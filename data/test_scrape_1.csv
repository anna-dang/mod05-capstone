"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very unhappy,My husband and I had to put our truck in the shop to get worked on... we stayed here until our truck got out of the shop and the whole time(3 days we stayed here) we were here we are very unhappy about the housekeeping service they have here. The whole time we were here I had to take our own garbage and towels out. The HOUSEKEEPING SUCKS HERE I even called down to front desk 4x still no service,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY HERE!,"DO NOT STAY HERE!! I traveled to Denver from Houston with my boyfriend and one other couple. We had reservations to stay here for 3 days. Check in is at 3pm but we arrived early at like 2:30..so we sent the boys in to see if the room was available yet. When they walked in they stood at the front desk for a while and did not get greeted by the 2 girls at the front desk (2 latinas with dark hair, wouldn’t give me their names and wasn’t wearing a name tag). They just acted as if they didn’t see them at all so when they approached the desk they were very rude, and disrespectful. They told us that if we wanted to check in early then we’d have to $10 to check in 30 MINUTES EARLY, we only paid $60 per night so why would that be policy? So the boys came back out and told us so I went back in to talk to them because the rooms were in my name and again they were ignoring us when we talked to them, when we told them that we felt like they were being very rude and giving us terrible service one of the girls said that her manager told her she doesn’t have to smile or be nice and that we need to leave. We did nothing wrong! At all, but because we have questions around this made up policy she wanted to kick us out. Idk if it was because we were black but we are educated, black professionals who know how to conduct business and this is not the way! We were forced to find another hotel at the last minute and for much more than we were expected to pay. The way we were treated was completely unreasonable and I don’t recommend that anyone stay here EVER!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst hotel ever.,This doesn’t even deserve a one star. It was the worst and nastiest hotel I’ve ever stayed at. There’s travel lodges that have better rooms than this. We came to have a wonderful vacation and this ruined it for us. Our room was unbelievably hot and when asked to change to a different room they didn’t help. We made the decision to leave and Cody at the front desk said he would cancel it and promised a refund only to find out he lied to my face and then said that he said no such thing. Worst customer service and hotel ever. Don’t waste your time and money here. Stay at the Hyatt regency convention center. That’s where we ended up going after. Best decision yet.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hamid H. stands for Horrible Customer service,Do not stay at this hotel if you like to be treated honestly and fairly.  I booked a room in March and had to cancel due to Covid.  A refund was not offered so I moved the reservation to September 20 and apparently the hotel will not honor it.   I contacted the property and had to deal with Hamid H. who rudely told me that I had no reservation and then actually hung up on me!  Even the Priceline rep who was helping me was amazed at his incompetence and impolite manner when he tried to deal with this man.Do yourself a favor and avoid being defrauded by this hotel.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clean Room and Friendly Staff,Great location close to downtown especially for a business trip to the area. Loved the stay. Everything was easy and no fuss the second I checked in. Would recommend as a great option in the Denver area.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"""Change is Good""","I know the management teams personally from prior to present. I must say the remodeling, service enhancements (such as car rental services), food store, and message / nail care center are a crowd pleaser.I see Chris (new owner) step up to the counter and jump right in to register guest. He personally greets guest asking ""So what brings you to town."" And ""where are you from"" He shows a personal interest for his guest.I've also seen him walk the property picking up trash and cigarette butts on the grounds. Most business owners would assign that task to staff because they are above doing that type of work. I know he is genuine in keeping the guest stay clean, safe and enjoyable.I can't wait to see what he has planned for the dining room and menu once the Covid restrictions are lifted. Oh and by the way, lots of service counter surface, elevator controls panels, door handles, hand washing, etc cleaning/cleaning/cleaning going on without anyone being told. Way to go.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clean,"Been coming down for our visits. Helpful front desk staff. Refrigerator and microwave in room, great for my family and I. Close to the Stock Show & Downtown. Off I-70 & Pecos. Will definitely come back.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Close to downtown,"Location was great. Very close to downtown area. The room was very clean, staff were so friendly, and it was overall great stay for me and my family! Highly recommend to all staying in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,THE WORST HOTEL EVER!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The hotel is disgusting, the staff is beyond rude and there was no AC in our room! Got my stay refunded but have an extra charge on my account that they refuse to help me with. Won't answer my calls or call me back. The front desk staff cops an attitude with me everytime I call! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! There are drug dealers outside, people are high out of their minds walking around there and staying at the hotel, there are hookers, and people will snoop around your car. DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING VALUABLE IN YOUR CAR IT WILL BE STOLEN!!! Windows at this hotel are busted. I did not feel safe even pulling up into the parking lot. There were cops there constantly. We had our German Shepherd with us and she was the only source of protection we felt. No one seemed to come near us because they were scared of her. Even though she is the sweetest. Complaining to the front desk didn't do crap, the manager is nonexistent. Apparently they have new management are dealing with other people who have also been charged a random amount they didn't authorize. Do wast your time or money on this hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Horrible,"Hotel was disgustingly dirty.  Staff was rude. Only 1 luggage trolley available for guests.  Expected our family of 4 to share 2 bath towels.   No wash cloths in room.    Front desk staff argumentative and was reluctant to give me more towels/wash cloths.  Blood stain on comforter.  Grimy smudges all over bathroom door.  Stinky hallways and loitering,  lots of it,  taking place right outside of front door for many hours.   I will never stay here again and would never recommend it to anyone.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Beware!!!!!!,"Hi, my boyfriend have been using choice hotels through our trip because usually they are comfortable and affordable. We arrived at the Clarion Denver  after booking on booking.com. We were staying here from 26th-30th. We pulled up and there are windows of the hotel with box fans and sketchy people outside checking car doors. I didn't want to pass judgement because again I have great experience in choice hotels with their cleanliness comfort and service. We got into our room with the ""King"" sized bed and my boyfriend goes to sit on the edge of it and the whole bed seasaws off the frame. We went to check it and it was two beds pushed together. We call the front desk and they immediately gave us another room. I walk into the new room and there is dirty qtips in the hallway in front of our door, the Air is noisey and doesn't work, blood on the walls, poop marks on clean towels and all the lamp shades are broken. Meanwhile My boyfriend goes to get the new room keys, takes a elevator back to the room and the elevator starts shaking and the woman who is on the Elevator  with him says she has been living here for two month and the elevator breaks all the time and no one would believe what goes on in this hotel. I call the front desk and their is no manager. So, we call choice hotels and customer service works out a resolution where we would be refunded the rest of our stay and moved to Quailty Inn. I was told I have to check our of Clairon prior to them booking our new stay. I go down to the desk check out while on the phone with choice hotels. After I'm all checked out Choice hotels was able to book my stay. It's now July 13th, and I still haven't gotten a refund from Clarion. We called Clarion and Jasmin told us they didn't have a manager and that in the system says we stayed there all four days and they couldn't give is a refund. she hung up on my boyfriend when he asked to talk to someone who owns the place.  So we called choice hotels and 3 hours  they said they can't do anything about it even when it's in their system we checked out. I got hung up on by their customer service manager Amanda because I asked who should be held accountable for stealing my money?  No one can help us and this horrible hotel has $300 of our money. Choice hotels have no control over their chains. Do not book Choice Hotels!!!!!!! Definitely don't book at this Clarion, don't let the price sway you in.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,AWFUL!!!!,"Location is not great, which is something I could overlook, however, I observed drug use and deals happening right outside the lobby, prostitutes in the lobby and around the building, daughter tried to use the lobby bathroom and instead found a woman who had set up camp there with all her belongings. You are advised to not leave any valuables in your car, but there are no baggage trolly available, so we had to make multiple trips to bring in all of our luggage. The room smelled of vomit and cigarettes, burn hole in bedding, duct tape holding down the carpet at the threshold to the bathroom, and damage to the furniture in the room. AC did nothing to cool down the room.  Overall did not feel like a safe, clean place to stay with my family. Very disappointed with the misleading rating here and on booking.com",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,acceptable basic accommodations,"Its in a kind of industrial area, super dark at night and a bit of noise from freeway traffic. The front desk staff was nice enough at check in but I had problems opening the door to my room and had to go back down. They told me you have to pull it a certain way. I got it to work after a few tries but it seemed kind of weird. Once I got into the room everything was basic but clean. I slept fine and checkout was uneventful.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,HVAC and staff,"Stayed at this hotel for two decades. It has never caught up to its promises. Cleaning is so-so. Newly remodeled? That happened years ago. Not enough people at front desk during peak times. Rude and uninformed people at the front desk. Promised during several stays to receive a fan or a heater, never got one and never got a return call from the front desk about it.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nothing to recommend it,"This is a property that says it’s newly renovated but I doubt it.  No hot buffet due to COVID, but virtually nobody including staff was wearing masks despite multiple signs and no hand sanitizer at front desk or in the room.  Most of the guests were a bit on the rough side and there were several arguments going on outside the front door.  They ran out of washcloths so a hand towel was pressed into service.The room was spacious and clean.  The bed was soft, but was not flush with the wall which is weird.  The whole place just looked worn out.  There was significant noise from the interstate.  Disappointing for a Clarion property.One other small warning.  Access to or leaving will probably involve a traffic circle at Pecos St which is an accident waiting to happen.  Be careful!",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don’t stay,"Smelled of smoke of both kinds no matter where you walk inside. The first room the shower and the curtains were broke. The bed linens were stained and dirty! They moved us and that room had stains all over the desk, missing drawers and a tv that was broke. I do not recommend. Only stayed for a few hours before having to travel again. Find a different hotel !",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Soft Bed,"My favorite part of our stay was that the bed was so soft and comfy, I did not want to get up. The room was clean, the Delux king had a large bed, microwave, fridge, and the bathroom was good too. However, the door does not go back all the way because of the bathroom installation which is rather annoying. I thought the staff was friendly, accomodating, and the elevators worked well. I would have appreciated vending machines on the fifth floor.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel was disgusting!! Not newly remodeled! Stay Away!,"The front desk staff was unfriendly and didnt care about anything. The 'non-smoking' hotel reeked of smoke. We even saw people smoking weed. When we got to our non-smoking room,it hadn't even been cleaned!! It also reeked of smoke. The whole hotel was very run down. Definitely  not remodeled. I asked for a full refund and my family walked out.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Completely Disgusting ,"We booked 2 rooms, both filthy, dirty bed linens, dirty refolded towels, broken televisions, broken shower curtain rod, torn and stained draperies, carpeting filthy worn to underfloor in some traffic areas. Showers filled with filth and hair in one shower, in addition what appeared to be urine in the other. Filth around toilets and edges of bathroom layeted with filth reminiscent of old school gas station restrooms. Everything in rooms and halls reeked of cigarette and cannabis smoke. Check in staff was incredibly rude, took over an hour and our having to call our booking agency to find our prepaid reservation. Shuttle was the selling point of the hotel yet completely unreliable, not being available to leave when promised and stranded us downtown for hours blaming other employees and continuously telling us that they were ""on the way."" I could go on and on, this place is astonishingly horrible. Fair warning, do not stay here!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel from Hell!!!!,"This place is the absolute pits!!!!  Stay away at all costs.  It is run down, outdated and dirty!  Staff does nothing about the smoking issues!  All rooms are no smoking but we had some jerk smoking next to us probably to cover up the smell of weed!  We cancelled our last night and moved to a different hotel which was clean and had fresh air!!!!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not 420 Freindly,"Hotel is old, in the industrial area, noisy, Section 8 vouchers for the homeless.People hanging out in the parking lot selling more than weed, broken lights and electric sockets not working in the room, the desk chair was unusable. Overall I would not recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to have 420 experience. The desk clerk told me I could vape outside,as soon as I started 3 people came up asking if I would share,(sure why not let 3 strangers put their mouths on my mouthpiece with coronavirus spreading accross the USA",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disaster,"Only one elevator worked which made for a 20 minute wait to get on a jam packed elevator. That elevator had dog food spilled in the corner, a pack of cigarettes, and a bottle of liquor in it. When we got in the room 3/4 light bulbs above the mirror were burned out. No hot water whatsoever on the second day. I went to turn a lamp off and it shocked me so bad my arm hurt all the way to my shoulder for half an hour. When I went down the last day to get breakfast I was asked literally 4 times if I was checking out. Finally I got tired of it and decided to check out early to see if that would help. It did not. He asked again. The only good thing was the staff member that checked me in was friendly even though we had to try several computers before we could check in. There were also no luggage racks and no one to help with any luggage as the poor girl at check in was running all over trying to multitask to take care of everything herself. This place was a complete disaster. The stairs weren’t even an option as they had fire alarms on them.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great stay,First night had no heat we went to front desk they gave us an upgraded room.the breakfast was really good enjoyed the stay you guys rock thank you for everything.they were under construction the first day which wasnt horrible they made sure we got our room in time,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wish I could leave -5 stars.....,"Stayed one night here, was checked into an occupied room. Moved to an empty room finally and checked out early in the morning to catch my flight. My card has been charged the nightly rate everyday since the stay, not to mention charged double for the initial stay. The bank now had to cancel my card because every time I call them they ask if I can hold and then hang up! AVOID this place. Not worth it at all.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A one night stay,"This a budget hotel and I found it average for a hotel in this category. The room was clean but rather tired, the bar staff were friendly but the reception staff less so. The food menu for evening meal and breakfast was limited but okay. This is NOT a city centre hotel, it is situated on the outskirts of Denver next to rail yards and industrial premises. The hotel shuttle bus is fine for getting from the hotel to the train station but seems not to work in the opposite direction, on two occasions we were unable to use it to get from the station area to the hotel, so had to get a taxi instead.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst Stay EVER!!!!!,"I just want others to avoid ever having to go through what we endured. There are SO many things wrong and scary with this place!We stayed here for years for the Western Stock show. It's an older hotel but with the shuttle, it was convenient. This year we got stood up by the shuttle, for 45 minutes, in the 20 degree tenperature, while they kept tellitemperature, just a few minutes away. The driver who finally showed up said he had never driven the shuttle before, the actual driver never showed up! There was a drug addict in the lobby yelling, that the police had to come and get. We had to change rooms 3 times! We even got keys for an occupied room once! Everyone's keys had to be redone at least 3 times traveling to the desk from the 9th floor on a scary elevator that actually vibrated,and screeched with noise. Our rooms heat at 60 degrees ran in the 90s. It was horrid. The rooms worn out with signs of mold. There were thug looking characters in and working at the hotel. The staff at the desk were nice and the activity director, however for 3 days the manager never returned my many calls. They said shes rarely there.Do NOT stay here! I'd rather sleep in my truck than here.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,YOU’VE BEEN WARNED,"Extremely disappointed.   Not sure how they have 3.5 stars.  Lobby was packed upon arrival.  Thought maybe they were just busy.  Nope, they didn’t know what they were doing.  Took two people to get me checked in.  Parked in a dark dark parking lot where one guy was partaking in smoking a joint and the guy next to us was either passed out or asleep in his front seat.  Got to the room, smelled like weed as I’m sure many seedy hotels do in Colorado now.  Room was hooooottttt!!  Opened window to let smell and heat out.  Went out for a while, got back to the room around 12:15am and two minutes later a gentleman l, probably on the new legal stuff, was yelling at his “significant” other to let him in the room across the hall from us.   She locked him because he apparently left to cheat on her for a while.  There were numerous other seedy people in an around the building.   Not a good look for the Clarion name brand.   Choice needs sell it off and let someone else take the hit for the crappiness.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disappointed,Very disappointed. Rooms are run down. Smells of smoke. The fire alarm was covered with plastic. Second room was so hot and fan did not work. Tiles are water damaged. Door to room was hard to open. No parking lot lights.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pay little expect less,"I wasn’t expecting much since is very cheap and we only need it to sleep and run next morning, but from beginning to end I wasn’t a present stay, the were nice to keep my luggage for a few hours, but the bathrooms where not clean, the carpet was smelly, but the worst part for me was the cigarette smell and the marijuana smell, for crying out loud is a not smoking facility. The only good thing was the staff was very nice and helpful.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY,"Would have been better off sleeping in the car. One star is even too high for this ""hotel."" This hotel needs so much help. Not to mention the management is about worthless. I will never stay here again, and I will voice that to anyone looking for a hotel in/around Denver. Upon arrival (130) we were told we could check in in 20 minutes. After 20 minutes we got in line to check in. Front desk checked in another guest into an already occupied room and proceeded to tell us we could no longer check in early but that we could keep our luggage in the back room. We did this as we had somewhere to be. Upon returning, one of our bags was stolen. This was reported to the desk and they processed to tell us they would check the cameras and get back to us. After asking what would be done if this was not found I was told there would be compensation. Cameras were not checked until constantly asking and once an answer was finally given they told me the camera in that particular area was out at the time, so there was no way to check, but I could file a police report. Yes wow what a great idea, considering it's a hotel and I'm not from here. Unless the front desk took it, it won't be found by the police. All that would do is waist a police officers time. They have much better things to do than to file a useless report. The managers were supposed to have been in both sat and sun, but not one was present until after 2pm Sunday. Mind you that's after check out. The heat was out in half of the building, (dec. 28) but don't worry, they'll bring you a space heater. Our tv remote had no batteries. There were holes in the wall. The hotel itself was very dirty and not kept up. After finally speaking with a manager she refuses to do anything about the situation. The manager now refuses to contact me back. This place needs shut down. Most ridiculous hotel stay I have ever had. -- Six days later I finally got to talk to Manager Mia (not Erin, the one I've been leaving messages for) who almost instantly got snippy saying she had no idea what I was talking about. I actually hung up on this manager because she constantly talked over me, and her attitude was very unwelcoming and extremely rude.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not up to Clarion standards,"Stayed here for three nights last month (November).  This hotel is understaffed, and because of it, the front desk is always crowded and the service is extremely slow.  The heating and cooling systems does not function properly either.  The room was cold, and when you turned the heat up you'd get no change in temperature but alot of very loud noises. It was so annoying I would just turn it off/down and be cold. Other people complained that their rooms were the opposite...burning up and they couldn't turn the temperature down. The fitness center was pretty shabby.  Nice shuttle driver though, just don't plan on getting picked up fast...it will be a while! And the restaurant and breakfast were not bad.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Even at this low price you don't deserve this type of hotel,"Well we got a good rate. After that everything went South, we checked in went to our room in the heater didn't work. We reported it to the manager who said he would have it fixed while we were out to dinner we got back late and lo and behold the room was in the 50s. We called the front desk who set up a maintenance man who said yes is heater doesn't work you should have a spot heater here I don't know why it's not in the room. Immediately went to the front desk agreed to move us to another room, unfortunately this room was occupied by another guest. Another trip down to the front desk was met with rudeness and poor customer service. They gave us another room our third of the night, when we got to the room it reeks of cigarette smoke and low and behold the heater didn't work. Since it was by now 2:00 in the morning and this room was at least in the sixties we went to bed. The next morning I was surprised although nothing is surprising now that there was no hot water, I let the water run for 20 minutes and the water never got hot. Cold room, cold shower, cold customer service. That morning we tried to get a manager but there was no one at the front desk and according to one of the employees there was not a manager on that morning.Almost is disconcerting was while we were waiting for our third room to drunk girls walked up to the front desk and said oh we lost our keys to the room. The girl behind the desk said okay what rooms are you in and proceeded to produce keys for them without asking for any ID or proof that they were actually Hotel guests. Even though it looks like a good deal I would run away from this hotel as fast as I could!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Mixed feelings,"Some good things - room was clean, breakfast had a great selection.  Bad things - the thermostat was simple enough to figure out but even when i moved it to 62F, it stayed at 73 and we died.  And there were tons of slamming doors and noise 2:30-3:30am. But it got us away from the craziness downtown Denver, and on our next journey.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Terrible hotel masquerading as just a decent hotel...,"Wow...  This hotel...  It is a terrible hotel masquerading as just a decent hotel.  Where do I even start?  At least read what's marked by the *** if you want to know why you should NOT stay in this hotel.We were in a bit of a rush when checking in.  We called to see if we could do so over the phone.  This took 3 calls to accomplish, the first two of those calls the headset was put down on the desk, it wasn't even a proper hold.  Eventually they told us our room, that we were checked in, and that we could grab the keys and head on up.When we got to there we were told it's not possible to check in over the phone...  So they started the process over.  Even though we were waiting to be checked in they weren't really paying attention to us and were asking others if they needed help.***Once we got our keys we headed to our room. Just outside the elevator there are no signs directing you to where your room would be.  You just guess!  When we got to our room at 7:30 PM someone had the door open and was ready to START cleaning it...  A room they had just checked us into.  Again, we were in a rush, so we asked if we could just leave our stuff in the room so we could get to what we traveled there for.  After our activity, we got back to the hotel at about 2:30 AM.  AND OUR DOOR WAS PROPPED OPEN BY THE METAL LATCH ON THE INSIDE!!!!  Our room with all of our laptops, a Nintendo Switch, all our clothes and bags, was just left open available for ANYONE to go into!!  That is the worst thing I've ever had happen at a hotel.***At this point, ANYTHING that happened just added to this awful experience.  Things that would likely normally be overlooked.  But not after what happened...  These things included our room keys not actually opening the door (good thing our door was unlocked!!), the blinds being poorly installed so we got woken up very early by the sun after a very late night, getting the wrong information that breakfast ended at 9 and found out later it was actually 10 so we could have made it but thought we missed it already, someone knocking VERY loud at NINE AM ready to clean the room (we should have put our do not disturb sign out, but 2:30 AM?  you forget things...), and finally, trying to take a shower and having to wait 3 minutes just to get lukewarm water.  No hot water whatsoever.Extremely poor experience overall.  But hey, the beds were soft!  We just woken up from them way too early...",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not worth whatever you pay!,"We stayed here on a recent trip to Denver and it was terrible.  The hotel states that it has recently been renovated, not the areas we saw.  The wallpaper in both the halls and the room was worn, torn and dirty.  The counter in the room had chipped Formica along the edge.  The bathroom mirror was dirty, the faucet and counter were dirty,there was no Kleenex, just a small amount of toilet paper and there was no bathmat.  The ice bucket still had water in it from the last guest.  The hotel is located in an unattractive, industrial area.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good... if cheap price is important,"I'll start with the pluses: Very central location (the junction of I-25 and I-70 just outside my window). Ample breakfast buffet. Big, comfortable room. Staff were mostly friendly and helpful. Currently almost as cheap as Motel 6.But this is no three-star hotel. The front desk is a shambles; most staff there wore fleece jackets and hoodies (not over their heads, at least!). Housekeeping didn't clean my room; one day they left me a handwritten note on wrinkled paper to explain. I sometimes heard them shouting outside my door. Maintenance only fixed a burned-out light after I asked twice. A lot of the day, the hallway smells like an ashtray. The TV remote didn't work. The heater thermostat didn't seem to do much. One night at 6pm, I couldn't get warm water for a shower.I adapted, and overall the three nights weren't bad. I sent a detailed list to Choice Hotels. I hope things change; I'd come back if they do.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NEVER AGAIN.,"Most unprofessional, unorganized, and uncleanliness hotel I have EVER stayed at. Too many bad things to even list. NEGATIVE stars. Absolutely NO customer service. Shuttle bus is a joke unless you enjoy waiting 2 hours in the cold while calling 6 times to confirm. Rooms are filthy, found dirty glasses and Victoria secret empty boxes under the bed. Mouthwash was opened and used.The heating/cooling system doesn't work. Non smoking? HA! All I smelt was cigarette smoke. Price match? No way. DO NOT STAY HERE.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dump with rude staff but can smoke it up,"This ‘buisness’ hotel is run down looking and off from the main area. We arrived and they had no information about our booking and seemed very reluctant to help. Luckily a lady walked onto the desk and recognised my name from when she prepped the check in list in the morning. She then took over and checked us in. This lady was the only helpful member of staff I remember. The only buisness that takes place in this hotel is drugs. I’m a fan of puffing on the peace pipe so it didn’t bother me but Jesus how do they get way with it! The male receptionist threatened to throw us out because a card fee didn’t go through and he didn’t realise. So after buying food at reception to munch on, he rang about 40 mins later and said I must come downstairs to pay. I told him I was in bed so could he add it to my room or come down tomorrow. He said no and if I didn’t he would throw me out. I told him ‘try it mate’ and hung up. He thought he was a big man. Turns out he was a little man. Perks of this place - can smoke it up, have ample stoner munch at reception - has a bar attached - cheap - next to a great dispensary - the TVs work! Downside - unhelpful staff - aggressive bloke on reception- but of a dump Add some extra ventilation so it’s less stinky and train your staff better and it would be much better.Added note, I made a formal complaint to both the hotel and the hotel chain and got absolutely nowhere with it. Shame you don’t care about your customers",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Rodent Droppings in Room,"I was in Denver for a few nights, as it happens, while the Broncos and Nuggets were both having home games. Lodging options were limited. I knew this was a budget hotel and I didn’t expect or need much.What I absolutely did not expect was to find rodent feces on the bar sink area of my room. In plain view. Meaning either the room had not been cleaned recently, or the infestation is bad enough that a rat crapped in the room in the few hours between housekeeping and my check in.I reported this to the front desk and the employee shrugged and said “weird, we’ve never had that complaint before.” After showing her photos, she offered to have someone clean it. Like, I get that they were probably full due to the games, but she didn’t even try to see if another room was available. To top it off, after an hour and a half no one had come to clean so I had to call the front desk and follow up. She said housekeeping had been “busy.” I wasn’t expecting a refund, but I was expecting some even remote concern from the front desk staff. Nothing.There was a large gap under the room door that you could definitely see in or out of. The entire floor smelled like cigarettes and weed. Several outlets in the room had melted parts and burn marks which did not instill confidence in their safety.The shuttle driver was great though! Had there been any other hotels available I would have gladly moved to another hotel even without a refund, but unfortunately rooms were slim pickings.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Keep your expectations low,"Main issue is housekeeping and maintenance. If you are OK with moldy showers, questionable cleaniness of the floor and carpet, unsightly half peeled duct tape for thresholds, and dust everywhere, then it is a well priced alternative for your stay in Denver. Just don't expect that clean feeling.As for the front desk staff. Don't bother complaining. They heard it all. You won't find many repeat visitors.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The worst experience in all my travels!,"We arrived at the hotel to check in around 4:30 or 5. We were informed by the front desk that they ""just got slammed"" and our room wasn't ready (we had reservations for a month). The attendant at the front desk ""guaranteed"" that our room would be ready when we returned home from the NFL game that we had traveled to see. We missed several calls during the very LOUD game that they didn't have a room for us due to a leak. They said we wouldn't be charged and said ""see you next time. "" When the game was over there was a ridiculously long line of angry people trying to check in or sort things out. We were told there wouldn't be a manager in until 10 am the next morning and we were basically out of luck. And to top things off they STILL charged my credit card for a room that they canceled!!! What a joke!! I've never encountered anything like it in all of my travels. I will NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone ever. An absolute disaster, nightmarishly ran!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wasp in the room and toilet paper holder on the floor.,I have to echo some other recent reviews.  Hotel was old and not well maintained.  We walked into our room to see the toilet paper holder on the floor.  There were random holes in the wall that had been patched by an amateur.  Day 2 a wasp flew out from the curtain.  I certainly will never stay here or at any other Clarion property.  Talked to the front desk and their comment “we will have to talk to maintenance tomorrow”.  No other solution was provided.  Hotwire was notified and this review will be provided there as well.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,AWESOME,Front desk ladies are awesome the bartenders and chef are on point 👌👌 recommended highly been great with the trucking company very friendly and clean rooms awesome food. Reasonable prices on rooms highly recommend,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Avoid this hotel,We booked this hotel based reviews on Hotwire and Tripadvisor reviews.  I always look for 3 star and up hotel with good reviews. It had good reviews so I was ok with trying it. It didn't deserve those reviews. Location is awful. The highway noise was annoying. The whole place smells like an ashtray. I got a non smoking room and it smelled so bad. The windows don't open so there was nothing I could do about that. The bed was comfortable but the whole place is very dated. The bed is about all I can say was positive.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A sad but honest 1 star.,"Firstly, I am realistic and understand that this is a budget hotel. I was not expecting the 4 seasons. If  this hotel was the same as most budget hotels like most I would not have felt inclined to say anything. This was a disaster. The staff were not interested, they were just brash and a little rude. No customer service skills or care. The hotel was dingy and worn down. The rooms were dated and not well cared for. My room had a random sofa covering the door termory door to the next room and a wardrobe that looked like it had been taken from the side of the road. It was just not nice. The first room I was given had guests staying in it. . . So yes, I walked into someone laying on the bed. It was mortifying and they were extremely upset as I was embarrassed. This was made worse when I went to reception to sort it out and the girl behind the counter did not seem bothered, no apology though she did offer me a bag of chipsThe Free Breakfast was a mad house. No staff on hand at all and it was just a mess of people fighting. The best thing I can say about the Hotel is that there is no staff in the breakfast area so if you want a free breakfast just show up between 7 am and 10:00 as nobody will stop you.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Terrible Clarion,This is a terrible Clarion.  Bathroom is in need of repairs and it smells like someone lit up a marijuana cigarette in the bathroom but it’s coming from another room.  The gal at the counter was very nice but this place is a dump.  I should’ve spent another $50 to stay downtown.  Had I realized where it is located (next to railroad tracks and a bad neighborhood). I would’ve but I’ve never been to Denver before.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Better off sleeping in your car,"An utter dump. First room they sent us to still had people in it (learned upon entering). Every floor smells like the worlds largest collection of ashtrays. We are in a non-smoking room, yet a damp tobacco stench hangs in the air, and I’m sure my clothes will smell similarly by morning. Broken lock on door. Terrible location—might as well be a truck stop on the highway. This was a $100 Hotwire booking, and this hotel somehow has 3.5 stars. I’ve stayed at far nicer places in rural Central America for $2 a night.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smelliest Hotel Ever,"I'm retired and travel a lot. This is my 5th trip this year. The room we stayed in smelled very very bad. When we complained about the smell the first day we were told they were full booked. Nothing happened to clean the room. We complained of the smells, smelled like dog poop, cat pee and vomit. The carpet obviously hadn't been shampooed maybe since the 90's. Then the door had to be pushed hard, shoulder into it to open. Closing it required more force. Several times the cleaning staff left the door ajar. The bedding had dark brown spots on the sheets. The housekeeping staff never did change them. The ice machine and soft drink machines were broken on our floor. There was never more than one person on the desk so check in and check out lines are long. The best thing about the hotel is the complementary breakfast. Good thing there nothing close to this hotel it's in an industrial park area. The complementary shuttle bus to Union Station is very unreliable. Don't even try calling the desk for the shuttle. On our 4 days there I was left on hold for 15 minutes twice. Once I was told the desk person put me on hold a few minutes then came back and said the shuttle was on the way to the station. 1 1/2 hours later I hailed down the shuttle at the station. He said he hadn't gotten a call. All and all STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,What a sorry excuse for a hotel,"We were trying to do Denver on a limited budget and decided to stay at the Clarion. Before starting in on all the horrible things, I want to point out one absolutely outstanding feature—the friendliness and helpfulness of shuttle drivers Garry and Brian.  If not for them, the trip would’ve been a total disaster.The hotel is shabby and dirty, our room wasn’t cleaned once in our entire four-day stay. We were told by numerous staff members that there is no manager and that most of the housekeeping staff walked out on the Thursday we arrived.  When you’re in downtown Denver, you have to call the hotel to schedule a pick up. The first night there I called and was put on hold for 10 minutes with no answer. I hung up and had to call back 10 times, each time the phone was answered with an abrupt “please hold” and then I was cut off or put on hold. I finally called Uber.  When we got to the hotel, I asked the woman why she wouldn’t answer the phone and got a snotty reply.The beds were comfortable, but that’s about the only other positive thing to say about it.Over the course of our stay I saw many people at the front desk venting their frustrations about dirty rooms. Incorrect charges, botched reservations, etc.There is a Radisson Hotel nearby. I didn’t see it, but anything would have to be better in this place.Unlike many others who have reviewed this place, we did not notice any pot smoke.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Needs major renovations,"Great location to downtown Denver. Unfortunately, the hotel needs major renovations. The carpet and wallpaper are old and need replacing. My room was a non-smoking room but you could still smell smoke in the room and in the hallways. One of the comforters was dirty and needed to be replaced but a new one was never brought up after we contacted the front desk. The shower didnt have a liner so the floor got wet with every shower. The water was hot and the pressure was good, which is a good thing. The ironing board was broken so we couldn't use it. I would not stay here again, unless they completely renovated the property.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very unhappy,My husband and I had to put our truck in the shop to get worked on... we stayed here until our truck got out of the shop and the whole time(3 days we stayed here) we were here we are very unhappy about the housekeeping service they have here. The whole time we were here I had to take our own garbage and towels out. The HOUSEKEEPING SUCKS HERE I even called down to front desk 4x still no service,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY HERE!,"DO NOT STAY HERE!! I traveled to Denver from Houston with my boyfriend and one other couple. We had reservations to stay here for 3 days. Check in is at 3pm but we arrived early at like 2:30..so we sent the boys in to see if the room was available yet. When they walked in they stood at the front desk for a while and did not get greeted by the 2 girls at the front desk (2 latinas with dark hair, wouldn’t give me their names and wasn’t wearing a name tag). They just acted as if they didn’t see them at all so when they approached the desk they were very rude, and disrespectful. They told us that if we wanted to check in early then we’d have to $10 to check in 30 MINUTES EARLY, we only paid $60 per night so why would that be policy? So the boys came back out and told us so I went back in to talk to them because the rooms were in my name and again they were ignoring us when we talked to them, when we told them that we felt like they were being very rude and giving us terrible service one of the girls said that her manager told her she doesn’t have to smile or be nice and that we need to leave. We did nothing wrong! At all, but because we have questions around this made up policy she wanted to kick us out. Idk if it was because we were black but we are educated, black professionals who know how to conduct business and this is not the way! We were forced to find another hotel at the last minute and for much more than we were expected to pay. The way we were treated was completely unreasonable and I don’t recommend that anyone stay here EVER!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst hotel ever.,This doesn’t even deserve a one star. It was the worst and nastiest hotel I’ve ever stayed at. There’s travel lodges that have better rooms than this. We came to have a wonderful vacation and this ruined it for us. Our room was unbelievably hot and when asked to change to a different room they didn’t help. We made the decision to leave and Cody at the front desk said he would cancel it and promised a refund only to find out he lied to my face and then said that he said no such thing. Worst customer service and hotel ever. Don’t waste your time and money here. Stay at the Hyatt regency convention center. That’s where we ended up going after. Best decision yet.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hamid H. stands for Horrible Customer service,Do not stay at this hotel if you like to be treated honestly and fairly.  I booked a room in March and had to cancel due to Covid.  A refund was not offered so I moved the reservation to September 20 and apparently the hotel will not honor it.   I contacted the property and had to deal with Hamid H. who rudely told me that I had no reservation and then actually hung up on me!  Even the Priceline rep who was helping me was amazed at his incompetence and impolite manner when he tried to deal with this man.Do yourself a favor and avoid being defrauded by this hotel.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clean Room and Friendly Staff,Great location close to downtown especially for a business trip to the area. Loved the stay. Everything was easy and no fuss the second I checked in. Would recommend as a great option in the Denver area.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"""Change is Good""","I know the management teams personally from prior to present. I must say the remodeling, service enhancements (such as car rental services), food store, and message / nail care center are a crowd pleaser.I see Chris (new owner) step up to the counter and jump right in to register guest. He personally greets guest asking ""So what brings you to town."" And ""where are you from"" He shows a personal interest for his guest.I've also seen him walk the property picking up trash and cigarette butts on the grounds. Most business owners would assign that task to staff because they are above doing that type of work. I know he is genuine in keeping the guest stay clean, safe and enjoyable.I can't wait to see what he has planned for the dining room and menu once the Covid restrictions are lifted. Oh and by the way, lots of service counter surface, elevator controls panels, door handles, hand washing, etc cleaning/cleaning/cleaning going on without anyone being told. Way to go.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clean,"Been coming down for our visits. Helpful front desk staff. Refrigerator and microwave in room, great for my family and I. Close to the Stock Show & Downtown. Off I-70 & Pecos. Will definitely come back.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Close to downtown,"Location was great. Very close to downtown area. The room was very clean, staff were so friendly, and it was overall great stay for me and my family! Highly recommend to all staying in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,THE WORST HOTEL EVER!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The hotel is disgusting, the staff is beyond rude and there was no AC in our room! Got my stay refunded but have an extra charge on my account that they refuse to help me with. Won't answer my calls or call me back. The front desk staff cops an attitude with me everytime I call! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! There are drug dealers outside, people are high out of their minds walking around there and staying at the hotel, there are hookers, and people will snoop around your car. DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING VALUABLE IN YOUR CAR IT WILL BE STOLEN!!! Windows at this hotel are busted. I did not feel safe even pulling up into the parking lot. There were cops there constantly. We had our German Shepherd with us and she was the only source of protection we felt. No one seemed to come near us because they were scared of her. Even though she is the sweetest. Complaining to the front desk didn't do crap, the manager is nonexistent. Apparently they have new management are dealing with other people who have also been charged a random amount they didn't authorize. Do wast your time or money on this hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Horrible,"Hotel was disgustingly dirty.  Staff was rude. Only 1 luggage trolley available for guests.  Expected our family of 4 to share 2 bath towels.   No wash cloths in room.    Front desk staff argumentative and was reluctant to give me more towels/wash cloths.  Blood stain on comforter.  Grimy smudges all over bathroom door.  Stinky hallways and loitering,  lots of it,  taking place right outside of front door for many hours.   I will never stay here again and would never recommend it to anyone.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Beware!!!!!!,"Hi, my boyfriend have been using choice hotels through our trip because usually they are comfortable and affordable. We arrived at the Clarion Denver  after booking on booking.com. We were staying here from 26th-30th. We pulled up and there are windows of the hotel with box fans and sketchy people outside checking car doors. I didn't want to pass judgement because again I have great experience in choice hotels with their cleanliness comfort and service. We got into our room with the ""King"" sized bed and my boyfriend goes to sit on the edge of it and the whole bed seasaws off the frame. We went to check it and it was two beds pushed together. We call the front desk and they immediately gave us another room. I walk into the new room and there is dirty qtips in the hallway in front of our door, the Air is noisey and doesn't work, blood on the walls, poop marks on clean towels and all the lamp shades are broken. Meanwhile My boyfriend goes to get the new room keys, takes a elevator back to the room and the elevator starts shaking and the woman who is on the Elevator  with him says she has been living here for two month and the elevator breaks all the time and no one would believe what goes on in this hotel. I call the front desk and their is no manager. So, we call choice hotels and customer service works out a resolution where we would be refunded the rest of our stay and moved to Quailty Inn. I was told I have to check our of Clairon prior to them booking our new stay. I go down to the desk check out while on the phone with choice hotels. After I'm all checked out Choice hotels was able to book my stay. It's now July 13th, and I still haven't gotten a refund from Clarion. We called Clarion and Jasmin told us they didn't have a manager and that in the system says we stayed there all four days and they couldn't give is a refund. she hung up on my boyfriend when he asked to talk to someone who owns the place.  So we called choice hotels and 3 hours  they said they can't do anything about it even when it's in their system we checked out. I got hung up on by their customer service manager Amanda because I asked who should be held accountable for stealing my money?  No one can help us and this horrible hotel has $300 of our money. Choice hotels have no control over their chains. Do not book Choice Hotels!!!!!!! Definitely don't book at this Clarion, don't let the price sway you in.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,AWFUL!!!!,"Location is not great, which is something I could overlook, however, I observed drug use and deals happening right outside the lobby, prostitutes in the lobby and around the building, daughter tried to use the lobby bathroom and instead found a woman who had set up camp there with all her belongings. You are advised to not leave any valuables in your car, but there are no baggage trolly available, so we had to make multiple trips to bring in all of our luggage. The room smelled of vomit and cigarettes, burn hole in bedding, duct tape holding down the carpet at the threshold to the bathroom, and damage to the furniture in the room. AC did nothing to cool down the room.  Overall did not feel like a safe, clean place to stay with my family. Very disappointed with the misleading rating here and on booking.com",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,acceptable basic accommodations,"Its in a kind of industrial area, super dark at night and a bit of noise from freeway traffic. The front desk staff was nice enough at check in but I had problems opening the door to my room and had to go back down. They told me you have to pull it a certain way. I got it to work after a few tries but it seemed kind of weird. Once I got into the room everything was basic but clean. I slept fine and checkout was uneventful.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,HVAC and staff,"Stayed at this hotel for two decades. It has never caught up to its promises. Cleaning is so-so. Newly remodeled? That happened years ago. Not enough people at front desk during peak times. Rude and uninformed people at the front desk. Promised during several stays to receive a fan or a heater, never got one and never got a return call from the front desk about it.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nothing to recommend it,"This is a property that says it’s newly renovated but I doubt it.  No hot buffet due to COVID, but virtually nobody including staff was wearing masks despite multiple signs and no hand sanitizer at front desk or in the room.  Most of the guests were a bit on the rough side and there were several arguments going on outside the front door.  They ran out of washcloths so a hand towel was pressed into service.The room was spacious and clean.  The bed was soft, but was not flush with the wall which is weird.  The whole place just looked worn out.  There was significant noise from the interstate.  Disappointing for a Clarion property.One other small warning.  Access to or leaving will probably involve a traffic circle at Pecos St which is an accident waiting to happen.  Be careful!",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don’t stay,"Smelled of smoke of both kinds no matter where you walk inside. The first room the shower and the curtains were broke. The bed linens were stained and dirty! They moved us and that room had stains all over the desk, missing drawers and a tv that was broke. I do not recommend. Only stayed for a few hours before having to travel again. Find a different hotel !",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Soft Bed,"My favorite part of our stay was that the bed was so soft and comfy, I did not want to get up. The room was clean, the Delux king had a large bed, microwave, fridge, and the bathroom was good too. However, the door does not go back all the way because of the bathroom installation which is rather annoying. I thought the staff was friendly, accomodating, and the elevators worked well. I would have appreciated vending machines on the fifth floor.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel was disgusting!! Not newly remodeled! Stay Away!,"The front desk staff was unfriendly and didnt care about anything. The 'non-smoking' hotel reeked of smoke. We even saw people smoking weed. When we got to our non-smoking room,it hadn't even been cleaned!! It also reeked of smoke. The whole hotel was very run down. Definitely  not remodeled. I asked for a full refund and my family walked out.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Completely Disgusting ,"We booked 2 rooms, both filthy, dirty bed linens, dirty refolded towels, broken televisions, broken shower curtain rod, torn and stained draperies, carpeting filthy worn to underfloor in some traffic areas. Showers filled with filth and hair in one shower, in addition what appeared to be urine in the other. Filth around toilets and edges of bathroom layeted with filth reminiscent of old school gas station restrooms. Everything in rooms and halls reeked of cigarette and cannabis smoke. Check in staff was incredibly rude, took over an hour and our having to call our booking agency to find our prepaid reservation. Shuttle was the selling point of the hotel yet completely unreliable, not being available to leave when promised and stranded us downtown for hours blaming other employees and continuously telling us that they were ""on the way."" I could go on and on, this place is astonishingly horrible. Fair warning, do not stay here!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel from Hell!!!!,"This place is the absolute pits!!!!  Stay away at all costs.  It is run down, outdated and dirty!  Staff does nothing about the smoking issues!  All rooms are no smoking but we had some jerk smoking next to us probably to cover up the smell of weed!  We cancelled our last night and moved to a different hotel which was clean and had fresh air!!!!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not 420 Freindly,"Hotel is old, in the industrial area, noisy, Section 8 vouchers for the homeless.People hanging out in the parking lot selling more than weed, broken lights and electric sockets not working in the room, the desk chair was unusable. Overall I would not recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to have 420 experience. The desk clerk told me I could vape outside,as soon as I started 3 people came up asking if I would share,(sure why not let 3 strangers put their mouths on my mouthpiece with coronavirus spreading accross the USA",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disaster,"Only one elevator worked which made for a 20 minute wait to get on a jam packed elevator. That elevator had dog food spilled in the corner, a pack of cigarettes, and a bottle of liquor in it. When we got in the room 3/4 light bulbs above the mirror were burned out. No hot water whatsoever on the second day. I went to turn a lamp off and it shocked me so bad my arm hurt all the way to my shoulder for half an hour. When I went down the last day to get breakfast I was asked literally 4 times if I was checking out. Finally I got tired of it and decided to check out early to see if that would help. It did not. He asked again. The only good thing was the staff member that checked me in was friendly even though we had to try several computers before we could check in. There were also no luggage racks and no one to help with any luggage as the poor girl at check in was running all over trying to multitask to take care of everything herself. This place was a complete disaster. The stairs weren’t even an option as they had fire alarms on them.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great stay,First night had no heat we went to front desk they gave us an upgraded room.the breakfast was really good enjoyed the stay you guys rock thank you for everything.they were under construction the first day which wasnt horrible they made sure we got our room in time,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wish I could leave -5 stars.....,"Stayed one night here, was checked into an occupied room. Moved to an empty room finally and checked out early in the morning to catch my flight. My card has been charged the nightly rate everyday since the stay, not to mention charged double for the initial stay. The bank now had to cancel my card because every time I call them they ask if I can hold and then hang up! AVOID this place. Not worth it at all.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A one night stay,"This a budget hotel and I found it average for a hotel in this category. The room was clean but rather tired, the bar staff were friendly but the reception staff less so. The food menu for evening meal and breakfast was limited but okay. This is NOT a city centre hotel, it is situated on the outskirts of Denver next to rail yards and industrial premises. The hotel shuttle bus is fine for getting from the hotel to the train station but seems not to work in the opposite direction, on two occasions we were unable to use it to get from the station area to the hotel, so had to get a taxi instead.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst Stay EVER!!!!!,"I just want others to avoid ever having to go through what we endured. There are SO many things wrong and scary with this place!We stayed here for years for the Western Stock show. It's an older hotel but with the shuttle, it was convenient. This year we got stood up by the shuttle, for 45 minutes, in the 20 degree tenperature, while they kept tellitemperature, just a few minutes away. The driver who finally showed up said he had never driven the shuttle before, the actual driver never showed up! There was a drug addict in the lobby yelling, that the police had to come and get. We had to change rooms 3 times! We even got keys for an occupied room once! Everyone's keys had to be redone at least 3 times traveling to the desk from the 9th floor on a scary elevator that actually vibrated,and screeched with noise. Our rooms heat at 60 degrees ran in the 90s. It was horrid. The rooms worn out with signs of mold. There were thug looking characters in and working at the hotel. The staff at the desk were nice and the activity director, however for 3 days the manager never returned my many calls. They said shes rarely there.Do NOT stay here! I'd rather sleep in my truck than here.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,YOU’VE BEEN WARNED,"Extremely disappointed.   Not sure how they have 3.5 stars.  Lobby was packed upon arrival.  Thought maybe they were just busy.  Nope, they didn’t know what they were doing.  Took two people to get me checked in.  Parked in a dark dark parking lot where one guy was partaking in smoking a joint and the guy next to us was either passed out or asleep in his front seat.  Got to the room, smelled like weed as I’m sure many seedy hotels do in Colorado now.  Room was hooooottttt!!  Opened window to let smell and heat out.  Went out for a while, got back to the room around 12:15am and two minutes later a gentleman l, probably on the new legal stuff, was yelling at his “significant” other to let him in the room across the hall from us.   She locked him because he apparently left to cheat on her for a while.  There were numerous other seedy people in an around the building.   Not a good look for the Clarion name brand.   Choice needs sell it off and let someone else take the hit for the crappiness.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disappointed,Very disappointed. Rooms are run down. Smells of smoke. The fire alarm was covered with plastic. Second room was so hot and fan did not work. Tiles are water damaged. Door to room was hard to open. No parking lot lights.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pay little expect less,"I wasn’t expecting much since is very cheap and we only need it to sleep and run next morning, but from beginning to end I wasn’t a present stay, the were nice to keep my luggage for a few hours, but the bathrooms where not clean, the carpet was smelly, but the worst part for me was the cigarette smell and the marijuana smell, for crying out loud is a not smoking facility. The only good thing was the staff was very nice and helpful.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY,"Would have been better off sleeping in the car. One star is even too high for this ""hotel."" This hotel needs so much help. Not to mention the management is about worthless. I will never stay here again, and I will voice that to anyone looking for a hotel in/around Denver. Upon arrival (130) we were told we could check in in 20 minutes. After 20 minutes we got in line to check in. Front desk checked in another guest into an already occupied room and proceeded to tell us we could no longer check in early but that we could keep our luggage in the back room. We did this as we had somewhere to be. Upon returning, one of our bags was stolen. This was reported to the desk and they processed to tell us they would check the cameras and get back to us. After asking what would be done if this was not found I was told there would be compensation. Cameras were not checked until constantly asking and once an answer was finally given they told me the camera in that particular area was out at the time, so there was no way to check, but I could file a police report. Yes wow what a great idea, considering it's a hotel and I'm not from here. Unless the front desk took it, it won't be found by the police. All that would do is waist a police officers time. They have much better things to do than to file a useless report. The managers were supposed to have been in both sat and sun, but not one was present until after 2pm Sunday. Mind you that's after check out. The heat was out in half of the building, (dec. 28) but don't worry, they'll bring you a space heater. Our tv remote had no batteries. There were holes in the wall. The hotel itself was very dirty and not kept up. After finally speaking with a manager she refuses to do anything about the situation. The manager now refuses to contact me back. This place needs shut down. Most ridiculous hotel stay I have ever had. -- Six days later I finally got to talk to Manager Mia (not Erin, the one I've been leaving messages for) who almost instantly got snippy saying she had no idea what I was talking about. I actually hung up on this manager because she constantly talked over me, and her attitude was very unwelcoming and extremely rude.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not up to Clarion standards,"Stayed here for three nights last month (November).  This hotel is understaffed, and because of it, the front desk is always crowded and the service is extremely slow.  The heating and cooling systems does not function properly either.  The room was cold, and when you turned the heat up you'd get no change in temperature but alot of very loud noises. It was so annoying I would just turn it off/down and be cold. Other people complained that their rooms were the opposite...burning up and they couldn't turn the temperature down. The fitness center was pretty shabby.  Nice shuttle driver though, just don't plan on getting picked up fast...it will be a while! And the restaurant and breakfast were not bad.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Even at this low price you don't deserve this type of hotel,"Well we got a good rate. After that everything went South, we checked in went to our room in the heater didn't work. We reported it to the manager who said he would have it fixed while we were out to dinner we got back late and lo and behold the room was in the 50s. We called the front desk who set up a maintenance man who said yes is heater doesn't work you should have a spot heater here I don't know why it's not in the room. Immediately went to the front desk agreed to move us to another room, unfortunately this room was occupied by another guest. Another trip down to the front desk was met with rudeness and poor customer service. They gave us another room our third of the night, when we got to the room it reeks of cigarette smoke and low and behold the heater didn't work. Since it was by now 2:00 in the morning and this room was at least in the sixties we went to bed. The next morning I was surprised although nothing is surprising now that there was no hot water, I let the water run for 20 minutes and the water never got hot. Cold room, cold shower, cold customer service. That morning we tried to get a manager but there was no one at the front desk and according to one of the employees there was not a manager on that morning.Almost is disconcerting was while we were waiting for our third room to drunk girls walked up to the front desk and said oh we lost our keys to the room. The girl behind the desk said okay what rooms are you in and proceeded to produce keys for them without asking for any ID or proof that they were actually Hotel guests. Even though it looks like a good deal I would run away from this hotel as fast as I could!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Mixed feelings,"Some good things - room was clean, breakfast had a great selection.  Bad things - the thermostat was simple enough to figure out but even when i moved it to 62F, it stayed at 73 and we died.  And there were tons of slamming doors and noise 2:30-3:30am. But it got us away from the craziness downtown Denver, and on our next journey.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Terrible hotel masquerading as just a decent hotel...,"Wow...  This hotel...  It is a terrible hotel masquerading as just a decent hotel.  Where do I even start?  At least read what's marked by the *** if you want to know why you should NOT stay in this hotel.We were in a bit of a rush when checking in.  We called to see if we could do so over the phone.  This took 3 calls to accomplish, the first two of those calls the headset was put down on the desk, it wasn't even a proper hold.  Eventually they told us our room, that we were checked in, and that we could grab the keys and head on up.When we got to there we were told it's not possible to check in over the phone...  So they started the process over.  Even though we were waiting to be checked in they weren't really paying attention to us and were asking others if they needed help.***Once we got our keys we headed to our room. Just outside the elevator there are no signs directing you to where your room would be.  You just guess!  When we got to our room at 7:30 PM someone had the door open and was ready to START cleaning it...  A room they had just checked us into.  Again, we were in a rush, so we asked if we could just leave our stuff in the room so we could get to what we traveled there for.  After our activity, we got back to the hotel at about 2:30 AM.  AND OUR DOOR WAS PROPPED OPEN BY THE METAL LATCH ON THE INSIDE!!!!  Our room with all of our laptops, a Nintendo Switch, all our clothes and bags, was just left open available for ANYONE to go into!!  That is the worst thing I've ever had happen at a hotel.***At this point, ANYTHING that happened just added to this awful experience.  Things that would likely normally be overlooked.  But not after what happened...  These things included our room keys not actually opening the door (good thing our door was unlocked!!), the blinds being poorly installed so we got woken up very early by the sun after a very late night, getting the wrong information that breakfast ended at 9 and found out later it was actually 10 so we could have made it but thought we missed it already, someone knocking VERY loud at NINE AM ready to clean the room (we should have put our do not disturb sign out, but 2:30 AM?  you forget things...), and finally, trying to take a shower and having to wait 3 minutes just to get lukewarm water.  No hot water whatsoever.Extremely poor experience overall.  But hey, the beds were soft!  We just woken up from them way too early...",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not worth whatever you pay!,"We stayed here on a recent trip to Denver and it was terrible.  The hotel states that it has recently been renovated, not the areas we saw.  The wallpaper in both the halls and the room was worn, torn and dirty.  The counter in the room had chipped Formica along the edge.  The bathroom mirror was dirty, the faucet and counter were dirty,there was no Kleenex, just a small amount of toilet paper and there was no bathmat.  The ice bucket still had water in it from the last guest.  The hotel is located in an unattractive, industrial area.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good... if cheap price is important,"I'll start with the pluses: Very central location (the junction of I-25 and I-70 just outside my window). Ample breakfast buffet. Big, comfortable room. Staff were mostly friendly and helpful. Currently almost as cheap as Motel 6.But this is no three-star hotel. The front desk is a shambles; most staff there wore fleece jackets and hoodies (not over their heads, at least!). Housekeeping didn't clean my room; one day they left me a handwritten note on wrinkled paper to explain. I sometimes heard them shouting outside my door. Maintenance only fixed a burned-out light after I asked twice. A lot of the day, the hallway smells like an ashtray. The TV remote didn't work. The heater thermostat didn't seem to do much. One night at 6pm, I couldn't get warm water for a shower.I adapted, and overall the three nights weren't bad. I sent a detailed list to Choice Hotels. I hope things change; I'd come back if they do.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NEVER AGAIN.,"Most unprofessional, unorganized, and uncleanliness hotel I have EVER stayed at. Too many bad things to even list. NEGATIVE stars. Absolutely NO customer service. Shuttle bus is a joke unless you enjoy waiting 2 hours in the cold while calling 6 times to confirm. Rooms are filthy, found dirty glasses and Victoria secret empty boxes under the bed. Mouthwash was opened and used.The heating/cooling system doesn't work. Non smoking? HA! All I smelt was cigarette smoke. Price match? No way. DO NOT STAY HERE.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dump with rude staff but can smoke it up,"This ‘buisness’ hotel is run down looking and off from the main area. We arrived and they had no information about our booking and seemed very reluctant to help. Luckily a lady walked onto the desk and recognised my name from when she prepped the check in list in the morning. She then took over and checked us in. This lady was the only helpful member of staff I remember. The only buisness that takes place in this hotel is drugs. I’m a fan of puffing on the peace pipe so it didn’t bother me but Jesus how do they get way with it! The male receptionist threatened to throw us out because a card fee didn’t go through and he didn’t realise. So after buying food at reception to munch on, he rang about 40 mins later and said I must come downstairs to pay. I told him I was in bed so could he add it to my room or come down tomorrow. He said no and if I didn’t he would throw me out. I told him ‘try it mate’ and hung up. He thought he was a big man. Turns out he was a little man. Perks of this place - can smoke it up, have ample stoner munch at reception - has a bar attached - cheap - next to a great dispensary - the TVs work! Downside - unhelpful staff - aggressive bloke on reception- but of a dump Add some extra ventilation so it’s less stinky and train your staff better and it would be much better.Added note, I made a formal complaint to both the hotel and the hotel chain and got absolutely nowhere with it. Shame you don’t care about your customers",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Rodent Droppings in Room,"I was in Denver for a few nights, as it happens, while the Broncos and Nuggets were both having home games. Lodging options were limited. I knew this was a budget hotel and I didn’t expect or need much.What I absolutely did not expect was to find rodent feces on the bar sink area of my room. In plain view. Meaning either the room had not been cleaned recently, or the infestation is bad enough that a rat crapped in the room in the few hours between housekeeping and my check in.I reported this to the front desk and the employee shrugged and said “weird, we’ve never had that complaint before.” After showing her photos, she offered to have someone clean it. Like, I get that they were probably full due to the games, but she didn’t even try to see if another room was available. To top it off, after an hour and a half no one had come to clean so I had to call the front desk and follow up. She said housekeeping had been “busy.” I wasn’t expecting a refund, but I was expecting some even remote concern from the front desk staff. Nothing.There was a large gap under the room door that you could definitely see in or out of. The entire floor smelled like cigarettes and weed. Several outlets in the room had melted parts and burn marks which did not instill confidence in their safety.The shuttle driver was great though! Had there been any other hotels available I would have gladly moved to another hotel even without a refund, but unfortunately rooms were slim pickings.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Keep your expectations low,"Main issue is housekeeping and maintenance. If you are OK with moldy showers, questionable cleaniness of the floor and carpet, unsightly half peeled duct tape for thresholds, and dust everywhere, then it is a well priced alternative for your stay in Denver. Just don't expect that clean feeling.As for the front desk staff. Don't bother complaining. They heard it all. You won't find many repeat visitors.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The worst experience in all my travels!,"We arrived at the hotel to check in around 4:30 or 5. We were informed by the front desk that they ""just got slammed"" and our room wasn't ready (we had reservations for a month). The attendant at the front desk ""guaranteed"" that our room would be ready when we returned home from the NFL game that we had traveled to see. We missed several calls during the very LOUD game that they didn't have a room for us due to a leak. They said we wouldn't be charged and said ""see you next time. "" When the game was over there was a ridiculously long line of angry people trying to check in or sort things out. We were told there wouldn't be a manager in until 10 am the next morning and we were basically out of luck. And to top things off they STILL charged my credit card for a room that they canceled!!! What a joke!! I've never encountered anything like it in all of my travels. I will NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone ever. An absolute disaster, nightmarishly ran!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wasp in the room and toilet paper holder on the floor.,I have to echo some other recent reviews.  Hotel was old and not well maintained.  We walked into our room to see the toilet paper holder on the floor.  There were random holes in the wall that had been patched by an amateur.  Day 2 a wasp flew out from the curtain.  I certainly will never stay here or at any other Clarion property.  Talked to the front desk and their comment “we will have to talk to maintenance tomorrow”.  No other solution was provided.  Hotwire was notified and this review will be provided there as well.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,AWESOME,Front desk ladies are awesome the bartenders and chef are on point 👌👌 recommended highly been great with the trucking company very friendly and clean rooms awesome food. Reasonable prices on rooms highly recommend,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Avoid this hotel,We booked this hotel based reviews on Hotwire and Tripadvisor reviews.  I always look for 3 star and up hotel with good reviews. It had good reviews so I was ok with trying it. It didn't deserve those reviews. Location is awful. The highway noise was annoying. The whole place smells like an ashtray. I got a non smoking room and it smelled so bad. The windows don't open so there was nothing I could do about that. The bed was comfortable but the whole place is very dated. The bed is about all I can say was positive.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A sad but honest 1 star.,"Firstly, I am realistic and understand that this is a budget hotel. I was not expecting the 4 seasons. If  this hotel was the same as most budget hotels like most I would not have felt inclined to say anything. This was a disaster. The staff were not interested, they were just brash and a little rude. No customer service skills or care. The hotel was dingy and worn down. The rooms were dated and not well cared for. My room had a random sofa covering the door termory door to the next room and a wardrobe that looked like it had been taken from the side of the road. It was just not nice. The first room I was given had guests staying in it. . . So yes, I walked into someone laying on the bed. It was mortifying and they were extremely upset as I was embarrassed. This was made worse when I went to reception to sort it out and the girl behind the counter did not seem bothered, no apology though she did offer me a bag of chipsThe Free Breakfast was a mad house. No staff on hand at all and it was just a mess of people fighting. The best thing I can say about the Hotel is that there is no staff in the breakfast area so if you want a free breakfast just show up between 7 am and 10:00 as nobody will stop you.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Terrible Clarion,This is a terrible Clarion.  Bathroom is in need of repairs and it smells like someone lit up a marijuana cigarette in the bathroom but it’s coming from another room.  The gal at the counter was very nice but this place is a dump.  I should’ve spent another $50 to stay downtown.  Had I realized where it is located (next to railroad tracks and a bad neighborhood). I would’ve but I’ve never been to Denver before.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Better off sleeping in your car,"An utter dump. First room they sent us to still had people in it (learned upon entering). Every floor smells like the worlds largest collection of ashtrays. We are in a non-smoking room, yet a damp tobacco stench hangs in the air, and I’m sure my clothes will smell similarly by morning. Broken lock on door. Terrible location—might as well be a truck stop on the highway. This was a $100 Hotwire booking, and this hotel somehow has 3.5 stars. I’ve stayed at far nicer places in rural Central America for $2 a night.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smelliest Hotel Ever,"I'm retired and travel a lot. This is my 5th trip this year. The room we stayed in smelled very very bad. When we complained about the smell the first day we were told they were full booked. Nothing happened to clean the room. We complained of the smells, smelled like dog poop, cat pee and vomit. The carpet obviously hadn't been shampooed maybe since the 90's. Then the door had to be pushed hard, shoulder into it to open. Closing it required more force. Several times the cleaning staff left the door ajar. The bedding had dark brown spots on the sheets. The housekeeping staff never did change them. The ice machine and soft drink machines were broken on our floor. There was never more than one person on the desk so check in and check out lines are long. The best thing about the hotel is the complementary breakfast. Good thing there nothing close to this hotel it's in an industrial park area. The complementary shuttle bus to Union Station is very unreliable. Don't even try calling the desk for the shuttle. On our 4 days there I was left on hold for 15 minutes twice. Once I was told the desk person put me on hold a few minutes then came back and said the shuttle was on the way to the station. 1 1/2 hours later I hailed down the shuttle at the station. He said he hadn't gotten a call. All and all STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,What a sorry excuse for a hotel,"We were trying to do Denver on a limited budget and decided to stay at the Clarion. Before starting in on all the horrible things, I want to point out one absolutely outstanding feature—the friendliness and helpfulness of shuttle drivers Garry and Brian.  If not for them, the trip would’ve been a total disaster.The hotel is shabby and dirty, our room wasn’t cleaned once in our entire four-day stay. We were told by numerous staff members that there is no manager and that most of the housekeeping staff walked out on the Thursday we arrived.  When you’re in downtown Denver, you have to call the hotel to schedule a pick up. The first night there I called and was put on hold for 10 minutes with no answer. I hung up and had to call back 10 times, each time the phone was answered with an abrupt “please hold” and then I was cut off or put on hold. I finally called Uber.  When we got to the hotel, I asked the woman why she wouldn’t answer the phone and got a snotty reply.The beds were comfortable, but that’s about the only other positive thing to say about it.Over the course of our stay I saw many people at the front desk venting their frustrations about dirty rooms. Incorrect charges, botched reservations, etc.There is a Radisson Hotel nearby. I didn’t see it, but anything would have to be better in this place.Unlike many others who have reviewed this place, we did not notice any pot smoke.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Needs major renovations,"Great location to downtown Denver. Unfortunately, the hotel needs major renovations. The carpet and wallpaper are old and need replacing. My room was a non-smoking room but you could still smell smoke in the room and in the hallways. One of the comforters was dirty and needed to be replaced but a new one was never brought up after we contacted the front desk. The shower didnt have a liner so the floor got wet with every shower. The water was hot and the pressure was good, which is a good thing. The ironing board was broken so we couldn't use it. I would not stay here again, unless they completely renovated the property.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst hotel I've ever stayed in,"This is by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, and I travel A LOT. Not a 3-star hotel at all - false advertising. I have asthma and the whole hotel smelled like smoke, which got me sick. We arrived at around 11pm and wanted a place to stay halfway between the airport and downtown. We did not feel safe in the parking lot, the lobby, and even in our own room. I even tried calling our other hotel in downtown to see if they can let us check-in that night. I would NOT recommend this hotel. Complete waste of $120 / night.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,pot hotel,"Other reviews are correct, this is a dump.  I never even heard of a pot hotel, but the people at the front desk insist it's on Clarion's website.  It's not.  It reeks of smoke, you can get a contact high from the elevator buttons.  No toilet paper or tissues in the room.  AC weak.  I paid $120 for one night, which I think is sort of a lot, and I expected much more from this.  It just smells so bad, all of it.  If you're gonna have a pot hotel, that's fine, but you need to advertise it as such.  We had a non-smoking room, but the smell is everywhere.  The front desk staff is rude.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Smelly, dirty and very disappointed.","Lobby smelled of pot,our bathroom smelled of urine. Our Non smoking room smelled of smoke The iron didn't work, ceiling tile above the sink was dirty & didn't sit in the ceiling correctly Never again!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Visitor - horrible manager Yvonne - she should be fired!,"I witnessed a nice lady checking in last night.   She had her confirmation on her cell phone.  The Front Desk refused to even look at her phone & said her room would be more $$.   The lady asked for a manager, Yvonne came over & called her racial slurs, spoke in Spanish about the lady using foul language.  Yvonne refused to look at the lady's cell phone confirmation.  She went over to the computer, cancelled the lady's reservation and basically told her to leave.  WOW!   I was visiting my friend who had a room, but we both agree to never book with Clarion ever again in Denver.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING,"I am doing a road trip back from California with my boyfriend and we have been trying to fit in as much as possible, sightseeing wise, without breaking the bank. We chose clarion because it was close to the city and not as expensive as other hotels. HORRIBLE DECISION. We got to the hotel around 330 PM and I was actually scared to get out of our car. I did not feel safe at all. I was concerned all night that my car would be broken into. We also did not have a safe in the room (which I never use but would have in this instance). People smoking everywhere and locals hanging out in the parking lot. The hotel itself smelled like marijuana (even with a smoking section designated outside), the lights flickered in the bathroom while showering, and my towels were probably 15 years old with holes in them. I slept on top of my own blanket placed on the bed along with my own blanket covering me to keep me warm because of a darks stain on the sheet. We ate the cost and booked another hotel farther from the city for our second night. I lost money but I had peace of mind. STAY FAR AWAY.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,420 Hotel!,"What a dump! Wife and daughter were there... people smoking pot all over, and yet no where does it say on web site that it is 420 friendly!!.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hasn't improved from Quality Inn days.,"I have stayed at this hotel since it was a Quality Inn and it has gotten worse over the years.  I will say that the service at the front desk was great and the breakfast was very good.  Other than that, I had nothing but complaints.  The hallways and elevators still stink of weed.  A problem that has carried over from the past.  Also the electronic key system went awry on Tuesday afternoon all through Wednesday.  I felt like I had to stay in my room since it would take a long time to get back into my room.  I realize that any electronic system can go down at any time,  but there should be a way for guests to get into their rooms without having someone let them in.  The only reason I stay here is because of the shuttle to the games.  From here on out I will stay at the Quality Inn in Westminster and take the light rail to Union Station.  This place has disappointed too many times.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Avoid at all costs,"Botched room reservation, no amenities, terrible ""grill"" food selection and service. Bed linens are worn out and very thin. The only good thing to report was that my room had a great view of the front mountain range during the July 4th storms and fireworks. This place is a dump. Do not stay here. There is nothing close by, hence their shuttle. Second worst place I've ever stayed. Never again. Cancelled another trip there in September for the Mineral show. I'd rather sleep in a car. Direct comments to management yielded what you can expect from them this time.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,YASMIN IS GREAT,"My stay here was great due to Yasmins kindness , as soon as i walked in my room itwas not cleaned well , yasmin was quick to fix all of our inconviniences , always had a smile on her face and said hi to my family as we walked by  , she made us feel very welcomed , appriciate her she made up for all the inconviniences we had , breakfast was great , pool was clean and enjoyable , will be back",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not too great,Ok so first the pros - free breakfast.  Cereals.  Make your own waffles. Muffins etc.  not bad for ftre!  Alsi free shuttle within 5 miles. But its on the hour so you have to catch it at the right time. Friendly bartenders.  Now the cons - elevators are super slow! Have to wait for a very long time.. hotel is near nothing!  Rooms are so so.  Not really sure what part of town? Industrial maybe? I suggest spend a few mire dollars for something better!,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disappointing,"I recently stayed at the Clarion as part of a package deal with Amtrak Vacations.  The hotel is outside of the city of Denver by the highway and the train yard.  It gets an interesting mix of clientele from truckers to business people.  As other reviewers have mentioned, check-in was a challenge.  We arrived earlier than expected and had to wait for a room.  We took the opportunity to avail ourselves of the free shuttle into Denver.  The shuttle drivers were great!  Very knowledgeable about where to go and what to do.  When we returned and checked in we went up to our room.  The elevators are notoriously slow.  Our room was nothing special, if not a bit on the well-used side of things.  Our shower didn't work properly and spouted tepid water.  As we were only staying for a short time I didn't make a big deal of this, especially after hearing someone complain at the desk about a problem they were having and had no resolution after 24 hours.  They do have an outdoor pool which was great on a hot day.  If you are looking for a place to crash this hotel may be your answer.  If you are looking for an ""experience"" keep looking.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great customer service!!,Travis at the front desk was extremely helpful and welcoming with a great personality. Made a great first impression and was able to answer any questions I had. Made us want to come back for sure when we travel,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Top Tier Service!,"I've stayed at numerous hotels all over the country,  and I must say I have never had such an amazing experience with hotel staff before!Yasmin at the front desk was swamped with a lobby full of people and chaos but handled it like each person had her full attention and no problem was too big or too small. She made our stay AMAZING from check in to check out! The hotel looks like it's getting updated as there was construction going on during our stay, but I know after this I won't stay anywhere but at the Clarion Hotel as long as she's working there!!Keep up the GREAT WORK!!!Thank you for everything!SPE",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,3 Stars but only 1 elevator!  Reefer Madness: pungent smell of pot permeates property!,"I booked a room in this hotel through Priceline.  Based on the prevailing rates for that night, it seemed like the best deal!  Overall, I have no serious complaints, but I would like to offer a few observations:  Check-in seemed chaotic.  I arrived about an hour before the published check-in time.  I was told that there were rooms available, but that they were waiting for housekeeping to update the computer, so I would need to wait until 3pm to check-in - fair enough, that is the published time.  In the meantime, everyone else who planned to check-in early arrived and by 3pm the lobby was filled with luggage and people waiting to check-in.  Maybe they could have relieved that by releasing a few rooms earlier on - they were willing to do that for some guests (corporate contracts), but not for all.  When I finally approached the counter after 3pm for check-in, I encountered a staff member - Travis - who seemed apathetic at best.  Rather than greeting me, he waited for me to state my purpose for standing in front of him.  He kept referring to me as ""man"" like I was his buddy.  Common courtesy is becoming less and less common all the time.  By the time I was ready to go upstairs, I had to wait an exceedingly long time for the elevator.  Of the 3 main lobby elevators, only one was in service.  The other two were broken.  I was also a bit put off by the pungent smell of ganja - I guess that is now a given everywhere in Denver!  Before I got to my room, I began to wonder what was awaiting me there.  Thankfully, the room was updated (except the bathroom) and, more importantly, clean.  It looks to me like the Clarion has seen better days, and yet management is doing their level best to update this old hotel.  Still, there are a few touches (customer service is one!) that they need to try!  Free breakfast was about par for the course - standard offerings nowadays!  the one nice touch was the stoneware plates (even if they had only plastic flatware!)",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don’t book or use Priceline,"Man, what a letdown from both Priceline and the hotel. Booked last minute thru a Priceline Express Deal, read the reviews and was very concerned about our health and safety. Contacted Priceline asking for a cancellation or a upgrade to a different hotel that we would be willing to pay the difference for and they said no. Ended up booking a separate stay at the Westin in Downtown Denver for the same cost, which was an excellent stay! Reached out to Priceline again who contacted the hotel directly and said no refund or credit, even though we did not use our stay. Very disappointed in both Priceline’s customer service and this hotels. We will not be using either service again due to the sheer disappointment with customer service we experienced and the inability to support customers who do not feel safe or secure. Please consider using another booking application such as Hotels Tonight and PLEASE do not book here.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smells of cigarette smoke and dope. Some good points - but sadly outnumbered by the negatives....,"POSITIVES: Good sized room, comfy beds, aircon just about able to cope on warmer days.  Good breakfast. Shuttle into town is good - friendly drivers and very accommodating if you need to get somewhere a little off route. NEGATIVES: Shuttle back out of town is extremely unreliable. The reception always say ""it's just left heading to Union Station"" or ""15 to 20 minutes, and they'll be there.  The worst one (of several) was where I was told it was on it's way, and it didn't pitch up for another 1 hour 40 mins.  That was extremely irritating, and if the reception desk had been honest with an ETA, I could have either taken a taxi or waited somewhere a little more comfortable. Very poor internet speeds. Very noisy (our room was on the side of the hotel that backs onto the Highway). No double glazing.  Possibly the curve on the hotel acts an amphitheatre?  I don't know.  Bizzarely, they have a very loud crane/access platform parked up in the car park.  They get this thing out virtually every night, between 2200 and 2300, drive it around a bit and then hoist the cradle up to roof level, leave it there for a while, and then bring it down and park it up again before breakfast. I don't care if anybody else smokes, or what they smoke, but I do care when my room stinks of it.  It comes in through the aircon into the room, and through the vents in the bathroom. Not much of a ""Bar and Restaurant"".  We ate there once and got a raw burger. One lift out of action.  Other two are intermittent.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Lions and Tigers and Pot, oh my!","The secondhand smoke is really as bad as other reviewers have expressed.  We spent a weekend here (pre-paid) and I thought I got lucky at first.  We had a room on the second floor (a non-smoking floor).  There was little or no odor on Thursday night, but by Friday evening the room would seem like we’re in a casino.  The elevators are even worse.  It’s too bad really, because the staff, services and the room itself were pretty good.  They actually have really nice exercise equipment as well.The problem is that even though they separate the smoking rooms from non-smoking rooms, the building uses central HVAC instead of individual room units.  No matter where you are the smoke is distributed throughout the building.If you really like the location, there is a Radisson near by you might check out (don't know their policies or HVAC system).  If you need to stay at the Clarion, here are a few tips to make the room non-smoker friendly.  I discovered most of the smoke is coming from the bathroom vent.  Find the vent in the shower area and stuff a washcloth in it.  Run the AC during the day when people are out and turn if off at night and open a window.  Bring a portable air purifier.  Get a room on a lower floor so you don't have to spend much time in the elevators (the stairs are emergency only).Without the smoke, maybe a 4 star for the breakfast, location, price, beds (hybrid form/spring mattress).",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dirty,"Don’t waste your money this is definitely not three stars. More like 1.5 . There was hairs, long dark hairs all over wall and ceiling of shower as it hadn’t been cleaned. Called down told night shift desk clerk and he said well we don’t have housekeeping here so I guess I can put you in a different room. Well my sons asleep so can you just come clean shower. They said they didn’t have people to do that. Wow. A real manager would’ve said I’ll be right up. Also location is not central as promised. It’s in a rougher area of town .",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very disorganized place,"We had reservations & arrived right at 3:00 pm but were told our room wasn't ready yet & it would be about a 20 min wait but they wouldn't check us in till the room was ready. After 30 minutes, we got in the line of new arrivals that was backing up. After quite a wait in line, we finally got checked in. When we tried to enter our room, the safety bar was on - because the room was already occupied! We went back downstairs & after another wait, they finally got us switched to a new room.  The light over the bathroom sink didn't work. It just blinked, never did come on. The bed was ok but you could hear other guests moving about, talking, doors slamming, & traffic noise all night. Breakfast wasn't bad. Best thing about this hotel, is its proximity to Coors Field.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Items stolen from room,"Several items were STOLEN from my room while I was out for the day. I called the front desk, asked for the manager, and was connected to Yasmin. After telling me that I probably left my door open, she told me she’d conduct an investigation and call me on 7/27 because I was checking out early that morning. She did not call as promised, and I still have not been contacted.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"WTH. Blood, gum, trash!!! ","DO NOT BOOK!!! Save your $$$. I booked two rooms for 6 people. 3 people each room. My little brother makes a pallet on ground in all hotel stays usually, he’s a tall guy and does not fit into bed with one of us. Anyways ...go to climb into bed after a long day in Denver and there is blood on my comforter. The blanket my little brother grabs from my parents room to make the pallet also has blood on it. i call the front desk tell them the situation and the young girl says she will send someone up to address the issue. Ten minutes pass and no one has shown up. Call again and a guy answers this time I tell him there is blood on our blankets and he seems more interested in addressing the issue. A few minutes pass and there is a knock on our door. A maid with a set of sheets, I then inform her it is the comforter that has blood on it and she seems confused all while Forcing my little brother to hold some of her stuff to help her. She grabs the dirty blankets and knocks my wallet of into the trash can. after trying to talk to us in Spanish. And asking us if we speak Spanish? We are dark skinned but are Native American She looks around and precedes to say she will be back. I then dig my wallet of it of the trash can. A few more minutes pass and she returns with what looks like a single comforter in a plastic bag. Obviously a new “blanket”. She leaves and I go to get in bed and she has not in fact brought me a blanket but rather a mattress pad. We receive a phone call after she returns to the front desk. It is the young lady making sure that everything was taken care of, I inform her that she has brought me a single mattress pad rather then two clean comforters. I’m Told again they will fix it. A few minutes later another knock on the door... and now there is a man with the housekeeper and she has two blankets with her. The man says he is there to translate and asks me if there is anything else they can do. I then tell them that obviously the floor was not vacuumed because there is gum and m&ms on the floor as well as a can of peanuts under one bed and trash and a gatorade bottle I under the other! All this man has to say is he is really sorry about the whole ordeal. No offer to make the situation right, points a discount?? Nothing!!! When we checked in earlier in the day we put our stuff in the room and took of to another adventure. This whole thing happened late  at night as we are trying to get to sleep and took about 40 mins at the least to resolve fully. I will not be staying here again or recommending to anyone!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great location,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff, bathroom and rooms very clean. Nice outdoor pool . Smoking rooms available. Scenic view of Denver city and mountains. I would definitly recommend staying here next time your are in Denver",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good spot,"After a long night and long day of camping and hiking it was nice to find a hotel that have everything that we needed. The bathrooms were clean and they also serve breakfast in the morning. A great place to stay, with friendly staff! Can’t wait to stay again with them!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don’t book here!!,"I’m not even sure where to start with this hotel. It is absolute garbage. There are no redeeming qualities whatsoever. If you need anything from the front staff (checking in/out, complaints, etc..) then I would suggest  bringing a snack to tide you over to your next meal because you will be waiting for a long time. They don’t even acknowledge your wait. They just seem bothered that you’re even there in the first place. The outside looks nice but there is no resemblance to that on the inside. The whole place smells awful, the rooms are disgusting, there is no A/C, the beds are so bad that me and my fiancée seriously considered sleeping in our rental car so we could be comfortable and enjoy some cool air. If you want to take a hot shower after a day out, I’d suggest turning your water on before you leave so that it’ll be warm when you get back. The clarion hotel is also home to the slowest elevators in the Midwest. We literally waited 5 minutes for it to come up to the 3rd floor. (We timed it.) On our last day, we actually found blood stains on our shower curtain that were not previously there. God only knows what happened. That’s just my review of the physical condition of the place. Other than that, we paid for this entire stay in FULL a week before we got there. We checked in pretty late and the girl at the counter asked us for a card to put on file for incidentals, like whatever. That’s fine. We asked her straight up if there was gonna be anything charged to that card and she said no. But Maury determined that THAT was a lie. In the middle of doing some shopping on 16th street, we checked our account and realized we were missing about $300!! So after almost an entire day, we finally got this situation figured out and the money was put back into our account. Their way of handling this situation was giving us $40 in vouchers to their restaurant and they didn’t even follow through with that. Side note, we had to pretty much tell them (The Clarion Hotel people) that this was completely unacceptable and we weren’t just gonna accept their “oh I’m sorry, nothing we can do” BS, that they were, in fact, going to fix this situation because this was their fault and we weren’t taking no for an answer. So after this was figured out, we roll into the last day in Denver and have ANOTHER hold on our account from them at almost $500 for the same exact thing!!! We had to wait until after our flight to take care of their mistake this time. Overall, please please please do yourself a favor and do not spend your money at this establishment. There are far better places to be than this.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smoke,This hotel smells-smoke and pot.  We switched rooms and it did not help. Only 2 slow elevators working. I would never return. Only bright spot was Greg who tried to help with the smoke smell when we checked in late.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Problem Here!,"If you ever want to see a hotel that obviously has no management come here.Lobby a mess!  elevators 2-3 working while you share with service staff,  filthy elevators.Couldn’t clean room to 4 o clock. No Linens because laundry didn’t have clean ones!Breakfast interesting.  The best is the price they charge! JokeStay clear. Can’t believe Clarion has this hotel with no management.",1

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Amazing service,Found this hotel last minute for friends who came from out of town.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good enough.  Great mattress. Bad Fridge,Not great but good enough. Best part was the mattress as most comfortable I have had at a hotel. Good breakfast. Fridge is room did not work. Breaker kept tripping to room so would lose power to half the room. Lots of pot smokers in hotel. 9th and 8th floor apparently dedicated to them. Lock on door was temperamental.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Definitely not 3 Star, & not ""close"" to downtown","Dont even know where to begin.This place is a dump. Not even remotely close to a 3 star, 1 1/2 at best. Not close to downtown as advertised. Got stuck on the elevator, tv remote doesnt work, ac doesnt work, there is literally holes and screws in the wall above the bed where a picture should be. Entire floor smells like smoke and urine. Urine smell is almost unbearable in the bathroom, I wish I was exaggerating, but im not, in all honesty DO NOT  get a room here, i want to save you the dissapointment. Im not kidding , i wish i was ...... absolute failure 3 stars my a$$ #yuck",1

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place to stay for Rockies games,"If you are looking for a great, clean and affordable place to stay while in Denver to see a Rockies game well look no further this is it.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,OK hotel with a dispensary nearby,"When I walked into a hotel elevator, the smell reminded me of my grandpa's bathroom where he smoked heavily. I got a non-smoking room, but I guess the hotel is smoker friendly. I tried to take a bath right after checking in at 3pm, but a hot water didn't come out even after running a hot water for 15 minutes (it came out next morning, so I guess the heating system was cold since it was right after the check-in time). While I was waiting for the hot water, somebody knocked the door. Before I could respond, he tried to open the door with a key. I wasn't wearing pants, but fortunately the door bolt was on. When I said something through the door, the person didn't answer and just left. When I tried to take a toilet paper, the entire toilet roll unit came out of the wall.  It's in a warehouse district and not many interesting businesses were there. However, there is a pot dispensary in a walking distance, which may appeal to certain tourists. If you're inclined to walk, I suggest walking on the South Platte River trail from downtown. It's a mostly pleasant trail.",2

That's where the positive for this hotel ends though. We read other reviews about how it'd been remodeled so we were surprised when our bathroom had mold. You could tell our bathroom hadn't been cleaned after the previous guests left. There was hair all over the bathroom, trash from the soap in the shower, and a soaking wet towel hanging up on the shower rod. The air conditioner didn't seem to work (or at least not very well), thankfully it was chilly outside and we were able to open the window. The comforter on one bed was ripped. Not just a little rip but slices in the comforter. It's alarming how an employee could think it was acceptable. At that point, I went to complain. An employee went and got a manager who was outside smoking. He didn't seem concerned really, gave a thin red blanket and said it was better. When I complained about the dirty bathroom, he LAUGHED and said, ""maintenance must have missed that being behind the door."" I'm certain he meant housekeeping, but regardless, that's not a mistake that should happen. He didn't take me seriously and it annoyed me. His solution, ""toss it in the hall and we'll get it."" No apology, no offer to switch us to a clean room... Nothing. It was disgusting. We had the room booked for two nights but we left in the morning. The lady who checked us out was so concerned about getting back to her video call she didn't even ask how our stay was. There are much better hotels without mold and with courteous employees, don't stay at the Clarion.Also, the menu for the restaurant in the room was much larger than the menu in the restaurant (they only have burgers and apps)",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Place!!,Me and my family stayed her. The rooms we clean and smelled good. Beds were super soft. Breakfast was pretty good. Surprisingly they had a lot to choose from to eat. Bar area was quite so I had a cold one and did alittle work on my laptop. Yazmin greated us at the hotel. She was happy and had a great attitude. Other places I have stayed at the front desk people are sometime rude. We also seen her when we checked out and the same cheery smile. Very professional I must say. All around I think the staff gets an A. They make this place what it is. I highly recommend if you stay anywhere clarion is the place to stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Quiet, well appointed, and clean","This was our 2nd trip to Denver, and our second time staying at this hotel. Compared to my last review, since last year, the Hotel has changed names and is now The Clarion Denver Central, and what a turn around the place has made. The lobby has a fresher, more welcoming feeling than before, and the front desk as well as every other person that works there, seem to go above and beyond expectations, even before you ask a question, they are at the ready with as much info as they can provide, I have stayed at other hotels and when asking the front desk for dinner recommendations, either weren't aware there was a restaurant on property, or they were embarrassed about it, My associate enjoyed the daily breakfast bar, while I am not a ""morning eater"", the food did look pretty tasty. If I had to complain about anything, other than no safe in the rooms, as if you want anything put in a safe, you have to leave it at the front desk, I would have to say the rooms, even clean and comfortable, could use some updating, perhaps a solid color carpet, as opposed to a square patterned carpet, in a wedge shaped room, other than that, I have no complaints, only Kudos to the Management and staff for dealing with everything they have to deal with.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice place to stay if you're only spending the night,"My wife and I recently traveled to Denver for our anniversary. I bid on Priceline for 3 & 4 star hotels and this hotel was selected. It is listed as Denver Central but it is really about two miles north of downtown Denver. The hotel is nestled against interstate highways to the east and south. The Radisson hotel is across the street to the north and to the west is what I would describe as an industrial/business area. In other words, it is not in a neighborhood where you can stroll down the street and find shops/bars/restaurants. Given it's location, I would recommend it if you were traveling through Denver and just spending the night. They do have a free shuttle to downtown Denver and to Coors Field however if there are many others going to the ball park, you may have to wait a long time to catch the shuttle. I thought the bed in our room was very comfortable and I liked the shower however the toilet seat was broken. I neglected to mention it to the hotel staff but I also thought that Housekeeping would have noticed it when they cleaned. The free breakfast is standard hotel food (waffles, sausage, eggs, cereal, etc.). I would have no problem staying there if passing through Denver and just needing a room for the night.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Be careful here,"We were booked into the Clarion by Amtrack Vacations. It is a 20 minute shuttle trip from Union Station. So, since the shuttle does not leave until 7AM, it would be easy to miss the westbound California Zephyr at 8AM because of traffic. That would ruin a vacation. The restaurant had just a couple of items, mostly hamburger. Our room was OK. We opted for another hotel on the way back even though we had the Clarion prepaid.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Our experience with Clarion Denver Central was brutal-the Clarion gave our purchased room away!!!,"First, we weren’t acknowledged by the front desk staff after walking in. When recognized by staff, we were informed that no rooms were available. This was very unexpected as we made a reservation and provided our credit card information ahead of time. We were even charged for the room!  Second, the Clarion expectations are that your must be present at their check in time, phone calls will not be accounted for. We were shelter-less until finding a different place on our own. There was no help from staff whatsoever.Third, it was very disappointing and unprofessional to do to travelers in an unfamiliar location. If it weren’t  for the Holiday Inn Express & Suites, we would have been stranded without a place to sleep. We appreciate the Holiday Inn Express’s services and accommodating us. Finally, Safe travels to all!",1

Well actually,  after some minor confusion...i.e.don't push the power button on the computer tower...it's already on. The computer lit up,  signed in to the trusty Gmail...pushed print...and proceeded to the front desk to retrieve our documents.  The young lady by the printer, Yasmin,  plucked the papers from the grips of the printer tray,  and with a big smile,  handed them to us, no charge.  What? Did I hear you right? Seems nothing is just free anymore.  But these papers were.  And all thanks to the assistance of Yasmin. A true breath of fresh air!",5

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,They cancelled the reservation the day before the trip to sell for a higher price.,They cancelled my brothers reservation the day before the stay so they could sell the room for $400 more. Made a complaint with the BBB. The staff was unprofessional. Not a good hotel service will never stay at one anywhere ever again.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Do not stay here,Worst service and hotel I have ever been in.  Waited an hour and a half in line to check in the hotel. They gave us a room that was not cleaned and said they would get to it immediately.  We had to leave the hotel but when arriving back the room was still not touched. When informing the front desk they explained all their cleaning staff got overwhelmed and left early so they would send maintenance up to get it cleaned right away.  30min passed and no one came.  Called down to the front desk to ask when it would be done just to be informed that they didn’t know why someone told us maintenance could clean it because they had also left for the night.  They said they could send us some clean towels if that would help but could get bit further service to us.  At this time it was 1am and we ended up having to leave the hotel to find something else.  On the way out we had spoken to 5 other people who were also leaving because of the same experience.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!,"Absolutely do not stay here, your room is never guaranteed! Where do I even begin to describe the incredibly dishonest (questionable legality), and very poor business practices this “hotel” operates under? We booked two rooms approximately TWO AND A HALF MONTHS PRIOR to a Garth Brooks concert in Denver. Upon arrival at 1:45 pm we paid money on both rooms, were told they were not ready but we could go to the concert, and they would be calling us “within the next 45 minutes” with our room numbers. At that time, we asked for a guarantee that we would have our rooms considering we put money down on them and was told face to face without a doubt they would be ready. Over the course of eleven hours, attending the concert my family and I placed over ten phone calls to the hotel asking where my room numbers were and was repeatedly told they would call in about a half hour, and yet again GUARANTEED that I would have my rooms. After the concert, I returned to get my room numbers and low and behold was met with “we over booked the hotel by 300 people and you no longer have rooms with us”. Even more incredible is that the hotel then had the audacity to lie to our faces and place the blame back on the customer with “well this isn’t our fault, we called you and left a message”, to which I have proof they in fact did not. Looking at other responses this seems to be a fabricated response given to all customers. What makes this even worse in my mind, is the many others they did this exact same thing to. The lobby was filled with people being told they no longer have a room after the concert in which many people had been drinking all day and caught a ride with an uber to avoid implications with the law only to be left with no other options than to drive to another hotel jeopardizing their safety as well as others. For those that were “lucky” enough to get a room, the desk was filled with people describing horrid situations such as being assigned to a room with people already staying in there and walking in on them, or being assigned a room to which still had evidence someone had slept there as it had not been cleaned that day. Additionally, this hotel made no attempt at an explanation as to how a hotel of 215 rooms overbooks by 300! All in all, this place is a perfect example of how NOT to run a business by lying to their customers faces, not giving even the slightest respect or concern for their customers’ safety or for the situation they have placed their customers in, and providing unsanitary living conditions for those that do receive rooms. I am not done with this issue and will be seeking further means to make sure this is heard by as many people as possible and reported to every level possible of the organization.",1

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not bad for the area and price but could have been better.,This hotel is located in an industrial area of Denver but not far from downtown. Their free shuttle runs on the hour from the hotel to various locations in central Denver which is great and cost effective. Unfortunately it is difficult to arrange a shuttle pick up because you never communicate directly with the driver and on a few occasions the shuttle never showed up to pick us up. This hotel has a very good breakfast which makes it value very good. Rooms smelt heavily of both smoke and marijuana but that is expected in a less costly hotel.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,It was amazing!,"I came from Canada to see the Jays, the Clarion, especially Jennifer, was so helpful. Shuttle bus to and from ballpark, reasonable fees and the best breakfast I've ever had! Highly recommend. Came with my kids will definitely return!",5

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Front Desk service was flat out AWFUL,"First, my fully paid for reservation was cancelled after I was unable to show on at the time I estimated. No call to me was made to ask if I was coming or when, just cancelled. How did I find this out, you ask? Well, I arrived and gave the front desk clerk (Yazmin) my ID, and she proceeded to pull up someone else's reservation and give it to me. She didn't even notice, I had to point it out and only after I looked to make sure the right rate was listed. She then told me that it was the closest reservation to my name (does that even make sense??). She then asked for my confirmation number, and when I found it, she told it was the wrong one... Well, it was the only one I had received. I looked and looked, and then tried to see if I could pull up my reservation on their hotel website... And sure enough, I could! You're telling me she couldn't suggest that or do that herself?? That's crazy. Then, she proceeded to tell me they had cancelled my one night reservation after I didn't show up when I thought I would, and that's why she couldn't find me. Like that's any better? She then finished checking me and gave me the wrong room type. Look, I know I didn't reserve a room somewhere fancy, but having such a terrible attitude is something they can control, let alone having staff that is mildly competent. I will never stay at this place again.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very accommodating,We came here for our honeymoon. When we first arrived there was a problem with the room and the staff was helpful and courteous enough to accommodate and quickly fix our problems. It was greatly appreciated.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very nice stay,"The staff is very friendly and the place is very clean. They remodeled and it looks amazing on the inside and out, you also can’t beat being smoker friendly. I would recommend to anyone who wants to stay in Colorado for the week.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Returning Customers,"My boyfriend and I stay here everytime we are in the Denver area. Super close to everything like downtown, good local eats, and dispos. Theresa and Travis were quick and efficient at checking us in. They stayed smiling and helped us with our online booking. Great hotel with great staff.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,$tevenbenav,Check in was wonderful. Travis and Jennifer are very knowledgeable and emphatic. Room is nice and clean. Shuttle service is a perk. Front office manager is on point and very nice. I would definitely return to this hotel. Overall stay is a ten for sure.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Honeymoon,"We stayed at the Clarion Denver for our honeymoon, we came to Denver for the cannabis and the Clarion has smoking rooms. The staff was so helpful and nice. Greg K at the front desk was amazing, he even let my husband borrow a jacket since we didn't pack for the couple of cold days we had here. Such a sweet man. Teresa at the front desk was also very helpful and so nice. We had a great visit and would definitely stay here again! 😊",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very disappointing,"Location difficult.  Public transport inaccessible.  Told shuttle service provided was ‘on the hour’ only and could not be booked an advance. Staff disinterested and not approachable. No customer service. Rooms needed new soft furnishings - smoky smells still pertain. On the plus side, at least we had the Village Inn next door in which to eat.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Difficult access; slow elevators, outdated equipment","This place is in need of a major overhaul. It can't do much about the roads around it. GPS took us through a lot to get from here to downtown and back. But it could fix somethings: only two of the three elevators were working, resulting in long waits. OTOH, the doors closed very quickly, and didn't seem to react to a hand trying to stop them. The AC in the room was very noisy, such that we turned it off to try to sleep. The faucets in the sink and the tub were difficult to pull into the ""on"" position and should either be re-worked or replaced.  And I don't know what was going on the night we stayed there, but we encountered five different dogs on the elevators between arrival, coming down for b'fast and checking out. I also felt what I thought was ""left-over"" smoke in the room, although I was assured it was a smoke-free hotel and had been for awhile. Juice machine in breakfast room was ""out of order"". Needs some tender loving care.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clarion,My trip here was nice. The staff are friendly and helpful. The Rooms are clean. It's a quick drive to downtown. And if you don't have a car the hotel Van's will take you downtown. I will come back again.Thanks,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Firearms Historian,"Very nice. Staff very helpful and  accommodating. Room clean and comfortable. Jasmine at front desk was very helpful with checking in and getting room close to elevator for my husband. Also, my husband misplaced his cell phone and Jasmine tolerated my calling it about 40 times before we thought to call the front desk to see if they might have it!!  She’s a gem!All in all a great place to stay. Very pet friendly, also!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place to stay,Great place to stay comfortable beds nice views nice hotel staff would recommend to anybody very quiet and peaceful they have a shuttle service which is great for getting around town this place is very helpful they have a restaurant inside the place and a little snack bar room for a quick bite,5

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Walk in,Had a great experience front desk was awesome Travis and yasmine are amazing. Clean rooms overall amazing experience will be back ! Breakfast was amazing loved how willing the staff was to go above and beyond,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pleasure trip,There was heavy construction all around the area which made access a bit frustrating. The restaurant was closed but they did provide a full breakfast that was quite satisfactory. The room was clean and comfortable. I would stay here again.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Get a fan at check in or they will run out.,"I was stuck  here for 2 weeks working, although after day three I tried to find someplace else, all close by hotels were full.   I will first mention the good things about this place.  Breakfast was always stocked well, and variety of choices, including pancakes and waffles.  The bed was a king size memory foam that I would have loved to fall into every night after 12 hour days.  Greg at the front desk was always very cheerful, professional and helpful, to the limits he was stuck within. The gals that work the front desk seemed to spend more time on their phones, or just sitting, letting him handle everything.  So there, thats the good.  Lets really focus on what made this stay unbareable.  The heat.  Yes, the heat in the rooms.  They refuse to turn on the air conditioning, knowing that rooms are well above 80 degrees, no matter what floor, or what the outside weather is like.  Even during a 29 degree outdoor temp, it was almost 80.  Most of the time it teetered at the 90 degree mark.  I bought an indoor outdoor thermometer to document this, and photos are being provided. Management's answer to the over the top heat was to hand out fans to the guests and open the emergency exit doors so air could circulate. (Dangerous disregard for the guests safety I would say) I was on the 9th floor, where smoking is permitted, but remember, Denver is recreational weed friendly, and boy or boy, was the 9th floor recreating, ALL THE TIME.  The smell would seep through the door cracks, and the adjoining room has a door as well, so you get a double whammy of weed if you have a recreational user next door. My room was a corner on the  East side, nearest the highway. Even with the windows closed (which you couldnt do because of the heat) the sound was always loud, and added to the inability to get a good nights sleep. It was much worse during rush hour of course, but even at 2 am  you could hear the racing cars and rumbling big rigs rushing by.  The room was in need of a good cleaning, and it would have been nice to have a recliner or lounge chair in the corner to relax in, there was plenty of room for one, but this hotel gives you the bare minimums.  It had a nice shower head, with multiple settings, but the shower head wouldn't adjust so I could use any other setting, and it was caked with hard water deposits.  Water flashed from ice cold to scalding hot, with no in between, so showering was an event in itself.  The tub drained very slowly, taking over 2 hours, and you stood in dirty water as it filled while you showered.  Yuck. The ceiling had obvious water damage to it, and a quick spackle job is all they felt was needed to make it appear repaired.  One of the cups that was provided was burnt with what was obviously a cigarette being extinguished at one time or another.The day before check out I found a surprise additional nights charge on my credit card, which I had to jump hoops through to get them to remove.  On a Thursday night the lobby was filled with guys, quite drunk, with music blasting from the bar into the lobby and it seemed like I was entering a frat party.  Staff was be bopping around to the music just as much. The middle elevator was put out of service a few times instead of being fixed as it would partially open the door, jump and not stop properly on the correct floor, leaving a good 2-3 inch gap between elevator and floor. A couple of suggestions for the traveler considering this hotel.  Bring your own fans, (I got one from the desk and bought one myself and it wasnt enough) stay on any floor other that the 9th if you don't want to get a contact high or have to worry about impromptu drug testing from work, ask for a room on the north side of the building where it will still be hot, just not AS hot.  Or save yourself the headache and stay somewhere else.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,No Air Conditioning! ,"😡 No air conditioning, not joking. First hotel I’ve ever been to that doesn’t have air conditioning. They say it should be on maybe next month. 🤷🏻‍♂️ This is a deal breaker for me. 😡 Slow check in, front desk worker(s) seem like they could use more training. Also, the females were not very friendly. 😡 Purple T.V.😡 Can’t open window more then an inch or two for outside cool air relief.😡 Hygiene amenities are generic and cheap. 😡 Outside hotel look is old and rundown looking. 🙂 Inside hotel look is fresh, modern and chic. 🙂 Bed is memory foam and comfortable. 🙂 Large room. 🙂 Free Shuttle.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,This hotel is dumb,"I've stayed here four times in the past year.  There won't be a fifth.  Started with not having the room I reserved for.  Whatever.  Description says it's newly renovated.  True, if by newly renovated they mean they changed the name from Quality Inn to The Clarion and remodeled their restaurant.  Other than that, not so much.  They have about 400 rooms.  Internet is frustrating and can't handle all the guests.  Download speed is about 5mbps, Upload about 1 mbps, but their pings are all over the place from 5ms to over 4000ms.  Don't expect to do much more than be able to check Email.  They need to get with the times like a lot of the Quality Inns (the sister hotels) have recently with much higher up and download speeds in the 20s-40s.Then there's the rooms themselves.  They're okay in terms of the look, but as some examples of apparently ""newly renovated"", there's more water pressure in a spring drizzle than in their showers and similarly, the sink was struggling to do more than drip.  The mini fridge, though cranked to high, cooled to about room temperature.  And speaking of room temperature, their HVAC system is ridiculous.  It's a central unit, not individual to each room and the system can only pump heat or AC, never both, meaning if they've set their main system to heat, you can't get AC and if they've set it to AC, you can't get heat.  The room temperature hovers around 84 degrees and since the system is set to heat, you can't cool the room.  The only option is to open the window the six inches it allows you to and hope the wind blows into your room.  Then there's trying to sleep with all the noise from the traffic on the highway that's beside the hotel...because the window is open...because you can't cool the room.It's really dumb.  If you know anything about Denver weather, you know one day it will be 80 degrees, the next it will be 20 degrees so not having the individual option to set your room temperature on heat or AC is just....baffling.  They have 9 floors so the higher you go, the hotter the rooms are.Lastly, you can no longer leave a review with Choice Hotels on their site unless they send you an Email after your stay, however it says they ""MAY"" send you an Email to leave a review, not they ""WILL.""  I've been staying at Choice Hotels for many years and don't get these Emails, so I went with Trip Advisor on this one...so you've been ""Advised.""",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,They will throw u for mistakes THEY MAKE,"WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! HOW DANG HARD IS IT TO JUST DO THE JOB YOU ARE PAID TO DO????????I have NEVER IN MY LIFE EXPERIENCED treatment like this in my life!!! & no matter how high up you contact NOBODY CARED!!!! I got a response saying to contact back & they would make it right. So we did because was coming back in a few weeks BUT when we contacted back, they offered NOTHING AT ALL!!! Staff is AWFUL HERE!!! We made reservations MONTHS IN ADVANCE, upon arrival was told no clean rooms as we watched SO MANY PEOPLE CHECK IN & GET A ROOM!!! Hotel clerk actually canceled our reservations while we was standing outside waiting on them to clean our rooms. But that not even kicker to it: She handed to my 16yr old daughter. She wasn’t even adult enough to give to an adult & when asked why we was canceled due to THEIR mistake, her response was “I don’t have to deal with this” we waited for over 3 hours for them to get our room cleaned, then they threw us out rather than clean a room???? Offered NO HELP TO FIND ANOTHER ROOM!!! I will continue to report this hotel to every possible website. & every person I know. We come to Denver 3-4 times a yr to visit for last 20yrs & NEVER EVER had ANYTHING like this b4. I feel as if we completely discriminated against, there is NO OTHER POSSIBLE REASON for they way we was treated. Apparently they are unaware or just don’t care how 1 bad customer service experience can hurt your business. As a business owner myself I know 1 bad customer experience will be heard. That 1 customer tells 20 people & if those 20 people tell just 3 people each you now have AT LEAST now 61 people heard just verbal that doesn’t include how many people you can reach through sites like this, Yelp, etc. I could go on & on about this place but this alone was HORRIBLE enough. Thankful there are few other super awesome hotels that ACTUALLY CARE about customers! There is a reason you make reservations it advance?!?!?!? There are really no words that I can use to describe our experience. We had a family of 4 & had to search town late at night to find a room. From what I read from other reviews seems they are overly happy to throw you out. AGAIN: HOW DANG HARD IS IT TO JUST DO THE JOB YOU ARE PAID TO DO????????",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Monica at front desk,"My visit started off with Monica at the front desk being EXTREMELY  rude . I was told I couldn't check in until 3 ( I arrived at 1:30 ),however she started checking in other guest at 2 . So I waited until 3 . I had requested a smoking room and none were available.  I specifically told her my check out day would be Sunday March 10 th .On the 9th my key wouldn't work any longer. So I went to the front desk to inquire as to why and Monica very abruptly told me I was to check out today Saturday March 9th. I explained to her that was not correct and I would need it for one more night . She quoted me the price for the room which was going to be $10 higher than I had paid all week and I explained to her I don't have my wallet on me because I'm locked out of my room. At that point she tells me she feels it's necessary for me to stay elsewhere. Mind you I am very sick because of the weather here. At this point she told me I had until 1:30 to ""GET OUT "". I proceeded to tell her I had no ride and nowhere else to stay for the night at which point she proceeded to tell me she didn't care it's not her problem I needed to get out.This person has no business and being at a front desk at a hotel dealing with customers. She has no customer service skills at all.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Overall a disappointment,"I’ll start with the good. On the exterior the hotel seems nice enough. The lobby is clean and well decorated and the staff were very kind. Now the bad... It started with my mother-in-law’s room. We had to call the front desk just to be instructed how to open the door, apparently you’re supposed to pull the handle up and pull up on the door to make it open. The luggage cart was too large to fit through the door so it made unloading our luggage very difficult. Not to mention the luggage cart barely fit into the elevator to begin with. Move into my room and there was a whole mess of problems. In the bathroom there was mold in the shower and the sink was constantly dripping. There was a hole in the door that was covered in tape and painted back over. The cups left for you in the room were dirty. The coffee cups had remnants of coffee s I’ll and the drinking glasses had grime and dirt on them as well. The decorating in our room looked no different than the La Quinta compared to my mother-in-law’s room. The beds were so firm, I left with my back hurting even more than when we checked in. I know not to expect much when staying at a hotel last minute, however I do not feel this room is worth the almost $100/night rate they charge. I’m not sure this hotel is bad enough to deserve a 1-star rating however I know it doesn’t deserve a 2-star.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Yasmine is awesome,"Front staff member Yasmine was awesome!  So helpful and patient with all of my questions.  She went above and beyond,  trying to help me find a venue in Denver I was inquiring about!  The manager was also so very kind and helpful. I'll stay here everytime I visit Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Worst hotel room ,ever","I have stayed in hotels from NY to NOLA to Colorado and this might have been THE worst night ever. I could deal with the outdated room, the random screws sticking out of the wall holding up the falling mirrors, even the broken lights and exposed electric. But after returning to our room at 2 am after a show downtown, we found that our room had to be in the 90's and there was no way to open a window or cool the room down. Turning on the AC only caused more hot air to blow from the vent. Around 4 am I was ready to go sleep in my van in the parking lot in 20-degree weather instead of sleep in this room. Sleep never came for me and we packed up and left the moment my husband woke from a brief nap. The sink was also beyond dangerous. Anything besides cold was scorching hot - thank god we didn't have kids with us. Wasn't just our room either, as we caught another guest who said the hotel was aware of the issue as they brought him up a fan after he complained. He could crack his window though - we were not so lucky. We only ended up here because it was the ONLY hotel with smoking rooms we could find... never again. Choice Hotels should be ashamed of putting their name on this property...",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don't risk your life,"The hotel has issues with heating on most floors.  They cannot regulate the heating so they are propping the emergency exit doors open and telling guests to leave their windows open in the middle of the winter.  On other floors there is no heat and they give you space heaters.  This poses a huge fire threat.This hotel is asking for a major catastrophe, don't be there when it happens.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Ok,"The place was clean and had a pretty decent location. The shuttle to downtown was great and so was staff. However, like other complaints, the heat in the room is awful and there is no fan. I’m always cold and I had to sleep on top of the covers sweating in winter. I’d suggest leaving fans in the rooms at this stage for guests.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,1st time Colorado trip,"My bed was hard as a rock!! Now everyone else’s beds had memory foam but mine. (We had 2 rooms, 4 beds) Rooms were extremely warm. You can’t adjust the temperature in your room. The unit just makes noise, does nothing. We even kept our windows cracked & it was to warm. Breakfast on the other hand is quite good with a large variety of just about anything you could want for breakfast & yes it’s free. It is 420 friendly but they offer smoking & nonsmoking",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Short Staffed and Not Prepared,"This hotel was short staffed at every position.  The restaurant needed wait staff, the front desk had one person working with a line of 8 people, housekeeping did the bare minimum.  The hotel was full, but management could have done a much better job of preparing.  The room was average and the food was not great.  The HVAC system would not allow you to get the room below 80 degrees.  The elevator was noisy making you wonder if the cables would hold.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Oldschool Hotel really nice,"my stay was beautiful. a spacious and clean room with a desk that helped me a lot to keep working during my visit.A friendly and helpful staff. If some day i  have the opportunity to return, I will for sure",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Hotel,It was an excellent experience to stay at this hotel.the price is cheap and they offer you many services.I love the lobby and the bar is newly remodeled.I will definitely be back in summer I can not wait,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Second visit to Denver!,"This is my second time in Denver this year and I choose to stay at the same hotel due to my last experience.  However now the hotel is in different ownership! Still had an awesome time, every worker I encountered was friendly, and check in and out went quick and smoothly! Free parking! Smoke friendly! Close to downtown Denver! Only issue we had was the fridge was plugged into a bad outlet and we didn't notice till the next day so some food went to waste. Still would stay here again in future trips back out to Denver. Sweet views of the mountains as well!!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great value - excellent location,Front desk staff was super friendly upon my arrival. Restaurant was recently renovated and looked very modern. Shuttle service in downtown was extremely helpful and made the overall experience much better. Centrally located for all of my business needs. Free hot breakfast in the morning was well prepared. First time staying and look forward to future trips to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,As if you were paying to be in a Breaking Bad episode,"Do not stay here.Three are tweakers in the parking lot at all hours of the night.The entire hotel stinks of weed.Front desk staff are rude and unprofessional.Only one working elevator in a 10 story hotel.Everything is either dirty, worn out, broken or under construction.Spend you money downtown on a hotel that doesn't suck donkey balls.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Enjoyed Our Stay At The Clarion,"My family and I have stayed at the Clarion several times.  The location offers easy access and shuttle service to many activities. I have always found the hotel to be clean, I feel safe staying here, the staff is friendly and helpful. An affordable option in a good location.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Nice for the price, but some issues","The room was cheap enough, and available at the last minute. However, the heat in my room did not work - I turned it up to 78 degrees, and the AC kicked in which only served to cool the room down! Definitely not great when you're staying in the mountains. I decided to sleep under a couple of blankets, because there was a continual line at the front desk, and I didn't want to wait to get my room reassigned (I had just driven in from Salt Lake City and was exhausted).  Also, the remote for my TV didn't work.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,2nd Time Staying,"The hotel isn't the nicest, but my husband is a cigarette smoker so it's nice for him to smoke in the room. Our kids always get there own room and there floor doesn't smell of cigarettes or weed. Staff is always friendly. Only downfall is the bar closes early an there is NO late night food around.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Clean Room Comfortable Bed, Had a Great Time!","Mid range chain hotel. I was booked into a clean room with a comfortable bed. Friendly and helpful staff.Acceptable but weak wifi signal. Complementary hot breakfast. Near a dispensary and they even give you a coupon. As some reviewers have said it was a little warm and lots of traffic noise with the open window, but I really enjoyed my stay. It was very clean, the beds were nice and they had a real breakfast, eggs bacon, biscuits, gravy... Would go back and recommend to friends and family.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Too hot!,We stayed two nights and could not get the room temperature below 78...too warm to sleep comfortably!  The front desk said the AC was turned off and to open a window. Since the hotel is right next to I-25 opening a window meant lots of traffic noise.  The breakfast was very good.  We will not stay there our next time in Denver.,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Have double what you will be paying for the room available,"Nice hotel rooms. Restaurant was closed. The front desk staff is nice and friendly but has no idea how to answer questions correctly. Also, be prepared for them to hold double the amount you are paying for your hotel room. They charge an incidental hold which is the entire amount of your stay prior to check in, then they charge you the entire amount for your stay upon check in. For myself, it was a one night stay so it worked out fine, however, a woman checking in at the same time as us was charged twice for all 5 nights which over drafted her account so be aware to have AT LEAST double what you are paying for the hotel room available plus additional funds for your trip. I am three days post check out with my incidental hold still not refunded.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very Bad Experience,"Made reservations on the road.  When we checked in the room and hallways were hot, no AC.  The front desk told us it wouldn’t be working that night and offered fans.  My wife has MS and we told them absolutely not.  We checked out and told them it would have been nice if they had told us before unloading everything.  Also, asked about other hotels, they were less than helpful.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,One night in Denver,"I'll start off with some good.  The front desk seemed to be interested in helping where they could.  The Manager on Duty seemed to be very friendly and knowledgeable, but the rest of the staff seemed either under trained or slow. Check in process was mostly efficient and easy. When we got to the room it was cold, probably because the heat didn't work and the window was leaning inwards.  There was a huge gap around the window that let a large draft into the room.  I managed to shove something in the window that helped keep it more sealed and kept some of the air out (it was about 35 degrees outside).Also had some food I put into the small refrigerator, well I didn't notice that it was turned to the coldest temperature and it froze my food solid.  Also, there was no tv remote in the room. I did call down about that and they brought a new one to the room fairly quickly.One of the best things about the hotel is that they provide a shuttle on the hour into downtown Denver.  However, during the ride to downtown the shuttle driver was answering the phone on speaker to talk with people about his pick ups and drop offs (which is fine).  However, he was also answering phone calls from other people.  One conversation was with an employee not working, because the restaurant was closed.  Why was the restaurant closed?  Well, because there was sewage backing up into the restaurant and I, along with every guest in the shuttle, heard all about it.  I won't stay at this hotel again because it badly needs to be renovated and the experience was one of the worst I've had at a hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Dirty, sheets that don't fit and more","This was dreadful, although the staff did seem to be interested it was a disaster from the start. Two rooms on the 5th floor, the floor looked as though it had not been cleaned for ages, the room badly fitted sheets with burn holes, the floor must have been the same brush just did not get used, the other room was not a lot different, both smelt of smoking. We were moved and promised better, it was not the case. We were told that new bedding had been ordered but it did not fit properly, we stayed the night and suffered it but never again.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Amtrak Vacation Hotel- 1st in Series of Reviews- Denver/Yellowstone,"This is the first of several reviews I am writing about our Amtrak National Parks Vacation from Denver to Grand Junction/Salt Lake/ Yellowstone/ Salt Lake.  If you are considering buying this package, I heartily recommend your reading the complete series of reviews which I will number in sequence of our experience.  If you are just interested in the hotel, this should be helpful to you as well.Lipstick on a Pig describes this hotel most succinctly.  This is, from the looks of it, a 60s-70s era building set in a crummy part of Denver.  It was previously a Quality Inn or Hotel and there seems to have been some hipster type cosmetic changes to the lobby and rooms to try to bring it up to Clarion standards.  I see people praising the pool area, which of course was shut down at this time of year for us- but I would compare it to a pool at someone's older house.  This is NOT a nice pool area for a large group of hotel guests.  The car rental kiosk was occupied by a man playing Arabic pop music.  The restaurant at midday was host to the entire housekeeping crew sitting around having social time... not kidding- about 12 people shooting the breeze and having a merry old time in the ""public"" area of the hotel.  The elevators all reek of marijuana.  I jokingly asked a younger couple on the elevator if everyone was smoking pot in their rooms and they replied ""yes, pretty sure they are""  even though the hotel has no smoking signs everywhere.  The newish furniture in the rooms has already been dinged up by the clientele here, but the beds were decent.  Our room had a bathtub but I couldn't use the tub because the drain plug was broken. Faucet fixtures feel like they are going to fall off in your hands. Shower head sprayed an uneven stream- probably due to mineral buildup I would venture. Tv remote control was filthy as well as the outlet switches which probably date back to the original incarnation of the building.  The staff's attitude at the front desk was strange- almost as though they are jailkeepers and not hospitality hosts/hostesses.  The elevators sputtered up and down, vibrating as they went- with some kind of rock facing on the lower half which looked incredibly tacky.  There is a trick to getting into your room, even if your key miraculously decides to work.  One night while I was sitting outside my room waiting for my husband to get a working key from downstairs, a girl walked up to the elevator and started crying bizarrely to someone on her cellphone loudly... ""I'm bleeding from my.... and nobody here cares.  I've had it with this.  I'm getting another hotel."" The two good aspects of the hotel were the hot breakfast served in the dated, sticky tabled restaurant, and the comfort level of the beds which I assume are a newish nod to the Clarion brand.  Another plus is the existence of a shuttle to the train station, which is probably the reason Amtrak Vacations still does business with this location.  But, although the shuttle drives seem to be decent folks overall, the shuttle itself is a well worn, sprung spring kind of vehicle.  The overall feel of the experience is that nobody really cares about the paying customer- they are there to take your money and do as little as possible while filling the rooms with partiers and two nighters. So... the upside of this hotel is that we did not spend much time there. Amtrak Vacations books you for two nights here at the beginning of this package.  MY ADVICE is that you would be better served to stay at one of the hotels close to the 16th Street Mall, like the Hampton Inn if you are looking for a better class of clientele and cleanliness.  There is a free shuttle that runs up and down this street to the Capital area with many hotel and restaurant options.  Union Station is right on this line.  There should be no need to take a sketchy van ride from another part of town.  Big, big fail for Amtrak vacations.  Shame on you for putting up unsuspecting package guests here.  We did not expect the Ritz Carlton, but would have gladly paid the difference for even a Holiday Inn Express level stay.If you are reading reviews only to judge the suitability of this hotel for a stay, then you have been warned.  It is pretty nasty.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Will not be back,"My husband and I stayed here for a little vacation with plans to go to the Broncos/Chiefs game. At first glance, the property was nice and clean and we were able to get into our room a little early, but that's were the good part stopped. The elevators were horrible. Pretty sure one of them didn't work at all. The middle one was VERY shaky and they took forever to arrive. One guest told us that he had been waiting over 10 minutes for an elevator and housekeeping told us we couldn't use the stairwell because it would set off the fire alarm. The door to our room, and a couple others that we noticed, was very hard to open, we actually thought it was locked from the inside it was so difficult. Once in the non-smoking room, we were greeted with an overwhelming smell of marijuana. We don't smoke and weren't necessarily mad about the smell, but didn't expect our non-smoking room to smell so incredibly strong as if somebody just smoked a joint before we opened the door. The bedding was weird and hard to figure out. I seemed to be a top sheet, comforter and then top sheet??  Turned out a mess in the am. The free breakfast was good. The bar was VERY lacking. It operated at odd hours and definitely not the hours posted. The bartender was very cooky and friendly to some and downright mean to others. Two gentlemen came in around 10 pm and were told the bar was closing at 10:30. They said the website said it didn't close till 2 am and the bartender told them very rudely that he didn't care and was closing at 10:30. The customers said they would make sure to give him a bad review online and he went and got the manager and had the men thrown our for ""threatening"" him. It was VERY uncomfortable.  The windows were filthy to the point of not being able to see well out of them.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Sports package gone wrong with the strong aroma of Marijuanna,"I bought a sports package through your website that included a $50 voucher to use for food and beverage at your establishment.  When I checked in no one knew anything about it the $50 voucher and referred me to the corporate number.  The corporate number provided referred me to member services.  Member services was not open until 8am the next morning ~ next morning I called again.  They said the issue had to be resolved at the hotel...  I went down to resolve the issue and the gals at the front desk told me that there would not be a manager until 9am I went down at 10am and the director said that she could not help, however she would get the front desk manager.  The front desk manager then tried to find the promotion and did not know anything about it?  She said she would get a hold of the corporate office and that should take about 20 minutes.  After calling she then opened a drawer at the front desk and handed me $50 worth of vouchers to use at the hotel restaurant area.  She also said she would credit my rewards account for the trouble.  O.K. ~ Finally.  Around noon, I go downtown watch the baseball game come back to the hotel go to use my vouchers and the gal working tells me that she can’t use them!!!  I order tell her that I will clear it up at the front desk in the morning.  Next morning, I go to check out, show the bill to the front desk after breakfast and I am told that they can’t take the money off, but she will give me more reward points to make up for the $50 in vouchers?!  I showed her the charges were for the in-house restaurant, she responded by saying that she would issue enough reward points to be the equivalent of the $50.  If I would have known that I would not have ordered anything the night before!  I then transfer hotels stay in town for a few more days check the balance and see 2000 points ~ hmmm O.K. It looks like I received points for the nights that I booked at 10 points for every dollar that I spent ~ basically what I booked.  The other lip service points for not knowing what your own program is, not honoring the program once you figure out that ""your guest"" was telling you the truth and then promising more points ~ what a terrible experience.  As I write this review verifying my points, so I can accurately respond on here, I am disconnected while being on hold for 8 minutes.  Call back and the phone is answered right away to customer service.  I want to verify that I understand the points correctly; I am transferred to member services and once again on hold.  Member services tells me that the hotel gave me credit for my trouble, however for some reason I did not receive credit (points) for the stay.  They finally fix the credit points for the stay.  I then have the pleasure to share this experience with the world.  The communication at the hotel between whoever designed the package should have communicated this to the entire front desk, so they could have served the customer and made it a great experience.  Breakfast in the morning was good ~ that I am sure is important as the hotel had the strong aroma of marijuana throughout.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Came for a concert,"We booked through TripAdvisor, stayed for two nights. Breakfast is excellent. Not just muffins and cold cereal here! While those things were available there was also biscuits and gravy, sausage and bacon, eggs and pancakes. Waffles. Juices and coffees, teas. Fresh fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese..... So much good stuff! The staff is very helpful and while I thought we had a shower that wouldn’t divert water to the shower head and called to tell them so, the maintenance guys came up and showed me how it worked. Guess that was my bad, they were awesome. If you are looking for a five star place where everything is top of the line and all the staff has rods up their butts then this is not your place. If you are looking for a clean place with good folks around and a fun atmosphere then this is it. Definitely going to be our go to when in Denver. Thanks for the stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,its ok,"loved the pool ,the accommodations 'were fair , we checked in and had our room key ,we walked in and thay said we have to change rooms , we were put in a room with no balcony, no sliding glass door , I spasificly  as for a room on the ground and we got put on 2nd floor , my husb is a handicap person and no accommodations' for him . the night crew was rude to me when I ask for a comment card ,but we loved the breakfast it was so good ,that's the only thing we liked about this place",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,It was okay...,"We stayed here because we needed somewhere that was pet friendly and wanted somewhere that was weed friendly. The entire lobby smelled like weed (could be a bonus, could be a deal breaker). Front desk staff were very friendly, efficient and gave us coupons to the nearest dispensary. Location was great. Could use updating and housekeeping could do a better job of cleaning the place. Continental breakfast was very meh. All in all it was a very average stay that met our two most important qualifiers. Not a deal breaker but there is some work that could be done. Overall I feel like the entire experience was what you would expect from the most stereotyped stay at a weed friendly hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst reservation I've ever made.,"I ended up not even staying in this hotel. When I tried to book through tripadvisors partner getaroom, before I booked I called them and told them I wanted 2 beds and a smoking room. They told me since there was no option on their site to ask for a smoking room that I could book the most expensive room they had then call them and ask them to make the change to a smoking room and the hotel would accommodate my request. The most expensive room they had was for 1 double king size bed (which again when I called I told them 2 beds would be a must.) I called the hotel and they told me they could make the change and there would be no problems. I called multiple times after to confirm the changes to a 2 bed smoking room were made and every time I called they insured me that I would be getting what I wanted. I even called the day before I got there to check in. When I get there to check in there is trash all through the parking lot. Lobby was filthy and I speak to the lady at the desk and she tells me I can only have a nonsmoking 1 bed double king sized room. I explained I had called multiple times and was suppose to be getting 2 beds and a smoking room. They told me they were full as it was a weekend and there was nothing they could do for me. Refused to refund my cash on the spot, so I ended up having to shell out enough money initially to get 2 hotel rooms as I ended up staying someplace else. Then to make matters worse, When speaking to getaroom (TripAdvisors 3rd party booking agency) to get a refund the hotel tried to claim that I checked in and did stay at their hotel when I did not. Had to argue with them through 2 phone calls (which both were over an hour long) to get a full refund. This was the worst hotel experience I've ever had in my life. I will never use TripAdvisor again to reserve a room. They say misery loves company, so If you like dealing with problems, horrible customer service, a dirty property, no guarentees, etc etc... Then TripAdvisor and Clarion Hotel Denver Central is the way you should go. As they will make all your entire experience a complete nightmare.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,At least provide sheets that fit the bed.,"I booked this room as an express deal on Priceline. If I had a choice I would not stay here again. The customer service with the check-in was great and the girls were super friendly. This hotel provided fast elevator service. They also provide a local shuttle for the Pepsi Center which we thought was nice. Unfortunately once we got in our room I instantly felt ""icky"" and didn't want to touch anything. I just had a feeling some things hadn't been thoroughly cleaned (like the carpet, bedside table and toilet seat). The king size bed was VERY comfortable and soft but had these awful sheets on it that kept coming off and wouldn't stay on any of the corners. Prepare for some noise from the parking lots, we heard quite a few car alarms in the early hours of the morning. But honestly if you're looking for a place to lay your head and don't care about fanciness then book your stay here.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NOT A BAD PLACE,I had a one night stay here while on business.The outside is nice looking and the hotel is accessible from the highway.There is an outdoor pool with nice seating area.My room was OK (not outstanding).  It appeared to have been cleaned in a rush. . found candy and candy wrappers on the floor.  I was very impressed with the shower pressure and abundance of hot water.Read the on site restaurant menu before dinner. . .only to find an appetizer menu was all that was available.  Luckily there is a great place to eat right next door.staff was very friendly and the free shuttle to downtown was a huge bonus.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Outstanding stay,"I had an incredible stay at the Clarion. The hotel met my expectations and needs. Despite its location, you can easily use Uber or Lyft or take the free shuttle going to 16th street/union station. The room is spacious and decent. A Little bit noisy being close to rail tracks and highways. Other than that, i thoroughly enjoyed my stay from the moment i checked in. I loved the near by diner ""Village Inn"". They serve all day breakfast that is really tasty and their pies are to die for.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Watch your bank account!,"I read the mixed reviews of this hotel and really thought the complainers were likely just whiners.  I really should have taken them more seriously.I will start with the biggest problem in case you don't read any further.  We booked directly with Choice Hotels so there was no one involved in the transaction other than this hotel and us.  We had a one week stay.  I believe the hotel put a hold on our card for one night initially, as is normal.  By our third day, our card was declined when we tried to buy gas...we looked into it and the hotel had charged our card for the week's stay (over $800) and also had a pending charge for nearly $700, tying up $1500.  The pending charge stayed on our card for FOUR DAYS.  The hotel was never able to adequately explain why.  Their explanation ranged from ""I don't know why that happened, I don't know why we charged your card at 2AM"", ""That's what we do, we always secure payment"" ""We should have only taken one night then the balance"" to ""We use a third party and sometimes this happens, I don't know if we don't have it set up right or why it happens"" In spite of requesting a call from the hotel manager, four days later, I have heard NOTHING.The other bothersome, though not as serious problems were:I made reservations two months in advance for a mountain view, king room (extra cost) and called to confirm that as well as to ask for the 6th floor the morning of our arrival.  Upon our arrival, we were given a 7th floor, queen, street side room...that smelled dank and smoky due to its proximity to the smoking and 420 rooms above.  It took two days for us to get a better room, though we never got a mountainside room nor a refund.The rooms were in disrepair, both had lose toilet seats and torn comforters, the queen room sheets and mattress pad didn't fit so it came lose every night, the showers were mildewy, one tub didn't drain when showering, and neither tv remote worked well (we thing the batteries were low).Wifi was so spotty as to be nearly useless.We didn't receive housekeeping one day and had to call for towels.Our room key had to be reprogrammed about five times...which required a trip to the lobby.  They sent maintenance to repair it, but it didn't completely eliminate the problem.The front desk seemed to be very poorly managed.  No one seemed to know what was going on and we got a lot of misinformation and noticed a lack of any care for the problems.The elevators are so janky they're on the verge of scary.  One didn't work till our last day there. There are open joints in wiring over the pool table, etc.  The fire doors in the stairwells are propped open.  I bet code enforcement would have a heyday.  The back door near the pool is never locked so its easy to come in that way... On the bright side, the beds were comfortable and the pillows were nice...They have free USA Today papers in the lobby.  It was convenient to be able to get our rental car in the Avis location off the lobby. The location was convenient to the interstates (and the rail yard if you were interested in hopping a train to make a quick get away from the Clarion Central.)I am ordinarily a pretty easy going guest.  I think my real issue with this hotel is the fact that there were so many problems that were not made up for with effort or attitude or items on the plus side...AND the manager apparently does NOT care.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Short Vacation,"The hotel could use some updating and serious cleaning.  Would consider staying there again. Centrally located easy to get to anyplace.  Staff was helpful and courteous especially Betty Martinez, Guest Relations Officer.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"New mgmt letting staff & paying guests down, want a response please from management!","New management is letting paying guests & staff down. We decided to eat at the restaurant (we were 8 ppl and had 3 rooms) after flying in from Europe & the East Coast in the early evening. There were only 2 ppl working bar, restaurant & kitchen? Service was sweet, very professional (Jenna & Melanie did their best & were great) but with only 2 ppl working everything with 30 customers, it was completely chaotic. Food arrived 1.5 hr later & dad is diabetic so we were very concerned. By the time we got a few orders, we canceled others as needed to go to bed! Don't think we should have paid full price for everything as management should have staffed more ppl to not only support paying customers but their own staff. As I was talking to the front desk this morning, who were really, really nice, another regular customer to the hotel was waiting to complain about rude staff. Seems like you guys have missed the mark under new management and I would like to speak with someone. Thank you",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not worth it!,"We stayed for two nights at the end of a wonderful 2 week trip to Yellowstone. This was by far the worst hotel we stayed at. First it is no longer a Quality Inn, but a Clarion. The front desk was not very professional looking; died purple hair, nose and lip rings, growing out bleached hair. Nice enough, but not what I look for at the front desk of a hotel. We could not even get into our room and had to have the cards re-keyed. I talked with someone in the elevator who was on his way to get his redone for the 5th time. The room was OK, nothing special. But when we took a shower the tub did not drain. A 15 minute shower and I was standing in 5 inches of water. Also the sink did not drain either. Really frustrating! When we came back to our room after being out all day housekeeping had not remade the bed. Just straightened it. Sorry, but I expect my bed to be remade everyday. The gold bed covering was thrown off in the corner, not even folded and put in the closet. Horrible! The hotel was also smoke friendly. Apparently they had several smoking rooms on the 8th and 9th floors, but you would not know it was only those floors. The whole hotel reeked of weed. I really don't appreciate my 9 and 13 year old getting contact highs. I will never book a hotel in Denver again without verifying that they are completely smoke free. Final nail for this place was when we checked out the final morning, no ""Hope you a had good stay"", ""How was your stay"", nothing. Just a curt Thanks and a blank stare. I do not recommend this place.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,GREAT HOTEL,This is a wonderful hotel with a great staff.  Our check-in went really smoothly and the staff was very welcoming.  My kids really enjoyed their pool and my husband and I really enjoyed the restaurant.  The breakfast had a great selection.  We even used their shuttle to go back and forth to a few restaurants in the area.  GREAT HOTEL!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Glad we went!,"We did read the reviews before staying so we were a little skeptical.  When we arrived there were several people in line ahead of us with one person working the desk.  She was fast and very polite.  It was a peak check in time and the hotel was completely booked, so the fact that we had to wait came as no surprise.  The only time we smelled smoke from either cigarettes or MJ was outside, and there was a faint smell of smoke in the elevator.  The room was fantastic.  Yes, the hotel is old and renovated, but it was comfortable and trendy.  The kitchen is being remodeled so the food available for lunch and dinner is extremely limited.  The pool area is great, as was breakfast.  They had more options than most Choice hotels.  About the only negative was that our room door was really difficult to open.  Luckily when we first arrived a staff member was there to help us get in, and show us how to open it by jiggling the door handle.  I would recommend this hotel for the price.  And, they offer a free shuttle into the city until 10 pm.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Short visit,needed a quick room to stay in that was smoker friendly. Middle elevator was very shaky and the hotel itself was very smoke filled and smelled of marijuana. Ice Machine was moldy by the drain. I did not feel the safest with a few people in the lobby very shady I stayed in my room rather than coming down to the lobby area after 10.,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Inconsistent,"Let me start by saying that we stayed at this hotel two nights, about 3 nights apart. We chose it because it had a rental car office in the hotel, which made it convenient for our trip plan. The hotel got good reviews, so we booked it. We arrived on our first day earlier than expected. Our room was not ready, but the desk people were super friendly and allowed us to go ahead and eat breakfast. We even took the shuttle around Denver, some, to see the area. By the time we got back our room was ready. It did smell smoky, which surprised us in a NON smoking hotel, but we turned the AC up and the stench went away. The room was clean and comfortable. The hallways need updating but we noticed that the elevators, pool area and lobby looked updated. That evening was stormy, and we were tired, so we decided to eat downstairs in the bar/restaurant area. That was our first big disappointment. The owner and his son were trying to find enough food to satisfy the people who were coming downstairs to order. We asked about wine, but they basically only had a couple of types of beers, and whiskey. They had Chardonnay, but no reds, so we passed. We ordered cheese fries and steak sliders. The cheese fries arrived, but were cold. We sent them back and then they brought the slider (one) that we were going to share. We never got any more cheese fries. We left unsatisfied, and bought chips at the little hotel snack store to supplement. We did get to talk to the owner that night. He has not owned it for long (a little over a year) and is trying to make it better. He seemed very sincere, and nice, and responded well when we told him that people need more than ONE trash can per room. We also enjoyed the shuttle, and the driver, Max, who was friendly and helpful. Our next experience was not as pleasant. We had rented a car, and spent days in other cities, and the National Parks. We planned on returning to this location to turn in the car, then go to the airport. When we got to the hotel, after driving around Colorado and touring all day, I was informed, by Yasmin, the front desk person who helped me, that my reservation was cancelled. I had NOT cancelled it, and pulled out my emails and paperwork to show it. While I was doing that, she helped other people, and even took a long phone call, while I waited, with my email in hand. When she did get back to me, she said she was sorry, but there was nothing she could do... too bad. I asked for a manager. There was NO manager onsite, Yasmin tried to call her, but the manager never responded. By this time, my husband joined me, and we asked about Chris, the owner, who had been around all day Sunday. She told us she had no number for him, and could not reach him because he ""is not my friend"".  Honestly, there was a problem with the card that I had used to make the reservation, but instead of contacting me, and letting me know the problem, my complaint is that they cancelled it, and did not try to phone or email me to let me know of the cancellation. Had they done that, I could have solved it over the phone. The desk conversation did get a little contentious, which all of us apologized for. As it happened, a cancellation seemed to immediately appear and we were offered a room. They were going to charge us more for the room but we insisted that we would not pay more, and Yasmin agreed to adjust it. By this point, she was seeming more helpful. We got to our room, and the AC was not working, even when we turned it down low. We knew it probably was the only available room, so we didn't say anything. I'd already had enough confrontation for one night. Fortunately, it was not overly stuffy, so we were able to get some sleep. I am not a really demanding customer. This hotel has potential to be a very pleasant place to stay, as we found the first day. But, if the staff is not consistent, and if they are going to cancel a reservation without at least letting the customer know, then it is not the kind of place I want to stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wonderful Experience!,"My experience at this hotel was AMAZING! Super friendly staff; delicious and filling complementary breakfast; clean pool; clean rooms; always could find a person if I had a question; great shuttle service/ mini tour guide; just a wonderful, wonderful experience-I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Denver!

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Tired grubby hotel with a horrible breakfast,Stayed here with my wife. We first had a 'no smoking' room that absolutely stank of cigarette smke. We asked for another room and were given one that didn't smell so much of smoke but was sad and tired and slightly grubby. Although the staff were freidly enough the whole place had a shabby feel to it. There were mostly people there on a boozing weekend it seemed to me. The poorest breakfast  by far of a 3 week holiday across USA.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Friendly staff,"We enjoyed our stay here. It was fairly easy to find.  they were in the midst of changing signs to Clarion. We drove by it at first, then figured it out and quickly turned around and got into the parking lot. All staff were very friendly and helpful.  My mother commented several times that this was probably the best hotel staff she had ever encountered.  Shuttle service to Coors Field was very helpful. I wasn't looking forward to driving around Denver in the dark. My only problem with the hotel is the smell of marijuana that lingered in the bathroom, and a few things need updated.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Big,"Largest Quality Inn we've stayed at-- 9 stories with very slow elevators.  Industiral area.  Stood in line for over 20 minutes to check-in and process also slow.  6 workers behind counter with only 2 helping customers.  Check-out also slow, although no one was in line--maybe slow computers??  Room was large with vanity counter and large mirror outside of bathroom.  Good place to store extra stuff or drinks/snacks.  Good lighting in room and bathroom.  Many people with unleashed dogs in lobby/elevators and strong smell of pot.  Breakfast served in restaurant-- lots of seating.  Standard fare plus large bowl of cottage cheese (not on ice), cubed cheese, potatoes, Mexican dishes.  Large parking lot.  Nice outdoor pool with seating and small fitness room.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nasty hotel,"**REVIEWS DECEIVING..DO NOT STAY HERE** We were so disgusted with this hotel and had to deal with it for 4 days because we booked on a non refundable site! It's dirty, smells awful (marijuana is smoked all throughout the whole hotel even on non smoking floors however it smelled like urine and mold in the halls), my brothers room smelled like dog pee horribly, there's a gap under ALL the hotel room doors so you can hear EVERYTHING in the halls, young ignorant staff and simply horrible breakfast! Literally this place is meant for college kids to have a cheap hotel to party! I would NEVER stay here again..my family all felt the same way! Major waste of $..spend the extra 30$ a night and get downtown. I'm amazed this place has a ""good"" rating because it's nasty!!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel of Last Resort,"We stayed here for a large, regional softball tournament.  Unfortunately, if there were any other mainstay hotels available, we would have stayed elsewhere.  For starters, I was told that our group’s block of rooms was supposed to be all non-smoking.  The first day we checked-in -- to a supposedly non-smoking floor and non-smoking room on the 8th floor.   Once we exited the elevator, we noticed a funky smell in the hallway.  Our room had a no smoking emblem on the door, but upon entering, it smelled like smoke and it had ashtrays.  The hotel staff said that they could not accommodate a room change to a non-smoking room, so we drove 45 miles to stay elsewhere – a big inconvenience, but necessary from a health standpoint.Our group coordinator called the hotel sales manager and got us a non-smoking room the following day.  The room was better… at least it didn’t have an odor like the prior room.  The room had what appeared to be relatively new carpet.  I can also say that our room’s shower was very good – hot with good water pressure.  We were appreciative that the manager got us a non-smoking room for the rest of our trip.  We noticed that it did not appear that housekeeping vacuumed our room with their daily service … and from prior comments, it appears that housekeeping services are not up to par with what one might expect from other chains.This hotel is supposedly “upgrading” to a Clarion hotel (and according to the reviews/comments, has been doing so for some time), but overall, in my opinion, there is much work yet to be done.  The hallways and doors are in need of a complete remodel; in dire need of cleaning old/worn items replaced and upgraded lighting.  Various parts of the hotel have a funky odor – this hotel allowed (and I think still allows) smoking and it has permeated everywhere – the hallways, stairways, and the rooms.  The doors to most of the rooms look to be original…they feel old, some look dirty and some don’t open or close properly.  The hotel bar and the restaurant appear to be “half” remodeled…the restaurant side looks fairly new; the bar side is in need of an update.  The pictures on the website make the hotel look great – somewhat deceiving.  Given that most of the hotels in Denver were sold out this week, our group was appreciative to have rooms, but it seemed like everyone had a comment about something that wasn’t right, didn’t work, or was just plain dirty, smelly, or old.We heard a number of people outside of our group commenting while we were there… everything from the smoke and funky smells in the hotel, to the poor elevator service.  A number of prior TripAdvisor reviews about this hotel commented that smoking was allowed and that it was 420 friendly.  I’m not sure who the hotel is catering too, but I don’t think it is families with children.  The Denver area softball organization that has this hotel on their designated hotel list obviously has not checked out this place nor stayed here.  The hotel is in an industrial area… with the exception of a Village Inn next door, there is no shopping, grocery or, restaurants nearby.  You must drive to get to anything – which isn’t necessarily a bad thing – just know you’ll need to travel if you are looking for food or shopping.  The hotel is about 3-4 miles to the downtown area – don’t let the name “Denver Central” fool you.  However, if you’re just traveling through, located at I25 and I70, it’s fairly easy to get to the hotel.Breakfast was “adequate”… lots of choices…  Knowing the lack of the hotel feeling “clean”, I tried not to think how the kitchen might look or the food was prepared. We did not use the pool area, which looks to be in reasonable shape and perhaps renovated within the last year.I’ve read the many comments here on TripAdvisor and the hotel sales director responding by apologizing and stating that they are in the process of updating the hotel and changing over to a Clarion hotel (these comments go back more than six months).  I can’t figure out their approach – it’s as if there isn’t a master plan.  Renovating an aging hotel room by simply replacing the carpet does not justify being in a “remodeled room”.  The wallpaper in our room looked original, the fire/smoke detector was hanging off the wall, the mirrors in our room are attached to the wall hillbilly style – with the screws on the outside.  Hopefully, they will get everything updated, sooner vs. later.Not every guest can be happy at even the best situations, but I would tend to agree that many of the unfavorable reviews are spot on.  If you’re traveling to Denver during a busy season, event, or conference, book early and book elsewhere.  I rarely stay at a Choice property, but if this is indicative of other properties, I doubt I’ll seek these hotels out in the future.  For me, this is a place “of last resort” to stay.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smoked out,"It is really too bad, this place has much to go for it. Now under new management (it is a Clarion Hotel for a few weeks), we liked most things. The receptionist was very friendly, our room was large, towels etc all there. The breakfast was pretty good, too, better than most buffets at this class of hotel.Why do I give it a 'poor?' When we got to the room on our after-midnight arrival, it reeked of smoke. ""Stank"" is a better term. This was not the smell of someone smoking a cigarette but some serious tobacco smoking must have gone on for a long time. It was unbearable.The hotel said there was not room available and wanted to add air freshener to the stink. We refused but we had not choice, by now it was 1.30am and the receptionist said all nearby hotels were fully booked. We endured the night and left as soon as we could the next morning. We booked a non-smoking room and we definitely did not get what we booked and what we paid for. We did not ask for a price adjustment and none was offered. It would not have made the night more bearable. Read my other reviews, I am not a complainer. There are few places where I will never go again but this is one of them. Be warned!",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Value and Convenient Location,"We recently stayed in Denver for an event and were pleasantly surprised by our stay at the hotel. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient. The shuttle to downtown area was extremely convenient, and it was less than a $10 Uber ride back. The complimentary breakfast offered a great variety of items!  My only drawback was the housekeeping staff.We didn’t get service the first day, and perhaps that was due to having the privacy tag on the door past10 a.m.  On our last day, we decided to have breakfast and checkout at noon, which was the check out time. At 11:50 a.m. we heard knocking on our door and answered. It was housekeeping, and she was telling us that checkout is at noon. We told her we were getting ready to leave and she basically waited at the door until we left with our luggage. Unfortunately, this didn’t leave us with a good final impression.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Perfect,"First things first location was pretty good. About a 20 minute drive to most activities. Located right next to a highway barely noticed the noise, I was facing the front of the building still  a beautiful view of the mountains. Upon arrival another couple was experiencing what  alot of views said with their room being already occupied so it does happen. However our room was great and check in was smooth. They are a 420 friendly hotel as well as cigarettes smelled weed as soon as we walked into the building. They offer breakfast from 630 to 9 I believe, as well an on-site restraunt we didn't try either. Pool was just okay, it fulfilled its purpose. We did call for new towels and toliet paper 3 days into our 5 day stay and never received them so we took what we could from downstairs pool area. At night the water was usually very hot like too hott. Other than that our stay was amazing, I would recommend this hotel just make sure you call ahead to confirm your stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Convenient, good value","We spent three nights here. The room was clean and adequate. The mattress was nearly the end of its comfortable life and should be replaced soon. The free breakfast is very good, and the free shuttle to downtown Denver was quite useful. However, it was overbooked (or understaffed) twice during our stay, and we had to opt for Uber instead on those occasions. The elevators are slow. The staff courteous. The location is in an industrial and rail area, but there was no noticeable noise.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Just OK.,"We travel to Denver on a family vacation and stayed at the this motel.  Rooms were okay, beds weren't too bad, but the housekeeping was not the best.  The first morning, my son's room was not cleaned at all. We were gone from 8am-9pm and came back to a dirty room.  We both went down and spoke with the desk clerk and he was told that they could send someone up in an hour or two.  At 10pm and tired from all day, we asked for some towels and went to bed. Second morning, all rooms were cleaned but this time, our room did not get any towels.  I had to walk down and asked for towels again.  Their shuttle service was great. We used it to go to amusement park and the Rockies game.  The only problem was that on Friday night, they only one driver to cover all the service runs.  I contacted the motel and they told me it would be a while because they only had one driver.  We had to wait on the shuttle for over an hour after the Rockies game to get a ride back to motel.  Several others that were waiting took cabs or use Uber. I don't understand why the motel wasn't prepared for this by having a standby on call, especially on a Friday night.Hot breakfast was good each morning that we were there.  Hot food, fresh fruit, and a cool pancake maker, according to my grandson.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Horrible experience,"My family and I just took a road trip to Colorado, and I had our room booked for over a month. When we arrived we encountered multiple issues. First, I was given a room key that didn’t work. Next, I was given a key to a room occupied by sleeping guests. Then, there were no other rooms available to offer us. While there we witnessed to other people complain about similar problems. With so many options out there, don’t waste your time or money at this place.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Most staff is Friendly,"We arrived later in the day, and we didn't want to go out for dinner, so we opted for the onsite restaurant, big mistake for dinner, but according to my travel companion, the daily breakfast bar was wonderful, I don't eat breakfast or lunch, but the sampler platter that we ordered, was by far, the worst of any restaurant food that has ever been placed in front of me, the chicken tenders were like batter fried rocks, although once you were able to chisel your way through the breading, the chicken was ok, the potato skins were so greasy, couldn't even eat them, have no idea how long they had been sitting before it was delivered, but, but first choice was the Rueben, took 45 minutes to find out they didn't have any corned beef, for the most part, the servers acted like their guests were an inconvenience, not to mention the nasty condiment bottles that were set on out the tables, our sampler plater wasn't set down but slammed down in front of us, found that a bit discouraging. The front desk staff were wonderful, couldn't ask for a better group of people, they, if were not genuinely happy to see you and welcome you to their hotel, then they have some great actors, but, you could tell that it was genuine. Another A+ for the hotel, is it is 420 friendly. The elevators are/were a bit sketchy at times, as there were a couple of times that I wasn't sure I was going to make to my floor or not, or if the cables were going to snap as I plummet to my passing, because the elevators shook so bad. The beds, like all hotel beds are, any more, 30-36 inches high, which means you either have to carry a trampoline, springboard or a step ladder to get into bed, one should not have to pay as much as we did to wake up in so much pain that they can't walk, other than that, the hotel needs a serious upgrading, and the bar could use at least 1 hit per week with a broom, as I saw the same pieces of trash on the floor every day that we were there.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The staff at the quality INN are the bet,The hotel itself could use a little updating but it was very clean and the staff at the front desk and house keeping were fabulous. They were always friendly and willing to provide assistance. The hotel is a 420 friendly hotel and allows smoking in the rooms and on the grounds. The beds seemed a little hard but that seems to be normal any more. During a couple of days there was some issues with the elevators and for a short period of time only one of the 3 was working but by the weekend they had all 3 up and running again.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Trip to Colorado,The staff was very courteous. It was clean. They offer a shuttle to downtown Denver. They offer smoking rooms. I could see the mountains from the window in my room. The breakfast was fabulous. Dinner wasn't so good. View from the room.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Conveniently Located, Great bar, Perfect Couples get Away","I loved our stay here! they are clearly in the process of remodeling but the noise never made it to the room. The view from our room was unexpectedly gorgeous, mountains for miles. the bartenders were very nice, as well as all the other staff I met. the breakfast was not my favorite, but it wasn't bad food either. (But with Denver Buiscut Co. 10 minutes away, we always ate out) we ubered in to the city and it ranged from $8-$12 per trip depending on time of day. They have a shuttle that leaves every hour for free if you want to save some cash on transportation. Don't let the odd location turn you off, this place is a great price for it's proximity to the city.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A bit disappointing,"We were here for a conference. The hotel was full, but only one of the three elevators was working. Cleanliness was fair. The room was amazingly quiet considering that it is close to two major interstates and a train yard. The bed was comfortable. Most of the staff were friendly, but there were some who seemed to not care whether they helped us or not. There was a strong marijuana smell. Breakfast was average.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst ever,"We arrived this past Saturday after a long drive. We checked into our reservation and proceeded to our room after standing in line to get an elevator as one was non functioning. The entire fifth floor smelled like a Cheech and Chong party. I live in Colorado, I get it. But I can't smoke my cigarettes in my room, why do they get to smoke their weed? We got into the room which was stiffling hot and discovered the AC didn't work. Went back downstairs to inquire about a new room. The front desk person, Alyssa, was extremely rude, condescending and snotty. She advised that they couldn't accommodate us into the same type of room. When asked about the price difference she advised us there wasn't anything she could do. We were nice to her, polite and explained the issues. When we told her she was being snotty she replied with I don't see how but whatever. I just took the room she offered, no refund for the price difference and asked for her to have the manager call me. She stated she was the front desk manager. I asked for the manager above her then. Went back upstairs to the room on the same floor that reeked of weed to discover the new room had no shower curtain. Back downstairs to ask if I could please get a shower curtain. Back upstairs. Mind you I had some where to be in an hour. Well the phone rings and it's the front desk manager, who was not Alyssa. Did she lie? Doesn't matter at this point. I advised him what was happening and none of it mattered more then the way we were treated at the front desk. He proceeded to say 99% of the time she was a great employee. He would talk with her. He then went on to explain that it was 100 degrees outside and the heat can do things to people. So that was his reasoning as to why she was rude. SERIOUSLY!?!?! I told him I could not believe he said that and he was defending her actions. He then stated he would give us a full refund and we could leave. I said no it's fine, I have to be somewhere. I would stay. He said no. He was giving us a refund and wanted us to leave. My partner was already getting in the shower. She had to get dressed and pack so we could leave to go find another hotel. We were never rude, never raised our voices, never caused a scene and only asked for and conditioning and a shower curtain. Basic necessities. And we were kicked out. All within half an hour of arrival. I am not a complainer and I even let being put in smaller room and the cost difference go ( even though online said they had three rooms available that matched the room we originally booked two months ago). I have never been treated so badly. Ever. I stay at Hilton for work and I choose choice hotels for personal visits as my family works for them. This experience has changed that. Going forward I will use my accuired Hilton points for personal vacations if this is any indicator of Choice management style. I will be contacting corporate to file a complaint as well. DO NOT STAY HERE.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst hotel ever!!,"Why can’t I leave a review with negative stars??? This hotel is HORRIBLE.  No equipment functioning in the fitness room. One out of three elevators working ( we were on the 9th floor). Local riff raff getting wasted in the bar downstairs. Shuttle drivers trying to solicit girls downstairs. Dirty. Terrible sketchy neighborhood. Not close to ANYTHING! Keys don’t work after two days. A/C not working in the room. Candy in snack bar melted from the heat. Old, outdated decor. Looks NOTHING like the pics on the website.  I CANNOT WAIT TO GET OUT OF THIS HELL HOLE. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,It’s good for a quick trip ,"Our room was clean and beds comfortable. We got a non smoking room, but our sheets still had a hint of smoke smell. The lifts smell of smoke too. The staff were polite, a little slow to process check in, but polite none the less. The free shuttle to downtown was handy for us with a friendly driver. We just parked our car at the hotel and we were set for the afternoon not needing to drive anywhere.  Breakfast is ok, nothing amazing - but covers the staples for a Buffett. All in all it suited us for a night before flying out.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Staff,Danielle and the hotel staff and the shuttle drivers were so awesome with this experience of your beautiful mountain Vistas and all that the city has to offer. It was a wonderful time! Thank you all!!!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good place, great value","I had my reservations when booking this hotel, having read some of the reviews, but the price and the shuttle bus were an offer too good to turn down. I did read others talking about hookers and homeless people and whatnot but I have seen none of this in my sixth day of seven day stay. I was not disturbed by traffic or train noise and I was facing the railway and motorway but I am a quite heavy sleeper.The positives - clean hotel and rooms, helpful staff, reasonably reliable shuttle bus with great drivers, mostly hot and powerful shower, plenty of clean towels, secure, a good breakfast (it is the usual average fare of lukewarm scrambled eggs and ham but there are also make your own waffles and pancakes and it is plentiful).The negatives - there is nothing else around, the shuttle bus still means you are 15-20 minutes from anything, I couldn't make international calls, the halls smell very 'deodorised'. The water was less hot on one day and meant it had to be at full heat to get adequate warmth. However, you can't really take away a star for things you already knew or are inconsequential.Conclusion - I would stay again but it would need to be the same price or as low relative to other offerings.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wonderful place,"My boyfriend and I took a quick vacation to Colorado this weekend. When we got to Denver, we had to quickly find a hotel since it was so late. Not only was the room under $100, but it had an incredible view of the entire city. It was absolutely beautiful. We thought being so close too all of the highways would make it really noisy, but we didn't have a single issue throughout the night. The customer service was beyond excellent. I spoke with Jamie, Danielle, and Rowland (spelling may be off) and they were all so polite and helpful. I was beyond happy with our stay and the complimentary buffet breakfast the next morning. Would stay againWould recommend to a friend",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great stay,"Nicer room than expected. Great complimentary breakfast in a restaurant atmosphere. Everyone was helpful, especially Betty Martinez and Susie in the dining room. They couldn't do enough for us, treating us like family. This is what we appreciate more than anything. The manager was also present and hands-on almost every time we were in the lobby or at breakfast making sure all was well and greeting guests.. We were really impressed.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,First Time In Denver,So let me start off by saying thank god for the manager Edgar who was able to assist myself and boyfriend from the time we landed. We was having issue with our booking but he went above and beyond to assist us with whatever we needed . Free morning breakfast is okay then shuttle can pick u upFrom certain locations witch was good. Despite having a rough start to our trip over all it was worth it do to the fact that Edgar was so  polite and  generous . He  suggested  some places for us to try out as  first time visitors to Denver.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Denver Quality,Back at the Quality Inn Central and still impressed ! Edgar and his team go above and beyond to make sure your stay is awesome. Free breakfast buffet cool little bar. lots of friendly people and a  free shuttle to town,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY HERE,"I recenttly stayed here to attend a concert at Pepsi Center. When we arrived we went up to room and there was no air on very humid in room. We turned air down to 60 lowest setting and went to concert. When we came back about 4 hours later it was not any cooler in the room so I called front desk and ask if they had another room and was told by Lowrence  to just shut the air off and sleep with window open. I asked to move rooms or get me a fan needless to say there was no effort in moving me to new room so he gave me a fan which we had to clean before even being able to use it. They also must have long term guest stay here as the next morning I went down to get name on shuttle list and there was an older gentleman at desk checking his mail.DO NOT STAY.. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY NEW NAME CHANGE THAT IS COMING.. ""CLARION""Shuttle drivers where great.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,WORST HOTEL EVER,"I was there in November 3, 2017, it was cold times in Denver, it did even snow and had ice on the roads, the hotel had no heaters in the rooms, they know they need to but never fournished any heaters as promised me. I had to change my room 1st cause the none smoking room had an awful smell, they upgraded me to a bigger room, but there was no heating system functioning in my room, it seems some have it, others do not. They promised me to bring a heater but never did. Breakfast was basic. They smoke in the elevator, marijuana and all kind of smokes. Horrible experience. Staff mainly snobby non chalent and rude. Location of  hotel is out of nowhere, it is not central as they claim, you need a car.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dell the shuttle driver!!!!!,DELL!!!!! Dell our shuttle driver is an asset to this hotel. He drove us to down town Denver in the middle of the St. Patricks day parade and never once showed frustration or inpatience during the ride. He also saved my brother in law's phone when it was left in the shuttle.  He is truely an amazing person,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Horrible start to spring break,"Arrived late. Our hot water did not work.   After a long day of travel, all I wanted was a nice hot shower.    Hot water not working when I arrived and wasnt working in the morning.   Very frustrating.   Bathroom had mold and air conditioning didn’t work.   I will not be staying at another hotel affiliated with this brand.  Manager only apologized and said the hot water issue was because I was trying to use during peak time.  I doubt 1:30 A.M. is a peak time for showering.  Would not give me a discount on room for inconvenience.  I will be sending a letter to corporate.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE! No HEAT in the rooms! No one CARED!,Horrific Experience! Rooms are ICE COLD with NO HEAT.  Staff could care less.  It took four hours and 4 complaints to get moved.  By that time it was midnight my kids had fallen asleep and when we woke them up to move them they stayed awake the rest of the night.  Spend your money on a tent if you want to sleep in the cold!,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,903 door doesn't work,"Bad room, bad neighborhood, sketchy people. The elevators take forever to pick you up. Room 903 door jams to where you have to slide your card and jiggle the door handle over 20 times just to get in. The food is ok.",1

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Ehhh.....,"So not my typical hotel I stay in but the quality of the hotel is what I’d expect of Quality Inn. The staff is friendly and polite.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very good value and service,"The staff was always friendly and quick to smile and greet me. The room was quiet, spacious and highly clean. I could not hear any of my neighbors. The free breakfast was hot, delicious, and appreciated. The only negative was that the location was a little tricky to get to: you have to follow the signs carefully or you may miss your turn.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Needs upgrade,"Pros: Location - close enough to downtown activities         Shuttle- free and gets you close enough to downtown activities         Free Breakfast, helped after getting no sleep.         Comfortable beds and pillowsCons:  Location - at the intersection of two major highways and a railroad yard.                              Sleep was nearly impossible because decades old, single pane windows let in the sound of every passing motorcycle, car, truck and train.And also, the old windows allowed a serious cold draft across the nearest bed.           One of three elevators was not working.           NO HEAT in the restaurant that serves as breakfast dining room.           No one checked for breakfast voucher, I'd swear some of the people in there had wondered in from under the highway bridge, across the railroad tracks about 35 yards out the front door.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,We were comfortable,"Our room was clean and the shower was great. The diversity of guests was great, at least four different languages at breakfast.  Go to breakfast early.  We were there at 9am on Saturday and most things were barely warm....and it was a great breakfast (eggs, beans, green chile sauce made it for me). The location was pretty central.  We will stay again.  The bed was the BEST!!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,One of the most unpleasant stays I've ever experienced ,"This hotel has the possibility of being an extraordinary hotel. It's clean, the bed is comfortable,  slept great (once I stopped freezing), the breakfast was good, the staff for the most part was great,  free shuttle. But there were some things that made it not so great and is the reason I had to give it a 2 stars. My husband and I stayed here 3 nights at the end of December.  Every single night we had to set the thermostat at 90 and the temp probably never rose above 60. I froze! My husband asked the front desk if there was anything that could be done and she said she would have maintenance staff look into it and call him. After 2 hrs,  with no response,  he went down again. Different person, and this time,  nothing could be done.  So he asked for more blankets. No, they didn't have any blankets. So I just froze every single night. There was nowhere in the hotel I could go to get warm besides the bathroom. I would literally have to go in there, run bath water,  let steam build up and get warm. Even the dining room in the bar was cold lije that.My next complaint is that the entire building smelled of weed.  I get that its legalized in Colorado and I'm ok with that,  but it stinks. And the building REEKS!.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pinnacle Pickup ,"Absolutely the worst from checkin to checkout. Crowded from Denver game, one elevator down, questionable area, freezing cold dining room. Bed was comfortable. Don’t recommend this hotel. Motel 6 is better They leave the light on.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,James,"Been there twice, the rooms are not worth half of what they charge you and you ALWAYS HEAR I-25 or I-70 going by ALL the time!

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not Bad,"Not bad giving the price you pay. Kinda of in a weird location but centrally located in the middle of town. They are making improvements which was nice to see. The elevator, one of them, was a little creepy especially since the robot randomly said, it was going into service while we will still on it. Customer service was great. I believe Minna checked us in.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Yuck!!!!! Run away!!!,"This hotel is the filthiest most disgusting hotel room I have ever seen or experienced in my life. My entire family felt dirty after staying here one night. The entire hotel reeks of cigarettes and cannabis, the heat doesn’t work, and it was just plain filthy everywhere you looked. My daughter found a hair in her eggs at breakfast, we found a dried booger on the nightstand in addition to black mold in the bathroom, various stains on the curtains, carpet, and  bedding, as well as something that appeared to be dripping down the back door of the bathroom. It is very evident that there is not even a wipe down done between patrons and we actually purchased Clorox wipes to try to feel OK about sleeping there one evening.The front desk staff was nice upon check-in and the shuttle drivers try their best despite no communication from the front desk about times and pick ups. If you are in town to experience the 420 lifestyle and are not afraid of a lot of germs, feel free to enjoy your stay here but if you are a family or have any hygienic standards I would look elsewhere.",1

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Free Shuttle and Great Customer Service,"I must say that from the time I checked in to the time I checked out, everyone I came in contact with was top notch!  We even had a lady walking around asking us how our meal was as we ate this delicious ""free"" breakfast!  The location was easy to find and there is plenty of ""free"" parking.  The rooms were clean and the ""free"" shuttle took us to 3 different locations during our stay to include the Pepsi center, the aquarium, and the 16th street mall.  Our entire family had a blast and I am so happy we decided to stay here.  The only thing that wasn't great was the smell of marijuana in the elevators and in the hallway to our room, which is no fault of the location.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Truck Parking, VERY clean rooms.","I so wanted to give this a 5-rating, but unfortunately it was a bit noisy. We were on the 8th floor--and yes, the smell of cannabis lingers in the hallway but NOT in the room. There was the sounds of slamming doors--but noone in the halls??--so not sure where it was coming from? Other than that, our room was a great size, linens were extremely clean, it was a not warm & the front desk sent up a fan immediately. Breakfast was fantastic with a woman visiting every table making sure all was well. And as far as the reviewer saying something about this place being a 'drug hangout'--we didn't see anything during our stay to warrant that comment. Its a great place, just wish they'd figure out what that banging noise is & fix it.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"It was ""OK""","As a General Manager of a Choice hotel with 5 years straight gold and platinum awards and being #1 on Trip Advisor in our area for over a year,  I tend to look and over look things at other choice hotels as I am very picky with my staff and the way we handle things at our hotel. And this is my opinion.At Check in the front desk clerk was very nice I would love to mention her name but she did not have a name tag on. We stayed  with our points and she did recognize our Elite status with choice hotels and offered a bag of chips and a small bottle of water. She gave us direction to our room, mentioned free parking, breakfast (we did not eat) and shuttle service which is a great amenity! Her customer service was great :) When we entered our room there was a musky smell, but we dealt with it. We did not have any problems with the heat or air in our room as many reviews mentioned, so that was nice. The room was clean,although not to my standard.I did not feel the room was ""rent ready""!  Reviews are on point about smell of Marijuana from 7th & 8th floor. I had to check for myself and the minute the elevator opened the smell just hit you. But with new Colorado law, I understand how hard to control.  Although we as innkeepers have the right to charge for smoking in a non smoking hotel. Note to management authorize $100.00 for incidentals on guest's credit card to assure funds are available should they smoke in your hotel. Housekeeping could use more training in cleanliness. (Choice University offers great on line training ) Dusting all surfaces is important, there was so much dust behind night stands and also trash it was disgusting. Sheets were put on the bed inside out and the bed skirts should be washed and changed more frequently as it too was dusty and also had hair on it.  NOT RENT READY! All in all our stay was ok, although I would probably not stay at this property again. This property needs some working on, there are so many things I would love to share with management, many idea's to improve come to mind.   GOOD LUCK ON YOUR NEXT LRA INSPECTION!",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice hotel with great ammenities ,This hotel is very nice for its price with a lot of ammenities and a shuttle service that takes you several places in the downtown area. If you're not a fan of marijuana then you shouldn't stay here since the 2 top floors are reserved to be 420 friendly.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not worth the money,"I only had two nights in Denver and chose this hotel, one for the rating and the location was central to what I wanted to do.  The cost was $150 a night.  I wish I would have read the o5er reviews before I booked this place.  This is more like an $80 a night motel.  The staff was friendly the hotel was clean, my problem was the amount I spent.  Upon my check in to my room I immediately turned on the heat and then left the room for 5e evening. My room never warmed up.  I called the front desk and the said something about turning up the boiler.  By midnight my room still never warmed up so they changed my room.  I had to repack and go up a floor.  Turned on the heat in that room and went to bed.  I woke up about 6am freezing because the heat wasn’t working in that room either.  A maintenance person came to my room removed a ceiling tile and turned some valve and he said it should work now.  My room never warmed up at all.  At this point I just bit the bullet and realized nothing is going to change. I’m glad I’m checking out today.  I would not stay here again especially the cost.  Not worth the value.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Terrible marijuana hangout ,Don't bother stopping. The halls are so heavy w marijuana smell by evening your tongue starts feeling numb... in your room.   Even tho outside the hotel it says No Smoking Within 25 Ft Of Hotel. Every night around 8 o'clock the a.c. turns off and switches over to heater (central air that you can't control) and you spend the night so warm you can't sleep. Till like 4 am. Breakfast is pretty good w a fairly large variety. The rooms are moderately clean.Overall I will never come back. Its a drug hangout.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dirty. Lazy staff. Not worth your money. ,"Unfortunately I made the terrible mistake of attempting to save some money by booking a questionable hotel room. Well to my surprise the room was as bad as the reviews had states prior to my stay. I strongly recommend that consumers stay away from this hotel and that the management/leadership team step up and start inspecting what they expect. The hotel rooms are dirty, cleaned very poorly and unfortunately most of the fixtures look outdated. Please save your money and stay somewhere else. Trust me you’re going to regret staying here.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,No quality in this Inn,"Outdated, unkempt rooms, rude cleaning staff that walked in our room unannounced, broken down elevators, can't control your own heat/air & no hot water. Beware this is a privately owned hotel.  Your complaint will fall on deaf ears. You will receive a nice reply from one of the managers. TRUST nothing will change.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,I WISH I COULD RATE IT A ZERO!!!,"To Whom It May Concern:I recently stayed at the Quality Inn Denver Central in Denver, Colorado. I stayed October 6th through the 9th. This hotel was by far the worst experience I have ever had a hotel. We paid $445 to be inconvenienced, mistreated and suffer for our vacation. This hotel lessened the enjoyment of our vacation. Nothing described by the hotel’s website was true. The hotel is not a 3.5 rated hotel nor is it in downtown Denver. Also it was right near a very large Salvation Army. There were many homeless people around the area and parking lot. This was not described on their site.  The hotel workers were also rude, incompetent, and not empathetic to what was going on with their hotel. When we got to the room October 6th we checked into room 410. The room was not cleaned right at all. We checked the bed sheets and there stains. We called the front office 5 times and it took 30 minutes to an hour for the workers to finally come up and change the sheets. Not to mention they never apologized for it once. Then the AC in the room was not working properly. The AC was blowing out lukewarm air. I then called priceline.com and was on the phone with them over an hour. I called and tried to speak to a manager downstairs but they told me none were available. A Priceline representative let me know they could not do anything for me until Monday. Monday was the day we checked out. We left for the night on Friday and stayed at the hotel. The hotel room we were in kept making a banging noise every 20 minutes. We called downstairs and they said they would look at it. The banging continued throughout the night. In the middle of the night I woke up and the room was very hot. I tried to call the office and no one would answer. When we got up we called again and they sent a maintenance man to room 410. The man checked the vents and told us there is nothing he could do because the AC was too old. He said we could open the window and he brought in an old fashion fan. I then called downstairs and told them this would not work for us. The employee at the front was very rude and said “come get a key to a different room.” We went down and got the key to the new room. The new room was 309. We checked out the room’s AC and it was working. We started to move things to the other room when an employee called room 410. He said “are you bringing the key down?” This was done in a rude condescending manner as if we were putting him out or bothering him by having him do this job. My boyfriend took the key to 410 down. When we moved all of our items to room 309 we noticed again a dirty room and this time the bed felt as if it were 30 years old. The bed was rough, lumpy, and the springs creaked horribly. We decided to stay and deal with it because dealing with the front office was a complete hassle. In the middle of the night the room was blowing out hot air. In the morning I went down and told the employee the AC in room 309 was not working. She said that they turned the AC off all night! We were never notified of this and I told her and she did not care. We again dealt with this because once again the front office did nothing for us and every time I asked to speak to a manager they told me they are not available. Our final day in Denver we came back to the room around 8:30pm. When we got to the room the key did not work. We went down and talked to Randall and he gave us a new key to 309. We went back to room 309 and again the key did not work. We went back down and Randall did not help him because he was busy on his phone. Our stay was the worst by far and it lessened the enjoyment of our vacation. $445 was money thrown away just to be put through misery by the staff at the hotel and the rooms. We've stayed at cheaper places and the service and overall quality of the rooms was much better. I would not recommend anyone stay here and their website should be updated because everything on there is a lie. This was the poorest customer service and should be used as every example of what not to do in a hotel business. I usually never leave complaints or bad reviews but this was extremely horrible and Quality Inn Denver Central should be ashamed of themselves.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Ew, keep driving! ","We were in Denver for my birthday last weekend and we had booked this hotel. Their ad says newly remodeled, but if this newly remodeled I shutter to think what it looked like before. Just from pulling into the parking lot you can tell this place was going to be a dump. There were people camping in the parking lot, the roof is peeling off in places, the trashcan is full of mattresses, and the fence is beat to heck (pictures in comments). We tried to get a refund because this is no 3 star hotel and they tell us too bad, so we decided to look around. We went to several different floors and every single floor the carpet looks like somebody had drug leaking garbage bags across it! On the floor, there was even a cake smeared across the carpet. At this point, we decided that even though we couldn't get a refund leaving and going to a different hotel was going to be cheaper than bringing this filth home! I wouldn't stay here if my car broke down on the highway. I would sleep in my car.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Was nothing I read for reviews,"We arrived at the hotel early in the morning. We called to see if we could check in early or do they have a room. We were told no. We found a spot in the lot to sleep. A couple hours later I went in the hotel and talked to Alissa and explained our situation. She said all I had to was sign up for the hotel program. We were in a room in minutes. Once we got to our room, I seen right away the reviews I had read reviews, looked at the pictures. The hotel was nothing I read or seen. The room over looked the highway and the industrial area. No mountain view. The room needs up dating. The cleaning of the room was horrible. Nothing seemed cleaned but the sheets. We asked the cleaners if they could clean our room one day. We made the beds and left. When we returned they had remade the beds and left. They did not even vacuum or wipe any thing. We cleaned our room. There was a gem show that week at the hotel. We were not told when making reservations. We could not find parking in the lot most days. We paid a lot of money, not to be able to find convenient parking. We had gotten a flat tire when we did find a spot in the hotel lot. I walked a round the lot one morning, I could not believe all the nails, large screws and other sharp objects in the hotel parking lot. I got up early and went to get coffee. At 6 am the elevator was gross. I was told because of the gem show, I had to wait for breakfast to open. They usually have it out, but they don't want to spend the money for all the extra coffee. I was there for vacation not the gem show. Another way we were inconvenienced for all the money we paid. The elevators and lobby area at 6am were disgusting. They never looked like they ever get mopped, the hallway leading to our room never got vacuumed the week we were there. The grey dust a long the walls was gross.  You didn't want to touch anything. One night I used the lobby restroom. There was NO toilet paper at all. I went to the counter to inform someone. The worker Rollin was on the phone. so I waited and waited and waited. Rollin never even acknowledge me standing there. Not even I will be right with you. Nothing. His call was not that important. They were just chit chatting. I walked away. I was not impressed with the staff. I would see them on their phones. Another day I wanted to get some information from the front desk,  I walked up to the desk. I was the only one up there. Rollin looked at me and walked away. I stood there a few minutes. Rollin was not doing anything. He never asked if I needed help. Someone came from the back and seen me, came up to assist me. Rollin was no help at any time of our week long stay. The staff need training from Alissa. They need new cleaners and some hotel up dates.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hits and Misses,"Here for business. Fellow travelers, this was not a restful or quiet hotel. Pluses: friendly staff, especially the drivers for the free shuttle service (quite punctual). This service is a big bonus. Breakfast, better than the norm with delicious and pretty hot green chile, served in the hotel restaurant with NO TV playing. Gold stars for that. 3 elevators, weight room, new wellness services. International crowd, families and seniors, who were good for interesting conversation.  Very clean room, good beds. Drawbacks: Pot smoke wafts through the halls even from no-smoking rooms. Maybe this is a universal situation in Colorado now.  I reported shower problems first day and they were not addressed. Some towels had stains, loose parts in the shower, and my comforter had burn marks. Housekeeping skipped my room one day and did not pull the door closed on another. I popped it right open upon my return. Doors here have to pulled very hard to lock but there are gaps under the doors, so this makes for noise that is frequent and audible.  Pretty dubious younger and/rough clientele during my multiple night stay....some folk who were rowdy, with no security patrol in sight. Worth the investment, I think.  Hotel is close to freeways and frontage roads so traffic noise is ever-present. I used ear plugs every night.  One restaurant in hotel, one next door and then that's it. No other shops withing safe walking distance. Despite the easy access, hotel is tricky to get to approaching from one direction in particular so look at your map very closely before trying to find this, esepcially if coming in at night. Conclusion: I will be pay more for better lodging next time I come to town.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Three Years Later and the Place has gone Downhill,"Just spent 5 days at the Quality Inn Central Denver and I agree with the preceding 2014 review criticizing the restaurant.  Moreover, the hotel is starting to fall apart; bathrooms with rusty fixtures, mildewed shower curtains, stained paint in the bathroom.  The maid service puts in a very minimal effort to make beds and vacuum rugs.  I even found a needle and a wallboard screw on the carpet.  There was no coffee for the in-room coffee maker for two out the 5 days.   There are very poor parking accommodations.  One of the three elevators probably couldn't pass a safety inspection since it creaks and bounces up and down as it moves between floors.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Upgraded Rooms and (Some) Staff,"I've stayed at this Quality Inn off and on for at least 20 years (always in September). This is the nicest the hotel has been in all of those years. The additional service of providing a microwave/refrigerator in every room is much appreciated - in the past, if the staff liked you, you might get an old, dirty, microwave/refrigerator; now, the appliances are clean and are provided to all rooms!  The beds are wonderfully comfortable; the previous awful bed covers and curtains have been replaced with nicer ones and with a duvet. The rooms and bathrooms were clean (a great change from the past). It was wonderful that the window opened a little in order to have fresh air. The air conditioning system worked well and was not intrusive with respect to sound. Some of the furniture is in need of repair, but it is my understanding that the furniture is also being upgraded.Downsides: If I were going to fault anything with respect to the employees, it would be the one person at the front desk who was totally non-responsive (don't ask Stephanie to do anything for you because you will not receive a response). Danielle (front desk) was the most efficient and helpful - I was fortunate enough to have most of my staff-experience with her and her very efficient manager. The Fabreze smell which permeated the lobby and the hallways was unpleasant, but it did work to cover the marijuana odors (for a few hours) - it would be much better to use something like Ozium for this purpose. The only other downside is the water pressure available for the bathroom sink - it takes twice as long to brush ones teeth or even fill a cup; I realize that Denver has some major water usage laws, but the water (saver) which must have been attached to the sink went far beyond the laws.With respect to the restaurant and bar - the restaurant had very sporadic hours and the food was low quality - we had our meals offsite (even though the breakfast is free for guests, it's worth paying to have quality food (Village Inn is just next door); the bar overcharged us on our first night there and we never went back.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Ugh!!,"i don't even know where to begin. i asked for a room on top floor and in quiet area. they gave me a room on 7th floor so i could hear the person above me pound along the floor all night. AND be sure to request a room that faces west or the parking lot. otherwise, you will hear the traffic from I25 and I70 ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT!!  it was horrendous. i chose to stay in room because i become immune to the noise but friends complained they couldn't get any peace and quiet and had to switch locations. also, be aware that they allow dogs in this hotel. that doesn't mean that the dog owners are responsible and pick up after their dogs outside. there are no dog bags provided so why bother?   you smell smoke from cigarettes and marijuana almost daily as soon as you leave your room.  there is an onsite restaurant.  ok food but mainly sandwiches. there is a place next door that is called the village in (compares to denny's). best of all, they had a gem and mineral show that was taking up 75% of the parking lot. you either had to park along the street or above in another business parking lot. the hotel is located conveniently to the interstates- that's a pro and a conthe breakfast is typical with waffle maker and various other items that are typical of hotel buffetsthe room was comfortable although not extremely clean. i see they supposedly had a remodel??  never really noticed this. the hotel staff i dealt with was friendly enoughthe hotel is located in a very industrial section of town.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NON SMOKING IS A FARCE,"We reserved a non smoking room.  Our room posted a notice that should we smoke there, we would be charged $150 cleaning fee.  The whole hotel reeked of smoke.  No escape!  Location is hard to get to.The breakfast was great.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Drug use by night manager,"The night manager not only smelled of marijuana but had white powder around his nose and kept sniffing. He seemed confused when we asked for a different room because our tv had ""no signal"" such a horrible experience, we left with 2 more nights already paid for. Save your money, stay anywhere else.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,perfect hotel,man this place looked a little old from the street pulling in but once we got inside we were very happy. Staff went above and beyond while accommodating us everyone was smiling it was a great experience. Edgar the manager was awesome !,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,perfect hotel with great staff,"We stayed here while attending a 3 night concert at Dick's Sporting Good's Arena. Everything was perfect. The rooms were clean and nice and they provided us with a cot which was super convenient. The owner Chris couldn't have been nicer. We had a lot of time to kill in between check out and our flight and they were extremely hospitable to us during that time, in addition to the entire weekend. They also have shuttles that take you where you need to go. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that needs to stay in the area.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Bad experience ,"We booked in on the 4th September 2017, for two nights.The name is quite deceiving, its not Denver Central , feels more like Denver industrial area.The room was filthy in the corners, not what we expected.We went for drinks and dinner downstairs , the person working the kitchen , her name is  Neomi Lopez, very rude, they quickly offer our food for free, which is not what I wanted and expressed that to them. They insisted and we got zero charge, but its the opposite of how to deal with a problemI wanted to speak to a manager, I got the feeling that they all covered for each otherThe bathroom is something else, very dirty , old hair on the toilette and basin.The shower has no pressure, and if you use water from another tap, expect to burn in the shower !!The window is stuck in the room, you can see it's past it use-by date, I could only get it open a few centimeters.The morning of the 5th, as we went downstairs around 10:30am, I think he might be the owner or manager, but he had a few friends in the bar area drinking beer.At around 12:30 I went into the bar, he poured me a beer, very nice guy.Later the evening I tried to order food, the room phone didn't work.I used my mobile , after my second call, I managed to place an order.They never called to let me know that the food was ready, so after 35min , I went downstairs , as I stood by the bar , I was watching the staff.The owner / manager took a used beer glass from a guest that was finished , rinsed it quickly, poured another beer in it, and proceeded to take it to another table for another guest, absolutely disgusting.I have to say, he was very drunk, stumbling a bit.Waited another 10 min, got my food and went to my room.The cleaning staff took all our soaps, complimentary stock on the second day, and didn't replace anything!My general opinion is, the staff , management is a joke, this is a classic situation of bringing in Gordon Ramsey to save this place!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,5 nights in Denver,"This was our first time in Denver and we stayed at the Quality Inn and had a comfortable stay. Everything was great. Reception Staff were welcoming, We had a nice big room (with Air con) that was comfortable and clean. It was at the rear overlooking the pool. The complimentary breakfast was really good and had a wide variety: Such as Eggs, Sausage, bacon, ham, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, waffles (Very popular), Toast, Chili, fresh fruit,  muffins, and oatmeal. Also Coffee and a selection of Juices.Coffee was also available in the lobby all day and a variety of snacks are available for purchase in a small pantry. The hotel is also centrally located just off the intersection of I-70 and I-25 which makes travel to all other areas of the city fast and fairly easy. We didn’t try the restaurant at night but the bar had drinks at a decent price.As this hotel on outskirts of Denver, there is not anything around the hotel so the courtesy shuttle is a must.We took advantage of it to explore downtown Denver. It dropped us off and picked us up on the 16th Street (by the clock tower) as there were many things to do along the 16th street area.The pool was clean with a decent depth.We had a very enjoyable stay. No issues in staying at the Quality Inn again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Um. No. ,"Specifically picked this hotel because of price, location to Interstate, and it's ability to accommodate a car pulling a trailer.  By Denver standards, this hotel is reasonably priced.  Denver isn't cheap. When we arrived we discovered that the area that we could have parked in had a large tent on it. There would be more tents built.  Starting the next morning. At 7am. Think saws and jackhammers. We ended up having to park on the road.  We weren't left feeling particularly secure with regards to the vehicle.  The hotel isn't very clean outside of the lobby and bar area. Our hallway carpet was covered with stains. Our room smelled like something I can't quite describe.  At one point we thought we smelled pot coming through an air vent.  So much for a non smoking floor. This hotel is in dire need of an upgrade. Spend and extra $25 and stay somewhere nicer.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Decent hotel with expected amentities. Leo Damillini kansas,Decent hotel.  The room was clean but had a strong smoke smell even though we were on the non-smoking floor.  Maintenance ran a filter fan in the room but it didnt help.  They said the smoke was coming from the floor below or the stair wells.  The morning breakfast was good but very busy.  We took the free shuttle to the Rockies game although the shuttle schedule is confusing.  The shuttle driver said they would pick up when there is a van full ready but some people had been waiting over an hour to get picked up 5 miles away.  The fitness room was closed.  The pool is very simple and the hand rail was broke.Leo Damillini kansas,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The shuttle and price- not a bad choice,"A buddy and I booked this hotel while attending a Rockies/Braves series. And unlike some people, I actually checked where the hotel was located so I knew that it was not located where most people consider downtown area. And even the price, I knew it was not on 16th street.  But overall the experience was nice.  You cannot get as close to downtown for the price and still have shuttle ready at a call.The hotel did look aged and is in need of an update. However, the room was very comfortable and clean.  There is not anything, that I would want to venture, around the hotel so shuttle is a must when staying.This was our first time in Denver and knew nothing about the area.  The shuttle driver, Lisa, was very helpful in finding places and dropped us off where all the action was happening.  Plus, they told us exactly where to be when we wanted to return to the hotel.  She dropped us off in the main downtown area around noon and we did not call for pick-up till the baseball game was over.  Many things to do along the 16th street area.>One note that I did not like about the hotel experience-  Upon arriving by plane, we were told to ride the light rail tram to 38th and Blake station and call the hotel for shuttle service. 38th and Blake station is just a rail stop with absolutely nothing around.  Nobody works the station nor and good place to wait for a ride.  In fact, there is some make-shift homeless boxes just over the hill.  How come we could not ride just a bit up the track to Union Station is beyond me.  Had it been my wife or children making a similar trip, I would be pissed that the hotel lets customers stand where no security of any kind is present. So beware!!--- Going back to the airport we got Uber to drive us rather than chance the homeless drop off point.>The breakfast, which is included, was weak.  Instead of sausage or bacon for breakfast we had ham slices. They were in water and looked like it was out of a can.  Had the same ham the entire three days.  All I can say is that it must have been a very large can. The orange juice tasted terrible like it was Orange-ade instead of juice. Everything else was about average.>Before staying at this hotel check out the location.  It is not in the main downtown area but is close. This way it will not be a surprise where the hotel is located.  How a person can claim they did not know where the hotel was located is beyond understanding.  >Overall an average hotel with a great shuttle service and friendly staff. Plus a price, with the services provided, that cannot be beat for the area.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Convenient, clean and great service ","I recently stayed here with family while exploring the area. LOVED this hotel- I was concerned about the reviews but had heard new owners took over and were making lots of changes- we were NOT disappointed! We were treated well from the moment we walked in (smiles) the room was CLEAN and well appointed, beds and linens new, comfy and good quality. The gym was adequately equipped and clean- not crowded - just enough for our needs. Pool was fine and clean; kids had fun - was told they were replacing pool furniture - Free shuttles to many area events - really a nice hotel that keeps getting better! Not the Ritz but we were not expecting that... VERY HAPPY with our stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Stay Away,"My wife and I used Priceline to get a so called 3.5 star hotel in Denver for the Zac Brown Band concert. Priceline selected The Quality Inn Denver, and unfortunately, it was the absolute WORST hotel we've ever stayed in.The facility was run down, dirty and right out disgusting. There was broken patio chairs and trash scattered about the pool area. The carpets were black with dirt and wear marks throughout the entire hotel.In our room there was tiles missing from the bathroom, an entire ceiling tile missing and the shower wouldn't work. The so called arcade had every game turned off, covered in dirt and was being used as a temporary spot to store tables, chairs and whatever else the could store there. Oh, and by the way, you had to walk through the arcade to get to the delapadated pool.The entire hotel smelled of smoke on every floor, to include our ""No smoking"" room, which obviously had been smoked in due to the cigarette burns in the furniture. We use Priceline quite often as our kids play travel Baseball, but if this is a 3.5 star facility in their book, we'll no longer use them.Save yourself the headache, DO NOT STAY HERE.",1
