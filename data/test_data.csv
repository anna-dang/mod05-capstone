"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Absolute stunner in best location,"I have stayed at the siren multiple times - I adore it. Its gorgeous on every level with no detail overlooked. It's not basic - it's curated. When the outlets are open they are incredible-- I love Karl's for late night French fries, the candy bar for the coolest bar in town, lobby coffee shop is excellent. Highly recommend The Siren for anyone that appreciates style, substance and service. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Wonderful,"Had a great time at The Siren Hotel. The lobby is one of the most AMAZING lobbies I have ever seen, looked like it was out of a scene in The Great Gatsby. The hotel bar, The Candy Bar, is very unique place with exceptional decor, design and ambience. Great for a couple’s night out. The rooms are clean and newly renovated and furnished while maintaining the historic charm of the building. Can’t beat the location, walking distance to all of Detroit’s downtown cafes, bars and restaurants. Overall a great place for a couple to spend a weekend",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautiful hotel,"The Siren hotel is located in the heart of downtown Detroit. The hotel gave me a Miami in the 50’s/60’s vibe!!! It was beautiful, and CLEAN! The staff was very friendly with fast service! Would definitely stay again!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"5 stars, Best Detroit hotel!","Had a great time at The Siren, a building I remembered was vacant most of my life. It is now renovated to a high standard, very comfortable, and perfectly located for having a wild night in Detroit Rock City.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Amazing,"Great hotel,Danny at the front desk was amazing and very helpful with nearby attractions/restaurants around town. Thanks Danny for making our trip to Detroit one to remember!Very comfortable beds and modern interior.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Beautiful Location, close by to most things downtown","Had the pleasure of spending a night in one of the most unique hotels I have ever visited. This hotel has a beautiful, unique interior with a speakeasy type bar, and coffee shop downstairs. Highly recommend!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Very Cool Hotel!,"This was my first time in Detroit, and I was looking for an upscale and trendy boutique hotel to spend a night.  I am glad I chose the Siren Hotel, as it was exactly what I was looking for; friendly service, great design, and walking distance to some great shopping and nightlife.    I highly recommend staying here if your travels bring you to Detroit.  ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,The company you keep....,"It goes without saying the charm and design of this hotel makes you feel really great, immediately. But during this pandemic time of stress and worry, to come in off the street and feel immediately safe and at home with humor and ease, from first contact with Eric, the guy at the desk, with a natural humor and charm, unrivaled among many of my great hotel stays, to every face beneath a mask as I came and went for three days somehow managing, at a distance to impart welcomeness and friendly kindness really left an impression. I’m so grateful for a place that finds the people that turn a good experience into a stellar one. I will go out of my way to support this and their other hotels whenever possible.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,caring and compassionate,"when i called the siren hotel with a non essential question while the hotel was shut down due to governor whitmer's  shutdown order. I was instructed to leave a message and they would get back to me. and just like everyother time i have dealt with the siren hotel they put my wants and needs #1, i received a phone call with in the hour from a siren hotel worker and the man i spoke with answered all of my questions. how cool, can't wait until my next visit, i would not even consider staying anywhere else when i visit Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Concert,"Upon arrival, the hotel was a super cute boutique style hotel. But when we got to our room, I almost ran into the bed it was so close to the door. Room wouldn’t cool down, the manager had to force a window open and hold it open with a roll of toilet paper. The tv didn’t work so we had to use our own Netflix account. Our bed was tiny, My husband is 6’1” and we had a full size bed(I requested a queen). The room was maybe the size of a master closet.",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Valentine's Day visit,"Had a wonderful stay! The staff was attentive and welcoming. It was a very chilly day and wish our room was a bit warmer, but the blankets were cozy and the shower hot! We ate at Karls and enjoyed a great sandwich and beer. We will be back!",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great in so many ways,"The warmth of the people and the atmosphere was noticeable as soon as we arrived. The lobby and the bar and the restaurant are all so cozy, cool, and comfortable and everyone working there was easy going and super friendly. The sheets, blanket, pillows and bed were each soft and felt amazing. The giant and gorgeous bathroom was a pleasure and even though the rooms were small, they felt great. The only real problem was that the t.v. there is terrible but there is so much to do around there anyway, not a huge problem. And the location of the Siren is perfect. Right next door to a people mover stop, a short walk from The Guardian, the river, the Michigan building and so many great places to eat and drink as well as so much beauty all around. Loved it.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Too many other options in the area,I get that this hotel is trying to break away from the norm of the large chain hotels but there are quite a few things that just don’t work. The lobby is cozy with couches and a bed and the Candy Bar is located off the lobby. The Candy Bar is a nice place to grab a drink before or after a show. The staff were friendly and valet is available ($34 a night). The hotel room is small by any standard and while the bed was comfortable it’s very low to the ground. There was a small cabinet to hang clothes but no drawers. The TV didn’t work during the evening but was fine in the morning. The bathroom was large (this was a handicap accessible room which wasn’t requested) but there were no shelves and the counter space around the sink was minimal. There isn’t a lot of privacy since you can…,3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Charming hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Siren Hotel. The building is really fascinating. We went up to the top floor and, in the stairwell, you can see the original outer wall with Wurlizter Building still there. That was really cool.  The lobby is incredible in that people actually hang out in it. It’s wonderfully furnished and you can sit and have a coffee and read in a comfortable environment.  The staff is great! Wonderful front desk stag and the staff member who brought us a mini fridge truly was a delight. You could tell she liked working there.  The rooms are tiny which was not a huge deal but the bed was definitely not a queen as advertised. We paid for the 3rd tier up and it was definitely small. The bathroom is gorgeous. The tile work was incredible.  We did not go to the…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Delightful Experience,We stayed at the hotel for a few nights for a couples weekend. It was wonderful. The location did the trick and allowed us to ditch our car. The look and feel of the lobby and rooms adds great character.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Siren Hotel,"This review is overdue, but I loved my 2 night stay here. Starting with the valet, he was so helpful and friendly, it started the trip off wonderfully. The Front Desk staff was also lovely, and had a warm welcome for me. The lobby is truly unique - Instagram can do all it wants, but in person is best. I really enjoyed my room, on the 10th floor with an interesting view, enough space and an amazing King size bed (I LOVE the blanket on the bed). The shower was sexy and spacious, beautifully designed. I had everything I needed in the hotel. I checked out the Candy Bar, which I am claiming as the coolest bar I have ever been too. Great vibe, unique look and delicious cocktails. I also checked out Karl's for breakfast which was PERFECT - impeccably designed with a retro look, awesome…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Character!,"We loved our room, we only stayed one night but it was very memorable.  Amazing character in the decor, the front desk was so helpful. And roku in the rooms so you can watch anything just like at home.  Would absolutely stay again.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,An Incredible Experience,"This is one of the most underrated hotels in Detroit. The staff is amazing, the ambience is on point and there are tons of Instgramable areas for you to feel like you're in another era.   The rooms are on the smaller side, however, you don't need much space when you should be out exploring the wonderful city of Detroit. Even so, if you wanted to stay in, there's a bar straight out of the prohibition era that is sure to spark excitement, two restaurants on site to get some grub and a coffee/bakery stand for your cafe needs and feels.   Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the Detroit area or for someone who needs a staycation.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great boutique hotel in the heart of downtown,"Great front desk reception.  We were warmly welcomed and offered some tips on where to grab lunch. Room was great.   Also, it means a lot that we could easily get our car out of valet so early in the morning so we could get to airport on time.  The nice lady that delivered the car deserves a raise for being out there so early, in the cold, with a warm smile.  Thank you.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Downtown Locale,"The Siren wound up being a great spot. Downtown is not as eclectic as other parts of town but it was clean, safe, with enough to do.  The hotel itself is super cool. Great staff. Coffee bar downstairs was a nice feature. The room was stylish. A bit on the small side with no chair but that was OK.  A couple of things...staff should probably develop a fact sheet of hotel amenities like what the Roku pin # is and that the YMCA down the block won’t charge for guest passes if you are staying at the Siren.  The Craft Brewery down from the hotel is good (Beer is good, food not so hot. At least the wings I had) and there are a couple of nice coffee shops within walking distance. Roasting Plant was my go to.  The food scene downtown seems pretty Americana. Not a ton of ethnic options.…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Perfect hotel for a night on the town,"The Siren provided the perfect place to stay for a night out on the town. The hotel is walking distance from the best Detroit sports arenas, concert venues, bars, casinos, and clubs. While searching for hotels in Detroit, I stumbled upon a wonderful piece by Vogue magazine about the Siren hotel. When I called to get information about the hotel, Kaleigh was pleasant and knowledgeable, making it easy for me to book my stay. Upon arrival, I was awe-struck by the unique and compelling decor. Kaleigh checked me in and even recognized my name and voice from our phone conversation- so welcoming! The $30 valet was well worth it, giving us the opportunity to freely explore what the city had to offer. ""The studio"" room was exactly what we needed from a hotel. The bed was just the right…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Not A Full Service Hotel.  A triumph of style over substance.,"Booked over the Christmas holiday.  The building has been beautifully restored.  Unfortunately, some services you might expect in a full service hotel were missing.  No coffee available Christmas morning, no in-room coffee maker.  No food available in the hotel Christmas day.  I was promised a list of restaurants that would be open nearby, it was never compiled or provided.  Our room was not serviced on Christmas day.  I understand that people don't want to work on Christmas day, neither do I.  But if you are in the hospitality business, this has to be solved.  I expressed my disappointment at checkout, and received consideration on my bill.  For this I am grateful.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Not great,"Our stay at the Siren was okay but nothing amazing for the price. We booked a Chamber Superior room which was supposed to have a queen size bed but when we checked in, the bed was definitely not queen size (it was a double/full). We went back to the lobby and informed the receptionist and she told us there was a queen bed in that room- this simply was not true though, I know the size of a queen bed and the one in our room was not a queen. We ended up changing rooms to one with a king bed for extra money, which we weren’t pleased about considering all we wanted was a queen bed and didn’t want to spend the extra money. The room we switched to was on the 11th floor which was nice but it was a bit musty smelling. The bathroom amenities are minimal (e.g no cotton balls or q tips like…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Not the best.,"Hotel itself was pretty cool, but the room we got was absolutely tiny. Was told it was a queen bed but the bed seemed small. When you walked in the room you are basically hitting the foot of the bed and there was about 3 feet on either side of the bed until you hit the walls. Bathroom was decent size.  Walls were thin, as we could hear people in other rooms flushing their toilets throughout the night and cars revving their engines outside. Also, when we got to the room it was set at 74 degrees Fahrenheit. My boyfriend and I like our room to be cool so we tried putting the temperature much cooler but nothing happened. We set the air to 64 degrees (the lowest it would possibly go) and left the room for about 6 hours. When we got back the room actually went up to 76 degrees even…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Treated like queens!,"I can’t remember the last time I stayed somewhere with such SERVICE! I felt like I could have asked for anything and it would have been delivered promptly and with a smile. The room was beautiful, the shower and products are top shelf. The bars and restaurants associated are fun and delicious. I definitely wish I could come back sooner than later.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,You might consider another hotel,"Cute, eclectic hotel.  Lobby is somewhat small.  In the morning, the lobby was very busy and no where to sit most times.  Check in was a breeze.  Entered our room and immediately noticed a used tissue on the floor.  The television had been left on and it was apparent the carpet hadn’t been vacuumed.  The rooms appear to be a bit small, so consider reserving a room with a king sized bed.  The room size might be a bit larger and layout not so cramped.   I’m use to cable/satellite television.  Not opposed to Hulu, Sling, etc, but perhaps there should be brief instructions on accessing network television. The shower was definitely designed by a man.  There was no place to prop my foot in order to shave my legs.  There was only one hook in the bathroom to hang cosmetic…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Cool spot,"Good style. Booked the ""king studio"" off of booking.com, ended up with the ""Parlor"", which was a great room - lot's of space in the room and bathroom is spacious (especially for a big city hotel). I actually thought the ""Parlor"" room was better than the ""Parlor Suite"" (the one with the stairs / loft).",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,1306 12/21,The hotel is very eclectic and different. The beds were very comfortable and it was clean.  We could not get our heat below 75 degrees in Our room which made it uncomfortably Hot. I knew ahead of time there was not refrigerators or coffee pots in the room but  it was a bit inconvenient for the price paid. I also requested champagne to be waiting for us upon check in for my birthday celebration and it was not there. It would also be helpful to have instructions on how to use the TVs because we all were confused and couldn't get it to work.  Just some helpful hints for future customers!,3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Getaway,"What great weekend we had!  The hotel has that vintage, old world feel and is in the middle of it all. We parked our car and walked everywhere the whole weekend. The staff was very attentive and polite. The rooms were small, but had everything we needed. You need to look up the history of the hotel to know why. The bed was comfy and we slept great. The bathroom was very cool!  We will stay again!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Step back into the Belle Epoque,"This is in our third or fourth stay at the Siren Hotel. We just live down the road in Ann Arbor and like to treat ourselves to a night out in Detroit sometimes. It is a beautiful venue, very well located, with gracious staff and stylish rooms. We would highly recommend it.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Wedding weekend,The Siren was the hotel chosen by our friends for their wedding guests.  We are so glad we stayed at this lovely boutique hotel!  Our room was quaint and the bed was very comfortable!  The bathroom was well designed and loved the products they provided for washing.  We enjoyed a delicious coffee in the lobby before heading out to the wedding.  My only complaint was the restaurant didn’t open until 10:00 Sunday morning so we got a recommendation at the desk for somewhere walkable nearby.  We would definitely stay again if the need arises.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautifully redone historic building!,"The Siren was a great place to stay on my visit to Detroit. Great location with walking distance to shopping, Campus Martius,Greektown, the river front and more. Room was clean and delightfully mid-century. Bathroom was huge with a really great shower. Staff were warm and welcoming and more than willing to help or give suggestions when asked. I highly recommend The Siren!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great location for shows & restaurants,"The Siren is a very quaint and quirky hotel.  Our room was clean, comfortable and nicely decorated.  It wasn't very big, but we didn't need a ton of room.  The lobby is a bit on the small side, especially when there are plenty of people checking-in or walking through to the bar/restaurant.  For us, the location was perfect for a stroll around town to a couple bars/restaurants before heading over to the Fillmore for a show.  We then walked down to Avalon Bakery for breakfast the next morning.   My only complaint was the long wait for my car to be brought around by the valet upon checkout.  Other than that, it was a fantastic stay at the Siren.  Highly recommended.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Best place to watch Groundhog Day,"I arrived to a bottle of wine waiting on the nightstand. Rooms feel vintage and new at the same time. The shower left me feeling like an old spice ad, but not smelling like one (that's a good thing). I woke up and watched Bill Murray do his thing. 10/10 would repeat.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great location!,We enjoyed our stay. Six of us came to town to check out the area and go to the Little Ceasar’s Arena. The Candy Bar was very cool - love the decor and cocktails were great!  The location was perfect for our group attending a Red Wings game and for a great neighborhood to explore.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Very Cool Hotel with a Great Location,"The rooms aren't big but they a quaintly decorated with a throw-back feel.  The Candy Bar is a memorable place to have a drink before hitting the town.  The Siren is a short walk to all of the major sports and entertainment venues.  This is a real boutique hotel so if you are looking for the amenities of  a luxury chain Hotel this place is not for you.  But if you want something more romantic and nostalgic, the Siren is perfect.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Date Nite,The Siren is lovely💕 The Candy Bar is Gorgeous and Karl’s restaurant on the 2nd floor is Great the Hotel is very nostalgic I loved it . Our room was great our only negative was the bathroom was on the 1st floor of our room and bedroom upstairs. I didn’t have a problem with it. But do keep that in mind. Other wise it’s Fabulous their is also a Coffee shop. It’s a 1 Stop Stay! The Allen’s,4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,I Will Spend My Money Elsewhere.,"With all of the great choices for hotels this one just doesn't cut it. I should have listened to the other reviewers. Our room was 75 and we were unable to turn it down. We completely shut off the system and were able to open the window and it went down to 70, but then it was very noisy. Construction, sirens and typical city stuff. The shower has no ledge so the water ran onto the bathroom floor. There is no place to put bathroom items so it is difficult to get ready for the day. The bed is very small, not even a queen size...but very comfortable.  No breakfast or coffee included. The rooms aren't being cleaned properly especially vacuuming. All of these things were mentioned in other reviews. We like trying new places but sometimes the experience isn't good. We have stayed in…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Love this hotel but it needs breakfast!,Siren is a great boutique hotel well situated downton Detroit. Rooms are funky and reasonable. However they don't serve breakfast. Just a small coffee shop in the lobby with very limited breakfast snacks. Tough to stay here on business when you have no time to go to a sit down restaurant nearby for breakfast. I also wish the toilets in the rooms weren't black. It's very funky but you can't see that the toilet is clean!,3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Weekend getaway,"The Siren has a great location! I looked at some before and after renovation pictures and the restoration of the former Wurlitzer Building from the horrible condition it was in is extraordinary! I love to see Detroit’s abandoned, once beautiful buildings restored and put back in use. Truly a success story, but it seems to still be a work in progress. The room carried a high end price that we didn’t feel was warranted with  a small, low, less than average bed, size of room or lack of amenities (no workout facility, pool, continental breakfast etc) Also the placement of the TV right next to the bed made it an obstacle and hard to watch. Why not put it above the armoire where it isn’t on top of you and in the way? Bathroom remodel was nice, modern and functional👍 Overall building…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Unique hotel,Hotel is beautiful. Staff is very friendly. The Candy Bar is a very cool place. Rooms are very small. Valet lost our car for almost an hour. This would be great for someone traveling alone. Rooms are tight for even 2 people.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great decor! Good beds!,"Very cool, chic hotel. The street noise however.... we could hear EVERYTHING on the 6th floor. Need better windows. Candy Bar is such a cool cocktail experience! The coffee was excellent too at the Coffee shop.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Fun Time in the ""D""",Everything was great - We loved the old style hotel. trip back in time. The staff was great and accommodating. The restaurants and pubs were  outstanding. Really nice group of people. Loved the old style piano bar as well. lots of fun!,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Awesome, for one person","It was a wonderful stay in a wonderful building.  However, when the rooms are that small, design becomes more important than the designers realize.  There is nowhere to put your stuff.  Everything you bring with you goes on the floor.  Your clothes can be stacked up in the wardrobe, but your suitcase, shoes, etc go on the floor.  The easiest solution, which we hope you consider, is changing the beds.  The bed frames prevent you from using valuable floor space.  If the sides were not blocked off, you could at least put your dirty clothes and shoes under the bed.  I harp on this only because it is the only thing that prevents us from staying there again.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,My Pink Fantasy Palace come to life,"I've stayed at The Siren multiple times, and it just gets more and more delightful every time, as more delicious and beautiful bars and restaurants seem to open with every new visit. When I first visited The Siren, I loved getting my coffee at Populace and reading a magazine in the luxurious lobby filled with velvet chairs and antique lamps. At night I sipped fabulous cocktails at Candy Bar, served by an attentive and well-dressed staff, cocktails twinkling in the disco ball and chandelier light. And to top it off, now they have Karl's, another beautiful space with its own vintage diner vibe, and the most delicious eats in the area --- really you never need to leave the hotel! And to top it off, at the end of the night, you climb into the most comfortable bed on earth and get to…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Weekend in the “D”,"This hotel is a gem in the heart of the city!  It is a great location to explore the city from but if you prefer to stay on site, there are unique restaurants and bars within.  Rooms are a bit small but when we come to the city, we are not hanging out in our rooms.  The rooms are quirky and very comfortable with views of the city.  If you are looking for a unique place to stay and not a chain, this is the place for you!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Thanksgiving in Detroit,Perfect location and a wonderful place to stay.  I'd highly recommend The Siren Hotel! We stayed here the night before Thanksgiving and we were able to watch the turkey trot from our window!  Very clean room!,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Cute but tiny,"This hotel has great history and adorable, vintage decor, but the room was tiny. There was no dresser, which was awkward for our 3 night stay. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything from other rooms and hallway. The location is fabulous, though, for walking to the Lions game, Tigers game and Red Wings game! That’s the only reason we chose it. Karl’s restaurant was yummy but closed on Thanksgiving. We walked to the Hilton to eat. The staff were all super kind and helpful, but we probably won’t stay there again. It just wasn’t a comfy room to stay in. It had a low bed, a small table and 2 chairs - nothing to lounge or relax on.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Very unique hotel in great location,Everything went smoothly. Staff was friendly. The bars and shops are all fun.  The candy bar makes great drinks.  Our room was clean and stylish.  If I wanted to have another night out in Detroit I wouldn't hesitate to book here again.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Sweet vintage style hotel,"This place is a gem and a deal. It is a throwback vintage style hotel. Gorgeous lobby, awesome drinking and eating options. Lovely staff. Please note that the rooms are spare and small, but sweet. Super comfy beds. Not a typical business hotel, which is nice IMO. Ask for a luggage rack.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Great, but.","Honestly love this hotel and it’s even gotten better than our first trip with such a wonderfully eclectic ecosystem surrounding it (Karl’s, Candy Shop, etc).  Both stays suffered from the same problem, however, and that’s the inability to control your room temperature.  The thermostats do not work, or the system is undersized, or something, but both stays have had issues with controlling the temperature.  This stay when we entered the room the thermostat was on 77 and the room temp was 67 and dropping.  They sent us a heater.  It’s such a shame because it takes away from the greatness of this hotel when your wife won’t take off her down jacket in the room!  Other than that, I really like this hotel and would definitely stay here again.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great place to stay and close to everything!,We enjoyed our stay in this unique and wonderful hotel. Personalized service and we would recommend to others. The rooms are on the smaller size due to the historic building but the charm and unique features make up for it.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Lovely & Unique,"I will start with my few complaints because most people are looking for those. The Hotel is not perfectly quiet, but what hotel is? Specifically, the doors next to us sounded like ours opening and closing and people talking in the hallway sounded like they were in our room... HOWEVER, this is an old old building, clearly renovated. We were not surprised by this at all so it did not hurt our visit one bit in our eyes.   My other complaint is that we got hungry about 9:30. There are options in the hotel for food which is nice, and while we were able to bring food up from one of the restaurants, we were not able to call and order, nor was room service available. My husband had to go down to the restaurant and wait and then bring it up. Just like my first “complaint” this did not…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,LOVE THE HOTEL!,"Fabulous location and glorious decor of well-curated antiques. Great coffee setup in the lobby and charming  bar, as well as fun throwback diner on the the second floor that's open till the wee hours.  Very hip vibe--not for lovers of  chain hotels that offer room service, etc.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Weekend getaway,"Beautiful, romantic hotel in a fantastic location adjacent to Grand Circus Park.   Pros: location, ambiance in lobby & room, bathroom, in-building bars and restaurant, view from room  Cons: street noise (on both nights of our stay we were woken by the sound of bottles being tossed in the recycling outside the hotel).  Neutral: service, bed comfort  We would stay here again.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautiful common areas.,My room was quaint but no view or rather a view of HVAC equipment on lower roof. No chair table to sit at and room was chilly even with heat turned up. The lobby was interesting but the rooms very sparsely decorated.,3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Would not recommend,It was a freezing night and the temperature is capped at 74. When in reality it felt like 68. We had to call front desk to get a space heater as they cap to save money. Not getting my business ever again  Also I did not like the antique look. The rooms were very small. My shower had a window and it was also freezing there. The bed was not comfortable at all. The only cool thing about this hotel was the front entrance it’s definitely unique but the rooms ruin everything,1
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,design-forward boutique option with a clear point of view,"beautifully designed boutique hotel with killer f&b options. we loved karl's (the seafood boil omg), the lobby coffee shop (they have oat milk, praise be), and found ourselves ending up at candy bar each night. no joke might be my favorite cocktail spot in america.  rooms are a little spare but I'd argue the public spaces make up for it, and it's clear the siren is constantly iterating and improving.  the entire neighborhood is buzzing, and it was unexpectedly thrilling to be in a city that you can feel actively changing virtually each moment. pumped to see what else has popped up at siren and beyond when we're back next.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Cool Hotel,The Siren Hotel is an eclectic spot.  A lot of cool decor to admire and review.  Karls had a cool 50ish vibe and the food was good.  The rooms are small but quaint.  Our room had a space heater to make sure the room was warm enough.  I would stay here again with my wife as it was our anniversary.  The beds are relatively low to the ground as we are tall people.  But overall a good expereince.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautiful but not practical,"The Siren hotel is in a fantastic location, and is a beautiful space.   The bar and restaurant are great, and every employee I came in contact with was wonderful.  However :   there are zero ammenities in the rooms.   No ironing board, no coffee maker, no alarm clock, no safe, no refrigerator.   These are basics that even side of the road motels have, and for the prices that the Siren is charging, should be in the rooms.   I will not go back because of the lack of these items.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Bed,The bed was terrible me and my wife work up with real bad back pains I wouldn’t stay here again unless they update the beds other than that friendly staff and a great location I would recommend after the beds get fixed but until then two thumbs down,1
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Nov 2019 Weekend Trip,"We checked in on Friday for just the weekend. We got the the hotel around noon and our room was ready, so big plus! The decor was very nicely chosen in the lobby and the room. The room was pretty small... Much smaller than anticipated. There were two of us and that was still hard to shuffle around. I couldn't imagine what the smaller room was like. The room temperature was a little too cold when we got there, but the thermostat was off. Turning that on was probably a worse idea because the lowest temp it would go was 70 degrees. We talked to the front desk about this and he said there wasn't anything they could do. We had to ask a fan after he suggested we open a window when the outside temps were 30 degrees. The bathroom was really nice - loved the walk in shower! The sliding…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Stay,"Our stay was great. From the moment we walked in the front door to the moment we checked out, we enjoyed The Siren Hotel. The decor throughout was a classy chic, yet slightly retro. Our room was very cozy and afforded us great views of the city. The Candy Bar on the main level is small, yet has great service and drinks. Karl’s Diner on the second level also has great service and tasty food.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Best Spot in Motor City,"There's nothing like this hotel in NYC or LA. The hotel bar, Candy Bar, is a visual delight . And the in-house diner (50s canteen vibe), Karl's, makes the best ham sandwich and cheesecake. It's centrally located in Downtown and across the street is a stop for the PeopleMover (Detroit's elevated monorail system).",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I came in for the night to see a show at the Fox Theatre. The Siren is a beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of Detroit. It is in walking distance, a very easy walk, to all of the sports stadiums as well as to the Fox Theatre and the Fillmore. I love the history of the Wurlitzer Building which houses The Siren Hotel, the Candy Bar and Karl’s Diner. We stayed in the Parlor Suite on the 13th floor. We had incredible views from our room. I would absolutely stay here again. The hotel is definitely not for large groups, or families. It is best suited for couples or those coming to the city for a show, concert or game. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Ahmazing,"The Siren was phenomenal. After scootering around Detroit and eating curbs left and right this was the best place to lay my head at night. The shower was spectacular which offered a full skyline view of the city, yes the city saw my ding a ling. Worth it. Elevators were a common place for conversation with the staff. Top Notch. Candy Room, though be it expensive, had a sweet time (pun intended). Candy Bar was delicious, definitely worth the money spent on it. Diner on the second floor (can't remember the name of it due to hangover) was just what I needed for the cure to getting kicked out of not one but two bitty bars in the 313. Would recommend 12/10 times. Beds very comforable. Yes I tried both.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Very Disappointing,"Upon arrival we found the hotel absolutely adorable.  Within hours it was not so adorable.  The decor was very cute and bougie but unfortunately the customer service was extremely lacking!  We were there with a group of people and the hotel absolutely does not want to cater to more than 2 to 4 people.  They advertise a very nice lounge area but would only let 2 to 4 in at a time, when it was open.  Not always open and the manager at the entrance was a total jerk!  He sent us to several places outside of the hotel not even to the restaraunt/diner in the hotel.  He obviously did not want our business or our money.    We requested a set of towels and some toilet paper on the second night, after the room had been cleaned and had to go to the desk 2 hours later to get it ourselves. …",1
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Stylish, conveniently located hotel in downtown Detroit","Our experience was great at this hotel. The room was on the smaller side, but exactly as advertised and fine for us (a couple and a dog). It was very clean, and the cleaning staff was very friendly and helpful. The dog policy was much more flexible here than at other hotels I've stayed at, and I didn't have to sign and kind of crazy paperwork or pay an additional fee to bring my dog with me. The parking charge was reasonable for downtown, and I could text the valet to order my car in advance, which was great. Staff was very friendly, at the front desk and at the bar. My only complaint (which is really a non-complaint) is that we had to leave early on Sunday morning and wanted an actual breakfast (not just a pastry) before leaving -- the hotel restaurant doesn't open until 10 AM,…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Retro Hip Grandma Hotel ,"The Siren was awesome. Checking in was effortless. The staff made a point to meticulously outline nice local options for happy hour/dinner. The room was nicely appointed. It was understandably small but comfortable; particularly for a single traveler. Despite the smaller size the design is still hip and updated; chill 1920’s chic. Retro /cool vibe with helpful, friendly staff. Look forward to coming back soon. ",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Customer service was poor,"Unfortunately this beautifully decorated hotel stay was interrupted by the horrible customer service we experienced. They need to invest in better management. Our parties interaction with ALL managers was horrible. If it’s just two people, your experience will probably be fine but we had a large group of people staying in separate rooms for a big celebration and from the minute we walked in, we were treated as though we didn’t belong. They obviously do not like to host large parties and we wish we would have known that going into the weekend. We were so excited to have a cocktail at the Candy Bar but we’re told that even if we came in groups of 2 or 4 having that many people in the bar that knew one another would be disruptive and against their “vibe”. Are you kidding me?!   And…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Disappointed with customer service,"We stayed in a single bed double occupancy room on the 8th floor. It was very small (2 coat hooks, no closet, no place for suitcase except on the 2 person bench seat which was the only seating in the room).  The room was clean and quaint, but it was not well maintained - the room phone didn’t work, there were no instructions for the TV, which we never figured out how to use, the hair drier was melted like it had been in a fire, and the curtains were difficult to open and close. The hotel bar does not allow large groups to come in so my party of about 15 people who were there for an inclusion gala felt very excluded. Management never provided an explanation why they didn’t allow groups and because we the person at the door knew we were all together, they wouldn’t give us separate…",2

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Mediocre property with cold service,Cons: - Tiny and dark space. Their images are greatly exaggerated. - Hair and color residue in the towels. Not extreme but not pleasant either. - Bad sound isolation. - Worst restroom faucet design I've ever seen. Extremely low and unpractical. - Poor attitude from the concierge. Poor guy didn't seem to enjoy working there but the coldness every time we ask something is really off-putting.  Pros: - Good location. - Tasteful design.,2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautiful hotel and great location,"Even if it's small, I really like the design and ambience of this hotel. The decoration is classy and chic, the restaurant, the coffee shot and the bar are amazing! Location is great if you want to walk around downtown Detroit. The only thing is that the room was a bit too small and the bed wasn't as comfortable.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Pretty cool atmosphere but...,"Here was my take on the hotel   Location- A its downtown and has the Candy bar inside of it.  I wish the bar could seat more people.  Right across the street from the Opera house  Cleanliness- D- My room had hair in the shower and someones private hair on the toilet.  Many years ago I cleaned hotel rooms for a 5 star hotel and hair was a big deal for the inspector that came by to check the room after cleaning.  Comforter smelled and one of the towels had a stain on it.  It might be picky because it was an old job of mine so I notice those things..  Coolness- A+ very cool hotel. Nice art, decor and cool hallway leading to elevator and stairs  Customer Service A+ Everyone was extremely friendly  Comfort/Sleeping D+ Rooms are not very sound proof.  Could hear the next room partying…",3

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,hip and vibrant hotel,"From the moment you enter the hip, quirky and warm atmosphere of the hotel greets  you.  The front desk personnel were very friendly and accommodating providing warm welcome and personalized service.  They took our bags and brought them to the room when we arrived earlier than usual check in time.  Coffee bar in the lobby, four poster bed, communal work tables, comfy furnishings marked this hip first floor lobby.  The restaurant in 2nd floor had good diner brunch to late night food offerings with great service staff.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Close to Ford Field and nightlife,"Hotel is very nice and quaint upon arrival.  Because of the age of the building there are some hallways to navigate and slow elevators but if anything adds to the charm.  Our room was a decent size for an overnight at an event.  Quiet and comfortable and nicely appointed.  Some small areas in the washroom could use a keen eye when cleaning.  Karl’s is a fun spot with great food options and attentive servers.  Coffee is wonderful.  Unfortunately the valet parking ruined my experience.  My car was scratched by one of the wheel wells, results from tight overnight parking and jockeying i’m sure.  I notified the hotel and stated I felt a professional buffing would fix the damage as there appears to be no dents or deep scratches.  I was given my $30 back for parking and dismissed. …",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Gem In The Heart Of Motor City,"I write this review with conflicting emotions. I want this hotel to prosper for years to come and at the same time remain the hidden Gem that it is. Décor is wonderful, Staff outstanding location can't be beat. It's central to all things in the downtown area. Pretty much can walk to all things in the area or catch the people mover right next to the hotel. You won't be disappointed in making this hotel the place you book and stay at. Bar on site, coffee bar/café in the lobby and a wonderful restaurant.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Soso, the assistant GM, was the best part of the hotel","Great location. Cool vibe. Karl's diner was a nice benefit.  Elevators and heating/air conditioning system are funky. Once I figured out the TV system, it was okay. The staff was eager to please, the beds are very comfortable.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Great, Boutique Hotel","From the moment we walked in, my wife and I loved everything about the hotel.  The lobby is comfortable and inviting.  Candy Bar has a great atmosphere, phenomenal drinks, and excellent staff and bartenders.  Karl's, where we ate multiple times, has a vintage diner/dive bar feel, with excellent food.  Populace Coffee onsite was very convenient, and the hotel is within walking distance to most arenas and a number of great restaurants, bars, and shopping.  Also, the karaoke bar, Sid Gold's Request Room, is connected in the back, and was a blast.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Four requests for heating help went without response,"We arrived early afternoon on a rainy cool October day.  It was cool enough in the room that we left our jackets on.  The thermostat was stuck on ""cool"" and did not respond when we turned up the temperature.  A personal request to an employee on the floor, a text (as directed) to the desk, a call to the desk and a subsequent visit were all followed with ""we're working on it.""  No one ever followed up with us personally to see if we were comfortable or if anything was different.  It was ok once we were under the covers in bed after our return from an evening's activities, but nothing was noticeably different during our one-day stay. The thermostat setting read as ""fan"" in the morning.  A stay in an otherwise nice, old building left us with a bad memory.",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Nice, But Can Get Noisy","The overall atmosphere is amazing.  The building is beautiful, the location is perfect, the room was very clean and inviting, and the staff was super friendly. However, I would suggest to try and not have a room right above the second floor restaurant/bar (Karl’s). They play their music pretty loud and you can hear it while in your room (the walls are slightly thin).  However, the restaurant closes at 10pm, so sleeping wasn’t an issue.  With that being said, I thought the following morning would be quiet due to the fact that they do not open until 10am, however, the music was back on (and much louder) by 8am.  Needless to say, my husband and I were wide awake by then.  The other issue we had was with the Valet.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful, but when we picked up our…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Location,"The location of this hotel is great!  You're within walking distance of most major arenas, restaurants and bars.  The rooms are not spacious like most hotels, but we figured we were there to sleep so it was fine.  The only downside was you could not regulate the heat in the rooms.  It was very warm in there and made sleeping a little uncomfortable.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Beautiful, intimate space in the city",We had a wonderful visit to The Siren! Flew in from the west coast to visit family in the Detroit area and happened to be staying close to an anniversary. Our room was upgraded upon arrival and Anthony delivered us a lovely bottle as an anniversary surprise. The Siren is beautifully designed and makes for perfect photo opportunities. Populace coffee in-house made it convenient to get a quick start on the day. Easy walk to all things downtown and a great addition to the revitalization of the city. I would absolutely stay here again on my next visit home.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,close to everything,This hotel is close to everything. Yes the rooms are smaller in size but make up for it in décor. Basically the way I look at it is the room is visually appealing and clean. I'm not there to throw a big party I'm there to relax and spend a great night with my significant other. The lobby is fantastic its like walking into a lounge from the prohibition times. Service incredible.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Tiny noisy room,"I was very disappointed in the size of the room. I paid extra for the superior room, but when I looked at the map of the hotel floor, it appeared we were in the smallest room on the floor.  Being directly next to the elevator was very noisy as well. The ambiance of the hotel is lovely, but I am not sure we will return.",2

Very comfortable , close to Ford Field (walking Distance , like one block) staff was nice and friendly !! 30 dollars to park (vale parking too, which is good)  I only gave it a 4 because the candy room charges 17.00 dollars for a  grey goose martini WHAT?? Never been charged that much , was shocked !! My fault maybe for not looking at menu.all in all , I'd go back, it was very convenient and in walking distance . For 200 a night it's a steel!!",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Love this Place,"The desk staff was consistantly friendly and helpful. I was in a 'Studio Room' which is small but still felt luxurious. Loved the huge shower with rainwater shower head, heavy 100% cotton towels  and comfy bed. The hotel seems to be the spot for night life, I was a bit concerned about noise but my rooms was pin quiet, just like I like it! Lots of dining options in the hotel and in the area dining and shopping.  Penny Red's Chicken is must and Detroit is the New Black ( a clothing store) is a must visit.  The Q line is around the corner so transportation is easy.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Not my hotel,"My husband and I spent 3 nights here. We usually stay at a Marriot, Doubletree or Hilton. The Siren was reasonable priced in downtown Detroit, so we decided to stay here and watch the Detroit Free Press marathon. For us that was not the best decision.   The lighting was dim in the halls and in our bedroom. Even the front desk and maid service acknowledged they have poor lighting. The hallway leading to the elevators is painted black with wall sconces on one side providing a half lit hallway. The hallway leading to our room was also half lit.I don't think I could recognize a person over halfway down the hall. The most lighting we had in our bedroom was to open the curtains. At night the bedroom lighting was a joke. There were two wall sconces beside the bed. They hardly put out…",2

Great ambiance and value and perfect downtown location, close to shopping on Woodward and all the sports venues.

Great home base for our trip!!!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Elegant  Art Nouveau in downtown Detroit,"As part of a Michigan road trip with two adult children, I chose the Siren because of its location and the beautiful (and accurate) photos of the restaurants and rooms.  Our double room was compact but comfortable, with an iconic Detroit skyscraper out the window.  The bathroom was spacious, and the shower was amazing.  We were missing some towels and a water glass and a staff person came up in minutes with what we needed.    That night, we went out for dinner (with suggestions from the front desk staff) to Savannah Blue (two blocks away -- boutique Southern comfort food) and then walked down to the riverfront park.    After a comfortable, quiet night's sleep (minimal noise from other guests) we had breakfast in the second floor restaurant, an upscale diner with city views and a…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Expensive for what it is; not ideal for a business traveller,"Although I was in town for leisure, I would not stay here if I were on a work trip; there is no desk in the room, no seating, and the lighting is less than optimal for working. The room was small, but fine for one person. The bathroom was very nice and almost the same size as the room.   When I arrived, the lighting in the room appeared to not be working. After I requested assistance, I learned that the lamp was controlled by a switched outlet and that the cord was plugged into the wrong outlet. The bedside lights are controlled via switches on them that look like they are part of the hardware bolting them to the wall. The front desk should advise all arriving guests about this. I find it hard to believe that I am the first person that this has happened to. When it did work, the…",3

It is located in a great little spot close to many of Detroit's awesome stores and restaurants.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Walking Distance to Detroit Marathon,I stayed at this hotel because of it's proximity to the start/finish of the Detroit Free Press Marathon.  It was certainly within walking distance.  This hotel is super convenient to a lot of restaurants as well as the ballparks & Arena.  The hotel itself is super posh and reminded me of European Boutique hotels.  I couldn't give this 5 stars because of the bad experience I had with the shower.  The previous guest must have broken a glass inside the shower as their were shards of glass that I stepped on.  There was also a used wash cloth in the shower.  This leads me to believe they really didn't clean the shower after the previous guest.  The bedroom was also in a loft which you had to climb a spiral staircase to get to.  The bathroom was on the main level which made it…,4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Heed the Siren's call!,"We loved the Siren!  The excellent aesthetic and care strikes you as soon as you walk up to the door - the lovely brass siren handles telegraph an interest in design and comfort.  The door was held open by a friendly staff member - indeed all the staff were uniformly excellent - thoughtful, polite, interesting and helpful.  The lobby is gorgeous - so much care has been taken with every design detail throughout the hotel - it's fun just to wander.  Definitely go up to Karl's and have breakfast, lunch or a late night drink, dessert or snack, in this soda fountain, bar, diner, have a drink at the Candy Bar - a very classy joint - or out in the lobby playing cards as we did one night - coffee in the morning is excellent too.

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Whenever I visit Detroit, I will only stay at The Siren","The Siren is one of a kind, and entering it is like stepping into a dreamland.  It's a world within itself; an environment that is completely polarizing to the landscape outside its doors.  Staying here is to immerse yourself in a fantasyland that typically only exists in one's dreams.  The Siren is beautiful, surreal, intimate and luxurious.    I visit Detroit often, and now that The Siren is here, I won't stay anywhere else in the city.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Anniversary Celebration & Night on the Town,Could not be more perfect if you're attending a show at The Fox or The Fillmore. Quick and picturesque walk to either venue. We were upgraded to The Penthouse and received a complimentary bottle of bubbly in celebration of our 15th wedding anniversary. Very thoughtful and unexpected! Beautifully appointed hotel. Chic without being stuff. Highly recommend enjoying a craft cocktail in The Candy Bar. Valet parking was swift and attendants were friendly. Already booked our return stay.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Loud,They put me next to the elevator and I could hear the elevator shaft the entire night.  NEVER went to sleep - literally never the entire night. I could also hear the garbage trucks right outside and this was not helping either.  Overall wouldn't stay there again.  Staff was nice which is a plus but but unfortunately that's not exactly the most important when traveling for business.,3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Sexy Downtown Hotel,"The Siren is a swoon-worthy boutique hotel full of personality and style. It's very feminine, vintage-inspired and lush, between the fresh florals, velvet lobby furnishings and bedding. The rooms have quirky art and enormous pink-tiled showers.

However, several small issues affected my rating: - The television didn't have a way to get live & local news and weather (or other programming) - a necessity when traveling! Everything operated via Roku or other subscription-based service and asked for passwords. - No clock in the room - fine if you are in the same time zone and have a working cell phone, but this could be an issue for international travelers or others. - No closet, just a single hook with a few hangers - fine if you are only there for a night, but for someone traveling for multiple days who would like to hang their things so they don't get rumpled, that single hook gets crowded fast.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Saturday night stay,"The Siren Hotel is clean and cute but the rooms are very small. There isn’t anywhere to put clothes or luggage if you’re staying more then one night. The shower doesn’t have a door or curtain, just a half wall not allowing for any privacy. The staff was also less then enthusiastic... We stood in line to check in for about 15 minutes while holding our luggage with 4 staff members behind the counter but only one helping guests. Checking out was also a tad irritating as I had to practically stand in the palm tree in order to be at the counter. The gentlemen checking me out didn’t ask how my stay was or anything, just if I wanted to pay my valet bill via the card on file. Over all the stay was not what I had expected it to be... probably won’t return.",3

My room was spotlessly clean  and unique. the bed with custom woven coverlet from Cranbrook Art School, was a dream for a great night’s sleep. Night’s view outside my window was great. I travel with 35 pound dog 🐶 who must go out in middle of night. The staff kept a watchful eye on me as I walked the desolate sidewalk out front in my nightgown & robe! The Candy Bar downstairs must be the most beautiful and romantic place in Detroit. Looking forward to our next visit.",5

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,3 Stars,"All-in-all, I mostly enjoyed my stay, the hotel and the area. Pros: The bar in the hotel is great and the restaurant is even better with fast service and amazing food. The coffee shop in the lobby came in handy throughout the day and is super convenient to grab something on the way out or to just hang around outside of the room. The valet guys were great and always welcome when we arrived to the hotel.  Cons: I live in NYC so maybe I’m used to a different kind of concierge experience but I was a little bummed out when someone wasn’t able to grab contact solution from the CVS down the street because I forgot to pack mine. Even offering to pay additional to the person who went to go grab it. We stayed for 5 days and needed laundry service mid-way through and decided to call down…",3

Room snacks are mostly local and not over priced. Bar/restaurant options within the hotel are amazing as well! We loved the design of the room as well.. it seemed small at first but then once we realized its functionality we felt right at home.",5

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Wonderful honeymoon,"The Siren is such an amazing hotel with its vintage decor, wonderful service and great restaurant/bar.  We stayed a couple of nights for our honeymoon and they provided complimentary bottles of champagne and were very flexible and accommodating as they let us check out VERY late. Karl’s had such amazing food and walking into Candy Bar was like walking into a 1920’s nightclub.  This is my favorite hotel and I recommend it to those looking for a non-traditional hotel experience.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,FUNKY,"I was amazed when i walked in to the awesome lobby.It is a mixture of old and new.There are 3 different areas to sit and chat/visit while still having some privacy. the small but very nice coffee shop is in the lobby. I was directed back a long corridor to the elevators.Each floor has a small amount of rooms. The bath rooms are beautifully decorated with older colors in mind. The doors could use some sound seals but other than that the area was quiet. They have a very nice restaurant, (Although it does not open until 10 am), and the Candy Bar-----well, its off the charts. If that ain't funky enough, go next door for a glass of wine and some great vinyl!!!",5

The Siren plesantly transmits a retro chic vibe.  The staff is friendly and helpful, the hotel is clean and smells good, the cocktail bar is nice [but very expensive] and the rooms are comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to anybody. Here's hoping for a second visit.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Quirky, chic, and very unique!","One night stay for a show.  Room was exactly as advertised and more.  A handwritten note on the pillow, large containers of luxury proprietary toiletries, 2 brown makeup washcloths (how thoughtful!). This is the refurbished Wurlitzer building (organs and other instruments) and the woodwork/doors are super heavy duty. Nice and quiet. Full overhead rain shower (oh so nice!).  NOTE: don't let the People Mover dissuade you. My window was right next to the Broadway station and it was barely audible.  NEXT NOTE: the funky shades look great, but do NOT block out the light.  Bring an eye mask if you want to sleep in! ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Boutique style hotel that truly delivers,"I absolutely loved my stay at The Siren in Detroit! I'm happy to say I encouraged two other people attending our conference to book here too and they were not disappointed! There was a little surprise waiting for me that was so simple yet so special that I saved it and I'm going to use it for our clients. I don't want to tell you what it is because I want you to have that same ""awwwww"" reaction I did! Stay here! Expect them to treat you extra special. Expect a tiny NYC style room. Try the Candy Bar and try Karl's!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Unique, boutique, loved it!","I stayed here for a few nights and had a fabulous time. Loved the 1920's theme of the hotel and the room was beautiful. Huge shower and the bed was comfortable.  Location was great for me, close to Comerica Park and Ford Field.  Staff were super kind and helpful, which was much appreciated.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Neat Boutique Hotel,Lovely restored 1920's building in a great location.  Staff was excellent.  Rooms are European style - small but functional with lovely linens.  Bathroom was top notch with the beautiful terrazzo tile.  Valet Parking & Uber worked very well for getting around the city from the hotel.  Coffee shop in lobby a nice convenience.  Karl's Diner good for late arrival meals at 11pm or later!  The hotel was busy late on a Thursday night.  They have done a great job restoring this gem of a building.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Exquisite, Beautiful, Comfortable!","My stay at the Siren Hotel located in the historical Wurlitzer building is the most  wonderful boutique hotel experience I have ever had.  The rooms were so well done, every detail was just perfect.  The staff was the most hospitable of any staff I have ever met.  The lobby felt like a living room you could hang out in for hours, reading, relaxing, and enjoying the company of staff and other guests.  The amenities near the hotel were also enjoyable.  Access to the state of the art YMCA for recreation and exercise, Candy Bar,  Sid Gold's, and The Monarch were all wonderfully curated cocktail bars that were in or near the hotel. Chef Kate has done a phenomenal job creating Karl's. Don't let the casual comfortable atmosphere fool you, the food was the finest of Diner food I have…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,One night in Detroit,What a super cool hotel.  Everything was great from the valet ($30 overnight but in and out privileges) to check in...to the room.  We were right next to The People Mover Tracks but no disruption at night.  Shower was great but the fancy sink doesn't train all of the way.  Tried to get into Candy Bar but super small and a 45 minute wait.  Went upstairs to Karl's Diner to have a drink.  Really fun place.  Would definitely stay again,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Style over Substance,"A good looking hotel with nice amenities, but not a great place to stay.  Common areas and rooms are all too small - all well designed, but an annoying amount of ""quirks"" you had to put up with.  No closet, no desk, bathroom doors that don't shut, sinks too shallow - evidently no service elevator - just a lot of simple functioning details missed,   Probably should be marketed to a narrow part of the boutique hotel audience and moved to another location.  Developers didn't do their homework on the type of boutique hotel Detroit needs right now - and it shows.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Hotel,This gem in the city of Detroit is a great way to spend your awake and sleep time.  My wife and I stayed here during a wedding and had such a great time.  The staff and amenities were flawless.  We highly recommend staying here.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,An amazing place that has become the favorite place for my wife and I to stay in Detroit!,We were on the 11th floor and had stunning views overlooking comerica park and a great view of Robert Wyland's whale mural.Our room was excellent. The snacks are reasonably priced and the bathroom was spacious and clean.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Vice President,Room too dark - very insufficient lighting.  Perpetual fan was very annoying and too loud. Could not turn it off. TV was only WiFi - no local news channel to obtain weather or local news. Bed was very low to the ground - made it difficult to get in and out of. No closet or rack to hang clothes. Only a hook on the wall that was too low making clothes touch the floor- hanger were not sufficient for the wall hook. No iron or ironing board. Overall room was not well packaged with the basic amenities.     Cute place but will not stay again.,2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,beautiful hotel; lacks function,"The Siren Hotel is beautifully Instagrammable, and it does well in the key areas of cleanliness and location. That being said, the rooms and hotel itself are less than functional. The elevators are down a long narrow hallway and the lobby has a large amount of decorative furniture, such as giant plants, low tufted stools, and an actual four post bed in the middle of the room. It is filled with people getting coffee or visiting the bar at the back all day and night. The people and the amount of stuff crowded everywhere the lobby level difficult to navigate with a suitcase. On the rooms side of things, I shared a double standard room, and it was certainly not “perfect for two” as advertised. Our two small suitcases covered almost all of the available side table and padded bench.…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Cool place - in a great area of Detroit,"This hotel strives to be funky - and pulls it off very well.  Really enjoyed staying there to experience something different from the usual Hilton/Hyatt/Marriott.  The lobby is small but interesting, and the rooms, while on the small side, have 12' ceilings and nice bathrooms so all is well.  Bar downstairs and nice restaurant on 2nd floor.  As noted, you can walk out the door and go to several bars, restaurants, the ball park, the opera, and lots of recent renovation makes this a great part of Detroit!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,The Siren was alarming great experience,"My first trip to Mo Town was a memorable one in large part to the Siren hotel.  The atmosphere and friendly staff made me feel at home each time I returned to the hotel.  We switched rooms from floor 7 to floor 6th because we left town for one night.  The windows on the 7th floor were much more quite than the 6th floor, but this was the only complaint.  I would return again if I had the chance",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Fun and fancy,"Great location, friendly staff, cozy room, great food and drink options.  Stayed for a night after interviewing for a job and really felt welcomed by the staff.  The second floor diner has amazing food and drinks.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great environment","Upon arriving to the Siren hotel, my wife and I were amazed with the friendly staff, beautiful artwork and furniture in the main lobby, and great accommodations provided to us. With Karl's and the Candy Bar on site, these two places set this hotel apart from many other boutique hotels. The giant disco ball and extravagant chandelier in the candy bar gave the added touch of class it was looking for. We will definitely come back here",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Very good, central hotel!","Very polite and helpful staff.  Lobby seemed a bit too crowded with furnishings and plants, especially when many people were around in the evening when the bar gets popular.  Our main difficulty was the very small room, without space to put away clothes, no closets at all, and rather cramped.  But this is a great location, with good views of downtown Detroit and easy access to both the Q-Line and the People Mover.   And nice staff as well.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great location...still some issues to resolve,"This was our second year staying at The Siren Hotel with a travel group from Rhode Island. They were VERY accommodating in our booking process and their customer service is top notch. A couple of our group commented that they had rooms with no view or very loud rooms, but most people had rooms that were just fine.  My own room had a couple of issues, including a sink escutcheon that wasn't fast to the wall and a loose faucet handle, and an electrical outlet cover that also wasn't attached to the wall. Just a bit of sloppiness. The room overall (707) was very comfortable.  The biggest challenge in my room was lack of places to hang clothes. Only one hook and no closet.   I'd stay here again, but I hope they can resolve these minor inconveniences.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Celebrated wedding anniversary,"+ Enjoyed the fresh flowers and nice anniversary note.  + Loved coming back to our room after a night out to a complimentary bottle of champagne.  + Nice having snack options in room (for charge).  + Room was clean  - Limited public parking nearby so you’re stuck paying $30/night for valet.  - We were on the 13th floor. Waited for the one & only hotel elevator for 5-10 min. every time we needed to go up/down  -Only 1 ice machine on the first floor (or that was the only one my husband found, hah).  - Didn’t care for the bedroom being upstairs away from bathroom. Nobody wants to go up/down small/skinny winding staircase after a bottle of champagne",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Anniversary,"The Siren is a very nice hotel. We were swept off our feet upon arrival. Everyone from the Valet and Doorman to Karl's restaurant was 5 star quality. Until the next day. The service was different, day and night literally. I want to say the young women at the coffee bar and front desk were amazing as was the manager at Karl's but the young man at the front desk was not friendly nor welcoming. When I ask could I have a late check out, instead of him responding in a professional manner he said, ""it depends on what time, 12 is the latest."" He could have said, ""Yes, Ms. I could have you ck out at our latest time at noon. Fortunately the kind young lady intervened. He then pushed through patrons without excusing himself or greeting anyone, and when we approached the counter he never…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Interesting Hotel in Detroit ,We needed a hotel near Comerica Park where we were going to a Tigers' game. The Siren came up in our search and it really looked unique. Great decor & people. We'll stay again. Pricey for a small room,4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Excellent hip hotel in the middle of everything,"Very prettily designed in new chic style. Right in the middle of everything new Detroit. Friendly staff, excellent bar, good views, good everything. Room was a bit on the small side but lobby made up for it.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,The Siren has loads of charm and good vibes,"If you need some kind of pristine cookie-cutter, mid-last-century kind of hotel or a ritzy luxe kind of place - The Siren is not for you. But if you want a beautiful, Boho kind of vibe and a super-friendly, knowledgable staff who love their city - The Siren is your place. Plus, I want to move into The Candy Bar. Beautiful little pink velvet box of a bar with outstanding cocktails. Karl's restaurant also just opened a couple days before we got there and has an excellent upscale diner-style menu. There is also a little cafe in the morning in the lobby for good coffee. The Siren is located in downtown Detroit and is near all kinds of places you want to be. The rooms are basic and a little small but very comfortable. Loved the not-so-basic decor of the bathroom and the overall…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Charming expierience,"Conveniently located in downtown Detroit. Easy access to public transportation and all of the hot spots. I would recommend this hotel.

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Unique hotel with a homey feel,"My stay at the Siren Hotel was wonderful!  I felt at home with the super comfortable bed and great in room amenities...but I was also in love with the design and unique quality of the hotel as well.

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Adorable boutique hotel in the heart of Detroit,"I enjoyed me stay at The Siren Hotel.  The staff was unbelievably accommodating and friendly.  I stayed in one of the smaller rooms at the hotel but it was perfect for one.  Great view of downtown, comfortable beds, and tons of character!",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Excellent,"We stayed at the Siren for a wedding.  We had a suite for getting ready and then our own room for after...  our stay was wonderful.  The beds are comfortable and everything was clean.  I wish there were more trashcans in the rooms as I hated searching for one, but that’s minimal!  Staff were friendly and attentive!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Stay,"A very charming boutique type hotel with a friendly and helpful staff .  The location was perfect, the rooms clean, efficient and well adorned and the vibe and atmosphere was a combination of cool and comfortable.  I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to visit Detroit!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Gorgeous Hotel and Perfect Over Night,This hotel is stunningly gorgeous and SEXY!  The room was perfect for an overnight/short stay and decor is fun and mixed of traditional and contemporary.  Lobby feels chic and sophisticated.  The staff was cordial and professional.  Location is great and walking distance to many great hot spots!,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Getaway,"The hotel is super cute. Vintage decor in the lobby, nice and clean, and super friendly staff. Our room was a little small, but had all the amenities we needed. A little pricey for the room size, but would stay again given the chance.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Exceeded expectations,"Wasn't there long - checked in at 11pm, left at 9am.  But I loved it!   Photos do it justice.  Very stylish and so many small touches throughout. Staff was great: from bartenders, to front desk to barista to parking attendants.    Everything is small (lobby, hotel bar, rooms) but it is sufficient.  Glad I was solo in my room, two may have been a crowd. Despite the close quarters and the fact that it's an old building, it felt nice and private. I didn't hear other guests and saw no one on my floor. Just perfect.   Candy Bar is as good as it appears.    No plans to return to Detroit, but if I ever do, I won't stay anywhere else.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,So beautiful!,"The Siren takes you back in time. Beautiful interior, so charming. A really cool bar that I sadly didn't get a chance to go to as I literally arrived late in the night and had to leave very early the next morning. I also loved that my room was compact. Extremely pleasant staff.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Best Friend's Wedding,"I booked a room because this was the hotel that my best friend who was getting married that weekend was staying. The room I booked was The Studio, it was cozy and great for a one night stay, or so I thought. The TV was terrible it wouldn't work it was connected to other people's ROKU accounts and required a password. I called the front desk twice and nothing was resolved. The man apologize as they were ""updating"" their systems. The people mover was next to the hotel and was very loud, which is why the tv was needed to drown out the sound. No parking options, $30 overnight valet was the only option. Good location on Broadway, needs better signage with the hotel name. The Candy Bar was pretty good and unique aspect of the hotel. The bride wanted to have mimosas in the morning…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Anniversary Stay,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay. From the moment you arrive until you leave, it was pure luxury. The room was quaint and the decor was classic yet chic. And the Candy Bar? Exquisite! The drinks were as smooth and sweet as the decor and vibe. We will definitely go again. The only thing I would suggest is that guests should be told about the mandatory valet. Otherwise it was a perfect night out for our 5th Wedding Anniversary.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Solid,Great vibe. Friendly & knowledgeable staff. Excellent service. Very cool lobby with chic furniture and a world-class barista. Well-appointed guest room (though I think you should provide luggage racks). Incredibly cute Candy Bar. Fun piano bar. Superb downtown location. Good value for your $$.,5

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Wonderful hotel with unique personality!,"We really enjoyed staying at the Siren Hotel.  We choose it because we didn't want a cookie cutter type hotel but one that reflects the downtown Detroit ""renaissance"".  We were not let down!  The rooms were clean, staff friendly, great coffee shop and very conveniently located.  We would absolutely stay again.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Very Nice,"It is in a great part of Detroit, both stadiums near by and lots of social life right out the front door.  The Hotel is classicly finished but has great modern technology to make it convenient ie. Roku TV and Room key",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel all around.  Wonderful staff.  We were there for a wedding at the DAC.  Our room was basic and overlooked the main road. The people mover went right along us at that point so if you're sensitive to noise I would suggest getting a more interior room away from main street. Nice bathroom with a rain shower. There is a coffee shop in the lobby with some pastries but nothing close by for breakfast, although there are places you can walk to.  Walking distance to Comerica Park and Ford field. Right across the street from the Opera House.   There is a people mover stop there also. There is valet parking but at $30 a night, typical for downtown. We enjoyed our stay there.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Odd hotel, great location","No food service, roku tv but can’t add channels, tight rooms, great location. Phone in the room but no instructions on how to reach front desk. I called them from my cell. Two towels in bathroom for a couple I think you need at least three. Coffee bar opens around 7am. Not free and no coffee provided in the room.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Cutest hotel ever!,"Fantastically cute, quirky, glam, retro stylish boutique hotel with great service and modern amenities. Love that you can text questions and requests and get an immediate response. Friendly staff and comfortable, stylish rooms. Love the “ambience” of the shower. Be sure to visit the live piano karaoke bar in back, Sid Gold’s Request Room for a super fun time!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Really fantastic hotel,This is a great hotel.  The rooms are small but darling.  The rooms are very well appointed.  And staff is very friendly and helpful.  I loved that you can text questions to the front desk and text the valet when you want to pick up your car.  Also really loved the bunk beds for our kids' separate room.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Lackadaisical Service,"In general it’s a cute little hotel. They turned the quirks of an old building into positives. But, I stayed from Sunday through Thursday. A package was delivered for me on Tuesday, but they never mentioned it, even when I was at the counter checking out. That’s just unacceptable. They didn’t leave a note on my account, no message on the phone, no attempt to do anything. I heard about the package after I checked out and called. Immediately, “Yes, we have it...” No apology, though they did offer to ship it. I have to wonder how they expected it to play out. Do the employees get to keep the unclaimed packages? If it was too hard to contact the guest when they were staying at the property, I can’t imagine they’d reach out after the guest left. Shame, because the hotel does a lot of…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Unique experience,"The hotel has a fantastic location! The decor and approach to the hotel experience is quite unique and refreshing! The bar is also unique: it has a great selection of cocktails, drinks and the decor is somewhat throwback to 1930's era.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautiful boutique hotel,"When we arrived, we unloaded and valet parked. The attendants were very friendly. The lobby is a little crowded, full of plants, people, and stylish antiques. It's really not like any hotel I've ever stayed in. The desk attendant was very friendly and helpful. As we were making our way to the elevator, we noticed the beautiful interior of this hotel - moody lighting, black and white checkerboard floors, and beautiful retro furnishings. It is a little spooky, I must say. Our room was spacious with few furnishings, but designed well with authentic pieces - a marble table and light pink vintage chair, brass hooks, and marble side tables. The bathroom is a real showstopper - very unique with its speckled tile and glass block shower, speckled red sink, and black toilet. There was a…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautiful Hotel with a great location,I stayed here in June to watch a production of Anastasia in Detroit with 2 of my best friends. This hotel was an amazing choice from the usual box chain hotels. The decor was really unique and I loved the coffee bar right in the hotel. What really made the difference was the service. I really appreciated the handwritten note in my room when I checked in as well as front desk letting us have a late check out and holding our luggage after check out time. A little bit pricey but the location is worth it! It's super central to everything and the night life is close enough to walk (The Belt). I would definitely stay here again if I was in Detroit!,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Lovely Hotel with Amazing Details,"The entire hotel has been carefully design so that all details fit together perfectly.  From the lobby to the room the hotel is wonderfully decorated, all the staff is super friendly and caring, the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The hotel is in an amazing location in Downtown. Would 100% recommend and would stay here again.",5

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Wonderful place to stay!  Trendy atmosphere, artsy environment, great hospitality.  I will stay there again!","This is a trendy, modern art deco style hotel with lots of hospitality and just good atmosphere. It was what we wanted and served to be a great welcome to Detroit. Room was clean and everyone was nice.  Also, located across the street from the Opera House.  It's in the center of the night life and very close to the tourist spots.  Definitely the hotel for me to stay when visiting  Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Sassy and Swanky,"Beautifully decorated, charming rooms with Italian linens.  The bathroom tile was super fun.  Great location within walking distance of Greektown, waterfront and stadiums. A little noise from the People Mover, but not unexpected for city noise in general.  Reasonable price.  Would definitely stay again.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,cozy,"Very unique property.  loved the room - cozy with comfortable bed.  great ambiance in lobby.  good location - close to Comerica Field, some restaurants nearby.  would have liked a small fridge in room.  maybe a list of nearby restaurants would be helpful also.  would stay here again.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Safe Bet,"I do love this spot and always a safe bet for a downtown boutique hotel.  Lacks some of the added frills and amenities that aren't always necessary for a quick stay and I don't mind that.  The decor and vibe are great.  My only complaint is that both times I've stayed, there were little surprise left over items from previous guests.  Maybe that's their novelty?",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Awesome hotel,"Very clean, modern, close to Baseball and Football fields, Greektown and great restaurants. We thoroughly enjoyed the stay and the hotel room. Downtown Detroit was very clean and safe to walk.  We should have stayed a couple days more to see more of the city.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Night at the Siren,"This was our second stay with the Siren. The hotel is beautifully done. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated, each one a little different then the next. We have an other stay planned in October. It's close to everything downtown. The valet guys are awesome. The staff has always been friendly and polite even when the customer is flustered. Our room was upgraded for no additional cost this stay which was awesome. You won't be disappointed with your stay here.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Perfect for enjoying downtown!,"We had a fabulous stay at this hotel. We were in town for 2 Tigers games, and the location could not have been better for all things downtown. We had booked the bunk bed room and got a free upgrade to a regular queen room. Staff was SUPER friendly and helpful as were all of the valet gentlemen.  The decor is so quirky and fun, we loved it. We will definitely be calling this place home anytime we're in Detroit!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Family Vacation,"Stayed in several hotels during an elongated vacation that included multiple cities. Our stay at The Siren will be remembered for it's charm, uniqueness, and hospitality. Great location within the city as well as public transportation, and a rate that was the best around, resulted in a great stay. We had a family of 4 in The Playhouse (room type) and while there was not much space in the room, we enjoyed it. Just don't plan on bringing a lot of luggage in this type of room. The other room types might be larger. Will definitely stay here again.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Best Customer Service ,"Found The Siren on a travel site and immediately booked. My daughter and I were attending a concert at Little Caesars Arena and I wanted to be within walking distance. What a great location. It was a 10 minute walk to and from the arena. The hotel is refreshingly unique, an experience all in itself. The staff were absolutely amazing, so friendly and helpful, they went above and beyond our expectations. Our room was not ready when we arrived which really wasn’t an issue, but we were upgraded to a queen suite at no extra charge. We will definitely be booking at The Siren when we find ourselves in Detroit again. Five Stars from us!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Perfect fit,The Siren is all around tremendous. Very stylish and comfortable. Great location. Great value and they genuinely care for their guests. The hotel group that owns the Siren gets it right in every detail. I would love it to be kept a bit of a secret so that there is always room when I wish to go back,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Cool place, sloppy staff","Pros: Cool design and decor. Comfortable bed. Cons: Elevators were in and out of service. Staff only keyed our rooms for a one-night stay. Housekeeping didn't come to our room even though we asked twice; after the third time we talked to the front desk they just said they were short staffed and when we returned, the towels had been replaced but the bed had not been made.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Stunning Renovation of a Detroit Landmark,"This is a great boutique hotel!  Beautiful and eclectic decor.  The Candy Bar is a hidden gem.  I wish we'd had more time to check out the new Piano/Karaoke bar in the alley.  Our room was small, but thoughtfully laid out.  The owners did a fabulous job of renovating the old Wurlitzer Building.  I read about the history of the building before we went, which made me appreciate the renovation even more.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Stylish and Laid Back,My wife and I stayed at The Siren to attend a wedding in Gross Pointe. We wanted to be near downtown to enjoy the quality of downtown Detroit's changes. We were not disappointed. The hotel itself is a wonderful place to sit and relax. It's also an excellent jumping-off point to explore the rest of the city. The hotel service is excellent. Everyone was intent on making you laugh and feel comfortable. Much appreciated. We would certainly come back here.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Loved It!,"Great hotel.  Atmosphere, design, location, staff.  We enjoyed drinks in the gorgeous Candy Bar.  Valets and front desk friendly and accommodating.  Detroit is a fabulous city and The Siren is a welcome addition to the hotel options. We will be back!",5

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Chic stay in a convenient location,"We stayed here with our two small children. The staff front desk and valet staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is beautifully decorated with lots of details, from the flowers in the front entrance to the scented candles that are lighted at night (thankfully, our kids didn't break anything...). Our room (two double beds) was a bit small for four people, but the price point and location was good. I agree with another poster that a small fridge in the rooms would be helpful. We were within walking distance of a number of restaurants and places downtown that we wanted to see. Overall, a great stay. I'd definitely come here again!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Ms,"We loved the retro atmosphere and commitment to preserving local history at the Siren. The desk staff were super friendly and helpful and the room was clean and cool. The location is fantastic being right on the People Mover line. The room only had one hook for clothing and no dresser so we couldn't unpack very well, but the tiled bathroom was gorgeous.  A bouncer in the evening pulled us out of the stairway after we had walked two flights up to our third floor room to make us go all the way back down and use the elevator which was rude and frustrating but all in all a high recommendation.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Save your money (and have a better night) by staying somewhere else,"We were very excited to stay at this brand new hotel in downtown Detroit, and while there were positives to the stay, we were overall disappointed.    The positives Hotel looks very cool with the decor Great location with good walkability Staff is very friendly and helpful  Negatives: The room is WAY overpriced when we stayed for the size and quality of the room In addition to that, parking is $30 and the coffee is $3.50/cup! (No coffeemaker in room) Curtains block out hardly any light Very noisy-our room was right by the elevator and we heard everyone get on and off it and walk down the hall.  In addition, we stayed by an alley where we heard everyone leave the bar late and the garbage truck back up down the alley very early. Toilet broke Valet staff mixed up our car Elevators…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,5 Stars for both Hospitality & Style,"The front desk staff at Siren Hotel took INCREDIBLE care of us during our stay. They remembered so many little details from our front desk chat and multiple different people checked in with us during our stay. They have an incredibly convenient texting platform you can use to talk to people at the front desk which was so easy and helpful. We spent lots of time relaxing in their lobby, had drinks in the Candy Bar, and even bought items in their curated shop. They definitely have our number.   The only thing that could've added to our experience would've been a mini-fridge in the room, otherwise we had EVERYTHING we could've hoped for and then some.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Despite Great Staff, the Siren Doesn’t Call Me Back","I recently spent two nights at the Siren Hotel in Detroit. As a business traveler, I have come to expect certain amenities and even necessities that facilitate my work. the Siren had none of them.  My room had a bed (which was only one and a half feet off the ground and very uncomfortable), a serviceable bathroom with a decent shower, and , well, that’s it! No table. No closet. No dresser. No chair. No kidding. There were two hooks and 4 hangers on which to hang things. I participated in a conference call from my room while sitting on the floor and using the bed as a table on which I could write. Honestly, I had better accommodations as a poverty stricken college kid and I didn’t have to spend over $200 a night for it. The lobby is crowded and chaotic.   As I mentioned, though,…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,A beautiful quaint hotel!,The Siren Hotel is located in the heart of downtown and close to everything. Our guests always enjoy their stay there. The staff is welcoming and warm. The decor is equisite and very hollywood-esque..,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Nice place for a short stay,"Cute boutique hotel.  Rooms are small, but I've stayed in smaller.  Very nicely decorated and bathroom was very nice.  While there was no closet or dresser, there were hangers on the wall to hang stuff - and we had a small bench that we could put our suitcase on - but there was also a suitcase 'tray' as well.  Great for a night or two, but not sure if I'd stay much longer than that.  Short walk to all the things - Little Ceasars, Comerica, Ford field.  Dropping of the car at the valet was a bit of a hassle - not a lot of space - but picking it up was a breeze with their text service.  By the time we checked out, we were outside for about a minute when our car pulled up.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Not what expected,"We stayed at the Siren a couple of weeks ago as we were attending a wedding in the downtown area.   When we arrived to check in the desk clerk was very unfriendly to us,  like we were disturbing him.  We stayed for 2 nights and on the second day we expected to have our room cleaned.........the maid finally came to our room around 5:00 p.m. and we told her just to provide us with some clean towels.  We were very disappointed with our stay.",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,The idea much better than the reality,"We've stayed at boutique hotels before, so we knew going in not to expect the comforts offered by top-level chains.  But, even with this in mind, we were very disappointed.  The room we were assigned was nothing like what's pictured on their website for a parlor suite and when this was called to the manager's attention, he agreed and credited our account for the difference between the chamber and parlor suites.  However, I'm not sure our account was credited for the correct amount and when I questioned this at checkout, the clerk wouldn't directly answer my questions. Which brings me to my next observation...we found the front desk staff to be cool and unhelpful....as did others in our group.",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Uniquely quirky awesome experience,"I prefer exciting and unusual accommodations in the center of a busy urban area.  The Siren Hotel is PRIMO!  Located within quick walking distance of Comerica Park, Little Caesar’s Arena, The Fox, next door to the opera theater and to the People Mover, The Siren lobby is richly textured in vintage furnishings, a small coffee bar, and the feel of a small old European hotel.  Our bunk bed room, the only room available when I booked months ahead, was a small and tight space but perfect for our overnight stay.  These were chic upscale type bunk beds with supremely comfy beds, Turkish bedding and drop dead gorgeous vintage type chenille spreads.  Slept like a baby.  My initial uncertainty about bunk beds is gone.  It was a fun throwback to childhood.  The bathroom featured walk in,…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Not your average urban hotel,"Even by the standards of hip hotels, the Siren is doing something different. The plushly textured lobby, with a day bed in the center of the action, suggests an upscale Edwardian bordello with a dash of indie fashion boutique. After the whimsy and panache of the lobby, the cramped room was a bit of a letdown—as much corridor as living space, with an elfin chair you wouldn’t sit in for long and the bed only accessible from the foot by the person closest to the wall. Top marks for a spacious and swanky bathroom, though.  I’d probably stay here again for the prime location, a short walk from the stadium and a number of restaurants (the Siren’s own restaurant will open soon). The rate we paid compared favorably to the competition, and we enjoyed both the intimate on-site bar and the…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,OpulentAF,"Our stay at the Siren was super enjoyable. The rooms were pretty good... the lobby though was timeless and very special. The coffee shop was divine and the the barista was delightful. Speaking of amazing service, Anna was really accommodating and enjoyable to interact with. She definitely elevated our stay and it wouldn’t have been the same without her :)",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Under constr,"There was neither table closet or a chair in the room. Also the light was pretty bad.. No breakfast possible.  Besides hotel is nice, however probably better for tourists.  Location is great, for work and tourism.",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Stay,"Rooms are small, but I got used to it. No refrigerator or microwave. Brought up a cooler full of beverages and hung out with friends. There's only one luggage cart and the wait at the desk can be kind of long. Reasonably fast valet. Hotel bar is pricey. Two elevators with separate call buttons causes longer than usual waits. Great location near the stadiums and downtown establishments. Very clean and historic restoration. Very courteous, helpful and friendly staff. Additional Karaoke bar has to be entered from a separate alley entrance.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Wonderful hotel with amazing staff!,"Wow. This hotel really blew me away with its decor. The front desk employees were such a delight to deal with. The room was pretty small but I was told that before I booked my reservation. Ana and Sydney gave us recommendations for near by restaurants and things to do, and we had a blast!! We will definitely be staying at the siren next time we are in Detroit!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,The hotel was very clean and beautiful.,The room was excellent and the staff was very helpful and friendly. We had a room overlooking the Detroit Opera House and other old buildings. The hotel was unique in how it was presented. The architecture and items displayed in the hotel were very interesting to view.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Quirky gem in downtown Detroit,Had never heard of The Siren Hotel before booking it for a one-night stay. There's a ton of vintage charm to the building and it's noticeable as soon as you step in the front door. Our guest room was small (2 beds) but we weren't planning to spend much time inside anyway. Bathroom was a good size and I loved the rain shower. The hotel is a quick walk to Comerica Park and plenty of dining and drinking options are nearby. The front desk staff were a delight to deal with.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautiful Hotel - Will be better once all aspects are opened!,"The hotel itself is quite beautiful and there is a lot of attention to detail. I know they have plans to open a restaurant and roof top bar that will make it that much more spectacular. My only issue is that I noticed a scrape on my front bumper that I think came from the valet. It appeared to be dusty like a scrape from a cement wall and/or barrier. I did not notify the hotel of this because I didn't notice it until I got home (a day later) and could not prove that it came from there. Other than that, great stay and would recommend.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautiful property with outstanding customer service,"The property is beautiful and unique and located perfectly in downtown Detroit--walking distance from just about everything. The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating. Would definitely recommend and will be staying there again!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Wedding,Our sink did not drain well. The hotel signage was difficult to see. We missed the hotel the first time driving. The hotel entrance where you register was way too cramped. I’m not sure why the bed was there. The staff was very friendly and courteous. I didn’t use the coffee shop or candy bar restaurant/bar.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Phenomenal stay, wow!","Had a great stay - such a warm welcome on arrival and made to feel special (thanks guys).  Bed was super comfortable, too.  Lots to do in the hotel as well, and in the area.  I can't wait to return to the Siren!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Second Stay + Still in Love,The Siren doesn't disappoint.  A year later for our 2nd stay and just as lovely as it was the first time.  Lobby is super luxe-vintage and smells divine.  The 'Candy' bar has gorgeous pink lacquer walls and pink velvet booths.  Despite the somewhat 'loud' music spun by a live DJ the prohibition style drinks and atmosphere were well worth shouting to your friends.  The rooms are super clean and have just the right amount of design.  Great place and well priced.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great stay!,"This hotel was phenomenal! I loved the personality and individuality of the space, it was clean, staff was welcoming and available, and the room was quiet. I'd highly recommend staying here for personal or professional needs.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Great foundation, could use some tweaking","There was a lot to love about the Siren: the bed was super comfy, staff were friendly and helpful, and the place has excellent style. That said, we left with a list of small things that would have made our stay more comfortable. The room was very small, with extremely limited space to unpack (a sort of half-armoire was the only place to put things)—a few well-placed hooks on the wall and a shelving unit of some kind in the bathroom would have made a huge difference to the endless shuffling of stuff from one unsuitable surface to another.  The bar downstairs is beautiful and busy, somehow both cozy and grand. The coffee stand in the lobby, in the absence of coffee makers in the rooms, was ok, but would be smart to offer a french press pot-for-two tray that visitors can take up to…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Very cool, great location","Enjoyed our 2 night stay with friends. Small rooms, but not in them much anyway. Super big walk in shower. Fun, eclectic decor. Best part was the large table in the lobby area that we could hang out at night playing cards with our friends. Walking distance to great spots downtown.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Cool little place,"Such a cool place. Rooms are basic, but clean and comfortable beds. I liked that they had streaming TV options and nice touches like a wine opener in the room. The Candy Bar is super cool. Can't wait to go back!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Really Nice Boutique Hotel,"Stayed for 4 nights in a Chamber type room. Really like the decor and warmth of the room, takes you out of the typical hotel chains without loosing quality. The service is very good, always took care of anything I needed (Valet parking, laundry, deliveries)  TV system is Roku, this still needs work, I needed to reprogram the system every night. ",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great stay!,"Everything was fantastic! Clean, affordable, great location, and friendly staff! Easy check in and check out. The amenities were fantastic and easy to locate. Candy Bar located in the lobby of the hotel was chic and romantic and had professional bartenders and incredible servers.  Detroit is a wonderful city with much to offer in the areas of food, drink, and nightlife. We enjoyed a few days away in this energetic city, and thank The Siren for hosting us so graciously!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Stunning Art Deco Hotel, Great Downtown Location!",Beautifully designed hotel with great attentive staff. Perfect downtown location.. everything was walkable or within a 6 minute drive. The entire hotel was kept impeccably clean and smelled great. The bathroom was very spacious with an amazing rain shower. Bed was super comfy too! Definitely recommend for long and short stays.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Cute boutique hotel,"Big shower and good size bathroom.  Room and double beds on the small size and would only work for 2 people per room.   Friendly staff and able to match rate got on Agoda when we decided to get a 2nd room for the night (we had four in our group, so ended up getting a 2nd room at check-in).  Convenient downtown location and easy to walk to all the sites. Clean room and nice decor with unique art work and furniture.  Good overall stay with decent value for downtown location.  Parking is a bit pricey @$30/night for overnight.",4

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Stay,"We live in SE Michigan and I decided to take my wife down for a three day weekend to celebrate her birthday and the Siren was up to the task.  The rooms are smaller and somewhat European as one would expect in a boutique hotel.  The staff is just super, super friendly and helpful.  So glad to see the addition to downtown doing so well.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Absolutely perfect!,"As a designer, I am really critical of interiors but this place blew me away. Not only is the decor fantastic and funky, the staff was outstanding, and the location is so convenient to everything. My 13 year old daughter and I stayed in one of the bunk rooms and it was super fun, spacious and the beds were extremely comfy. Will be back soon!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Super funky cool hotel with a great location/price. BONUS: dog friendly!,"As soon as you walk in to the hotel the lobby tells you that you are somewhere cool. Plus everyone is REALLY nice (including the valet, front desk, coffee shop, the person that stands outside of the bar). I found this hotel by google-ing Dog Friendly Hotels in Detroit. I wasn’t sure from their website so I emailed them and they replied right away that they were. When we arrived they had a personalized welcome note for Max on the bed. Also the hotel is like 2 blocks from a great little off-leash dog park!!! Again, everyone was really nice and it was so cool to stay in a hotel that wasn’t just another chain. We had never been to Detroit (or Michigan) before and we would definitely stay here again! The price was great and also the valet were super helpful and quick!! We kept saying…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Old World Feel, Good Service","This hotel had a really cool, original feel. As you walk into the lobby, you feel as though you are being taken to another time. This is refreshing if you find most large hotel chains to be sterile and boring. The staff at the valet and front desk were all very friendly and fast. The location is close walking distance to shopping, the ball park and the Fox theatre. I would almost return to Detroit just to stay at this hotel.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great location to explore Detroit ,"Traveling with a pet can be a challenge but from the moment we arrived at The Siren Hotel we flet welcomed! The lobby is a place back in time, making one forget the world outside. Our room was peaceful and quiet. The view out our windows, amazing; day or night! The furnishings are top notch in originally and comfort. A couple small suggestions:  shower caps for those who do not want to redo hair after standing under the waterfall shower—great for others. There werevery few electrical outlets in room so I needed to recharge my phone in bathroom, making it inconvenient to get to alarm in morning.  I found it confusing that I could not charge Coffee at the convenient counter in the lobby as it was a separate venue and that there were very limited choices for breakfast. There is no…",5

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Calling Us Back,"The hotel was beautiful, felt like stepping back in time when entering the lobby and corridors. Rooms were comfortable, clean, and the hand written notes were a nice touch. The staff was friendly, and out going, we had a problem with our bathroom when we arrived and they were up in minutes to remedy the issue, and so pleasant while doing so.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,NICE HOTEL,"We stayed here for a night and attended the Rocket Mortgage classic golf tournament the next day.  It was a very nice and cozy hotel with great staff who were accommodating and respectful.  It is in a convenient spot downtown Detroit so you could walk to many bars and restaurants and experience Detroit by foot.  They are also very close to the ballpark and football stadium if you need a place to stay after a game or an event there.  Bare in mind, our room was small - just enough space for 2 people - I am unsure how big the other rooms are but double check before booking.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautiful Stay!,"This hotel was STUNNING!! It’s unlike any other I’ve stayed it. Everyone was super great and accommodating, especially the valet. I hadn’t had a great sleep until I got there. The beds are great. The Art Deco aesthetic is unreal! The location was perfect for everything I needed to do. It was close to all the sporting venues. All walkable. 20/10 would stay here again.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great gem in the city.,We stayed here for my sons wedding that was at the Gem theater. It was conveniently located to everything and very accommodating. Anya at the front desk was a huge help in straightening out a reservation that I had made a mistake on. Would highly recommend.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,The hotel was very interesting visually and very clean.,The room could have been better designed.  My biggest issue was having hangers on a hanger on the wall across the bed in a small alcove; very inconvenient.  I found the room was very small and furniture crammed into it.,3
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Amazing Stay,Everything from the amenities to the staff to the layout of the hotel was amazing. This property really stands out for the decor and the amount of detail that was put into it. I would highly recommend staying here.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Weekend in Motor City,Well situated. Walking distance to many key Detroit sites. Great warm and welcoming staff. Coffee bar in lobby and the cocktail lounge in back both were visited and were very good. Love the vibe in the cocktail lounge. Small rooms - not suitable for a business related stay but comfortable beds and well appointed bathroom.  Overall highly recommended for a 2-3 night tourist stay if planning on covering what the new and improved downtown and midtown Detroit have to offer.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in,"I really liked the small room and what made it enjoyable was definitely because it was so well designed. Great attention to detail and even better, because they anticipated people wanting to walk off with all those nice details, they have a gift shop where to can buy them! Great location, great staff, great coffee bar in the lobby which makes top-notch coffee and great cocktail bar - although it's so popular and tiny you really need to go early to get in! Excellent experience overall!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Ideal place to explore downtown from the heart of it,"A friend and I stayed there 3 nights in 2 rooms (we moved rooms when we added an extra night). It is located at what is the center of the spokes of the street grid that lays out the city. There is so much exciting, fun stuff to explore on foot from there that you can't see it all. Location is perfect!   The hotel remodel is ""exquisite"" in the words of my travel companion who visits NYC once a month in the fashion business. No detail was overlooked, and expenses were not spared. If you are a visual person who seeks beautiful surroundings, you will be delighted.   The rooms are extremely comfortable, clean and pleasant, even the small one that has bunk beds (honest!). We had the monorail (People Mover) whooshing next to the room, but it's surprisingly quiet for such a thing, and…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Birthday gone pretty wrong,"Hello... I’m writing to let someone know of the complete disrespect I had encountered over the weekend....of my fiancé’s birtnday,  not only paid 200+ dollars on a room pretty small but loved it - nice room, lovely, terrible service. The woman at the front counter I only wish I got her name looked at me as if I didn’t belong... I’m 23 years old and my boyfriend had booked the room as he runs a company. He wouldn’t be present at the time of check in, so.... we did the credit authorization.. confirmed it with a gentleman over the phone. Arrive - Pay for valet.

Hence why i filled out the credit authorization form- any ways, Doesn’t Tell me how to use the elevators as they are used with the sensory cards. Any…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Great location, friendly staff","Overall, I enjoyed the Siren, though it is not ideal for business travel. The location is great - tons of places to eat nearby and the neighborhood is very walkable. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are tiny, but comfortable. Rooms do not include a coffee maker, but an electric kettle was brought to my room promptly on request (and there's a coffee shop in the lobby). The smallest guest rooms lack a desk or even a chair, though there's kind of a bench to sit on, so working in the room was difficult. The hallways are dark - this seems to be a style choice, but is a little creepy. Housekeeping was a little spotty, but I was there during their soft open, so I expect those issues will be worked out.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Customer Service for Tiny Rooms,"We stayed here as part of a wedding block.  Our room to sleep three was far smaller than the other rooms we visited, not that I would call any of the rooms roomy.  It is a boutique hotel with a unique design, great staff and a pricey coffee bar.  The cost was roughly the same as many of the regular downtown hotels, however it lacked a pool for the kid and someplace reasonable to grab food.  However, it was in walking distance to EVERYTHING you would want in downtown Detroit (fun bars, great food), the room was comfortable and clean, and the $30 valet service each night included letting you put your car in and out as many times as you'd like during the day.  These are the reasons why I give it a very good.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great place to stay,"Really nice convenient place to stay in downtown.  Room & bathroom had a European hotel feel.

I'd definitely stay here again next time I'm in downtown Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Location,"We were downtown for a couple days prior to a concert. Detroit is definitely on its way back! The location of The Siren Hotel was wonderful. It did, however, take us a night to get used to the hotel...no restaurant, no closet in the room (there were 2 hooks!) but the bathroom was clean and modern. I should have requested a softer pillow but didn't and it was my fault for not getting a good nights sleep. The bed was very comfortable. By day 2 we were acclimated and actually enjoyed it! Never did figure out how to watch the television but the only time I missed it was when I didn't feel well and wanted to veg out. The snacks for purchase on the dresser didn't have any crackers or pretzels which would have been helpful for something bland. But Vernors ginger ale was there! Tried…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Weekend Destination,"I loved the Siren! It's clean, comfortable and the staff is extremely friendly.

My fur babies would love it.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Disappointed,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Siren Hotel. We booked and paid for we thought was the Parlor Suite with a king bed seven weeks prior to our arrival. Our decision was based on photos on their website and our desire to splurge. When we arrived we were informed our room was available. On getting to our ‘suite’ it was far from what was pictured on the website having a queen bed, no place for suitcases except the floor, a tiny ‘sofa’ to sit on, and was just sterile and uncomfortable. On asking about the room we informed that the suite we had booked had been removed from use for repairs two weeks prior. We had not been informed of this either prior to our stay or upon arriving. Natalie at the front desk did resolve our problems to our satisfaction. Don’t be misled by the photos…",2

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Great Downtown Stay,"My wife and I stayed here on the way back from a concert. Very nice and clean hotel. We didn't get to go to the lobby bar but we did go to the lobby coffee shop in the morning, excellent coffee and pastries. We we go back, the beds were comfortable and there are lots of things to do close by.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,"Intimate, homey stay at this urban treasure","We stayed at The Siren while in town to see a Tigers game.  We spent two nights here.  We loved its history (Wurlitzer headquarters for many years!) and the cozy, unique decor of the lobby, as well as the excellent coffee bar in the morning.  The handwritten notes waiting for us welcomed us, and the beds were so comfortable.  We slept really well.  Staff was awesome at every turn.  We stayed here with our two children (aged 13 and 14), and they loved it, too.  We closed one evening with a drink at the Candy Room, which had a fun atmosphere and a great cocktail list (try the homemade candy bar, too!).  Everything downtown is super walkable from here, and we tried several area restaurants, too.  For everything that the Siren offered, we found the price quite reasonable as well.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Charming hotel in a great location with friendly staff,"I stayed here for two nights on a work trip and I feel like I found a gem of a hotel. From the lobby to the rooms, the decor is really well done. Everything felt very cozy and welcoming. The staff was excellent--very friendly and easy to talk to. I got some dinner recommendations from one of them which took me a little further out of downtown than I probably would have ventured otherwise, but it was well worth it--really great restaurants. The location of the hotel itself was perfect for exploring downtown and very close to Q-Line and People Mover stations for getting around. I will definitely be staying here again!",5

"Detroit, MI",The Siren Hotel,Beautifully Restored,The customer service is excellent. The lobby bar is fantastic; even if I wasn't staying there I would want to go to this speakeasy-style lounge! This historical building has all of the character but does not feel old. They did a wonderful job with the restoration... My only qualm was the room size. I was traveling for business so I didn't spend anytime in my room however there was not enough room to hang clothing or work on my laptop in the evening.,4

Warm, welcoming, friendly and beyond helpful. To be honest she's the only reason I enjoyed my stay. If it wasn't for COVID I would have given her the biggest hug. Her personality is amazing.

Mind you with the pandemic we haven’t been out much lol, but this beautiful old building served us well! Rooms are super cool, and a good value, I suggest a corner room.

The first person to greet me at the hotel upon arrival was Gina. She was very professional, kind, informative and was sure to welcome us to the Aloft. This truly set the tone for what to expect for the rest of our stay. Next, I had a very simple and easy check in experience with the front desk. She made us feel welcomed and was also very nice and personable. The next person to assist us at the hotel was Brenda at the front desk (night). She was absolutely amazing. She gave us menus for food delivery services that deliver to the hotel. I requested some additional assistance from Brenda on another night and she kindly helped us again late at night with no hesitation. She was aware of the reason that we were…",5

The Aloft rooms are roomy, modern, and very well appointed. Anthony at the front desk and Joe at Valet were especially helpful and friendly. Thanks for the dinner recommendation Anthony, it was delicious!    Be aware- this property is a combination of hotel rooms and apartments. There isn’t as much offered in the way of amenities such as room service etc but a nice place to stay in the downtown area.   We felt very safe. The architecture of the building is striking. Gilded elevators and marble everywhere make quite an impression. We would stay here again. ",5

After carefully reviewing downtown hotels, we decided to stay at the Aloft.  We entered the space and we were immediately impressed with the architecture of the building. We were greeted by Jordan at the front desk.  He was warm and knowledgeable about the city and placed us in a beautiful,spacious  room with fantastic views of the city.  Although we only stayed overnight, I was able to walk to the Riverwalk and see a beautiful Monument dedicated to escaping slaves seeking freedom in Canada. Thank you Jordan for suggesting this location and thank you the the security guard who gave me directions. We would definitely stay here again.",5

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location, nice rooms, and friendly staff","Couldn't be happier with our stay over here! We had originally booked the Marriott Detroit Renaissance Center and had the worst experience ever so we cancelled and headed over here. We were greeted by Lorans Zoumot who was extremely pleasant and very apologetic of our horrible experience at the Marriott. He booked us in the perfect room with a beautiful view of the city. The hotel wasn't very busy because of COVID, but they still had the bar open downstairs which was a nice stop before going out to dinner. If we're ever back in Detroit, we'll 100% stay here! Couldn't have asked for a better experience!! Thank you again Lorans and the rest of the Aloft team for turning our Detroit experience completely around!!  If you're contemplating staying at the Marriott, don't.",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Great Stay with Amazing Staff,"I stayed here in January for one night with a group of friends while in town to watch the Raptors play the Pistons. The hotel was really cool, the room was a perfect size for the four of us, the location is AMAZING if you're going to games or concerts at Comerica Park or Little Caesars Arena, but the hotel staff really made our trip memorable. Johnea was lovely and even provided us with vouchers for the hotel bar, which was beyond welcoming. All the staff members we interacted with were funny and kind, but Johnea went above and beyond for us.  I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone in town for a game.",5

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Wonderful hotel with the BEST staff!,I come to Detroit at least twice a month for business and I always stay at the Aloft Hotel. The staff is amazing but this past week the help from Lorans and Sparkle was above and beyond! As I checked in I found out that they were 95% booked and it looked like I could not get the room type I usually get. The look on my face was all they needed to see. They made it happen for me. They understand that business travel is tough and make it as easy as possible. Makes a huge difference when you are on the road for work!,5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,One Night,"The building is cool, but the food situation is bizarre. You need to pay for food at the hotel front desk, where there is no menu. So, go to the pantry/food service room, choose what you want, go the hotel front desk to order the food, and then go back to the pantry to pick it up. The food actually was very good, but....never again.",2

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Great stay at the Aloft,"I just returned from a weekend in Detroit with my wife and two kids with a two night stay at the Aloft. The property is beautiful inside with an amazing restoration of a century old building.   We were in a two bed room looking into the atrium. Beds were comfortable and lots of room to move around. There is a door to the toilet/shower, but the sink area is not private and the lights for both are on a single switch.   All the staff we spoke with, including front desk and valet, were friendly and helpful.   Centrally located and attached to the People Mover, you can be anywhere in downtown very quickly. We walked to Greektown in under 15 minutes.   Would definitely stay again on a return visit!",5

Lawrence, at the front desk was particularly helpful, making sure our family needs were met. Carlos, the hotel manager was equally helpful and a pleasure to talk to about the hotel, the building and the area.

Later in our stay, Theron went above and beyond to help us with a minor request we had. He was so friendly, honest, and interesting to chat with!   As we were staying at the Whitney for a wedding, we had relied on the cleaning and maintenance staff to tend to us more than a normal hotel stay.

Truly lovely, and great proximity for sports/concert events!","As a Goldmember, I frequent multiple concept hotels within the Marriott brand, my favorites being Aloft and The Autograph Collection.  The Detroit hotel is really lovely.    I valet parked my vehicle.  I am not certain if they permit self-parking, as I didn't ask.  Cost to valet was $34 overnight.  Easy system, where you text parking services just before you wish to pick up your vehicle.  There isn't a charge for in/out services.  Front desk staff = very friendly, helpful.  Fantastic little center in the lobby (consistent with Aloft) that includes fresh food options along with packaged items to go.  Coffee is unlimited, free, and fresh.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Beautiful building, good location, strange room layout","The building is really beautiful with a lot of history. The hotel staff is very friendly and Jordan (works at the welcome desk) is a wealth of information about the hotel history. Residents live on the top floors and the hotel rooms are on the lower floors. There's a very small sorta store in the lobby where you can buy water and snacks and they charge to your room. The room was clean and quiet but the room had a strange layout. There was a long entryway in the room and a small room where the bed was. It's location was downtown and there were some decent shops within walking distance, though didn't see any grocery stores. Detroit really is the motor city so expect to rent a car or take a Lyft everywhere. ",4

I chose it because it is just a couple blocks from the Fox Theatre, where we were going to a concert. It is also steps away from Comerica Park, Ford Field and the Detroit Opera House--all of which we could see from our window. The room was comfortable and attractive. I did have a few issues with the design, especially for the high price point. First--the lighting is lacking. The room is very dark, especially in the bathroom area where there is no natural light. It was very dark to try to apply makeup, and no makeup mirror is provided. Also, there is no way to turn on the light in the powder room only--a big negative when sharing a room and not wanting to wake anyone else. (The bathroom…",4

As we pulled in front of the hotel, one of the valet workers said “look as those wheels, those are pretty sweet looking on your van”.  For some reason they couldn’t park my van with valet services because they said my vehicle was over 6’ and couldn’t fit in their lot. ”. The valet guy told me to park at a pay lot that was gated and well lit a block away.  I parked my vehicle at the lot at 2pm.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Great Location,"We stayed for 3 nights in July for a nearby wedding, in one the of the suite room on the 4th floor, on the Woodward Avenue side of the building.  The building that houses this hotel is old and elegant, with a center atrium, but no full service restaurant at this time.  The bar opens after 3 pm, and there are couches in the atrium where you can gather with friends or family.   The location is terrific, but the area is quite busy and noisy all day and night, and we experienced street noise until late.  We would know better next time to ask for a room on the other side of the hotel.  We found the service from the hotel staff to be average at best.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Interesting place; good location,"My previous stay at an Aloft (and I'm never sure whether it's supposed to be Aloft or A-loft), in Rogers, AK, was haute underwhelming. This was a better experience. The restoration of the David Whitney and adaptation into the hotel and apartments is kind of cool. I liked my room, with a couple of caveats: The conversation has resulted in some odd spaces (in this case, really long and narrow); and the only settings I could achieve on the room AC were ""Glacial"" and ""Off."" That said, this is a good hotel and I would stay here again. Has the standard (?) weird Aloft breakfast options downstairs, with no real place to eat them. Note to hotel keepers: PLEASE offer your guests stronger coffee!",4
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Best Check In Experience,"Driving from Niagara Falls to Chicago, we tossed a coin and decided to visit Detroit instead of Cleveland. I didn't have time to research the city and made a reservation at the Aloft en route.  The hotel and Detroit were such fantastic discoveries.  Joanna at the front desk provided the best check-in experience with her friendly, open personality, knowledge of the city, and efficient professionalism.  She truly loves Detroit and it made us excited to take all her advice in exploring the city.  We hope to return and of course stay at the Aloft.  Such a unique space, clean, and quiet.  The grandeur of the lobby is impressive but the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. The location was great with the People Mover stop right outside the door.",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Great Management Followup,"Had a point discrepancy over my stay on points which Marriott was not effective with settling. However, after a couple of calls with the hotel, one of the managers Rich was kind enough to spend time and follow up with Marriott to settle the issue. Needless to say, he went the extra mile to satisfy what I felt was something which impacted my experience and because of his tenacity turned it into a positive. The hotel is situated close to Comerica Park and ideal if you are planning to attend a game or two. I stayed here with a family of 4 and we were comfortable with the space in the room and room designation was nicely appointed with a view of the stadium. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,location is very convenient,"The location of the hotel is very convenient. In the city center with easy access to all attractions. In general, the city of Detroit exceeded all our expectations. On the Internet, they write a lot about empty buildings and high levels of crime. This is nothing. The city is beautiful and safe.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Amazing Part of the City Hotel Service BELOW Average,"Located in the Grand Circus Park district of Detroit, close to many amenities.  Interior restoration of rooms was done beautifully and clean. However, my room was a ""terrace view"" which was dismal and actually the view was horrible!  You looked into other guest rooms!!!  Was not impressed with front desk service, they were nothing special and not helpful!!! A guest (not in my party) was hurt in the corn-hole area, the front desk had No first aid kit and gave no assistance.  No accident report, nothing!!!  Bartender was plain rude!!!  Two co-worker's were supposed to have a suite, ended up with a room with one king bed. Valet service was probably the best, nice people, great service.  It's a shame because this hotel is located in a great area for tourists, but unless service is…",2

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Beautiful hotel - convenient location - great stay!,"We really enjoyed our stay at Aloft. The location is fantastic. It's easy walking distance to restaurants, bars and stadiums. There is a People Mover stop right there and you're not too far from the QLINE. The building itself is restored beautifully. There's multiple bars within the hotel. We had a city view room. It was decorated nicely and had a great view of stadiums and the church out the window. The beds were comfortable.   Two tips for future travelers. First, be smarter than me and remember that you're booking a city hotel. Pack ear plugs! I didn't hear noise from inside the hotel but there was quite a bit of street noise (sirens, loud radios, etc.). That's totally to be expected, but I wasn't thinking about it when I packed.   Also, if you're traveling with others, find…",5

I also like hotels with high ratings and customer service - I chose the Aloft at the David Whitney, because it was one of the top hotels by ranking in Detroit.  The  building is nice, interesting and historic.  The furniture and amenities are OK – typical Aloft style.   The problem is with the staff. Brittany  (Alexis? - multiple names provided) at the front desk, put me in a musty room on the fifth floor that was dark with half windows.  I called and asked to be moved and she pushed back.  She then proceeded to tell me that there was nothing else available and put me on hold.  I looked at the Marriott app to determine that there were indeed other rooms available. I walked…",3

We only stayed one night but had family in town that stayed three nights.  Highlights: Proximity to dining, nightlife and other events. We took our company to Downtown Louies, Cliff Bells, Atwater Brewing and the Hudson Cafe.  There are several other restaurants and diners and dives in the area.  We love Vicentes and Hot Taco is an inexpensive and tasty option. Our company went to the Rusted Crow on their own and enjoyed the food and steampunk vibe. Nearly all of our dining stops were within walking distance.  All the venues for the 4 major sports teams and many places to see live music are within walking distance as well.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Alofts Never Disappoint,"This hotel location is really convenient and centrally located amongst many activities, restaurants, and transportation options. There is a “people mover” stop right at the hotel and multiple parking garages within blocks. The valet service has 24/7 in and out privileges as easy as a quick text to the attendant. The lobby is gorgeous, rooms are bigger than your typical aloft, and the staff is friendly like always. For a great stay at an affordable price, it’s tough to pass up. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Theran is the definition of customer service,"Upon my first time arriving to the state of Detroit due to business, after a very stressful airport dilemma involving me nearly missing my flight and transportation, I was greeted by Theran H at the front desk. I was immediately welcomed to the city with friendly conversation, complementary drinks and the offer of an upgraded room. Needless to say this has been one of the best hotel experiences I have had and when I come back to visit Detroit for vacation this exact Aloft will be my stay of choice. Thank you for the warm welcome, this establishment and its employee's truly care! ",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Cool Hotel - just not our taste,"Just need to say that everyone has different taste.  This hotel in a repurposed building was really unique. The lobby was beautiful.  The hallways were “office-like”. The room was modern- ours had a wonderful view of Comerica Park.  But it just didn’t feel cozy. Unlike other reviewers, all of the staff members were gracious, welcoming and very friendly to us!  The bar was also friendly - drinks were good but a bit pricey. Would we stay here again- probably not- but I am sure others (maybe those younger than us!) would love this place.",4
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Might stay again. Not sure,"I like the fact that they give a sizeable Military/Govt discount. Its a unique Hotel conversion in the fact that it was once a hospital. Bar maid was over worked but handled the load and was very friendly. Why only three stars? Two of the male desk staff were arrogant and rude. Upon arrival the elevator was broken. On day two the fire alarm went off for no reason. Also, they promised specials for passing on daily maid service but they did not deliver.",3
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,A standby for good catgish,We always like DBs catfish and the salad bar is always good and fresh. Good for lunch or dinner.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Beautiful building, but not so great hotel","Great location downtown and a beautiful building, but . . . .  Wish I could write a better review of the hotel.  The room and bed were pretty good, but floors didn’t feel clean.  Carpet wasn’t really vacuumed well.  The coffee/tea area in the lobby was dirty the 24 hours we were there.  Counter was never wiped off, no hot water for tea until Sunday morning, no bananas in the fruit bowl even though there was a major 5 K we ran downtown.  They were “out.”  It just didn’t feel upscale for the price we paid-around $400 with parking and taxes.  Won’t stay again.",2
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Poor service,"I stayed at the Aloft during the week of the FIRST competition in Detroit. During check-in, we requested for a suite instead of regular king room since we were a party of four attending our sons event at the Cobo center. The lady at the desk in the morning said we could be moved the next day since they did not have availability that night. When I enquired again the next day, the gentleman at the front desk was extremely rude and said it would be a $300+ charge per night for the upgrade. I enquired again the next morning and the lady said she would have the room available after it is cleaned and once again in the evening the same gentleman was rude and refused to do so.  After checking out and staying cramped for 4 days in a single bed, we checked out and requested for our car to…",2

Lovely bathroom and large. I used the cafe for coffee the next morning, and valet was very timely retrieving my car.  Everyone was very friendly. I wasn't visiting for a sporting event, but had I, this would be an ideal location. I would definitely stay here again. The Aloft was a lovely experience!",5

I found it to be totally different in the morning versus the afternoon/evening. Alexis, who checked me in in the afternoon was awesome! She went above and beyond. The girl who worked the both mornings on the 23rd and 24th- has to be some of the poorer hospitality I’ve seen.

The whole area surrounding the hotel is neat and clean. The hotel is in a sexy building. Just wow! Amazing history, great marble construction. I really liked it.  The room/bathrooms are renovated and I had a giant room with writing desk and long couch etc. But this can be improved - there is no space to store clothes if you are staying long, no drawers etc. Then there is no microwave or kettle. The coffee with the machine is meh. Only one teabag. The body lotion is very inferior and there is combo shampoo+conditioner (not separate).   The TV channel numbers are not the same as the printed paper in the room. There is no HBO and no way to do Chromecast…",5

James Davis, the operations supervisor, got us a gorgeous corner king room with unbelievable views. The hotel is a stunning peek into history with rooms that are modern and stylish....not to mention tall ceilings. One think to note, it is a city hotel and there is noise because of it. We love city sounds so it wasnt a problem.   The neighborhood it's in is clean and safe and has tons of walkable shopping and restaurants. The people move is literally outside our window so you can keep your car parked and just walk.  I would highly recommend this hotel and it's super kind staff.",5

The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful--everyone from the parking valet (same cost as a day of park-yourself, so why not?) to the doorman to the front desk staff. The wide corridors look onto the courtyard/skylight and reminded me of long-ago visits to dentists' or lawyers' offices. The room itself was large, comfortable, modern, and very clean.

We were able to walk to the Opera House and also walked to Lovers Only (good burger and sandwich place) for lunch, Wright and Company for dinner and Hudson Cafe for breakfast. All great places to eat!  The room was nice although the refrigerator was making noises. We told them about it when we left, so hopefully the next guests won’t have to deal with that.

We stayed here to celebrate our anniversary, they surprised me with champagne in the hotel room. The hotel room they gave us was a corner room with the most amazing views (pics included). They have complimentary coffee in the mornings and the location of this hotel is perfect. We walked to the baseball stadium where we watched a game. We walked up the other way toward the water and stopped at a couple bars along the way. The location is perfect! The hotel room itself had the most comfortable bed and the bright colors in the room were a lovely touch. The bathroom had a large walk in shower. I would love to stay here again! Thank you for the great hospitality!",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Aloft David Whitney,The Aloft David Whitney is in the perfect location downtown. It seems to be centrally located between everything downtown.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Mixed Feelings,"Stayed here for 3 nights.  Location is great and the building is beautiful.  The rooms were disappointing.  It was our first stay at an Aloft property.  We only had interior views, which means that the draperies had to be drawn unless you wanted to be on display for the other guests also facing the interior.  No natural light - and not that many lamps inside the room to brighten it up, so the general affect was dreary.  I missed looking out to see the weather - you couldn't tell if it was rainy or sunny.  There were NO drawers for storing clothing, so we ended up hanging a few things (very few hangers - makeshift closet) and living out of our suitcase.  No general amenities like shower caps, q-tips, cotton balls, and the glasses were plastic.  Also no wine glasses in the room. …",3

Only complaint was that there were not enough hooks or towel racks to hang up wet towels and the bathroom door doesn’t lock, it just slides shut, but other than that it was great! They even had a little market downstairs with breakfast and other food items as well as a bar so it had everything we needed! We were right in the heart of downtown, minutes away from the stadiums and the sky rail was accessible from the building! Overall a wonderful stay. ",4

As a solo traveler in a strange city (without the very best reputation), I was most interested in a lodging experience where I felt safe, and the Aloft-DW absolutely delivered.

Every staff member we came across was very accommodating and pleasant.  The architecture and history of the building is amazing.  It was set up like other Aloft Hotels we've stayed in where the bedroom/sleeping area is opposite the bathroom area.  The room was very clean and nicely appointed.  About the only issue was the lights in the bathroom area were set where you could not turn on those lights only, it turned on either just the lights in the bedroom portion or all the lights in both the bathroom &  bedroom area turned on simultaneously.  It made it difficult when getting up at night to use the restroom and not wanting to disturb those still sleeping.  Other than that it was…",5

It was comfortable and more than spacious enough for the 3 nights that the two of us spent there with full-sized luggage. Facilities are limited (a room fridge for use, shop and what is effectively a fast food offering in reception) but this was not a problem given the location downtown. Staff were all very helpful and friendly, with particular praise for the staff in the WXYZ bar who were quick to offer tips and advice on our visit. Recommended and would stay again.",5

The People Mover stops right at the hotel (Grand Circus Park stop), and from there, we could get to most places in downtown (Greektown, Renaissance Center). The best part though was that we were in amazing walking distance from the new Little Caesars Arena (LET'S GO RED WINGS, LET'S GO TO WORK PISTONS!), Ford Field (GO LIONS), and Comerica Park (GO TIGERS!).   The only improvement I'll recommend is more cabinet space in the room. We were upgraded to the corner junior King suite (Thanks, Parker!), and we stayed for three nights...but there were only five hangers to share between my wife and me, and there was no real cabinet space in the room.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Warning make sure you get confirmation in writing about your arrangements,I booked a total of two rooms for my father and wife who were seniors and myself and spouse. When I called and spoke with staff I asked for the best price and even let the employee know I had AAA. He assured me that the rate he was giving me was the best rate. I DO NOT normally pay in full ahead of time but to get this rate I accepted. The charge went through a couple of month before our arrival date. Keep in mind I was paying interest on that. When it got closer to the date of arrival I went to the website and noticed that there was a senior rate available. I called the hotel and yes there was for fifteen dollars per room less. However I was told since I prebooked and the deadline to cancel was up they could not help me. All of this was irritating but still not a major problem.…,2

We had the rudest experience with your bartender. Some shorter  auburn haired girl in her late 20s or 30s. Your employee was much to preoccupied attending to what we assume was her boyfriend than us the customer and appeared to be intoxicated alchol or drugs when you can smell marijuana which personally makes me nauseous and the person is behind a counter top there's a huge problem with that, but we both felt it was more than that if not a combination.

Overall I have no complaints about this hotel, will stay here again and will definitely recommend it to friends visiting the area.

The hotel is very close to Comerica Park and several restaurants. The People Mover also goes right by the hotel. We are Starwood members, so I requested an early check in and we got it, no problem. Our room (325) was huge! There was a living room-type area when we walked in, followed by the bedroom. I didn’t request an upgrade, but I wonder if this was. There is 24 hour valet parking for $30 per day. I would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a place close to Comerica, Ford Field, Greektown, Little Caesar’s Arena, or the Fox Theater.",5

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Was nice in the past, but not this time","I like Aloft's and had stayed in this one before and liked it, but this time was different. First, I arrived and was given an ""interior"" room which I did not expect, without a nice view. I asked for another room and was told it was not possible. It was not clear from the booking that it was this type of room. Secondly, on the first day, housekeeping completely skipped my room. I left for work at 10am, not even later in the day and didn't have the DND sign on. The rest of housekeeping's duties during my stay weren't strong and left the room somewhat dirty. The HVAC system was difficult to use and was overall, cold, and windows didn't open - so there was no way to warm up without getting under the covers. Will not stay here again.",2

The renovation was handled very well, and I feel that all the special touches that made it so beautiful in its heyday are still highlighted. The reception is in a round desk toward the back of the main atrium area, and I have to say I just fell in love with Roxanne. What a nice girl.

I also agree that the staff was nice but that doesn't compensate for an OVERPRICED, barebones hotel. The price we paid, I was expecting a luxury, 5 star hotel but realistically, this place is 2-3 star tops; our room had PLASTIC cups and NO DRAWERS.  Where are yo supposed to put your clothes.?

The hotel itself is a renovated office building from the early 1900s and beautifully done.  After the game, we walked around the surrounding area, which seems to be a very up and coming area with lots of restaurants and bars and dance clubs.

While the hotel was impressive and room large, many of the details didn’t hit the stop. Prior to my stay I called to ask whether my corner king was a suite with a door separating the bedroom from the rest of the room. Unfortunately the “suite” was sitting area with no door (and not as advertised). The room was also not the best for sleeping.

The hotel itself is gorgeous and in a perfect location!  The Fox was a 5 minute walk, the People Mover and QLine are both *right there* and being able to valet the car instead of searching for parking was much appreciated.  We loved our corner room and had great views of the city from the 7th floor.  We also had a great time at the Wxyz bar, although we took our drinks out into the quiet, comfy lobby area.

I called in advanced and they assured me each room had a fridge with a small compartment for the icepack, if that wansn't enough, to ask the front desk to put them in the freezer. The front desk person repeated that the room fridge had the compartment when I checked in. Not only the room fridge doesn't have the compartment, but the hotel isn't capable of keeping them for me.

The lobby is, dare I say, breathtaking. If you've stayed in an Aloft before, you'll be delighted to see that the rooms - while containing all the Aloft items you'd expect - are seemingly many different shapes. I've stayed here twice and the first time we had a room that had a sitting/living room. The second time it was an ""L"" shaped room looking onto the interior space. Nice staff running the place.  My only qualm with the hotel and the Aloft brand in general is the breakfast options. They've added some breakfast 'cups' here which are fine, but it's a bit too DIY for me early in the morning.",4
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Cool hotel, great location, noise opportubites","Overall I enjoyed this stay as this Aloft was placed inside an older building that was renovated. My score is not reflective of the service, mostly stems from the noise outside from the overnight construction as it was audibly noticeable. Didn’t know that it was occurring until it woke me up, so a heads up (though not required) would have been appreciated.   Room and service were on point for the Aloft brand and the room was clean (standard king bed), spacious and high ceilings. WiFi worked great and nice Bliss amenities. Shower shampoo and soap was a little confusing. Dispenser both said all in one shampoo and conditioner stickers, but one liquid was blue and one was white. Was it the same?

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Just ok,"The hotel is in a good location to the ball park, but for the price I would not do it again. The carpet is dirty & frayed. You do not have a bathroom door that shuts & locks, nope it slides & no lock. Just not impressed & believe me it is pricey. ",3
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Perfect location,Came in for a Red Wings game near the end of the season and we were anxious to see both Little Caesars Arena as well as Aloft.  The hotel was beautiful and Jordan and the staff were extremely kind and helpful.  The room (suite) was spacious and nicely appointed and our room looked out toward Comerica Park which is another landmark very close by.  Went around the corner to Small Plates for a quick bite before the game and from there it was a short walk to the Arena.  Stopped at nearby Cliff Bell's for a nightcap and some jazz afterwards and enjoyed a couple of breakfast options the next morning in the room off the main lobby.  Great addition to Detroit's hotel options and as the title suggests it puts you within walking distance of so many things to see and do.,5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Good experience ,We had booked five rooms in this hotel. It’s really good. Ambience is great. Rooms are comfortable. Location too is good. Across the road there are many eateries too.But bathrooms cannot be locked.  Breakfast is average.,4
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Surprisingly Bad,"I made a reservation for my Fiance and used my SPG -Starwood guest points for what I assumed would be a pleasant stay for 04/26/18. There was no Internet Service and the phone did not work. The front desk said there was nothing they could do. She used her cell phone to contact the front desk supervisor (the evening of 04/26/18) to discuss the issue until the call dropped.  There was no follow up from the supervisor or any representative from the front office.  This was indeed a surprise in contrast to the other reviews I see here.   To Management: Both myself and the guest are very easy to please, however, some effort is expected and none was given this day.",1
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Can't Wait to Visit Again,"Staff:  Super pleasant, knowledgeable, and accommodating.  Made us feel special. Facility:  Gorgeous atrium, modern rooms, great views, secure elevators.  The best pillows of anywhere I have ever stayed.  Within easy walking distance of everywhere you need to be downtown. Lounge:  Limited selection, too small to have the DJ nights that it does.  But, again, within walking distance of numerous places to dine and drink.",5

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Top-notch service and a beautiful building,Stayed here two nights while exploring the city. It's a great spot for cab and uber pickup and there are several good restaurants nearby as well as shops and great architecture.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Location Location Location,"I haven’t visited my hometown in about 18 years, and Downtown Detroit has been through an INCREDIBLE transformation!  The only bad thing about this stay was that it was during a winter storm with out-of-season low temperatures of below zero! I quickly found out that the windows of my room were not equipped/rated for these below zero temperatures ( I could literally feel the breeze from outside coming through my windows)  This Aloft is located across the street from Comerica Park, so if you are a baseball fan I highly recommend you here!!!  Now got the Hotel itself: This inner city/downtown hotel is a renovated office building.  It’s a very modern style w/the usual amenities!

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Great location and very cool retrofit of an old building!,"Went down to Detroit to catch the Leafs play the Wings over Family Day weekend.  Picked this location based on proximity and the price fit the bill.  The location is perfect for just walking over to the new Little Caesars Arena. Amazing facility - you must check it out if you're a hockey fan.   The lobby is very cool as the inside is basically a hollowed out 4-story building with a glass roof that has rooms ringing the outer wall.  I stayed on the 3rd floor and it seemed like I was almost sleeping in one of the offices. The rooms are quite spacious and I really liked the layout. The only issue I had was with the very tall windows and that the curtains didn't quite block out all sunlight, so either in the mornings or if you wanted a nap in the afternoon, odds are you'd eventually…",4
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Had another awesome night at Aloft!,Spent an amazing night at Aloft in Detroit a few weeks ago. The building is gorgeous and the service is absolutely spot on. Upon arrival the valet parking was very convenient. When we got to the front desk I recognized Jordan from the last time we had stayed back in June. He was again extremely helpful and made our stay the best it could have been. The building itself is absolutely beautiful with a very old classic feeling in the lobby and hallways but a few clean and modern look to the rooms. Ours had an awesome view of the city. I will definitely be returning to Aloft the next time I stay in Detroit.   Peter,5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Excellent weekend at a great property,"Friendly check-in, accommodated 3 of us to be on same floor. Great views of the ball park.

Would not hesitate to recommend this place or stay again when in Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,We were there for our granddaughter's wedding and it was perfect.,"This is an old office building remodeled to be a hotel.  It was wonderful.  You can walk down to the business/restaurant area in the center of Detroit.  Fox Theatre is just down the street.  Across the street is the Opera House, Ford Field and Comerica Park.  Very close is Caesars Arena.  It is a perfect location.  It was very clean and the people at the reception desk were very helpful.",5

My room was located at the 4-th floor, which gave an amazing view at the lobby below. Room was huge. Bathroom was nice and clean. Big Queenside bed. The room had a nice view on the baseball stadium. At the ground floor of the hotel you can find a coffee shop and bar. Breakfast sandwiches and good coffee served from there. As we had an unexpected meeting in the morning and needed a separate room to meet, the staff was very helpful and gave us a meeting room on the LG floor for free! Amazing service level!! Will come back for sure.",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Nice stay in the D,"The Aloft Detroit is an odd place. The rooms are large, yet it's obvious that this is a restored old building. The windows are original, so any stay here in the winter means the rooms are very drafty---cold by the windows and warmer near the door. My room had a portable space heater to help the regular heater keep up. The real disappointing thing is that they still have not opened the regular restaurant. There's a nice bar, but the food selection there is limited to whatever the bartender can microwave. I've stayed here several times and it's quite convenient for my needs. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It's not nearly as nice a hotel as the MGM, but certainly on par with the Marriott Ren Cen or the Courtyard Marriott.  ",4
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Excellent Customer Service,Hotel is great.  Very clean and within walking distance (even with little ones!) to places like Little Caesars Arena.    Rooms are spacious and well appointed.  We had an issue with the first room we were assigned.  I bumped into Sylviya and her colleague in the hallway.  They came and checked on the room and agreed that there was a mechanical issue and quickly reassigned us to a new room.    Great experience with the aloft Detroit. Will definitely return when in Detroit again.,5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Excellent!,"Quick stay (only 1 night) but really enjoyed this hotel. Has great 'bones,' as they say - hotel is located inside the David Whitney building right off of Woodward. Lobby is very nice as are the guest rooms. I was upgraded to a suite (see pics) on the 4th floor which is still in the old building; the hotel extends up past the 9th or 10th floors in a new tower. On the ground floor, you have a small coffee bar and a nice sized bar. This area is being slowly reclaimed but you're still hard pressed to find a good breakfast place nearby.  That being said, the hotel is well located - a Quick 10 minute walk to Comerica or Little Caesar's Arena and its right by the Peoplemover, if you need to get to Cobo Center or elsewhere. Would definitely return if I needed a hotel in downtown Detroit.",5

Not only was he professional but very helpful and personable as well.  I single out Parker, who was great, but every instance where we interacted with the staff of this wonderful hotel was great.  I can't stress enough how welcome we were made to feel and how polite and genuine everyone was.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,No Hotel for Sleep,"I spend the last 4 nights in this Hotel. Considering the price it was pretty standard. The people are friendly and gave no reason for complains. The main issue are the rooms. Despite they are good sized, there is no real space for putting things away. Just enough closet space for 3 shirts to hang. No dresser, no option for even putting something into a drawer. The safe is in the way for a sliding door of the narrow mini closet. The sliding glas door to the toilet does not seal at all for smells or noises. However, the by far most disturbing and real unaffordable topic is the extreme loud screaming and low efficient air conditioning / heating system. Who is able to sleep in this room deserves a medal in being extra deaf. Obviously this issue is known since after I made a comment…",2

The rooms are humongous. If you are an spg elite member, or getting a suite, you will likely have the largest hotel room in Detroit.   Love # 2- the staff is awesome. Brian the evening manager, Roxanne, Laura the corporate manager and the entire staff are extremely friendly and welcoming.   Love #3- location is so convenient.

The room is divided by a large wall with the beds on one side- with windows/view, TV and desk, etc. while the sink is against the entry wall, on the other side of the separated bed space. Even better... the toilet and shower are behind a heavy sliding door.

We asked her for a fun, dive-y bar to visit when we got back from the show after midnight and she knew the perfect place that was right behind the hotel, but difficult to find due to the weird layout of the streets in the area. She literally walked us there to make sure we found it! I seriously can't get over how awesome she was!   The lobby is breathtaking. The original features throughout the hotel have been beautifully preserved and restored.…",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Spectacular architecture, great location","Stayed here for my third anniversary and it exceeded my expectations in many ways, though there were a couple of disappointments.   First the good: - Friendly service: from the check in experience to the valet service, I was pleased with the friendly & helpful nature of staff. - Spacious: I stayed in a suite and it was incredibly spacious with a great view of the city. - Location: the location couldn't be better: a short Uber ride or 10-15 minute walk gets to to Greektown. Near the hotel are a number of restaurants & shopping too.  - Architecture: the building itself is spectacular! See my photos ;)   Now the disappointments: - Bathroom: I'm not a fan of the dunk being outside of the bathroom.

Excellent valet services  Location, Location, Location  Hmms:    Room decor doesn’t seem to match the classic feel of the public spaces.    Starwood (mid quality) hotel and service level.  Not impressed with check in, no bell service, small public food and drink areas.   Dirty windows  Mid grade quality fixtures.    Focus on service of following rules and policies rather than trying to make my stay memorable and expectation exceeding.   Overall.   Not a bad place, great option for most.

I was so surprised by the entry experience - into a huge glass-covered atrium, with comfortable seating, a great bar that has access to a patio on the street.  I'm an architect and so I love it when I see old buildings that have been re-purposed into cool new places.  The staff are so helpful, and recommended an excellent restaurant nearby.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Classic mixed with modern,This is a interesting location for a hotel. As a classical building that were originally for businesses it's oddly amusing. Bedrooms are in areas that used to be office spaces.   Comfort - 4 Rooms are a typical aloft room that are placed into office spaces. Rooms are nice and spacious. Bathrooms are just a tad small  Cleanliness - 4 It must be a pain to keep the marble floors clean but I have to give them props for keeping things tidy. Rooms were clean but not spic and span  Location - 4 In a central location for downtown Detroit. Nice and trendy and good for a theatre night.   Will return to see how they improve. The potential to be a boutique hotel is very high,4

I was impressed by the Aloft in Chicago- so we decided to stay here.  The building is great- and the location as well.    Arrival was easy- valet went quick, and pick up was smooth.   Check-in was standard, although our room we booked was not the room we were checked into.  We brought it up at check-out and were given a discount on the rate (rightfully so, we paid the rate for an ADA room and not a King Suite).  Staff was helpful in making the adjustment.    I found the room to be well done.  The bed, pillows & linens were very nice.   Didn't need the wifi in the room as the LTE signal was sufficient.

We hadn't been back to Detroit in many years and were pleased to stay downtown.  The lobby of hotel is beautiful.  It seemed as though the design kept the basic floor plan of the offices with a large entry way to the room, perhaps where the receptionist used to sit.  The room was comfortable and quiet, just fine for the two of us. We liked the location and the helpful staff.",4
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Gorgeous restoration in the lobby.  Luxury ends there.,"We had stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac before and had a good experience.  Decided to trying out the Aloft this time, after reading many positive reviews.  For the relative price in Detroit, we expected a reasonably upscale experience for our family of 4.   First and foremost, the receptionist gave us the wrong room.  We reserved a room via a reservation engine.  When we got upstairs we were given an drab atrium view room (yes you stare at each other).  Called and receptionist just said it was simply not available.  Since I prepaid more for a room with a view, I would not let it go.  Finally they admitted that there was miscommunication, and moved us.  Oh yes, the friendly receptionist asked why we were in town- when I gave our reason (which was not a happy one), and he simply…",3

This building, like many around it in downtown Detroit have been/are being restored to reflect the Detroit of tomorrow.    The second you arrive you realize that this hotel is located in a piece of Detroit's rich history.  Build almost 100 years ago, the renovations have kept the best from the past and added a cool, urban twist as well.  Marble floors, original water fountains in the hallways, a glass ceiling that encompasses the entire lobby, and that clock (you'll know once you go).  This Starwood property is definitely in a league of it's own.  Pretty much 5 minutes from every major venue (Comerica, Ford Field, Fox Theatre, new Little Caesars arena, Detroit Opera House).

Its makes a great first impression. the staff are kind and professional and checking in is a breeze. the lobby bar is bright and inviting and was a great setting for drinks before dinner at a local restaurant. The rooms are spacious and modern with all the necessary accoutrements for a business traveller.   The only part that I felt lacking was the food ""outlet"". Its hard to define what it is exactly - part convenience store, part take out window. Overall, I'm not sure I liked the concept and would have preferred a sit down cafe. that said, I give the hotel credit for trying a new concept.",4

Also, the hotel is in a great part of town in the middle of the action as well as located in cool, historic building.

The location was ideal for us because we were there for a Tiger's game, and the hotel is an easy, safe, five-minute walk from the ball park. My only complaint with the hotel concerns the reservations process. I booked a room for one adult and two young children months in advance, reserving a room with two queen beds.

The valet team is great pull up and they take care of everything.  The front desk crew is fantastic, where to go, the best restaurants in the area etc....

The beds were of average comfort but I have to admit the pillows were very flimsy, they hung over my hands when I picked them up. I believe they are in need of replacement.   Another positive about the room was the cool sink and shower design. The water got warm quickly and I liked the added touch of the in shower shampoo and soap dispensers.

Were it not for Inman especially and Kaylynn I would have spent the night wandering the streets of Detroit.  Not only did they go above and beyond in helping me decipher which room my friends were in, they also offered excellent company and service the likes of which I have never received from a hotel in my life.  Because of them, I will be staying at Aloft Detroit for all of my future hotel needs, and strongly…",5

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Stunning (Aloft) Hotel,"I frequently stay at SPG hotels, and this Aloft impresses unlike any other.  While the services and amenities are classic Aloft, the building is uniquely Detroit.  The hotel comprises the first few floors of the beautiful David Whitney Building, in a great downtown location along Grand Circus Park.  Each room is a renovated 1930s style office building, redecorated with Aloft decor. The location is well connected, with an on-site people mover stop, and street car stop across the street.  If you are in Detroit, you can't go wrong with the Aloft.",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,I expected much more from this hotel. Disappointed.,"I was very much looking for a trip to Detroit because of staying in this hotel.  But to the great regret the hotel did not live up to my expectations. The building of the hotel is really very beautiful, but the hotel does not have a restaurant neither even a normal bar. The hotel room looks modern but it is much smaller than I thought. The view is completely disgusting (it's a shame to have a view of the courtyard, when everyone writes about a wonderful view of the city). And the most unpleasant for me turned to be service. When settling in, the receptionist reported on a free breakfast (by the way terrible, a bagel or a sandwich and that's all). And the next morning after we had it we were asked to pay 7 dollars! It's a shame because it was not so tasty at all and the reception…",2

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Location, location, location - and really, really cool","Aloft Detroit is one of my favorites.  It's really a toss-up between Aloft and the Book Cadillac for the best Detroit hotel.    Aloft clearly wins for location.  Located on Grand Circus Park, Aloft is ideal for Tiger and Lions games, or shows at the Fox or Fillmore.  For any of these, you're literally steps away.  There is also a People Mover stop adjacent to the hotel, for a quick ride to Greektown (casino!), Cobo Hall (Auto Show!), and Joe Louis Arena (Hock . . .  er, never mind).  And the Q-Line stop is across the street, linking you to Masonic Temple, the District (Wings!  Pistons!  Kid Rock!), and others.  It's probably the most conveniently located hotel in the city, as far as accessing entertainment venues.  Aloft is in the David Whitney Building, a beautifully-restored…",4

I liked: the building (a lot), room size, accessible coffee and tea in the lobby, public areas, wifi.  I wasn't as fond of: dark rooms, particularly with a lamp that didn't work and a ceiling fixture flickering in and out; noise from the street and also the atrium; curtains that let in light from the street. The room cleanliness was ok, but I have had better. The location is convenient for lots of activities. I would not hesitate to stay here again but would not rush to do so either.",4

The ambiance of the David Whitney Building is interesting. The lobby is large, open and bright. The refreshment shop is well done. We did not visit the bar but it appeared busy. The large space east of the lobby was used for opening day for the Tigers and empty thereafter. The rooms with city views are larger than we expected for an Aloft (NYC being the comparison).

It was really only noticeable when we first walked into the room, we acclimated to it pretty quickly.  Also, you're definitely paying a premium for the location, it was a pretty pricey room.  For us, however, it was well worth it!",4

So many entertainment venues such as Comerica Park, the Detroit Opera House, Ford Field just a 5 minute walk away.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The architecture is breathtaking in this old gem.  I am absolutely in love with the concept of the ALoft Hotels. Taking old historic buildings in revitalized metropolitan areas and repurposing them, but with top notch style and convenience.   The elevators were super cool with heavy metal doors and marble floors. Rooms were very comfortable with chic style, and comfy Heavenly Beds. The lobby doesn't quite have the vibe of a W, but a few more couches and comfy nooks to sit in and socialize and it would be there. An A++++ find in downtown Detroit!!    And major kudos to Bernadine the night…",5

The rooms are very modern and trendy.  Our room (on the 8th floor) had a very nice view of Comerica Park.  It was an easy walk to most of the major venues along the Woodward corridor.  The bed/pillows were soft and comfy.  I'd stay here again, however, it is very pricey ($200 +).",5

Casey at the lounge was friendly and great. Everything is clean, great location and quiet rooms.",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney, Too expensive for the experience. ,This hotel is mixed.  It is absolutely young and trendy.  But offers very few amenities for the price.  The room is very quiet and pretty comfortable.  Staff are a bit distant and the only shampoo was a shampoo/conditioner cross.  It is a mix of posh and very basic for a high price.  ,3
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Nearly great,The rooms are big and spacious as this is an artful restoration of a cool building. The staff we great and the feeling very welcoming. It is let down by very noisy heating and a couple of other details- all of which were taken on board by the staff. I will stay here again. Btw there is no restruant in the hotel-but good local cafes for breakfast ,4

Missing out!,"After attempting to make a reservation at the Book Cadillac (sister company), we were referred to the Aloft.  After our first visit to Aloft I'm sure we'll never return to the Cadillac.  The architecture and story behind the place is just amazing. From the entrance to the elevators the place screams with history.   The location can't be beat, just steps away from Comerica Park and the entertainment district.  Plus having a People-mover stop right inside the hotel is very convenient.  The rooms were top notch, very trendy and very clean. Extremely comfortable beds and a shower that I didn't want to leave.

Had a fabulous meal at Vicente's (Latin/Cuban....the mojitos are fab)  Disliked noise from the street and the people mover (bring earplugs).  A bit quiet in the neighborhood hood during our stay Monday-Wednesday.   I would hesitate to walk alone.    Low water in shower meant it took forever to rinse shampoo from hair.  Sink is in room and toilet and shower in a separate room.

The new room was perfect and the view was gorgeous! In the evening, we went down to the lounge where the kids were excited to find board games and a pool table. The bartender Casey was fantastic!

Both of these souls radiated such welcoming and positive energy that we literally felt like we had known them our whole lives!

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Very Cool Hotel in Historical Building,"The David Whitney building was built in 1921 and renovated in 2014 to build the Aloft. Still intact are the marble stairs, windows, roof and art deco architecture. The exterior of each guest room reminds you of an office, very hip and cool.   The rooms are still new and very nice. Downside is the noisy AC reminiscent of the old Holiday Inn rooms, plastic drinking cups at the sink (c'mon, those need to go) and water-saving shower head which is terrible.   Unlike many other Alofts, there is no pool or open-air entertainment area. There is a nice bar with pool table open until 2AM. There is also a gym in the lower level about 20% filled with equipment. At least it is new and they have yoga mats.   There is no restaurant although they have a 24-hour panty with coffee and snacks. Be…",4

We valet parked, which was the smoothest valet I've ever encountered, and got checked in.  We had two rooms, one double for the kids and an adjoining king for us.  Super clean and comfortable rooms.  I didn't care for the in room coffee so we ended up heading out to ASHE Supply Co. which was super close.  We walked everywhere, this really is a great location.  Staff was super friendly and the building is gorgeous.  The main desk didn't really fit, but when has that ever made or broke a hotel deal.  We plan to come back to town to check some other attractions out and will definitely be back.",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,New and interesting,"We decided to try the Aloft Detroit and were very pleasantly surprised.  The rooms are different; the bedroom and sitting room are big, but not the bathroom area, apparently due to the building's earlier life as a medical office building.

The lobby is huge, with high ceilings.  It's truly amazing to just stand there and soak it all in.  The photos on the listing don't do it justice.  My room was clean, neat, and had a great view of the ballpark.  I slept very well.  It was a typical Aloft room - hip, trendy, and with a nice sized bathroom.    The staff were very friendly; I was well taken care of at the front desk.  I really wish I could've stayed longer to just walk around and soak in the beauty of this renovated building.",5

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Okay hotel, very expensive, but a great location","I gave this hotel a 3 mostly because of the price.  The rooms are okay; nothing horrible and nothing spectacular.  The real appeal is the architecture of the historic building, along with the location.  It is a three minute walk to the Fox, the Filmore, and some pretty good restaurants.   The last time we stayed, we paid about $180 for a Sunday night, but the room itself is really only worth about $120.  The prices have gone up since we first stayed there, so we probably won't be staying again.  I recently tried to book a Tuesday in May and couldn't touch a room for less than $391.  The kind of room you get is definitely not worth that much. Oh, and I do want to say that the staff is really, really good.

The ceilings in this hotel are very high as well which contributes to the very ""grand"" feeling you get while staying here. This hotel is a treat and I recommend staying here not only for the rooms and architecture but also for the prime location downtown.

Absolutely beautiful venue conveniently located within walking distance from both Comerica Park and Ford Field (and soon Little Caesar's Arena). The hotel has taken the lower levels of the David Whitney Building, with amazing remodeling of the prior office spaces. As a preferred guest, I was upgraded to a suite. Can't stop saying good things about this place. Only downside is if you use the valet parking and want to leave after a sports event, it may take a while before you get your car... but no problem, you can relax and have a drink at the bar (located on the first floor).",5

Our room was on the 9th floor, the highest the hotel had to offer.  We had a magnificent view of the Comerica Park, and in the distance, the Music Hall building.  The room was beautifully decorated, but functionally sucked.  I am baffled on why no one commented the rooms lacked a lot of storage. Maybe I don't like living out of a suitcase?    Aside from storage it also lacked insulation from the cold weather, and from the noise.  We could hear the giggling women the dog barking that was 4 doors away, and as you stepped closer to the window, you could feel the temperature drop.    As for storage space the closet held, if lucky, a handful of dress shirts or dresses, or a couple of heavy coats. Key word, ""OR"" not and. …",4

We were assigned a room on the 5th floor looking into the interior ""open"" space of the building.  The room was very dark and felt claustrophobic, almost like we were in a basement.  The windows were near the ceiling and if the shades were left open, you could look directly into the rooms of other guests (and other guests could look down into the room) so keeping the shades closed was a must...thus again adding to the darkness and closed in feeling.  So we requested a room change and were given a room with a view of Comerica Park. …",4

When we bought tickets to see John Oliver on New Years Eve, my wife and I decided to make it into a short getaway and not worry about driving home. I checked out the casino hotels, which were all exorbitantly priced, and since we are not gamblers held little appeal outside of swankier rooms. The Aloft, is perfectly located. Within walking distance to our show at the Fox Theatre, as well as one of our favorite restaurants, Angelina's Italian Bistro. It is also within walking distance to many excellent restaurants and night spots, as well as Comerica Park, Ford Field, and soon the new Little Ceasars Arena.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Very cool hotel,Stayed here's for a night after staying at MGM.  Must say we much more enjoyed our stay at Aloft than MGM.  Had had 8th floor corner room with a beautiful view of the ball park.  The room was great with an extremely large couch along the windows.  Very old historic building turned modern in the rooms.  Only complaint is that the rooms are drafty which made them cold even with the heat blasting.  Would come back here for another stay anytime!,5

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Beautiful Building, Great Location, but don't expect Luxury","The building is a beautiful renovation of a historic facility, and looks like it could house a luxury hotel, but the rooms are typical of the Aloft chain--comfortable, pared down, compact, with minimal amenities (plastic cups, no lush towels, etc.). Ours had a terrific view of the baseball park--you could read the scoreboard--and it's in a lively area very close to parks, sports facilities, theaters and restaurants. Service was friendly.

The valet was very attentive and we were able to check in and go to the Lions game very quick!! (About 5 mins). I didn't notice if this hotel advertised the proximity to the people mover prior to booking, so we were so suprised to see that it is actually connected to the lobby!! (Huge bonus!)

Walked 2 minutes to The Fox for a show, but just as close to the ball fields or anything else you'd want to do.  The staff, all of them from the valet to the front desk were SUPER friendly and helpful.  The room was very modern and clean.  For less than half the price of all the casino hotels, this place rocks.

Lots of pubs and restaurants nearby, Comerica Park is right there. Close to Joe Louis Arena.  The only downfall is the service at the lobby bar. The bartender was miserable.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Highly recommend - gorgeous boutique hotel in awesome location ,"Was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel! It was the lowest priced option between the Book Cadillac and Marriott RenCen, so we decided to give it a try. The location was incredible, service was top notch, and the vibe of the hotel was great! Bliss Spa toiletries, incredible views, and an awesome location. Highly recommend. The one downside is that the beds aren't as comfortable as the Marriott or true W beds, but still very nice! ",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,EXCEPTIONAL PLACE TO STAY IN DETROIT,"My wife and myself are staying here and we having great experience.  We came in a little earlier than check-in time is, so we called ahead and they were very accommodating!  Once we arrived we were greeted by two beautiful smiling young ladies.  They gave us an upgrade because the room we were going to be in wasn't ready and we were staying for 5 days.  After receiving our keys they gave us a rundown of the hotel amenities and some local restaurants.  Our only issue was the valet, it is pretty expensive.  At first the service we were receiving was not commensurate to what we expected with that price tag.  My wife had to go to the valet day time supervisor.  The supervisor did what any GOOD supervisor would do, which is apologize for the service.  She even went beyond our…",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Great service, great location ","We stayed for two nights, and everything was great.  I'd read reviews saying there were no bellhops and was not expecting help with bags, but the valet staff were so friendly and helpful, they offered to help with bags multiple times. The valet was fast too, and very professional. The room was clean and modern. It was quiet in the halls even though the hotel was sold out. Kalynn at the front desk exceeded my expectations. My son left his favorite stuffed animal in the room after checkout and as soon as he realized it was missing and started panicking,  we called the front desk from the car on the way home. She quickly had housekeeping search the room and found doggy! Review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the location of this hotel. It is within walking distance or a…",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Amazing Stay!!,First visit to the Aloft. Spent the night to celebrate a special occasion. The Hotel Staff couldn't have been nicer! From Nolan at the bar to Tracey with my who assisted with special details. A great experience!! I will definitely return!,5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Lovely weekend stay,We had a wonderful stay at the Aloft. Just a quick weekend visit now that we are empty nesters. The hotel is beautiful. We were most impressed with the service. We had a lovely evening at WXYZ. Andre and Nolan took exception care of us and really made our stay fantastic. We are already planning a return trip in the spring.,5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Mrs Jeffrey Wright,"We purchased this stay for our daughter and son in law for part of her birthday gift. We also purchased them great seats at the Tigers baseball game that they were able to walk to from the hotel. The manager on duty was so accommodating she upgraded their room and made sure they had a room facing the baseball field when she found out it was her birthday celebration. (I wish I could recall her name) The kids enjoyed cocktails and pool in the hotel lounge, where she was treated by the bartender to a birthday cocktail. The entire staff was so gracious and accommodating. Many thanks for making her day special. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,An unexpected gem in downtown Detroit!,"My wife loved our stay at this hotel. It is a residence as well, so there were some canine friends walking around the lobby with their owners, which my wife absolutely loved. WXYZ Lounge had a great vibe and pretty cool bartenders. Room 521 had an amazing view of Comerica Park on the right, and upcoming development on the left... which in our opinion was a representative juxtaposition of downtown Detroit. The room itself was HUGE, I think that was because it was a corner room. Just a short walk down the street was a Nike store, and a Moosejaw store of all things. There is so much development going on, I anticipate that could very well rival Chicago's Michigan Ave. within 5 years. Lastly, the hotel is connected to a People Mover stop which is a great way to get over to Greektown…",5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Great location. Beautiful building.,"Went to Detroit to watch a Lions and Red Wings Game. Very close to Ford Field. Probably a 15 min. walk to Joe Louis. The People Mover comes right to the hotel, but really the location is sooo good we found it easier (and maybe quicker) to just walk. The hotel is a real stunner. They have done a tremendous job. Valet parking was $30 per night, but they were fast and professional. Well worth the $. Room was very nice. Beds were comfortable and quiet.   Cons -  We had loads of trouble with our bill. It was inaccurate at check-out. They agreed and corrected, but credit card statement was again inaccurate. I think it is corrected finally. Staff are friendly, but not knowledgeable about the hotel or surrounding area. The lighting was quirky. Hard to explain, but it was an ""all or…",4
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Great Hotel! Great Staff! Excellent Location!,I love these hotels!  Very urban and convenient. The staff is great only drawback is no room service.

"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,So much to do ,Brought my daughter to Detroit for YOUMACON convention. Love this hotel would highly recommend close to all the sports venues and museums. Soft comfy beds. Super clean rooms. Quiet and relaxing rooms. The lobby wow gorgeous!!!  You can definitely get a vibe of Detroits history in this building. ,5
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,Excellent Service,"I recently stayed here with my two sisters for a concert at the Fox Theater and a Lions football game. The location was great for both as it is only a few blocks away from each location. Our stay was quiet and we liked the old office building feel of the hotel. The service at the front desk was always excellent. Having the People Mover in the building was also a plus. The main draw backs are the lack of a restaurant (and the options nearby are somewhat limited, especially on the weekends) and the layout of our room. I realize the new ""modern"" concept is to be open, but there was no door between the bedroom and the sink. Plus the wall separating the two did not connect to the ceiling. The result was if one of us got up at night we could not turn on a light or it would wake…",4
"Detroit, MI",Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,"Great location, spacious rooms, friendly staff!","We stayed at the Aloft while attending a football game at Ford Field. Just a short walk to a football or baseball game makes it a perfect choice. Rate was reasonable, and our room was huge. I believe it was just the standard size room, but it had its own living room area and large bedroom area. Bed was super comfy. Staff was friendly and gave us great recommendations on where to eat. Also, valet parking free with your stay, super convenient for a sporting event. We arrived we'll before ck in. The valet took our car and the concierge held our bags till after the game. Nice little bar on site to end the night with a night cap. Overall great stay, and would definitely book again in future. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Fantastic vacation in our own city,"We stayed here for one night--New Year's Eve, just to have a special get-away and dinner.

It had been a moved reservation from July to celebrate our 35 anniversary. We really wanted the whole stay at the cool hotel and eat at the cool Apparatus Room restaurant experience. Despite the restaurant being closed, we Were able to have an even cooler experience with a private dining room! That was so romantic and the food was amazing. We are discriminating wine drinkers and the bottle we had ordered had been sold. The wine steward offered a higher quality substitute for the same price.

This hotel offered peace and a lovely nights sleep while we dealt with a stressful situation. The staff are friendly and the rooms are clean and comfortable.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Excellent!,"Ideal location and facilities could not have been better.  Restaurant was being visited by many outsiders, proving that it was as high quality as anything in the area. As good as the Highlands (without the view) but at half the cost. Hotel and the restaurant well worth the cost.  We have stayed in hotels in many cities and countries and this was among the best!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A Detroit Must!,"It is evident Detroit is booming back, and the Detroit Foundation Hotel is evidence of this. The hotel is chic, featuring Detroits cultural impact and history with their decorations to their physical set-up. The staff were incredible; they were kind, welcoming, attentive, and enforced the mask mandate to ensure guests and staff are as safe as possible. The Apparatus Room, the hotel's restaurant/bar was incredible! The decor, staff, and options were excellent. If you are ever visiting Detroit, go out of your way to stay here. You will not be disappointed.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Awesome,Amazing hotel.  Smartly designed and appointed.  Beautiful art and cool rooms.  Car alarms and lock beeps from adjacent lot sucked.  It seemed like the valet was finding cars that way...ugh.  Loved it otherwise!!!,4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beautifully designed building,"We have stayed at this property at least 5 times since 2018. We love the character of the building, design of the rooms, convenient location, and service from the staff. I will say that it was a much more special experience in 2018 than it is today. Staff welcomed us back on our second visit, there used to be a house Navigator that could drive you to places locally, we were surprised with drinks in our room and upgraded rooms. While the staff is still very attentive, it doesn’t feel over the top special anymore.  There’s great food in the area. We walked to Prime & Proper, Leila, Townhouse, and the Apparatus Room at the hotel is good too. We took an Uber to Seva and Sugar House. It was fine, but after having the DFH Navigator drive us places in the past, a smelly Corolla Uber…",4

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Best Hotel & People in Detroit,"I hate that it has taken me so long to write a review about Detroit Foundation Hotel. After years of traveling to Detroit for work, The Foundation Hotel changed the game for my hotel stays. They are literally rewriting history with this hotel.   All that said, it took me leaving to realize just how much I had in the first place - the grass is not always greener. Unfortunately, during one of my trips in I found that this hotel was booked up so I took it as an opportunity to try the ""prestigious"" Shinola Hotel."" It was quite possibly one of the worst experiences I've had from barely being greeted upon a 11 PM ET check-in, to someone trying to barge into my room to being double charged for minibar items... it was one disappointment after another.   So here's what I have to say…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Stay here!!!,"The Foundation is in a great location for  your downtown Detroit stay. Across from the TCF center, it is close to the river walk and downtown. The rooms are well appointed and warm. The history of the building is on display and compelling. And the staff meet and anticipate your every need. They were all so pleasant and go above and beyond to make your stay complete. Loved it!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,THE place to stay in Detroit,"Everything about this hotel was excellent! Staff, service, room cleanliness. I definitely recommend eating at the restaurant at least one night of your stay. The food was outstanding, and our sever was very knowledgeable. ",5

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Unique and Top Class,"I came to Detroit for a business trip and my husband joined me. The hotel is in a beautifully restored building with a unique look. Friendly and professional staff. Fabulous world-class restaurant. I would gladly stay here again. The only con was that our room faced a building that was under construction, and we were awakened before dawn by loud clanging noises.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Night Out,"Friendly staff, quick check in and out, nice roomy room, great staff and food in the Apparatus Room. Valet service was quick and convenient.  Loved the little museum area.  When sleeping though..fan  kept running for the heating system.  This can be good thing to keep air circulating but could hear it in the quiet time. Bed comfortable. Loved having bath sheets as opposed to just standard towels.  As with the rest of the hotels, price was on the very high side, supply and demand with all the activity at the different venues this weekend. Felt comfortable walking to Ford Field from here. Wasn't too far of walk to other restaurants or bars.  Really liked how the building was restored and the history was shown. Would stay here again!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Hotel stay,"My husband and I loved everything about this hotel. From the friendly valet staff, to the welcoming front desk staff, to the attentive bartenders, we couldn't have felt more at home. Our king suite was great and the hotel decor is beautiful. With Garth Brooks in town, we appreciated the free ""shuttle"" (luxury SUV) to the wedding venue, and didn't have to worry about finding an Uber. I highly recommend the Detroit Foundation Hotel.",5

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Converted Fire Station,"This 100 room hotel used to be a fire station - the main restaurant area is called The Apparatus Room and is where the fire trucks used to be kept. The bedrooms are spacious and well equipped, having retained original features of when they were offices etc. The staff are friendly and helpful.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing Boutique Hotel,I can not recommend this nostalgic hotel enough!  This was an old fire station converted into a hotel.  The history and the culture were absolutely amazing.  Hospitality was top notch.  Very cozy and clean rooms with a very comfortable bed.  Valet parking for the night was $35 which was convenient.  We will definitely return.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great old building has new life with great spaces,"Interesting hotel and well worth staying in. Great front check in- very personal ( although I wonder how they handle it if its crowded). The restaurant is in an incredible space ( where fire engines used to be housed in the 20s) and I will review that separately. It is a quirky place- get out on the 4th floor and there is an exhibit on the old fire house with original unifroms etc. On the third floor-it appears to be a small library- on the first floor, a small boutique shop with rather random things in it , right next to check in - men's suit jackets in I am not sure what sizes. The room was big and felt good- but somehwhat oddly decorated,. It felt like a lot of modern furniture sort of thrown together,  Your clothes are just hung in a small space out in the open- not sure it…",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Proof that Detroit is back!!,"I am still buzzing from my first-time visit to the Detroit Foundation Hotel, @detroitfoundationhotel, located in the heart of Detroit. This former 1920s Fire Station has been transformed into a stylish boutique hotel, with a cool vibe that radiates everywhere!! The meticulous restoration and rehabilitation have transformed this significant beauty into a modern hotel and restaurant, as well as unique pop-up stores. Many features of the original fire hall have been restored, such as the class red-brick facade, the huge arched fire engine doorways, and wait for it -- even the original fire poles inside the restaurant, The Apparatus Room. The staff are friendly, attentive, hip, and just awesome. My new BFF is Bradley Brummit, who personally took my family and I on a tour. Bradley…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Wow, wow, wow","I cannot say enough good about my experience at this hotel and restaurant.  It's a fabulous hotel and restaurant, and the food is incredible (ate here three times on a one night stay it was that good!), but the staff really deserves so much of the credit.  I was impressed with everyone I met and who assisted me during my visit.  I have been telling anyone who will care to listen about this place, my wonderful (one night) experience, and the fact that this gives me so much hope for my city of birth.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great time!,"Your entire staff, from the desk folk to the waitstaff to the valet guys, were very friendly, approachable, capable, and warm. It almost felt like family at times. We loved our experience. We loved your services and amenities. Decor spot on with our tastes. My steak was perfect. The bartenders, even when they were slammed with business, were friendly and willing to share their knowledge of cocktail mixing. Everything was clean. The only tricky thing was getting used to the Downtown street noise at night when it was time to sleep. Other than that perfect stay.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Excellent,"This is a very hip hotel in downtown Detroit without the attitude hipness.   it's an extremely solid choice. What for me was a stand out was the staff. I travel quite a bit and it's clear that there is an emphasis on training. Everyone that i encountered were professional, friendly - just excellent in every way. The absolute stand out is Alex Merced who works at the reception desk. I only wish I could write his performance review. This is a guy who proves the adage that the right person at the front desk - could absolutely make your stay. This exceptional individual had an amazing attitude - he loves his job and it shows. He engaged every guest he encountered. Getting to know what thier interests were and then offering up suggestions (resterautns, places to go) that I'm sure…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Good Position in the center,Very good location in the center of the city within walking center to where I needed to go.

The Valet guys are very helpful and diligent and the staff was very helpful. ,4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Love the Hotel,Just hated the noise Saturday... the party space directly above our room was distracting and annoying... we live the hotel and have never encountered this issue before... I believe it was poor planning having a party space over guest rooms.,4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Love The Foundation!,I could go on about how cool this hotel is: how beautifully designed & well positioned & how great the restaurant is...but the real pleasure is the sense of pride in the place: Detroit pride; pride in the myriad small businesses showcased there... and the pervasive sense from the kind and helpful staff that this hotel is onto something really special. We will be back!!,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Impeccable,"From the architecture and history, to the service and cleanliness...this location was absolutely perfect.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A solid choice.,"We booked to stay at the Detroit Foundation as part of a tour of the Midwest and stayed one night in one of their super king rooms. The hotel is clearly very recently renovated and the overall impression is very good. On arriving, we opted to valet but several others (I think most of whom were just using the service to dine at the hotel restaurant) arriving at the same time seemed to have sent the staff into meltdown and there was much running around and shouting which wasn’t a great first impression. Check in was smooth, however, and we were eventually on the way to our room. The room, at the end of a corridor and down some steps (it wouldn’t be accessible with mobility issues) on the third floor, felt at first quiet and spacious. The high ceilings and mid-century styling…",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Best of Detroit,"Just steps from Cobo, the People Mover station and the Qline tram, this modern stylish hotel is very easily accessed and central to all of Detroit's entertainments and, if thats why you came to town, the central business district.  The staff is very very professional and warm.  We loved our room which had so much character and comfort.  The Apparatus Room restaurant and lounge is an amazing space and the food is lovely.  Creativity and comfort made our weekend perfect.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Expectations Not Met,"We had previous eaten at the Apparatus Room and the food was outstanding. However this time around the menu was different and the food was mediocre. There's nothing worse than a chewy rib eye. The room itself was nicely designed by don't let that fool you. It was very loud, you could hear every car pass on the street below. Also the room seemed a little worn. Maintenance was definitely an issue. Overall its a nice hotel, but definitely not 5 star. ",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Excellence at its best,"I have stayed at the DFH several times. Each and every time it has exceeded my expectations. The attention to details and the use of local artists and collaborators elevates the experience, offering the best of Detroit. The rooms offer privacy and elegant comfort. And, the Apparatus Room offers one of the best dining and lounge experiences in Detroit. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Very cool boutique hotel in an old firehouse and office building,I stayed here for one night on business and would definitely come back.  The bar and restaurant are in an old firehouse that has been beautifully redesigned.  My room was large and comfortable with eclectic decor and upscale amenities.  Good workout room.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Holiday getaway,Spent our first Christmas away from home at this hotel and the staff could not have been friendlier on Christmas Eve or Day. They maintain the history and homage of the Detroit Fire Department (former headquarters) while transforming to a luxury hotel and restaurant/bar.  Their brunch is a well-kept secret with its quality and price. Will definitely return.,5

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Upscale is alive and well in Detroit,"The Foundation Hotel proves that Detroit is on the right track when it comes to the boutique hotel experience. On holidays with a friend, we made a pitstop in Detroit on our way to Chicago. The friendly hipster staff and vibrant character of the historic firehouse turned hotel made this a memorable stay. The rooms are contemporary and cozy. The spaces are filled with great local art. A large social hub within the hotel combines a lounge, bar and restaurant serving unique cocktails, small plates, and family style eats. A big shoutout to bartender Bree who was generous in sharing her local perspective on the best of Detroit--whether it be dancing and drinks at MotorCity Wine, Willis Show Bar for music, or The Standby for cocktails (check out The Belt). Thank you Bree! I recommend…",5

We've been to the Foundation before which we enjoyed which is keep me from giving this experience a 0. From about 12:30am to about 4am, we had people running up and down the halls drunkenly screaming and slamming doors. A girl was screaming and crying at some guy and both of them kept running to and from different rooms. I went down to the front desk to ask to have security come up and try and do something, which he did. But minutes after he left our floor, the ruckus continued. I called the front desk from my room to notify the front lady at the front desk that there were still people running and screaming, but she said there is nothing they could do and she apologized.

The way they’ve transformed the building is something very special.   The restaurant’s food was delicious.

The bar area is on one side of the room, and the restaurant is on the other side, with many long tables as well as some smaller tables and booths.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Detroit Haven,The Detroit Foundation Hotel is a remarkable renovation of a historic building. The rooms are minimally decorated but what is there is chic and comfortable. The proximity to a very good restaurant and comfortable bar is a major plus.

The Commissioner's Suite is simply stunning - a huge room with a pool table, it offered the perfect backdrop for my bride to get ready the day-of.

As other reviewers point out, it's a converted fire station, and lots of the old architectural and design amenities remain.  It also features lots of firefighter-related artifacts and newspaper clippings from conflagrations near and far.  Our room was sleek, modern, gorgeous, comfortable with all the amenities.  The first-floor restaurant is terrific, had a lovely lunch there.  Friendly check-in staff, and one major plus -- the hotel offers its own free Lincoln Continental car service within about a 3-mile radius.  The hotel just exudes coolness, but not in a W sort of way -- it's uniquely Detroit.  Can't wait to get back.",5

The design of the hotel is fantastic, the rooms are spacious and well appointed, and the food is delicious, but what really stands out is the warmth and positivity of the staff and the impeccable service they provided throughout. The staff must be exceptionally well trained and vetted for their ability to impart just impeccable service, from check in to room service and everything in between. I only docked it one point because the room wasn't entirely quiet at night, with any old building you might get settling noises and the such, but for people who aren't insomniacs that shouldn't be a problem.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beautiful Historic Hotel,"We stayed here as a treat while in town for a family event.  I love the hotel, how it was furnished, and how the rooms were outfitted.  We happened to come at a time when emergency road work was being done, and out room faced out to the street.  Generator noise all night long, not a fault of the hotel, but very annoying.  It was close to Woodward Avenue where we walked to for dinner and touring.  Everyone was very nice and accommodating.   I do wish that they had a lobby for guests of the hotel, there was only the area next to the bar, which was overrun with people and very loud. Dinner at the restaurant was okay, not great.  But the breakfast omelette was amazing, I would definitely go there again just for that.",5

Stayed at the Foundation hotel one night in transit, and it was a great way to stay central and get a good night's rest during our trip.  The room thermostat control range was defaulted to a 2degF window, which meant the fan came on regularly to regulate temperature.  A call down to the front desk made it possible to widen the controls.  ",5

We picked the Detroit Foundation Hotel, and could not have been more impressed across the board.  The staff was 100% friendly and helpful (shout out to Hamed).  The suite was modern, clean, and jammed with local touches that made us smile and go ""Wow!""  The restaurant and bar vibe was killer.  Especially Sunday brunch with a wonderful local jazz band that just made you want to soak in the moment forever.  My wife was loving her Bloody Mary; the kids were happy with their pancakes; and I was sipping a (who knew?) Detroit Bourbon, thinking to myself, ""it does not get any better than this."" Thank you Detroit…",5

From the moment my family walked into this hotel- which was once a massive Detroit fire station- we got a sense of how special this place is. The staff made us feel so welcome and although we had had a long day driving, we couldn’t resist the buzz from the bar/restaurant that opens onto the lobby, The Apparatus Room.  It was once the room where the fire engines etc were housed and still has the massive garage doors. The late evening menu was delicious. The guest rooms are gorgeous and the gym is also top notch. The decor all over the hotel is very cool and all the art and amenities pay homage to both Detroit’s history and to local artists and locally sourced products.

Front desk is unable to take care of this little request, which anywhere else gets solved in 5 minutes. But they just wouldn’t tell you. They will promise you it’ll be off in no time, but only so that you don’t call any more.

Sasha (Lauren) very friendly and knowledgeable, also enjoyed conversing with our bar back Steve, also very personable. Brunch however was not as good as dinner and did not compare. Food lacked flavor and was somewhat dry.

I travel a lot for work and am always on the look out for a hotel that effectively incorporates the local vibe and feel of the city into it's property - this certainly fits the bill!  The Property was a former Detroit Firehouse and is a wide open space with high ceilings and dripping all things Detroit.

Set in an old Firehouse a couple of blocks from the river that separates Detroit from Canada, this hotel is going to be a favorite for my wife and I. Located near a lot of activities, there is much to do within walking distances, including the river walk and Cobo Hall. Our room was huge, with very high ceilings and a cement floor. Bed is very comfortable, the bathroom is nicely appointed and has a large shower. Staff, from the valet workers to the front desk personnel have been very friendly, helpful and accommodating.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Fun, trendy, thoughtfully designed and decorated","We had come to Detroit to see what was happening, what was new, and whether we liked the direction the city was headed.  We had heard that Detroit Foundation Hotel was a good example of thoughtful repurposing of an older building and that's exactly what it was! The building, long long ago, was a firehouse we, were told.  Now it's a hotel designed to make you feel comfortable and to make you want to return.  A few examples of the design are that the third floor has an open library of NEW books, books that you'd really like to take a look at along with your hotel-provided glass of wine before dinner.  The books were clearly chosen with great care, all brand new, on various subjects such as design, history, art, which you could either take to your room or page through as you sipped…",5

Both times we had breakfast at the Apparatus Room, all the people at our table (two different couples) complained that the background music is too loud, especially first thing in the morning at breakfast.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Interesting but Overrated,"Loved the history and architectural interest of the building, room was spacious, and the staff were friendly. However, it simply wasn’t among the top hotel experiences I’ve had, which is what I was expecting at an average price of $450/night in Detroit. Like some other hotel experiences of late, there were no coffee makers in the room nor even a hot pot available to make hot water for tea. The Lincoln advertised for use getting around was not quite as available as promised. Services and amenities just seemed average. Room decor is decidedly modern industrial, with concrete floors, which was cold feeling to me. Barn door to bathroom is interesting, but difficult and loud to open - perhaps a maintenance item that could be fixed. Lobby is small and dark and loud and not…",4

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,First time staying,"I feel that this being a old fire station, they would have had fire fighting items throughout the building.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A glorious time.,"We spent our Anniversary here and had an absolutely wonderful time. Staff was so helpful and gracious, they even sent us chocolates and wine. The Apparatus Room was a wonderful dining experience and I highly recommend the Chef's Choices. The hotel provided a very nice car to take us to the Whitney as well. Within walking distance of beautiful Detroit landmarks. Just an excellent time overall. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beyond expectations!,"Loved the hotel decor and vibe! Received a warm welcome by all staff! They did a remarkable reno of this historic building, definitely not your typical boring chain hotel. Apparatus room was beautiful and the bartenders were so friendly! Used the comp car service to go for dinner. Room decor was awesome and very creative.   I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the frustrating A/C system. Its either freezing cold or blowing heat-even thought it was 90 degrees outside....couldn't just shut it off so we had a restless sleep. Front desk did adjust our bill slightly, which was appreciated and also shows me that they do care about guest satisfaction. I would stay again if visiting Detroit. ",4

As a whole, the room is very nice and the bed is comfortable.  The Apparatus Room provides really good service and a quality menu with a diverse drinks.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great hotel,"Very Detroit! Hip, edgy, cool, centrally located, clean. Air conditioning didn't work one night. Other than that, had a great vibe and energy, not to mention being housed in an historic fire department building.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Go Detroit,This is a fantastic property! The staff was professional and incredibly friendly. The restaurant is exceptional and very comfortable. Ed is integrated into the hotel in a very powerful way.There’s a lot to see in Detroit. Everyone should go.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"When in Detroit, stay at the Detroit Foundation Hotel","The Detroit Foundation Hotel is an excellent small hotel - 100 rooms - in the old Detroit Fire Station across from COBO and convenient to all downtown restaurants and offices. From front desk to doormen/valets, great place. A must stay.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Really noisy,"The hotel definitely looks nice, but for the price, I found the rooms looked pretty average. The air conditioner/fan that’s in the room, is so loud that it disturbs your sleep. And the controls for it either don’t work, or don’t make any sense.  Also, they don’t have their money own parking...which was pretty inconvenient.",2
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Must Try,"The large rooms are modern and sleek and the hotel is worth of a walk to take in the art. The Apparatus Room is a must for dinner.  The salmon, poached in butter, was amazing.  The craft cocktails are totally worth it and the pimento cheese is haunting.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Nice Hotel!,"Great location - close to downtown activities and close to river. Very clean! overall staff was friendly and accommodating. The rooms were comfortable and clean with the necessary amenities. I stayed for business trip, I would not reserve for family stay. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Stayed overnight after viewing the Detroit Fireworks.  Great place to stay.  Hip, comfortable, friendly and accommodating. I don't have anything more to say, just putting in filler to get to 200 characters.  This is a stupid rule.",5

They’ve done such an amazing job renovating the hotel and keeping true to its firehouse roots. Drinks were great and food was wonderful. Service was great as well. We have no complaints.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A most interesting renaissance building,Whoever designed this hotel using an old firehall had a wonderful imagination with most interesting results. It feels quirky but comfortable. The location is excellent and staff very welcoming. We hope to be back some day.,5

The venues for several gatherings throughout the weekend were perfect. The food was fabulous for each event.   ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Fantastic boutique hotel experience ,"When it comes to a boutique hotel stay, this gem exceeded my expectations in every way. The first things I look for are a unique vibe and attention to detail. The Foundation offered these in spades. From the huge red doors we encountered upon entering to the quirky, inviting lobby, to the floor to ceiling fire station windows in the bar, we really felt like we were stepping into an experience, not just a hotel. Funky artwork adorned the hip, urban lobby and bar. Friendly staff at the valet and front desk made us feel welcome right away. Even the stitching on the sumptuous leather interior of the elevator caught my eye and oozed understated luxury.   The room was well appointed but minimalist in a way that made you feel you were moving into a chic, urban loft. The concrete floors…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Memorable,Had a fantastic stay with wonderful service and excellent ambience. The bar layout and room decoration was particularly pleasing. The board rooms were very comfortable and views were good. However the air conditioner kept coming on regularly. ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing hotel,"1st class place. Staff to the quality of the renovation (was the former main Detroit fire hall), all is at such a high level! Part of the resurgence of Detroit as a ""world class city"". Restaurant gets loud on a busy night. The food tasted amazing, kitchen knows what they are doing! ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"...""just"" very good","I don't know why- everything was ""just"" very good.  Nothing was fantastic or mind blowing during our stay which makes this review difficult.  I suppose I was expecting more based upon the reviews and some of the recommendations I received while planning our trip.  I have nothing to really identify as being a bad experience so I am just at - very good.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Detroit Hotel,"I’ll start with a couple of negatives and get those out of the way:  In our guest room, the body wash had not been replaced after the previous guest.  I did not realize it until I was in the shower (as that’s where the toiletries are).  There was only about 1/4 of the bottle left.  The toiletries, although made in China (would be great to use a Michigan made product), were excellent.  Great aromas.  At breakfast in the Apparatus Room, the smoked salmon was excellent but it should not have taken 30-35 minutes to arrive.  We did not order anything that required cooking.  We were the first ones in the restaurant at about 6:40 and we ordered right away.  The salmon (and fruit bowl and yogurt) arrived at our table at about 7:15.  The waitress did apologize for the delay.  Surprised…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Stay at Great Hotel,"Spent weekend at the Foundation Hotel. Great beds, great food, great bar staff! Everyone at hotel knew we were celebrating our 47th wedding anniversary. Made us feel like movie stars. Can’t wait to go back",5

Can’t say enough about the rustic but modern feel throughout.  Thank you John V for your attention and charming personality.  We’ll be back.  The Jairala’s,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Interesting recreation of buildng,"Masculine simplicity; no luxury, but well conceived restoration of building.   Quality materials chosen for outfitting of rooms and bathrooms.  Good downtown location.   Service in only restaurant at breakfast is slow and unacceptable.  Menu simple but adequate.",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,In town for Archbishop's Gala,Outstanding hotel and a quick walk across the street to Cobo. Apparatus Room bar was great with outstanding service and great atmosphere. Thoroughly enjoyable stay. The rooms were very comfortable and met all our needs.,5

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A must try in Detroit.,Awesome food and drinks at the Apparatus Room.  The accommodations at the Detroit Foundation Hotel top notch. Great Service all the way around. Surrounding area was safe with plenty of places to walk too. ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,almost perfect,"I found the hotel had a great city/urban vibe and adjacent to an amazing restaurant (the apparatus room).  the food was great and they were able to seat us on a Saturday night without reservations.  in addition, we had the rise/dine so breakfast was included in our package.  of course, the food was great and love the ambiance, but if you are looking for something quiet, this is NOT the place.  the hotel is adjacent to a parking lot and of course, on a Saturday night, crazy folks will come out and play -- saw drug paraphernalia left in the parking lot on my morning walk...woke up to someone shouting and of course the construction was quite loud...seemed like it didn't stop until 7am.  ",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Cool, fun, historical!","Our experience was top notch, looking forward to staying here on our next visit to the D.  Food, drinks and service at the Apparatus Room was a great experience as well.  They even had a small selection of fashionable clothes up front which came in handy because I needed a shirt for the evening.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great for a night downtown,Room was clean and comfortable.  Minibar prices were reasonable.  Great location; close to everything downtown.  Did not dine at the restaurant or have a drink at the bar.  Love the architecture.  There were plenty local artists' paintings displayed throughout the hotel.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Excellent Experience,Highly impressed with this property.  The experience far surpassed my expectations.  The restoration of the building is flawless.  The Apparatus Room was the best first-time restaurant and bar experience of 2019 for me.  Exceptional menu and drink offerings.  Great city vibe.  ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Make sure you review your credit card statement,"I've stayed at this hotel twice. The first time, the room was super cold and dark, and it was pretty dismal. The second time, the room was well-lit and the air-conditioning wasn't blasting onto on bed, so it was pretty great. A few days after my stay, I noticed a separate charge on my credit card for $150.52 that was on top of the room charge. When I called to inquire about this charge, the receptionist told me that they were minibar charges for all the items I consumed. I didn't even OPEN the minibar. She kindly removed the charge, but wow, thank goodness I review my credit card statements. Otherwise, I would not have caught this. Be careful about charges like this when staying at this hotel!",3

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Fabulous Long Weekend in Detroit,We explored the museums and other sights over a long weekend and enjoyed our stay at DFH very much.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Service,Wonderful hotel in the heart of Detroit.  Close to shopping and restaurants.  The staff goes out of their way to help you feel welcome.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Perfect Choice in Detroit,"Great location - downtown, able to walk around and everywhere seems to be nearby...   The food was great food - sufficient selection for breakfast for a week stay... Lunch and dinner selection was great... in addition, there were special chef menu.  The room was spacious, the bed were very comfy. Regardless was for leisure or business, the lounge/restaurant were a great place to have conversation. Absolutely a great choice!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Awesome Stay,Great stay but it would be nice if more restaurants were closer. Easy access to the highway makes commuting convenient. One of the cons is that valet parking is expensive ($32) but there is limited street parking that would come in handy if you can find a spot.,4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A Great Experience,"We had a wonderful time this weekend celebrating a birthday. We spent Saturday night at the hotel and had drinks and breakfast at the Apparatus Room. We never left the hotel and never wanted to! Huge shout out to our waitress on Saturday night. She was friendly, attentive and went the extra mile.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beautifully restored and comfortable hotel,"I've stayed at the Detroit Foundation hotel twice now and both times, I encountered a beautifully restored hotel -- modern rooms while keeping the original look and feel of the building.  The staff is great - very welcoming and accommodating. It's my new go-to hotel for Downtown Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Overnight stay at the Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Overall, the service at this hotel was very good. All staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room itself was nice and clean, but I thought the room was a bit over-priced for what it was (and no coffee-maker). I dined at the hotel's restaurant. The food was excellent, but the menu was a challenge to find just the right thing.",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Perfect Anniversary Getaway,"We stayed at the Detroit Foundation to celebrate our anniversary. We left feeling both like VIPs and family. Check-in with Nailah and James at the front desk was a breeze; they were friendly and welcoming. Allison took us and our luggage up to our room and did an excellent job explaining the hotel's amenities and things to do nearby. The room was spacious, with beautiful, comfortable furnishings and lots of natural light, plus a bottle of bubbles and truffles for our anniversary celebration. Omar took us to dinner in the house car which was a nice perk that we weren't expecting. The next morning we enjoyed breakfast in the Apparatus Room. Tiff was knowledgable about the menu and which items would meet my gluten-free needs. The vanilla latte was perfect and the BREAKFAST À LA…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Movement Weekend,"This was our second consecutive year staying at the Foundation for Movement weekend and we will definitely be back next year as well. Everything about our stay was excellent - all the staff was very accommodating and friendly, the rooms were immaculate and the location could not be any better (5 minutes from the middle of Hart Plaza to the room). Additionally, this was probably the most sound-proof hotel room I’ve ever stayed in which made it sooo easy to get some well needed rest despite the parties going all weekend long. 10/10 would buy again",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Stay at Detroit Foundation Hotel,The staff was efficient and very helpful. There were always enough on hand that you didn't have to wait too. The only thing I'd change would be to have an ice bucket in each room and an ice machine. Other than that the hotel was top notch.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Business,Wonderful hotel with great amenities. Clean and large room with nice style and great shower.  I would gladly stay at this location again. Staff was courteous and extremely helpful and attentive to my needs. Loved it!,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Excellent Hotel and Location in the D!,"Probably the coolest and nicest hotel I’ve stayed at anywhere, and certainly tops in Detroit.  A small group stayed for a quick business meeting and we all very impressed.  The room had a good view and was very well decorated with modern accessories, great big shower, excellent toiletries, etc.  Also, the king bed I had was super comfy and I sleep great, which says a lot since it was only one night and I usually need 2 nights or so to get a good sleep in a new place. What sets this hotel apart for me is that many items are are very locally Detroit sourced.  The in-room mini bar and local cocktail selection was very nice.  Priced reasonably, I think.  $5 for a mini-Bar craft beer was great. I wasn’t able to grab a bottle of local gin, since I forgot and will the next time I’m…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Artsy Hotel and great location!,The hotel itself is amazing! The rooms are high end boutique style and the beds are super comfy!!! I was in town for Movement at Hart Plaza and it was perfect for walking to and from the fest. The hotel staff were all super friendly and accommodating.   The only complaint i had was with the hotel restaurant The Apparatus Room. I ate pretty much every meal there and each time experienced poor service from my servers and bartender. Very rude and condensing. Also their hours of operation don’t sinc up with festival hours. They stop serving lunch at 2:30 and close the kitchen at 11 at night. For guests staying at the hotel there isn’t an option for food when we got back from the fest at midnight. That was very disappointing. I really hope they modify hours next year for the festival…,4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Very cool hotel!,Loved the hotel and would definitely recommend it.  Staff was very friendly and rooms are very cool incorporating details from the past with updated features.The only negative was the traffic noise from our third floor room.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Even better than before ,We first visited the Foundation hotel a few months after opening and were impressed with the surroundings inline with the original firehouse.  We’ve also attended many social events in the bar/restaurant area.  Check-in process included a very genuinely friendly individual.  This last trip took the experience to another level as I received a hand written note waiting on the bed from manager thanking me for returning- nice touch.  I would also mention that the larger room had much in terms of natural lighting and the towels were the softest in memories.   Dinner at Apparatus room was outstanding and large windows (where doors used to be) added to the experience.   Highly recommend!  My only ask is to have standard ironing boards as the tiny ones are challenging ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,My Preferred Hotel When I'm in Detroit,"I'm from Detroit and remember when this building was an abandoned fire house. The transformation is amazing! Staff is superb. Feels like they are taking care of me every time they see me. Rooms are clean and super stylish. And, you don't have to leave for nightlife because the bar/lounge/restaurant is a hotspot in the city.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Awesome Hotel,"We loved this hotel.  Hotel had super cool decor amd style.  Very modern and rustic. The location was perfect in central downtown.  The the room was wonderful, super clean, cool design, modern fantastic bathroom,  Most important, the staff was superb and service phenomenal.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Lovely hotel...a little room for improvement,"A very good hotel, beautifully designed.  We had a spacious room.  The restaurant/bar/lounge is excellent and sets the tone for the hip atmosphere of the hotel.  Hotel staff was super friendly and helpful.   At the same time, a couple of touches could really improve the hotel including: 1) Robes in the room.  For a hotel a this price point it seems like a no-brainer but there were no robes; and 2) soundproofing for the windows.  The outside noise was persistent and bothersome and it's surprising there is no buffer given the newness of the hotel.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing Boutique Gem,"Everything about the DFH was fantastic!  The refurbished firehouse is so cool!  My room was on the third floor, stunning decor, very comfortable and had a rich feel to it.  The third floor has a lobby with lots of local art and books to read.  Had dinner in the Apparatus Room, again, beautiful decor that really highlights the original building.  Service was top notch.  Only issue was a couple of loud noises from the street during the night that woke me up.  Every little detail was well thought out, highly recommend!!!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Charming boutique hotel in Detroit,Stayed with family to play tourist in Detroit. Lovely hotel with unique rooms and vibe.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great hotel ,"We had a great experience at the Foundation Hotel. From the valets who took our car, to the front desk, to the bellman, to the wait staff in the Apparatus Room. All were friendly, helpful and accommodating. The hotel is great the way they repurposed the old firehouse. It gave you a sense of what it was but with all of the amenities of a modern hotel. Room rates were reasonable, location is great and our weekend there was just what we were hoping for. We will definitely come back.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Location, location, and a lot of other good stuff.","This boutique, luxury hotel is right across the street from the Cobo Center. Every one of the staff that I met went out of their way to make my stay welcoming and relaxing. Everything I needed was just so easy to get. Being a former fire station I was a little surprised to see the floor of my room was cement when I first opened the door, but a thick, stylish rug was laid in the bed and desk area of the room making it warm and comfy. The bed was great, and the bath had the largest shower I've ever seen in a hotel. Food service was excellent. Not a single negative thing happened during my stay.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great find in downtown Detroit!,We stayed at the Foundation Hotel for a singing gathering in Detroit. Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated to reflect the firehouse history of the hotel. Service was good and the bar/restaurant is to die for. I would definitely go back -- loved it!,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Great, except location of room","Stay at the hotel was great, comfortable beds, clean and great decor etc.   Only issue we had was that our room was located by an employee supply closet at the end of the hallway.   We could hear the door opening and closing early in the mornings, so it disrupted our sleep.  I'd stay again and just request a different room.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Charming Experience,Beautiful renovation of the fire station with great features that keep you looking around to admire the unique decor and it adds charm to downtown Detroit.  Had a great family experience.  Great customer service by all the staff.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Fantastic,"I travel around the world for work and I can say the Detroit Foundation is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It has the style of the most exciting European boutique hotels, and the efficiency of some of the most famous large storied hotels. The place is comfortable, welcoming, clean, and hip. A perfect combination. The restaurant is great and the bar has the best beer I have had outside of Belgium. I can't recommend it highly enough.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,Detroit was an incredible surprise. Such an awesome city. I have travelled the world and Detroit Foundation Hotel was truly one of the best rooms/hotels I've stayed in. I loved it and can't wait to return.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Excellent boutique choice in Detroit,"we very much enjoyed our stay in the foundation hotel.  We would stay again.  It was not cheap but the service was good, hotel is quite new and clean, and rooms are interesting.  Sort of industrial style, if you like that.  Would stay again.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great stay at the Detroit Foundation Hotel.,"Great experience to stay in this wonderfully repurposed space. Great service, enjoyed dining at the Apparatus Room - excellent food and drinks! Convenient location for exploring all of downtown Detroit ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Hotel is ok ... Restaurant is disappointing ,"This old fire station was nicely renovated and is conveniently located in downtown Detroit.  Service upon check in and out was excellent.  The room is well fitted and comfortable however air conditioning is quite noisy ! The restaurant, on the other hand, was a disappointment : VERY loud, to the point where it's difficult to hold a normal conversation.  Food was overall way too salty (and so was the bill !).  Desserts were excellent.   Breakfast was good.  ",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Fun, funky hotel right near the river",Enjoyed a 2 night stay at the hotel. My only complaint: ordered 2 shots of scotch at the bar. Wish the bartender had said “I’m happy to pour those for you but just want to be sure u know they cost $75 each.” Unhappy surprise ,4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Truly Fantastic Hotel,"Skip the big chains and stay in this wonderful hotel. Completely redesigned the vibe is warm, modern and inviting. The bar and restaurant rock. Real mixologists and the food gets an A plus. The rooms are spacious with a fantastic bed and terrific shower. I would highly recommend this hotel. Staff is friendly and very helpful. Don’t be put off by the modest outside. The inside is a real treasure. Deserves its five star rating!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Nicely recycled!,"Very nice historic venue. Great ambience, details and decoration. Anyway for a boutique hotel still missing some details...no bathrobes, no sleepers...basic or poor comfort rooms for the price.   Great location and concept idea nut still needs to work to be a high class boutique hotel.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing Amazing Amazing!,"You have to stay here the next time you are in Detroit.  Not only are you treated like royalty from the moment you check-in to the sad moment when you have to check-out but the building is an historic masterpiece.  Built in 1929, this is the old Detroit Fire Hall and the designers/decorators have created a hip, industrial vibe throughout the entire building.  Don't miss The Apparatus Room for drinks or a meal during your stay.  Such a cool, fun place to hang out!  Most importantly, our guest room was super clean.  All hotel personnel were friendly and accommodating.  We were able to use their car service at no extra charge (other than driver gratuity) which dropped us off AND picked us up at our venue.  Soooo convenient!  We will definitely be back to Detroit Foundation Hotel!!!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,30th Birthday,"Amazing stay for my wife’s 30th birthday.  The staff was super accommodating and secured a table larger enough for our friends at Apparatus Room, stored our cake in their restaurant refrigerator, sliced and served it at dinner!  There is a courtesy car (2019 Lincoln Continental) that will take you anywhere in a 3 mile radius.  Super close to everything and can walk but we did use in the rain and it was perfect.  Rooms are really nice and trendy, maintaining elements of the fire station that it used to be.  Would highly recommend considering it was cheaper than the very old Crown Plaza across the street, at least for my dates.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Nice Hotel with excellant Bar and Restaurant,"Nice rooms. Walking distance from a nice nightlife areas. This boutique hotel was aamazing. It exceeded my expectation. Trendy furniture, cool, clean. The Apparatus Room is AMAZING !! Would recommend to friends and family.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing Anniversary,"This hotel is seriously the best in Detroit. From entering thru the beautiful big red doors , to the smell of 5 star food at the restaurant, all of the unique art , and the best hospitality in the city... and that is all right in the entrance while you’re checking in.   The room was so awesome as well. High ceilings, open floor, and a great view. We stayed on the Lincoln floor (3rd). We want to thank the staff and everyone involved for making our 13 year anniversary the best one yet and look forward to staying/dining with you in the future. Again, thank you.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Unique Hotel & Great Asset in Detroit!,"I LOVE this hotel. It's unlike any other hotel in Detroit and we have stayed at most of them. The building and decor are fabulous. We had a room with two queen beds and no view, but that's OK because the room and hotel are beautiful enough.  The service was great - friendly employees at check in. We didn't eat at the restaurant, but it looks like a great place to go. The location is great too, especially if you have an event at Cobo Hall. This is the best place to go if you're tired of boring chain hotels. I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Detroit is BACK!,"Great atmosphere with a super cool room, awesome hotel bar and restaurant.  The decor is also very hip and trendy.  The history of the building is also very interesting being that it’s an old firehouse.  The staff are very helpful and accommodating as well.  We had a 2 day business meeting with 20 people and their meeting room accommodated us nicely I would strongly recommend staying there if in town on business or a weekend stay!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Fantastic Boutique Hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel with excellent service from the time you pull up for valet parking until you check out.  Some of the amenities include the contemporary elements combined with the vintage atmosphere of the old Detroit Fire Station.  I loved the leather wall wrapped elevators, the beautiful wall murals and extensive headboards in the rooms, the huge showers in the very clean, modern bathrooms and the huge windows in the restaurant looking out on the streets.  It's located right next to Cobo Hall and the view of the downtown area from the room was breathtaking.  We had dinner and breakfast there and were not disappointed.  I will definitely be staying here again!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Experience,The Customer Service was Awesome!!!! Rooms were a perfect combination of vintage and contemporary flair. Will definitely visit again. All of the staff aimed to please. Everyone from valet to housekeeping was spectacular.  ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Anniversary visit,"Had a great time however 20 min after getting to my room, someone keyed into my room without knocking and just walked in. Very startling to have this happen. When I told the front desk this had happened I was told they would look into it and then I never got any follow up. ",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Fantastic Experience!,"Detroit Foundation Hotel is friendly, incredibly clean, quiet, attentive, and located in a great spot!  My husband and I stayed here for our 20th wedding anniversary and the staff sent us a bottle of champagne with a very sweet note.  The bed and pillows were an excellent quality.  The shower had gorgeous, well-scrubbed subway tile.  The decor is modern and unique.  I love that many of the original fire station features are found throughout the hotel, including the fire poles and ceiling in the Apparatus Room, the gorgeous bar of this hotel.  A very unique stay!",5

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Home Away From Home,"And thats just what it was.  I stay recently for a week long work trip.  I had a jr. suite and the property was spotless, high end with a comfy feel.  Staff was great and rectified all issues (mostly payment related) very quickly.  I appreciated being able to burn a candle and make my space feel like home while I was there for work.    I wish the restaurant had more variety but the property was great about me ordering takeout.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Love the renewal here,"Detroit has repurposed a classic piece of their history with the new Foundation Hotel. It opened the 100-room boutique hotel in May 2017 in what was once in the Detroit Fire Department headquarters. The building that is now the hotel was built in 1929, but this location housed fire equipment from 1840 until the Detroit Fire Department abandoned it in 2013. The end result is a blend of museum, art gallery, upscale dining and lodging with a touch of a local hangout.  Dining in the Apparatus Room is an unforgettable experience. The refurnished fire station arched doorways are topped by glass arches and the fixtures are multiple hanging lights so the room is bright and cheerful.  The restaurant is presided over by Executive Chef Thomas Lents, a two-star Michelin chef who left…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Attention to Detail,"Just got back from a wonderful two night stay at the Detroit Foundation Hotel.  Was impressed from top to bottom, from the impeccable service at the front door to the cleanliness of the room.  The room wasn't huge, but the architecture was unique and everything was well-designed. My only nit-picky complains were the lack of counter space in the bathroom (the novelty sink took up the whole thing), and the fact that our queen bed definitely seemed a bit smaller than a traditional queen.  Ate several times at the Apparatus Room and was super impressed with both the food and the service.  Had equally positive experiences at the bar.  Loved the selection of teas in the morning!  I thought the bed was comfortable and the blackout curtains were a nice touch, especially since we had a…",5

When I called they provided me with the name of a driver to pick us up at the airport. He was courteous, friendly and safe behind the wheel.  Second, there was always staff to open doors, answer questions, give directions and ""show you around"" the hotel.  Very Clean modern rooms.  Room service prompt and food was hot and delicious.  ",5

The service is incredible, the restaurant stunning, guest rooms are chic and inspired, in room bathroom is spacious and accommodating. The overall experience is one that makes you appreciate Detroit’s comeback in an incredibly tangible way. There are thoughtful touches all over that separate The Foundation hotel from its many competitors. From the lobby that looks more like a designer boutique than a hotel lobby to the locally sourced in room mini bar to the USB ports in the room thoughtfully placed beside the bed. Staff are professional, polished and happy to assist but never in the way. Even the complimentary coffee is top notch MadCap coffee. If you are…",5

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Boutique Hotel in Downtown Detroit,"The Detroit Foundation Hotel is a great boutique hotel right downtown across from the Convention Center. The property has a hip, laid back charm and vibe. The staff is very attentive. The hotel was originally a firehouse and carries this theme throughout the hotel and the Apparatus Room bar & restaurant. It's always a delight to stay here. And check out the bar and restaurant, which are excellent. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Cool space,The building spaces are nostalgic and comfortable. Rooms are spacious with very comfortable beds. I never sleep well in hotels but this was one of the best hotel beds I have ever slept on. The only issue that I didn’t like was that the restaurant was very cold when it was single digit temperatures outside. Otherwise it is a very unique place with quality staff.,4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,My stay at the Foundation Detroit,"Excellent Hotel, great service, clean rooms recently renovated.  Clean lines and functional. If you want quiet , as for the Atrium Rooms. Food was excellent, service knowledgeable. I experienced an incident with a noisy neighbor.  When I pointed it out at checkout, the manager did not hesitate to shave the bill to comp me. I appreciated that very much,  more symbolically than financially.  Good to be recognized and dealt with personally.",4

DFH staff are always so friendly and welcoming. DFH provided a fantastic foundation to build a spectacular birthday weekend.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Fantastic!,"This was a truly wonderful hotel experience. We travelled as a group of 6 on business and couldn't say enough good things about the Detroit Foundation Hotel. Its location was perfect for our needs, with valet and checkin being seamless. Our team loved their rooms and the amenities were excellent. The minibar was well stocked and affordable, and we were all obsessed with the toiletries.  We also got a tour of the property from Bob, which was both enlightening and inspiring. The hotel's commitment to Detroit can't be beat, which was evident in the artists' work throughout the hotel, the podcast studio, and the onsite events. We left feeling like we knew more about the city, and excited to return. Also, the restaurant is phenomenal!!!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,ALMOST a great experience,"Overall, we enjoyed our recent stay at the Detroit Foundation Hotel.  It has been renovated very stylish, with rustic yet classy decor and the staff were all very friendly.  Our favorite part was our dinner and brunch at the hotel restaurant Apparatus.  This restaurant is fantastic from the decor, service and delicious food.  Unfortunately the hotel itself fell short.  Our queen bed was lopsided, and uncomfortable.  The walls are very thin.  We heard everything in the hallway and next door.  The worst was in the early morning, being awakened by glass or bottles and or trash being taken out and dumped into the dumpster which happened to be in the alley outside our window.  We had a terrible nights sleep.  Overall, we would return (mostly for the food) but would definitely request…",4

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Cute but expected more for the room rate,"We checked into the Detroit Foundation Hotel for a long weekend. Overall we had a nice stay- the staff was friendly and helpful. The food was hit or miss- we got in-room dining one morning and it arrived stone cold.   For the price, the room was nothing special- you could tell that it was a newly-built space but that they cut some corners. We arrived and there was a stain on our comforter and a chip in the bathroom mirror. For the room rate, we expected a more premium experience.",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Perfect,"I came for business, I would move in if they would let me. The decor is excellent, minimal, classy, for me, just perfect.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Sophisticated elegance  ,I am a big fan of this hotel. They were one of the first hotels to spur the Detroit renaissance.  I was born and raised in a suburb of Detroit and have since moved away and it was so nice to see the city thriving.   Upon check-in the front desk kindly greeted us and even offered to get us a cocktail! The minute you walk past the big red doors you are surrounded by beautiful art by local artists.  As you enter towards the bar area there is a big table for plugging in your laptop and getting your work done.  The bar/lounge is filled with treasures of Detroit’s past and the attention to detail in decor was unexpected and appreciated and the cocktails were creative and tasty.  There is a mini library and lounging area on the 3rd floor (my room was on that floor) surrounded by more…,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing Experience,"From the greeting by the staff, to the beautiful details in the room, to the great food - we could not say enough great things about our stay at the Detroit Foundation Hotel! Great for a quick romantic getaway",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Doin’ it in the D,Detroit is back to its former glory. Sure it’s a tough town but there are no lack of refinements. The Foundation is a hotel that has Ben converted from an old Fire Station. Great service. Check in took 1 minute. Check out was 15 seconds. Super swank restaurant/ bar in the lobby with incredible food. Location is right next to Cobo and a 3 block walk to Woodward. One suggestion would be to get some more greasy food on the in room dining menu. Nobody wants to eat pumpkin soup and a Maurice salad when they are hungover at 4:00 in the afternoon. ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Fantastic stay,"I stayed with a friend for one night stay as a quick getaway.  I presently surprised as to the attention to details, the warm welcome at the reception and great service at dinner.   The Apparatus room was amazing, inviting and the service was impeccable. ",5

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A Perfect Stay,"My fiancé and I stayed here for 2 nights. We were blown away by the level of service and overall quality of this hotel. The rooms were spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. To ensure a quieter stay, we requested a room on the 4th floor facing the inner courtyard. The hotel had no issue accommodating this request. The other added bonus of staying here is the complimentary car service they offer. We enjoyed utilizing their Lincoln Navigator to get around town up to 3 miles away from the hotel. Next time we’re in Detroit, we’ll definitely consider staying here. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Weekend fun ,"Love this hotel.  This is our 2nd stay, but probably our last.  The atmosphere is super and room amenities so very cool.  However, both times we have stayed we have been put in a room next to employee stairs or work rooms.  For the price, we wish we didn't have to hear the banging around the whole stay.   Be careful and ask where your room is located.  ",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Outside the window is a wall,"We care about the view from a room very much, so we asked a room with view on booking half a year beforehand. But the window of our room which we finally got just faced a wall. The front desk would not like to change a room for us. The air in the room was bad because the window could not be opened and the ventilation of the air conditioner did not function all the time. There is also a pillar in the room that made us feel that we were in a factory working room.",2
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at and used the hotel for our wedding prep, first look, pictures.  It was an amazing stay and we would do it all over again!  Love the apparatus room as well, excellent food and a great place for pictures. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Experience,"My husband and I frequent Detroit often as we live less that 20 minutes from Downtown.

They had an amazing Navigator that took us around were we needed to go.  Staff was helpful and amazing. They even went to the store and picked us medicine when we needed it. We adored their restaurant on site, The Apparatus Room was AMAZING !! CANT WAIT TO COME BACK ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Weekend Getaway,Wonderful room. Fantastic Service. Great restaurant. And good location.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing hotel.  Will be back,Visited the last winter auto show in Detroit.  Stayed at the Detroit Foundation Hotel which is literally across the street from Cobo.  From an aesthetic standpoint hotel is amazing since it's a restored old building.  Room was large with high ceiling (so felt much larger) and all fixtures/furnishings are top notch.  Hotel staff was extremely responsive and friendly.  Room was spotless.  Having top notch restaurant (Apparatus Room) onsite was another big plus...especially since it was sub-freezing temps during our stay.  Highly recommend this place!,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Get away!,"We visited the Detroit Foundation Hotel December 30. Location is excellent and everything about this hotel was great!  They have maintained the integrity of the original firehall while adding excellent new bathrooms, etc.  Nice large dining room. We had a great dinner meal and breakfast.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Not Up to Reviews,"We stayed September 2018.  Room was quite small, concrete floors, very thin rug on floor, the new spartan decor.  Bathroom quite small.  Sink had no area around it to place much of anything.  Just a stark environment once you leave the lobby area.  Air conditioning did not work and after repeated conversations with front desk, room service and engineering (when it was quite clear there was a problem) a very polite technician finally came up to take a look.  All he knew to do was change the filter and it was obvious he had no clue what else to do.  We were eventually (hours from our original call) moved to another room which was a bit larger.  We travel all over the world to major cities.  The quality of the accommodations do not merit the price.  While the staff is very polite…",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A great experience at the Foundation Hotel,"Astounding 36 hours in Detroit starting with the amazing Foundation Hotel.  Its heritage as Detroit's main fire station is reflected in the entire property and was great way to spend our whole weekend immersed in Detroit's history. The hotel's industrial chic feel, reflects Detroit's rebirth perfectly.  Staff were warmly welcoming, helpful and friendly.  In our room, we loved the attention to style in each detail. Faux fur pillows on the retro sofa, and lovely plush carpeting in the rooms felt extra cozy on a polished, heated concrete floor. A feature wall is dressed in wood reclaimed from Detroit.  We loved the substantial bottles of whisky, gin and vodka, which make great momentos, and reminded us of Detroit's historic speakeasies.  Wonderful bed and bathroom too. …",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Awesome Hotel!,"Have only been to brunch here prior to this stay for a wedding in Detroit.

Chikas and John ensured a smooth check-in, as well as spot-on recommendations and a welcome so warm we knew we landed in the right place! The hotel rooms are spacious, but inviting; designed to please the eyes with beautiful art and unique decor pieces. The bed is lush, the bathroom is lavish, and the hotel soaps/shampoos are to DIE FOR. We enjoyed dinner at the Apparatus Room (on the first floor, it was divine), toured the Waterfront via the Detroit Bikes (amenity provided by the hotel), and graciously devoured the MadCap coffee available on the cart in the hotel lobby.…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great experience,"My boyfriend and I loved the Detroit foundation! All the staff was super friendly, the room was well kept and extremely clean. We ate at the apparatus room twice and enjoyed our food and drinks both times. This is a unique experience and gives you a true Detroit vibe. My only minor complaint was that you couldn’t adjust the temperature in the room.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Cool, modern, well-located hotel with lovely staff!","All the staff made me feel very welcome and looked after me, which is especially nice when you are travelling alone. The restaurant / bar staff particularly looked after me, as they appreciated that it's not fun to eat alone! The cocktails are fabulous - you have to try the famous Detroit 'The Last Word'. The room was large and very tastefully decorated in a cool, loft style and a lovely bathroom - with really nice 'beauty products' (shampoo, shower gel, and body cream). Bed was really comfortable, however I got a little hot as you are not able to turn the heating / air con off yourself. The hotel is perfectly located in Downtown and within easy walk of public transport and most things to see - I loved the Guardian Building, the Fisher Building, Detroit Institute of Arts, Campus…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A Great Addition to Downtown Detroit,"We have been meaning to stay at the Detroit Foundation hotel since it opened, as we both used to work downtown in the late 1980s and fondly recall the old firehouse. We were very impressed with all aspects of the transformation into a hotel. The Apparatus Room is a great space - we ate dinner one night at the bar and we were on a breakfast package, so we had both of our breakfasts there as well. Our room was very comfortable, and followed the industrial chic aesthetic, thus reminding us a bit of an Aloft type feel. On top of the physical structure, we also found everyone working at the hotel to be super friendly and helpful. We had a couple of minor requests regarding the room, and they were both handled quickly and efficiently. We also chatted with the staff working in the…",5

There’s literally nothing surrounding this hotel, it’s still up and coming. But the hotel is amazing. Amazing building remodel. The room are very unique. Great Detroit vibe and pride. The Apparatus Room downstairs is even better then the hotel!",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Worth it to spoil yourself,Anniversary gift to ourselves and included dinner at the Apparatus room restaurant located in the lobby. First impression: I was awed by the simplicity of the front desk.  Read the trip advisor and saw a live band was playing on this evening so asked for a higher floor and got a interior room on the 5th floor.  The bathroom in this room was probably more than 300 sq ft!  The peace and quiet was much needed. Much of the room had concrete floors and artistic accents throughout. The ceilings were extraordinary tall. Just again spoiled with the artistic accents throughout the building. We stopped on every floor to admire the artwork throughout the building.  Keep up the great work!,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great stay in downtown!,"Hotel is beautiful; rooms are spacious.  We had 4 girls in a 2 queen room and it was very comfortable.  Amenities are great; the minifridge and snacks are reasonably priced which is good.  Walking distance to Campus Martius.  There is a lot right next door to the hotel for $20 overnight parking but we opted for the valet anyway, extra $12 seemed worth it for our car to be in a safe garage.  Def recommend! ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Phenomenal hotel and staff,"This is by far my favourite hotel in the midwest. Luxurious, comfortable, and yet with a down-to-earth approachable level of exceptional service. The staff are professional yet friendly and genuine. The renovation of this venerable old firehall is remarkable, retaining respect for its past. The hotel is gorgeous. The rooms are sumptuous, comfortable and quiet. The lounge has a fascinating mix of people, and it's very lively and fun in the evenings. Love the DFH. The valet staff - beyond excellent with a fabulous Lincoln Navigator car service. And the location is on the doorstep to everything you could want. I've stayed here at least 6 times, so the review could apply to any of those visits. Need I say more?!",5

Thank you and kudos to Emily & the entire team at the Detroit Foundation Hotel. Born and raised in the Detroit area, came back for a company event and researched many places downtown before deciding on the Foundation.  Every positive comment is as advertised.  From the moment you pull up and take in the historic building with original refurbished firehouse doors, to its inviting staff, great location, and upscale eclectic vibe, it all works and is on point. Best way to describe the staff is cool, friendly and professional. If you're celebrating something special, the Commissioner's Suite is posh, period-elegant, fun, luxurious, comfortable; worth the expense. If attention to detail and chic decor throughout is any…",5

We ordered scrambled eggs and they were swimming in so much butter that we could not eat them. Overall, a great stay and would come back again.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Fantastic!,"The building, the room, the hotel staff, and the restaurant food were all fantastic.  The only thing I would say they need to improve on is the friendliness of the staff in the restaurant.  The hotel staff were all very friendly.  For some reason we didn't feel the same love from the staff at the restaurant.  None of them seemed as happy to be there as we were, which is unfortunate.  ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Perfect stay in Detroit,"Came home for an early Christmas with family, decided to spend two nights downtown.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Thanksgiving,"We absolutely loved our visit to Detroit and to the Foundarion Hotel. The rooms are spacious and each one untique in its own way. There was clearly no expense spared when renovating this property as the attention to detail is 2nd to none. I loved that they feature & support local artists with several items available for purchase. We were greeted with a smile from each and every staff member we encountered. The Apparatus Room offers a wonderful menu and great atmosphere. It was within walking distance to the downtown tree and Ice rink which was great and we used the services of the house car a couple of times to take us further downtown. Overall a fantastic experience! Be sure to stay here if you are traveling to Detroit, you won’t be disappointed!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing Hotel with excellent service!,We had such an amazing time on our trip to a Detroit!

Dinner was amazing, we had chef's choice and ordered what seemed to be the whole menu for our table of 5. Mallory the bartender is excellent. she took care of us at the. I love how she greets her guest with a handshake... Valet was also great, they got the car right away even with them being busy.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Detroit expat feels so at home at Detroit Foundation Hotel & The Apparatus Room ...,"I am a Detroit expat. The Detroit Foundation Hotel experience is a must do. Glad I did. It's the local Detroit feeling I discovered that has grown on me each time I am home in Detroit.  I met and reconnected with Detroiters and visitors from all over the world who have become acquainted with the community spirit.  Like myself, the Apparatus Room during the day was a home base with the offering up of plugs for our computers, interaction at the communal tables or seating where you can be alone or have a meeting or lunch. The environment creates conversation among each other if you want. I get why they say they are a restaurant with rooms.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great hotel, The service was excellent from the moment we arrived- starting with the Valet right through to the very talented bartenders.  Cool vibe and a great location- close to everything.  We will definitely be back. ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Short but sweet stay,"I’m actually a former Detroiter, in town for a friend’s wedding. I lived in Detroit during the recession, so my memories of the city are a little bittersweet, but in the last few years, I’ve been happily surprised to see something new pop up each time I come back home, this hotel included. I only stayed one night, since I have friends and family in the area, but I almost wish I had booked longer. My room was beautiful, the bed comfortable, and the reading material worthwhile. There’s a little art gallery inside the hotel, they have some cute merch for sale, and I recommend the downstairs restaurant. Great food in a great setting. Cheers!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Awesome hotel and comfortable stay!,I was in Detroit for a few days with my one year old son. Detroit Foundation Hotel was the perfect hotel for our stay. The room was clean and comfortable and a pack n play was set up for my son. We both slept great. We enjoyed the Apparaturus room for breakfast and dinner. It was a fun stay and the staff were very accommodating. I look forward to another visit soon!,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Exactly what we had hoped for !,We were nicely greeted by the doorman and our car was taken care of. Check in was efficient and so we decided to go to the bar for a cocktail and boy was it hopping.  Got up to our floor and the lobby was fabulous and then our room did not disappoint either. Will definitely stay again.  ,4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing Experience!,"From the moment we arrived until we left, we had an amazing experience! The entire staff was top-notched and bent over backwards to make our stay perfect! The decor is beautiful and our room was very comfortable. Dinner in the restaurant was an experience in itself! We certainly will return! Detroit has revitalized in many ways, so much to see and do!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Hotel or Nightclub?,"I had a 3-night stay at this hotel.  The first 2 nights were fine, but on the 3rd night, the entire first floor of the hotel (The Apparatus Room restaurant and the adjoining lounge/bar area) was rented out for a private event with a live band.  Our room was on the 2nd floor, and thus we were subjected to very loud, thumping, bass-heavy dance hits for what seemed like hours.  At about 10 past midnight, I called the front desk and was told that the private event was contracted until 1am, and therefore nothing could be done about the noise until then.  The clerk offered to move me to a different room, but I was already in my pajamas and was not about to change and pack everything up in my room at that hour.  So I asked the clerk to note that I wanted to speak to a manager in the…",2
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beautiful hotel - awful mattress ,"We were excited to find our go-to Detroit hotel as we travel there quite a bit. All of the reviews about the decor, building design, cleanliness and staff are spot-on. It’s a beautiful hotel and a great experience overall, however I’m surprised to see so few people mention how uncomfortable the beds are. The mattress was so soft and bouncy, it was impossible to get comfortable. My 6’4” boyfriend ended up sleeping on the window banquette because it had more support. It was a real bummer to wake up so groggy and sore today. Compared to every other amenity and detail, the mattress seemed very poor quality. Had it not been for this detail (which is important considering we came here to sleep), I wouldn’t have hesitated to give it 5 stars. ",3

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Loved the Foundation!,"The minute we hit the lobby we knew we'd made the right decision. The renovation of this old firehouse is well worth checking out. The lounge/bar/dining room are located on the majority of the first floor and the careful attention to detail and preservation of the space made for a comfortable vibe with artful touches everywhere. The ENTIRE staff were amazing and made us feel not just welcome but well cared for. The rooms were unique and well appointed and a previous review called out not enough closet/drawer space but we found that a non-issue. While there is no closet, the bureau/credenza situation gave us plenty of space for our things and you can accommodate hanging clothes that need it. The mini bar items were legit and locally sourced which is another wonderful feature…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Old Fire House turned hotel,"Fun hotel conviently located in downtown Detroit. Lots of fun features including bicycles to borrow on your floor next to the elevators or stacks of books for your convenience.   The bedrooms are comfortable with good mattresses and pillows, lighted refrigerator, easy access safe in a drawer and average sized bathrooms. Even liked the creative head boards.(see photo)  The kitsch is fun including a tray of fuses (your token)  to take downstairs for a  kick start of a free cup of coffee. (See picture).   Side lights are unfortunately not bright enough to allow good reading in bed. Floors are concrete but it adds to the room atmosphere.   Restaurant in hotel on ground floor is good with the old fire truck bays now as windows. Food was very tasty.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great place to stay,"We stayed in the historic hotel when in Detroit (awesome place to visit). The bar / restaurant was hopping both nights, and I recommend the 3rd fl lobby if you need quiet. It was the perfect spot to take our drinks and catch up with our traveling companions. Be prepared for no in room coffee, which for an addict like me was a bit of a problem, and nowhere to put your personal effects in the bathroom, the furnishings are comfortable if a bit spartan.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Dinner date ,"Wondering around looking for a place to eat and we happened to pass by the Foundation hotel. We arrived at 8:30 on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was happening. Live music, and a great atmosphere. The food was awesome and the staff was very engaging, strongly supporting the local food scene with recommendations. We can’t wait to go back. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Became our Detroit Home Base!,I absolutely loved our numerous stays at the Detroit Foundation. The level of service is great and the beds are the most comfortable I have experienced at any hotel. We used this as a home base while we completed a project in Detroit. The staff was so accommodating and friendly. We can't can't wait to return for a little fun! ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Hotel. Great Staff.,"One of the best hotel experiences I've had. The staff is accommodating and responsive. The food is excellent. And the design of the hotel and rooms, impeccable, contemporary, thoughtful. We were originally at the Crown Plaza across the street, and were disappointed. It was old and smelled of smoke and heavy chemicals. We called the Foundation and told them our predicament, and Rich took care of us. He came over personally and helped us move from the lobby to the other hotel. He set up our departure the next day as well. We were pleasantly surprised with the experience. When we visit Detroit, we'll definitely be staying at the Foundation. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,The New Detroit,"If there's any place that epitomizes the renewal and rebirth of downtown Detroit, it's the Detroit Foundation Hotel. Set in the old Detroit Fire Department, this hotel has used the building's history to its greatest advantage, while still providing a welcoming and comfortable place to stay. The original storage place for fire department equipment has become The Apparatus Room--an excellent restaurant and lively bar. The old brick walls--and many of the hotel's public rooms--display some of Detroit's best new art. The guest rooms are spare and somewhat industrial in decor but feature very comfortable beds, well outfitted baths, and an in-room bar with all sorts of options. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable about the city, and eager to help make their visitor's stay a pleasant…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,It's the little things...,"On my first return stay at the Foundation, there was a handwritten note in the room welcoming me back. It's that kind of attention to detail that, to me, makes a great hotel. The food and drink are top-notch and the atmosphere is full of energy. It's a fun, cool property to stay at, which isn't something that happens too often. Even with a couple of new boutique hotel options in town, I'll definitely be sticking with the Foundation.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Lovely date weekends.,We've stayed at the Detroit Foundation Hotel three times and had a great experience each time. The hotel has been immaculate and tastefully decorated. Staff were welcoming. It's very convenient to have a restaurant downstairs. We've been there for cocktails and breakfasts. Everything was perfect. ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great boutique hotel,"This is a great hotel, right in the heart of downtown Detroit.  The room was hip and modern.  The entire ambiance of the hotel was very cool.  Whether you stay for a drink or meal, the combined bar & restaurant is very relaxing.  All service staff was very helpful.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great overnight stay in downtown Detroit!,"We were only in the hotel one night, but received a first-class experience, all around, from our warm greeting at our arrival, to the well-stocked and moderately-priced mini-bar/fridge, and the incredible dinner at The Apparatus. Staff was super-friendly and ultra-helpful.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,An unforgettable place,"We stayed here as a staycation for our anniversary and I’m so glad we did. Every single staff memeber was so kind and personable. Then there was Mike, the security guard, who was one of the kindest people we have ever met - he even shared some late night pizza with us after several drinks at the bar!  The ambiance at this place was stunning. As soon as we walked in everything smelled good. Our room smelled amazing. It was all super clean. All of the decor was nice, our room was beautiful and cozy.   The apparatus room is insanely beautiful. There is so much to look at and the history of this building is awesome. The food was OK for the prices, but everything else made up for it. The drinks at the bar were super good. It felt like every single staff member was there to wait on…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Boutique hotel without attitude!,I very much enjoyed my stay at the Detroit Foundation Hotel. I was pleased that the very appealing design and amenities were not spoiled by the lack of service and painful attitude that so often mars an otherwise pleasant boutique hotel stay. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful and seemed genuinely happy to be doing their jobs assisting guests. The room was comfortable and well designed - the only quibble would be that the hanging bedside fixtures did not give off sufficient light and were difficult to reach from the bed as the switches were quite high up.   The Apparatus Room was excellent - both food and drink. The location was convenient for exploring the revitalizing downtown area. I highly recommend the hotel and would happily return. ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Not impressed, really disappointed and poor air quality.","My husband and I travel quite a bit and this stay was a *huge* disappointed.   First the good:  The building is a converted fire station which was interesting.  The staff (except for the restaurant waitstaff) was very helpful and timely with their responsibilities.  Now for the not so good:  The room was tiny.  The bathroom had virtually no counter space and only two wall hooks.    There were only two usable drawers in the dresser (the third had a safe).  One of the two drawers had a hairdryer, mini-ironing board and iron in it.  Had we not brought hangers for our formal clothing, we would not have had enough to hang our clothes.  As previous guests have noted one has to get out of bed to turn off the bedside lights.  There was about 2 1/2 feet of space between the walls and…",2
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beautiful boutique hotel but could improve service ,"We were visiting Detroit for the first time for a wedding where the wedding block was at the Westin Book Cadillac. Unfortunately, the employees at the Westin were on strike beginning at 5am so we got no sleep and decided to switch to the Detroit Foundation for the next night. The hotel was beautiful, with the original details of the firehouse kept intact. The complimentary car service was a great perk, as well as a complimentary coffee or tea at the Apparatus bar.   We did not see anyone else in the elevators to or from the guest rooms once so the hotel was presumably relatively empty on a Sunday night, and yet we were not offered an upgrade, and we were given a room that was adjoining to someone else's room and had an extra entryway off the hallway just for these two rooms. We…",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,lots of money for a poor night's rest,"Yes, it is a well designed, well appointed, Spare-no-expense boutique style hotel in a unique urban building at ground zero of Detroit's resurgence. The bed was too stiff for old bones to be comfortable. Got up feeling like I just finished 10 rounds at Kronk Gym (Detroiter's will understand this).Service and environs are great otherwise. Lots of history in that old fire station. Would like to see more local art rotated in and out of the wall spaces. The low amp fuses as chits for morning coffee is a cool idea. The turmeric tea I had at 4:30 a.m. in the Apparatus Room because the bed was too hard to sleep in was a welcome distraction. ",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Excellent Hotel,"Detroit Foundation is an absolute gem! No better boutique hotel downtown. We were treated so great during a birthday celebration stay - complimentary champagne, complimentary car service and breakfast provided with our room package. We won’t be staying anywhere else when in Detroit!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Wonderful!,We were impressed from the moment we drove up and were greeted in front of the hotel by the doormen. Room was beautiful and the restaurant for both dinner and breakfast was amazing. We could not have been happier with our stay.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Sons wedding,"Very nice room. Thank goodness for the room darkened shades!  They were perfect. Room was really soundproofed, we never heard extremely long thunderstorm on the first night.  One disappointment was that the bar closed at midnight on a Saturday night. Way too early.  Will definitely stay again.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Detroit Foundation wedding weekend for guests,"The rooms are lovely and the bedding is extremely luxurious. The staff is wonderful as is the fitness center. The restaurant, Apparatus has terrific food. Quirky tip: they hide the extra tp in little black velvet bags and the firehouse tokens will get you free and fabulous coffee in the morning.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great but too hipster for its own good,"The hotel is architecturally very cool, and the rooms are comfortable.  There is not much space for hanging up clothing (we were in town for a wedding so had lots of stuff), and the ""deluxe king room"" is kind of small.  The downstairs restaurant/bar, the Apparatus room, is really awesome, though.Overall it is good - we would go back for sure.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Good service, historic restoratiion","Beautifully renovated building in a lively neighborhood. Our room was comfortable but the ventilation system blew a strong cold wind, and the room lacked a few key amenities-- bedside lights were not placed for reading, and the bathroom had absolutely no place to put toiletries or clothes-- really needed a shelves and hooks.  Without these issues this would be a 5 star review.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Urban Vibe,"Stayed for one night recently during a trip to the general area. The hotel architecture is gorgeous -- lots of historical brick work, art, and unique features/highlights of local artisans and chefs.   The room (Superior King) was fairly big. The bathroom was a bit small (not much counter space to spread makeup and toiletries), but the amenities were nice (shampoos, makeup wipes, cotton balls, etc). The bed was fairly comfy and there were lots of electric outlets in convenient locations around the room.  The staff were friendly and efficient -- always welcomed us, assisted with luggage, efficient with the door, etc. They even sent a bottle of wine when they found out that we were celebrating an occasion.   The resturant was amazing! Local food and craft drinks, live music, and…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Love Love Love,"I loved all the people who work here.  They all kind and helpful, from the person who took our reservation and made sure we had the right room, to the person who greeted us at the door, to the person who gave us tips on where to go, etc. etc.  I loved the room.  It was as comfortable as any I have been in (and I have been in a lot).  Specifically, we had an junior suite, which much more spacious and actually suite-like than a lot of what other hotels pass off as a suite.  I loved the restaurant.  We ate there twice for dinner and twice for breakfast, plus had a few drinks in the bar.  It was all good.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Urbanista Renewal Done Very Well,"An amazing renewal of an old fire station.  Clean, efficient, coherent in design, feel, staffing etc.  Very focused on local products and partnerships.  Across the street from Cobo - so very convenient. Easy walk to the core of the reviving downtown.  Detroit is definitely roaring back.  Three cheers for the team that pulled this off.   My personal tastes don’t run to graffiti art or Andy Warhol, so it wasn’t a perfect fit for me, but I will definitely recommend it for my more adventurous and educated friends.  The website does a good job displaying the vibe.  ",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Reunion at the Foundation,"Outstanding hotel that focuses on service and making the guest feel at home.  We had 17 people from all over the country there for a fraternity reunion and we couldn't have picked a better place.  The hotel is beautifully restored, right in the heart of the D, has a great restaurant, and the nightlife is really hopping.  Loved every minute.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great hotel,Renovated firehouse is as nice as the reviews say. Great location. One of the “coolest” places I’ve stayed. Rooms done just right with being modern and respecting the buildings past. Very nice bar area. Excellent breakfast at reasonable price,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Third time back!,We've now stayed at the Detroit Foundation three times in two years.  My hubby is a firefighter and the hotel was recommended as a great place to take him for his 60th birthday.  They treat firefighters very well.  A room discount and complimentary beverage.  We absolutely love the atmosphere and the staff is wonderful.  We've been back twice met friends up in Detroit and stayed there again after a concert at Little Ceasar's Area.  You will love this place if you come.  The bar area is awesome as well.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A dream come true,"Our visit was astounding! (We visited Detroit Foundation 7 months ago, but I’m not much of a social media gal and I forget trip advisor exists until someone reminds me ;) ) due to an epic snow storm, we were 4 hours late, Checking in around 12am.   Valet, to the bellman to front desk, welcomed us like it was 8pm! “Hello!!!”They said, “we’re celebrating xxxx’s birthday this weekend right?!?” Omg! It was 12am and the city was under 12+ inches of snow! I’m sure the staff were wondering how they’d safely get home that night, but when we arrived, we, the guest, were their focus. There aren’t too many places where, you, as the guest, feel so welcome, so invited, and so.....part of the family. Thank you Detroit Foundation Hotel!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great overnight stay with my family,"My wife and our 2 sons (4 months and 2.5) stayed in the junior suite on a Friday night after a family wedding in town. We used the valet services and had breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. Everything was absolutely fantastic.  Everyone was friendly, check in and check out was a breeze, breakfast was awesome! One of the nicest hotels we’ve ever stayed at, we wish we could of stayed another night and were able to try the restaurant for dinner. The room was great for the four of us, it was nice having the little wall separating our bed from the pull out couch were our son slept, that couch was also very nice and comfortable. We will definelty be coming back and will recommend to our friends and family.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,I can't wait to be back,"I had a short stay at the Foundation in February and just fell in love. Leading up to my sisters Detroit destination wedding that I was planning, I was dreaming about the 3 wonderful days that I would get to use that awesome matte black shower, be steps away from the best Old Fashioned, and bask in the absolute best service. As I was planning the weekend, I had a lot of questions, accommodations, and requests, and the Foundation was so pleasant to work with and made my weekend so much smoother and easier to enjoy.The real clutch came when on the second day members of our party staying at the Crowne Plaza had a horrifying experience involving feces and a face towel... They were all so uncomfortable and unable to relax in their hotel for the rest of the trip. We were so thankful…",5

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Really fun hotel,"The old firehouse is really cool and the bar on the first floor is great.  The rooms are pretty modern and still have the old cement floor.  So, don’t expect a luxury feel in the room but it is clean, comfortable, and they give great service!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Super Cool Hotel,"This is a converted Firehouse that is really cool.  Staff is great - I stayed earlier in year when there was road construction and, while that was a nightmare and hotel was not advised by city, they did the best with a bad situation.  This time there was no road construction issues and room was nicely done and QUIET.  Fitness Center is above average.  Restaurant is good. Bed is super comfy and shower excellent.  This is a unique and good option if staying downtown.  ",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Very good but could be better, a bit of style over substance","This is a beautifully designed hotel with great history and character - it's clearly the place to be in Detroit and we enjoyed our stay there. The upsides are that our room was very well designed, had great furniture, a nice mini bar and was very spacious. We appreciated the filter coffee at the bar in the morning and the bar/restaurant area was fun and buzzing. The architecture is also very charming. However, as nice as it looked, it slightly misses the mark compared with other hotels of this style and price point. The AC in the rooms was impossible to control, I don't think it was a comfortable temperature throughout the whole stay no matter what we did. Our room had an adjoining door to the next room which was a little noisy at times. The bedroom floors are bare concrete with…",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Cool hotel, great friendly staff",I have to echo the kudos the media and other guests have given this hotel.  We stayed in a city view foundation king room 2 nights while attending a wedding in Detroit.  Great design from the lobby and Apparatus Room to the hallways on the floors and the individual rooms.    Breakfast wasn't included in our rate but we ate brunch n the Apparatus room twice and it was delicious and very reasonably priced.  Most importantly all of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful - the valet staff especially!    The hotel definitely deserves all the accolades it's been getting!,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Nicely repurposed building,An old fire station has been turned into a chic and trendy boutique hotel. The restaurant / lounge is a popular classy evening spot for party goers.   Because of this it can be a bit noisier on the streets at points in the evening.  The windows could be better sealed. The location is very close to the convention Center. There is surface self park for $25 / day and $32 for valet parking.   Wifi is free and works well. There was no safe in the room.  The beds are comfy and the room is clean.  I wouldn’t walk around too far at night in the area though. ,4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Coolest Hotel/Bar,"We loved staying here! Very cool transformation of an historic building in downtown Detroit. Close to everything. Not much we wanted to eat on the apps front, while enjoying a drink, and breakfast wasn't as appealing as we'd hoped. The room was very cool. Loved the shower, bathroom, location, design. Great place to have a cocktail before going out! Excellent sleep as well. Very helpful staff at front desk. A+!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Revitalized Icon/ good food/ sparse rooms,"I stayed at the DFH on business with a wonderful dinner in the Chef's Dining Room and pre dinner welcome cocktails in the Apparatus Room bar. The cocktail area has a great vibe inhabited by business people, fashionistas and suburban curiosity seekers. The service from valet to check in and out and maid service were first rate. However, the experience was diminished by the cold uninviting room. I get redefined architecture and do not need grand drapes and acutoments and lots of pillows. But my room was spare ,sparce and not welcoming. The bed was acceptable and the shower good, but it is definitely not 4/5 star. ",3
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,This is an amazing Detroit Hotel!,I stayed at the Foundation Hotel for a few nights in August and absolutely loved it! The building is a beautiful bit of Detroit history and the staff could not have been friendlier. I highly recommend staying here if you're in town. Cheers.,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,An unexpected pleasure,Unique setting and extremely warm reception. Loved the location. Interiors updated but not too much. A great feel.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Anniversary get-away,My husband and I spent the night at the Founation Hotel for our anniversary.  Not only did they upgrade us to the beautiful and well appointed Secretary Suite but they also delivered champagne and cookies.  The staff + valet were very helpful + kind.

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Outstanding design, service and location!","The Detroit Foundation Hotel is unique. A large restored fire hall, it has many interesting and original design features, beautifully maintained large rooms and a vibrant and inviting bar/restaurant area. Staff are friendly and warm, and Jeonnay, as well as the tall young man with gold glasses who tends the bar, are stellar employees. She was a pleasure to talk with, as she drove me in the hotel car to the Motown museum, and he made awesome drinks and was equally friendly and cheerful. The young man who checked me out at 5:30am was a pleasure to meet. Overall, a great hotel, with great rooms, great drinks and meals, and especially with great staff. I shall return!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Superb hotel in the heart of downtown Detroit,"First rate service with great rooms and wonderful food. The hotel, an old fire station, has been tastefully re-furbished and put to a new use. Dinning room to one side of the bar but child friendley. English breakfast as good as you'd get in London.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,One word....Santal33,"I love this hotel!!  The rooms are like walking into a restoration hardware catalog.   Bed is comfortable.  Although I rarely/never pay for inroom food/drinks, I can definitely appreciate the attention to detail in picking out made in Michigan products.  The bathroom is simple but nice.  And did i mention they provide Santal33 bath products, lol.   One of my favorite scents.  The bar downstairs is pretty cool, would like to have dinner there one night.  In the morning you are allowed a free cup of coffee if you bring down the fuses they provide in the room.  The chocolate chip cookies are some of the best I’ve had, and I’m a cookie snob lol.  The few times I’ve stayed there, EVERYONE working was very friendly and helpful.  They seemed to really enjoy working at the Foundation. …",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beautiful hotel!,I changed my original reservations to this hotel and I am so glad I did.  Beautiful restored building that used to be the Firehouse Headquarters.  The rooms are beautiful and modern.  The beds are so comfortable.  Highly recommend the hotel restaurant The Apparatus Room.  Food and service was exceptional!!!         ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Unique and Hip Hotel,"The hotel was really great. I don't usually stay in such hip hotels but I was attracted to the history of the building (TBH I also read a great NYTimes review). The building itself was gorgeous and grungy (is it ok to use those two words in the same sentence?). The room was phenomenal. I loved the way it looked and the way they used the space. I had some minor housekeeping problems in the bathroom but were resolved quickly. Also the fact that they had Le Labo soaps in the bathroom made it all better. Staff was nice and accommodating, food was great, and ambiance superb! Also, check out time was 12 which I greatly appreciated. All in all, we would 100% come back here. Thanks for a great stay.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Place!,"Didn't know what to expect, a refurbished fire station. WE LOVED IT! Boutique hotel with a great restaurant and bar downstairs. Room was great, super comfortable and great bathroom. Staff was great and because it was my birthday they surprised us with a bottle of champagne and sweets when we got back to the room. Highly recommend it.",5

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great  authentic Detroit hotel,The Foundation capitalizes on the history of the building and the location making it a wonderful place to stay.  We’ve stayed a few times now and will continue to frequent this hotel for our trips to Detroit. The staff is fabulous and very focused on making your stay everything you want it to be. Front the hotel you can take a lovely walk along the riverfront and it is close to many downtown Detroit venues.  ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Unique new upscale and exciting,"for a big city the options are not great...but thought i would try this converted firehouse the rooms were a nice size, clean and well appointed ...a bit funky but in a good way restaurant near front desk was hopping from breakfasts to night...breakfast was only meal i did here but great  free coffee in the am....pastries available to buy...free paper( i still like paper so enjoyable) well located downtown and very walkable i would definitely go back...",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Night - Great Stay,"Hotel room was beautifully decorated, beds were extremely comfortable. The staff was so unbelievable helpful and kind. I've never received such outstanding service at a hotel before.  Would stay here again for business, couples weekend, family trip or friends night out. Really a great atmosphere for any type of trip.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great stay!,"Spent a busy weekend at the Foundation Hotel and was very happy with the experience!  Staff went out of their way to make us comfortable, valet was amazing and we even got a gift from our Lincoln Navigator ride experience.  Definitely plan on staying there again soon.  ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Best experience,"I just wanted to say over the weekend of Aug 25-26, the front desk was very pleasant and helped so much when we arrived early for check in. Valet was so helpful and worked very quickly and was very nice even when they were very busy. I will only stay at this place again when I visit Detroit again.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Outstanding Service!,"The service at this hotel is the best I have experienced over many years of frequent business travel. Hawanya Garrett, the overnight agent at the front desk, is exceptional. She assisted me several times during my stay (I get up really early!) and she was always friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and went above and beyond.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A Night in Detroit,"I was looking for a special place that would accommodate a few requests, as it was my girlfriend and I, and I wanted to surprise her. Upon arrival we were treated warmly and given the use of the house vehicle as we were late for our dinner reservation. The valets were excellent and expedient. My special requests were verified twice by the staff with phone calls two days prior to arrival. The morning breakfast and brunch at The Apparatus Room were delicious. I would recommend this location to anyone visiting Detroit for work or pleasure. They made the whole weekend work for us and I’m looking forward to returning.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Awesome overnight stay for our group!,"Our group of 25 stayed at the Foundation hotel on August 10th. So glad we chose this hotel! The rooms were clean, cool and chic. More impressively though, was the friendliness and professional attitude of each of the staff members we encountered. Everyone from the valet to the folks at check-in to housekeeping were so friendly and pleasant. It seemed like everyone went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay. We will definitely return!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great place,"Good, central location. Great atmosphere in the bar and dining area. We enjoyed our morning complimentary coffee and newspaper there. Room was clean and well furnished. Nice big shower. Bed very comfortable. Highly recommended. ",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Nice hotel with a great restaurant and cool, funky decor","I was hosting an offsite meeting for my team and we chose the Detroit Foundation. The rooms are nice, with a modern more industrial feel. Showers are large and have very good shampoo, conditioner, and bath gel. Bed was comfortable. I was on the 2nd floor and was woken up every morning at 5AM by a very noisy garbage truck. Many of my colleagues had the same experience - so make sure you get a room away from the garbage pickup area.   The restaurant, The Apparatus Room, was very good as was the bar.   The meeting room was large and well-appointed, though the WiFi projection tools were a little annoying to use. On our first day we had a temp imbalance so that one part of the group was comfortable but the other part was freezing.  All in all it was a good experience, but the service…",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Didn't miss a beat!,"We enjoyed absolutely everything about our stay. The decor is amazing - down to each and every tile. The food was amazing in both dining areas. We had a Jr Suite, loved the shower and the seating area. The gym was fantastic. We found the location to work for walking to both day time and evening restaurants and such. Even though they offer a car we didn't need it. Highly recommend this hotel. We were very impressed.   ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Remarkable Hotel and Resturant,"Great atmosphere, amazing staff, awesome food and unique stylish rooms! What more can you ask for?! Best burger in town. Bartenders are knowledgeable and the craft cocktails (my favorite the old foundation) are incredible. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great Hotel with Real Character in Downtown Detroit,"This hotel is part of Detroit reawakening.  Located inside the old city fire department headquarters, the Detroit Foundation hotel blends great architectural details with everything you would want in a modern, boutique hotel.  Rooms are large and comfortable, with poured concrete floors and fun murals of old building details.  Nice sized bathroom with a great walk-in shower.  Downstairs the old fire bays remain but behind those doors is a very hip lobby bar and restaurant.  Great vibe and walking distance from everything in downtown.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Historic Firehouse Now Cool Hotel,"Architecturally preserved and updated. Cool building and rooms. Dining room/bar area visually impressive. Great bar, good food. It was a fire department and many of the original functionalities were incorporated into the design.  Central location to vibrant downtown Detroit which is amazing to experience.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Excellent Service and Food,"My husband and I stayed here for our 5 year wedding anniversary and we were congratulated by multiple people in both the hotel and restaurant. We felt special the whole time. The customer service at the front desk was sincere and prompt and we were always greeted and told to have a good time by the valet people.   The restaurant was phenomenal. We ordered the chefs choice menu and had way too much food to eat in a good way. It was delicious and fresh and they even made changes to accommodate me being pregnant. As much as I love cocktails, they made an amazingly fresh and tasty mint Mojito mocktail for me as well. We will definitely be back soon!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beautiful hotel,Stayed at the Foundation for a weekend getaway with friends. Check in was easy. Staff were all friendly and helpful. Needed ice for the room and it was promptly delivered. Loved being able to use the Lincoln Navigator instead of having to call an Uber. Top notch experience! ,5

"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beautiful Hotel ,Loved the Detroit Foundation Hotel. Excellent customer service from the valet attendants  to the front desk staff and bartenders in the hotel bar. I liked also that they support local Detroit vendors. Local items available at front desk as well as in your room. ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing experience,"This is an amazing place and experience. The staff were all very professional and attentive. The building and what they have done in its restoration and furnishings is a sight to take in. The restaurant and bar was bustling on a Thursday night! It’s not a quiet place, but certainly positive and lively vibe! This was certainly worth the extra money for a night’s stay in a unique place with staff who seem to enjoy what they do and are thankful for their guests.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Best Hotel in Southeast Michigan,"From the second we pulled up to the valet line, to the moment we picked up our car to leave, every single aspect of this stay made this the most phenomenal stay that anyone could have asked for. We checked in and the front desk clerk was the most friendly that we could have asked for. We checked in to our well-appointed room with a great wet bar selection and great Detroit area products. When we realized we had forgot to bring in two bags, we were promptly brought the forgotten luggage. The Apparatus Room has a wonderful, helpful staff that makes great cocktails and delicious food. My only regret was only staying there 2 nights. We will be back as this will be our goto for Detroit stays.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Perfect Location,"I was a guest of Visit Detroit for a 3-night stay at the Foundation Hotel. My only complaint was the lousy coffee at breakfast. This 100 room hotel is located just across the street from the Cobo Convention Center. Not to be too picky but it was very difficult trying to cross the street as traffic comes out of the tunnel & rushes straight past the hotel. Walk only with the light, in the crosswalk. The wonderful valet parkers halted traffic so I could get across (I walk with a cane). They also hold open the huge former firehouse doors.  The third floor has an open area with books where one can sit and read. There is also a 24-hour fitness center.  The two parts of the building used to be the old fire department headquarters as well as the Pontchartrain Wine Cellar. The small…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great experience at Detroit Foundation Hotel,"Amazing experience at the hotel, from the moment we pulled into valet until check out. Impeccable service and attention to detail. Love the hotel and the history.We walked to Comerica Park for the game and it was not far at all.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,I thought it was super!,"I was a little surprised at some of the negative reviews as my experience was great.  Stayed there for a night while traveling through Detroit, and loved the quirkiness and found object nature of this re-purposed firehouse.  Rooms are clean and freshly modern.  My elderly mother would have liked to have had grab-bars in the shower, but we did not think to request that. Exploring the hotel, we found the fire-hose hanging area, converted to a wine cellar, and the exit stairs were also where the firehoses were dried.  Supposedly the arson investigation unit was on the top floor.  Super-friendly staff - we got a lovely complimentary cocktail when we checked in.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Enjoyable one-night stay...,"We recently had the opportunity to stay at the The Foundation for an evening and found it clean, comfortable and interesting.  The room was clean and well appointed with plenty of local flare.  Staff were helpful and seemed genuinely interested in our visit. The ""Apparatus Room"" is a nice place to sit and enjoy a drink, thought the service on the bar side was a bit hit & miss and we wished the menu had a few more options.  I think this would be a nice choice for those visiting Detroit for the first time.  The location is good and the building has a Detroit-style vibe.  It represents the city well and is a short walk from many attractions.",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Not all it is cracked up to be,Went there in July on the recommendation of Jeremy Clarkson.  I feel it is rather trading on its reputation somewhat. The bar is frightful with terrible service and unfriendly staff.  It is a shame as i am sure it should have a warmer vibe.  ,2
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,not quite perfect,"I've been to Detroit for business a few times but this time it was a pleasure trip to see some baseball games. A colleague recommended this hotel to us. All in all we had an excellent experience. The renovated old fire department headquarters is as impressive as the other reviews report. The cavernous old firehouse makes a beautiful dining room/lounge area, although a bit noisy in the evening. When traveling I like to have a cocktail in a quiet hotel lounge at the end of my day and this was NOT going to happen here, since this hotel is following the trend of trying to attract young hip locals. Cool if you're young and hip, not so welcoming to an old guy like me. Still, the breakfasts were good and the cocktails excellent, and the room itself is to be admired. The front desk,…",4
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Wedding Party,"Was in a wedding where the whole bridal party got ready at the hotel. We had 2 large suites, which were probably the coolest hotel room I've ever seen, so cool. We also stayed the night for a wedding, our room was normal sized but same modern touches.   My only complaint about the hotel is that the A/C was super loud which made sense why there were ear plugs in the bathrooms.   The elevator area made for such nice pictures too. I love how they kept the original featured of the fire station and also used nice materials for a luxurious classic feel. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Getting over Divorce Stay-cation,"Very clean, comfortable and big rooms.  Bed was dreamy, soft and sleepy. Bathroom has two different shower heads, complimentary toiletries are high quality and towels are big and soft. Hotel interior and exterior very cool with extra touches that are to be seen. Very close - walking distance -  to the hot spots as well as the Q line to connect you to midtown. Price point is high but worth the splurge if you have something worth celebrating.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Gorgeous hotel in historic building,"From the moment you walk in you'll be struck by the industrial artsy feel. Local art adorns the walls throughout. The building was the city firehouse so has very high ceilings and exposed piping. If you sit at the bar and turn towards the street, you'll see the old firepole to your right in a cutaway. First time here and I was upgraded to a lovely suite - one large room with a sitting area and king size bed divided by a dimensional 3/4-size thick wood wall. Adjacent is a bathroom with a large walk in shower. The staff esp Michael and Bradley, at both checkin and the restaurant were accommodating, knowledgable and refreshingly midwest pleasant! If I ever make it back to Detroit, this will be my hotel of choice. ",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Amazing,"Our hometown visit was topped off with a stay at the Detroit Foundation Hotel and we could not have chosen a better place to end a perfect weekend of our 40th high school reunion fun with friends and family visits. Every employee we encountered was kind, helpful and very personable! The Apparatus Room lounge area was great to have friends join us for drinks and appetizers. Our room was beautiful and well appointed. We loved having access to the  bicycles and took a ride around the riverfront to Belle Isle. What a great way to make sure the Detroit Fire Station Headquarters is uniquely preserved by renovating it into the Foundation Hotel and Apparatus Room!  Loved it and will return!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Beautiful restoration and delicious food at the restaurant,"We went for dinner at the Apparatus room with 4 friends a few months ago. We had a great time, the food was delicious, the waitress was very knowledgeable and the restored fire hall was beautiful. I real gem for the city. I loved the art work in the dining area and the lighting fixtures were so unique and fit the space so well. I had the duck and it was tender and cooked to perfection. It is not inexpensive but it was worth it and we will be back.   On our way out we noticed the podcast studio area at the front of the hotel. I was with 4 musicians and a sound technician, so we had to stop in. We were talking with the staff and then we were offered a tour of the Foundation hotel by Chikas Reynolds. He was very hospitable and knowledgeable about the history of the restored…",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,A pleasure,"Wonderful hip and a great example of adaptive reuse of an old Fire Station.  The restaurant is quite good and it is smack in the center of the major revival of Detroit's downtown area.  I would get a room on the permitter of the building as some rooms face into a weird atrium and others are about 4 feet away from a building that was halted mid-construction.  When they switched me to a room overlooking the street, it was significantly brighter and more pleasant.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great stop with my kids,"My kids (8 and 10) and I stopped for an overnight at the Foundation, and it was the perfect place for us. Our staff encounters were limited to various valet and reception employees, but everyone was friendly, welcoming, and helpful to us. We loved our high-ceilinged, room, and really enjoyed seeing both the city and the way places -- like the Foundation -- are helping bring Detroit back.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,An excellent stay at the coolest hotel,"I am so happy that I chose to stay at the Foundation hotel while stopping in Detroit. It's an absolutely beautiful hotel, has only been open for a year, and used to be fire station. The room was really nicely decorated, beds were ok, service is great too. From the friendly check-in, to the valet - everyone just made us feel so welcome. I would definitely stay here again anytime I am back in Detroit",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Great experience all around,"Really enjoyed this small boutique hotel.  Staff was friendly, helpful and personable.  The hotel is beautiful and hip, my room was comfortable and had everything I needed for my 3 night stay.  I enjoyed the modern yet comfortable furnishings.  The hotel is a renovated fire house, and they kept a bit of that history.  I appreciated it being unique and not a traditional chain hotel.  I ate in the Apperatise Room and few times, loved it!  Even got a salad to go.  Morning coffee was great.  I’m picky about where I stay and I was very pleased and pleasantly surprised by this little gem!",5

First class operation.",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,Detroit cool!,"Detroit Foundation exceeded expectations in all ways.  The building itself is a marvel and the updates are terrific.  The main open bar/restaurant lobby are a wonderful gathering place.  The service is warm, welcoming and friendly.  I loved the use of 'all things Detroit' in the decor and uniforms as well.  The guest rooms were modern, yet cozy, and all well appointed.  Nothing lacking in this place!",5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,"great, unique, vibrant hotel in downtown",This converted fire station has kept much of its charm while being updated and upgraded into a first-rate hotel. Make sure to eat at the restaurant on the lobby-level of the hotel. This hotel is further evidence of Detroit's comeback.  ,5
"Detroit, MI",Detroit Foundation Hotel,If Restoration Hardware Had A Hotel,"I was recently in town for an event at the Cobo Convention Center, so I booked the Foundation hotel based on it's location alone - it's literally across the street. The hotel is small (5 floors) and was an old fire station that's been converted. The vibe is funky and cool. Saying you were at the Foundation vs. the Crowne Plaza across the street increased my street cred considerably. The people in the lobby bar are a blend of guests in town for whatever is at Cobo, business people, wedding guests and hipsters. The service is excellent - staff bent over backward for every request. The rooms are small but efficient - very new and modern. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Things to note: - It's the cool place for everyone to hang out, regardless of where they're staying.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Worst first experience in Detroit,"When we arrived the uber driver dropped us off in front of the casino doors, the doors were closed to the casino. We thought the hotel and casino were one it was not also it was very cold we walked  around at 12:45am trying to get information how to get to hotel a lady  told us there is no elevator we had to walk around the corner and up the  stairs. We went around the corner and it  was dark we couldn't find the stairs  the lady was talking about, it was  hidden. We ask a gentleman and he said ""oh they want you to to use the employees entrance"" it was a very dark walk to the stairs when we got to the stairs there were a hundred cigarette buts all over my husband had to carry our suitcase up 4 flights of stairs. All out of breath from walking up the stairs a guy at the door check our temperature and said yell to get someone to check you in, we went to the counter no one was there, we shouted for 5 mins no one came my husband had to go back to the guy at the door and asked him to call someone.  The only positive thing about the hotel was the room but for $400 for 2 nights this is not worth the price. I have stayed at cheaper hotels and had wonderful experiences. I never checked out the casino. Now having experience the hotel I can assume the 4 stars it has is based on the casino and not the hotel. If you are traveling on a late night flight you will have a problem to find a uber and lyft to the hotel. Most uber and lyft drivers do not want to take you up the the hotel they rather leave you downstairs not only in the night. The security also gave my husband a hard time when he went to buy a drink in the casino they took his ID for a couple mins and called ""someone"" to confirm what I dont know, other people walked past the security without an issue. This is the worst hotel experience!… check our temperature and said yell to get someone to check you in, we went to the counter no one was there, we shouted for 5 mins no one came my husband had to go back to the guy at the door and asked him to call someone.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice Surprise,"We ended up here b/c we got a great rate for a 4.5* hotel on Hotwire. When I found out it was a Casino I was upset—I mean, who wants to be in a casino during Covid? But we were both surprised by the ease of check in, the dedication to sanitization and the nice room. The room was spacious, the bed gets 5 stars in comfort and the TV was huge, bathroom had both a shower and tub and all amenities. We ordered room service....menu was very limited but we were thrilled with our Greek salad (again, 5 stars) and LIttle Caesar Pizza that came in 20 min. I would have not have made this as my first choice (b/c of the casino) but we were very happy with our time there. Employees were top notch, too.",4

Pros:  ~From the front desk to security everyone was so friendly with a smile on their face. ~The casino was proportional to the hotel. It was nice to not have a long walk.  ~The casino itself was really nice, not smokey, and social distancing was in place. ~There were sanitizers throughout the casino and the hotel. Mask were also worn. ~The room service food was really good. ~The bed in the hotel room was very comfortable we slept great.  Cons:  ~The hotel room was dated and could really use an upgrade or remodeling.  ~The carpet was dirty and could use a replacement or cleaning. ~The tables and cabinets were dusty. ~The curtains could use a steaming and cleaning.  ~The bathroom was not clean as their was a urine spot on the toilet.   My expectations:  On their website the rooms look so well put together so we were very disappointed that the actual room did not look like the website especially since this was our anniversary getaway.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Just ok place to stay,"We spent a few days in Detroit and saw the reviews of this hotel and decided to stay here, unfortunately we were very disappointed.  The staff was extremely friendly I will say.. very helpful but the room was not in the best shape.  It definitely looks like it needs to be updated.  The sheets were stained and so is the carpet.  Unfortunately there was a lot closed as far as restaurants due to Covid, so not a lot of options in the hotel you actually had to leave the hotel to get a good meal.  Nothing around in walking distance of the hotel, something you need to keep in mind when leaving to go get dinner, lunch or breakfast.  The good part was they had free parking which was connected to the hotel.   With Covid they did close off a lot of entrances and exits to get in and out of the hotel so if you did leave the hotel and didn’t drive it was hard to get back in.  The signs were not very clear but the staff was very helpful.  Deep bathtub and a nice big shower that was probably the best but I was extremely disappointed in the rooms not sure we would come back.. as things were very outdated and beat up.… the hotel so if you did leave the hotel and didn’t drive it was hard to get back in.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Loved it!!!,"We were concerned about safety while staying in Detroit, however once we got to this hotel, we were happy. This is an upscale hotel with an adjoining casino. There are separate parking areas for each building & you had to check in once you drove up to park. Only those staying at the hotel were allowed to park in this area. It was manned 24 hours & they checked the roster to make sure you were a registered guest. The room was a nice size, very clean with double beds. There was a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee & also a mini fridge. The sheets were clean & so was the bathroom. The bathroom was exquisite with a large walk in tiled shower & a soaking tub. Great bathroom amenities & bathrobe also. This room was very comfortable for our three night stay. I Highly recommend this…",5

Casino on the other hand was very very very smokey we actually had to go back to the room to get a break from the smell me and my wife are not smokers but I use to b a smoker so I dont mind it but the smoke here is horrible ended up getting headaches so we needed to take breaks throughout the night. People were very nice and helpful. And we had a average time. Nothing special just a hotel attached to a casino exactly what you would expect,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Cancelled our reservation before Check-in,"Our plane landed in Detroit at 11am on a Saturday where we planned to stay the night after the concert at Ford Field.  After leaving the airport, the hotel called and said they cancelled our reservation!  We booked the room 3 months ahead of time through travelocity for $217/night.  The hotel manager said the card wasn't valid which was bold faced lie!  He said i have the option to rebook that same room for $497/night!   Upon looking over the hotel terms/conditions, it reads, ""form of payment to be charged at check-in.""  My card used to hold the reservation was valid and there was no question it had plenty of funds available.  This was a way for the hotel to make double the price of the room and take advantage of Garth being in town.  We are currently escalating this situation…",1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Cancelled our reservation ,They will cancel your reservation and try to sell you the same room for double the price when they get busy  Will definitely not be going back anytime soon! Also seen another person had the exact same issue with this place  scammers! ,1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Worst Experience Ever!,"Last night was single handily the worst travel experience I have ever had, all thanks to Motor City Casino and Hotel. I booked a room at Motor City Hotel way back in November; I have stayed at this hotel in the past and had no issues. However, all that changed yesterday after my horrific experience. When I went to check into my room, I was informed that they had CANCELLED my reservation. Excuse me, what? Yup, they cancelled it earlier that morning. I was absolutely flabbergasted. The front desk “claimed” they called me earlier that day to inform me my reservation had been cancelled. However, I have absolutely no record of that call and highly doubt a call was ever made. I also never received a written (or email) cancellation notification, which in my opinion, doesn’t make much…",1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great location and service,"We spent a few nights here and very much enjoyed our stay.

The room was clean and the housekeeping staff were attentive. Highly recommend!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Spot for Pre-Game Fun,"I stopped in here before a Red Wings game for a bit of play and a bite to eat.  There was plenty of easily accessible parking. The interior was clean, but smoky (to be expected). The non-smoking gambling area was completely separate from the smoking area.  I interacted with a staff member at the rewards desk, a beverage server, and security. All the staff member's I interacted with were friendly and attentive.   I only played slots while I was here. There are a large variety of games in various denominations, including some of the older games I like to play and newer games. The machines all worked flawlessly, including the bill receptors and ticket printers.  The ticket redemption machine worked OK, but it only accepted one ticket at a time - so it took a while to cash in at the…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Old World Detroit Elegance in a Great Location,"Truly the experience we were looking for in the heart of Downtown Detroit. The location is excellent, friendly staff and a hotel with the classic Detroit Elegance.  The staff is friendly and the hotel has most things you would want...coffee shop in the lobby, Candy bar pub in the back of the hotel and a sandwich shop on the mez level. The rooms are luxurious although small (think old school hotels or Europe).  However, the value was very good and rooms were clean.  This hotel has a feel like your in classic Detroit (like the Leland before it went condo OR the Millender before it became the Ashley). As a bonus, within a block are several restaurants and pubs plus the stadiums and theaters are all within a few minute walk or a quick Uber/Lyft ride.  I highly recommend the stay for…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Good experiene,"I met a friend for lunch.  I'm a vegetarian, and appreciated the wide non-meat spread.  The service was awesome too!  My only issue was navigating from the parking garage to the buffet location.  Signage was minimal and it was very confusing.  Not surprisingly, I was late for lunch.  ",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Loved everything,It was such a fun and relaxing night in the food was magnificent and the view from the room was beautiful. The casino was not too busy and we could locate or play any machine we wanted to. The tables were not crowded but had enough people so I didn't have to play alone. And the food ATS all the restaurants that we tried were so good.,5

Terribly thin walls in the hotel thought the next room occupants were gonna come through the walls they were very very loud arguing and had kids  that was bouncing off the walls.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice hotel. Not the greatest experiences,This is a very nice property. The room was clean and bed was comfortable and the housekeeping staff were excellent. We were disappointed with what happened at check out. The first lady that checked us in was very pleasant and told us that our room wasn’t ready even though it was 3:30 PM and check it was 3 o’clock. Understandable they must’ve been busy the night before. She told us to come back down in a half an hour or call us and she pre-checked us in and got my credit card and information. So when I came back down over an hour later a different lady was very short with me explaining that I was supposed to be waiting for a phone call to let me know my room was ready. She gave me my keys and that was it. She hurried me along as there was a line of guests behind me. I had a few…,4

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Favorite spot in the D,Motor City Casino and Hotel is a fabulous venue and a must visit when in Detroit.  Hotel is clean and comfortable.  Casino is quite large with a nice variety of table games and slot machines. There is always a great band performing for dancing or listening.  Many dining options are also available to choose from.  Absolutely our favorite casino in the Detroit area!,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,The Butler's Lounge Experience (Concierge Lounge),"I got a chance to attend The Butler's Lounge on December 16th, during the 5p-7p time slot. I had met Chante, whom had come to my table, that was full of other guest, and embarrassed me. She had told me about some juice that I was taking to my room, before I had left my table. I did not appreciate that inappropriate childish approach that she commented to me about, while other guests were around. Other guests had left the area with food, also, whom were not approached in such a way, as I was. Besides, what harm are we doing taking food from this area, when it is going to be thrown away, don't our play allow us to consume and take food to our rooms for later? MGM allows us to take concierge food to our rooms. 2 hrs really is not enough time to eat, when you want to play, and enjoy…",4

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great place to stay and wonderful place for a concert,I went there to see The Family Stone and Tower of Power. The room was beautiful. I paid 199 plus tax and had a 50 room credit so do the math. Everyone said hi as I walked by them. Food was great plus the room was huge and a real comfy bed. Good place to go see a concert at Soundstage which is very mush like a Hard Rock Hotel. Lots of stuff to look at. I dropped some quarters in the slots but I dont gamble but it was a great place to stay and see a great concert. I highly suggest this place. I will go back.,5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,The Motor City's Finest Hotel,Our stay was great. It was my girlfriend's birthday weekend. The front desk upgraded our room and treated us like royalty. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a great dinner at Irridescence. We took a walk through the casino but did not gamble. It would be great if the casino banned smoking or relegated it to a certain section. The whole place stank of smoke. That was the only drawback. But we didn't stay there for the casino. I plan on staying here whenever I'm in Detroit.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Excellent staff, room and slot selections.",Motor City Casino and Hotel is a fantastic get away!  All the staff members are so friendly and polite.  By far my favorite casino in Detroit!  Highly recommended!  Great food as well with a huge selection to pick from.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,WHAT A LET DOWN,"It’s such a shame that a place with so much space and is such a nice building, has such bad help. Where do I start. 1. They lost a reservation for one of my coworkers. Then after checking her into a room with someone else they mysteriously found it. 2. My room was filthy. Check the pics. After I spoke with the female manager on duty she assured me my room would get completely cleaned the next day. NOPE still didn’t.  3. My boss had his feet on the coffee table(maybe wrong?) but then one of the rudest people I met here came and told him “get your feet off of the table now!” He apologized and said I’m sorry I just get like i was at home it’s so comfy. Her response was “well you’re not!”  Then she walked away and proceeded to stare us down for the next 30 minutes until we decided…",1

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Thought I’d try this but disappointed ,"Thought I’d try this hotel after I have tried another local casino hotel. The staff was not friendly and welcoming. The first impression was sad. The restaurants was the only one impressive. The room was gloomy and the carpet was old and dirty. The bathroom was boring and the lights are just not impressive. The worst thing was there were no electrical sockets near the bed so I had to miss using my equipment - CPAP at night coz the power chord won’t teach the bedside table. The corners of the room was dusty, overall a disappointing stay. The door key states I might not need the room because of the fun I might have at the casino. They had old machines and the only helpful ones were the old and kind bar ladies trying to get me some drinks. Perhaps trying MotorCity just told me…",3

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Cleanliness and Friendliness go a long way.,"I booked this hotel because it was close to my destination. Price was average compared to surrounding hotels. There is a casino that I did not attend. The parking garage is a little confusing but we eventually parked. I had read previous reviews before going and for the most part they were right on point. When I was checking in the front desk agent was not friendly at all. No personality. I tried making small talk, no response. Not even a smile. I continued up to the room. At first glance it was presentable but working at a hotel before my expectations were high. Let’s just say this did not pass the test. There was an unknown purple gooey substance on the head board. Fingerprints all over the light switches. The knobs to the nightstand were so crusted over I did not even touch…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Bravo!,The infrastructure and cleanliness were what I would expect from an outstanding hotel. What surprised me was the outstanding spirit and friendliness of every staff member I encountered.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Elegant,"The Motorcity Casino Hotel is very elegant. The rooms large and beautifully appointed. His and hers lighted closets. Glasses rather than plastic cups. The bathroom was huge with a separate shower and large soaker tub, lighted make up mirror. We were give an upgrade that included appetizers from 5 - 7 and they were excellent. It also included breakfast but that was not very good.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Motor City Casino Hotel,"First, I suggest parking on the top level.  It's by far the easiest to park at, instead of going around on the other levels trying to spot an empty space.  The casino has two none-smoking areas for patrons that don't want to be around second hand smoke.  The casino has a vast variety of slot machines and gaming tables. The hotel has a buffet area and a deli-type burger restaurants. Also upscale restaurants. The room is spacious with a flat screen tv.  I found that my phones wifi works best near the window for good reception.  Check out is very easy, you can check out via the phone before 11 am to avoid lines at the front desk. I would stay here again.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Friday afternoon visit,Great vibe throughout....until we got to the players club area.  We went to sign up for their card and our service was horrible!  The person who signed me up gave me no information.  When I was done I walked to my husband when was still being signed up and he was being told about free play.  When I asked her to please repeat that (as I came at the end of the conversation) she rolled her eyes at me and dism6ne and continued to only speak to my husband!  Quick let me drop more $ in your casino...I THINK NOT!,2

The hotel is much nicers. Parking, once we found, which was the hotel parking(signs not so good) is easy and plenty of it. Before you can go to your room you have to show your key card to security so only guests can get though. The halls need a renovation, carpet is beyond dirty and stained. The room we had on the 11th floor was huge, with a great view of the international bridge. The room is clean, plenty of space, the bathroom is very large and has everything from soaps and shampoos from the spa to a scale if you wish to weigh yourself.

We got a deal to stay for 169 for the night. I did see that there was a 50 dollar deposit due tat check in. But I had no idea the deposit was going to be charged along with the full nights stay and the taxes. This was a surprise, but I paid the deposit cash and put the rest on my credit card. I have to say that the room was wonderful. It was huge and clean. The beds were comfortable. We had Starbucks coffee in our room, two bottles of water. We only had one tea bag and had to ask for some extra, which was promptly brought to us when asked. The staff was very helpful. except the front desk clerk who was rather sassy.

Free valet parking, reasonable room rate, large hotel room, great bathroom and bathrobes and towels. Great view of city from huge windows. Free wifi, free showtime etc. Room service was wonderful.It was all great-except: the beds have no fitted bottom sheet so flat sheet kept coming undone.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,MotorCity Casino Hotel,Staff were very friendly and welcoming. The fridge in the room is actually a cooler. I asked staff about this since I am a nursing mother and they sent a mini fridge within 15 minutes. Amazing service. My only complaint would be the night time valet staff weren’t helpful. When we arrived to check in I had to push my child in a stroller and my husbands hands were full with all of our luggage and they literally just stood there and watched us struggle to get the door open. Kind of rude but maybe it isn’t their job to open doors. But overall I thought the hotel staff inside the building were awesome.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Love this hotel!,I stayed here last Monday for The Backstreet Boys concert. I originally booked this room because I noted the free shuttle to the concert at Little Caesars Arena. That service was priceless! But let me add the rooms are beautifully decorated very up-to-date and extremely comfortable! Loved the accommodations! There are several dining options. We only had one incident of poor service and that was late night in The Lodge Diner. My niece ordered a drink and it was sitting on the bar a good 15 minutes. We reminded the waiter. He still didn't give it to us. Finally my niece went up to ask the bartender (the bar adjoins the diner) if that was her drink and the female bartender was very nasty to her. Thankfully the restaurant manager or at least I assume that is who he was overheard…,5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Hotel-Not Impressed-Dirty,"We stayed 1 night, July 24, 2019. REO Speedwagon was playing at the Sound Board & we sprung for an overnight. We got a king suite, room 428, with the Motor City Package ($50 restaurant credit) ... with tax, our 1 night stay was $200. We pulled the covers down to the mattress pad, because the bottom sheet was not tucked in. To our horror, there was hair all over the mattress pad. Not one or two or 20 hairs, a lot of body hair. Clearly, they don't change the mattress pad until someone complains. There was a large round stain on the side of mattress. The surfaces had only been dry dusted around what was sitting out; many rings from wet cups. The desk chair had honey or something other sticky substance dripped across the back. The entire tile area was sticky & the carpet was dingy…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Some good some not so good,Stayed here for 4 nights. Room very spacious as is the bathroom. Comfortable bed. Carpet could use a cleaning. Cleaning of rooms hit and miss. Some days yes some no even when clean room sign was on. A bit put off when evening staff came to clean because we had been missed in morning to be told they don’t replace dirty glasses just give them a wipe. Might want to bring some detergent. Also toiletries  replenishment sometimes no shampoo but 6 body wash. Good eateries  available in hotel but nothing close by. Need to take a taxi to downtown rate $15. Seems to be on edge of renewal are as many boarded up buildings nearby. Easy to get to because of proximity to highways. Free valet parking excellent service. Casino good variety. Very smoky. Smoke free one limited options. Gift shop…,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,SPECTACULAR!,"Talk about being catered!! Upon arrival, valet was wonderful and FREE! Then, the Bell service gentleman--Michael, was impeccable. He gave us an informative guide while taking us to our room, explaining functionality of things from the time we entered the hotel lobby, even with our room. The buffet dining area was GREAT! Even the Food Court was good :-).  The room was so comfortable, I almost didn't want to leave. I loved the idea of having a doorbell for visitors to ring. The room & bathroom were very clean and well kept. If I had to do it over, I'd stay at this hotel again.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Easy Peasy for ELO at LCA,"Me and girlfriends wanted to attend ELO and avoid hassle of parking and driving home after event, so we thought we'd spend the night, picked MotorCIty because of location to Little Caesars Arena and because they have a shuttle to events.   We found MotorCity incredibly easy to get to, parking free and easy, they'll even valet for free. Check in was fast and desk guy Shaun was welcoming and informative, we checked in early so we could enjoy the lunch buffet at The Assembly Line. Buffet was plentiful and mostly tasty. We'd booked Executive Level room so there were evening appetizers and continental breakfast included.   The shuttle to LCA was via bus, comfortable, timely and easy.   Beds were comfortable, rooms were clean and spacious, staff was awesome.  Casino kinda fun bonus as…",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice Clean Room,"Hotel is nice and the room was clean, Staff was a little indignant and their policies regarding their members is a little off.  They send me a flyer just about every months saying two free nights stay and of course they have disclaimer saying some nights might be blacked out.  Well the last few months I have not been able to get any two consecutive nights.  I do not know why they would bother with lies and not just send out a flyer saying you can stay these two nights if you like and provide them.  I called on the 14th of the month and it was good til the 30th,  they literally told me that my promoting was not good for any of the remaining 16 days,  not one night and over half a month left.  Just poor business practices, and I complained to customer service and never received…",2

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Unexpectedly Excellent ,"I booked a room here using Hotel Tonight  because it was comparably inexpensive to other downtown properties but I didn’t expect much.  I talked a number of my colleagues to stay here for same reason.  We all were surprisingly impressed.  I gotta say from the huge free parking lot, to the casino attendant, to the front desk staff to the engineer that fixed my stuffed up shower drain, everyone was exceptionally gracious!  They truly must enjoy working there and it shows.  We all put this on our would stay here again list.",5

Very spacious and lovely amenities. Comfy beds and great soaps, towels and robes. Beautiful city views from the floor to ceiling windows.  We had at the diner restaurant and the portions were huge but the food was so good we ate it all. Also the hotel had a food court style pizza restaurant that our son enjoyed.  We did not visit the casino but no smoky smells were noted anywhere during our stay.  Encountered many friendly people during our stay both hotel staff and other patrons. A very family friendly environment from what we saw even on a busy weekend. ",5

I decided to try the buffet on a Tuesday night which wasn't busy but the selection was fresh and pretty decent. I got a kick out of paying thru a kiosk instead of having to wait in line for a regular cashier. loved my waitress and I wish I had gotten her name to post. she did an excellent job and told me that mondays are usually crazy busy because of seafood night in case u came back on a Monday night. good to know since my husband is deathly allergic to shellfish. the hotel doesn't have a regular pool, instead they have a spa.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Half a visit but enjoyed the service ,"Visited the motor city casino for a show at the sound board in the casino, only to find out the show was rescheduled (ticketmaster did not send an email out) but the casino was very impressive. The valet parking service was super easy to use, the staff in the lobby were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant diner we went to had a good selection of food, I had the Buffalo chicken sandwich, was pretty decent, my friend had the wings and swore they were the best he's ever had.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Booked for tigers game visit,Arrived early on a flight from BOS. Location is easy to find and there is plenty of free and valet parking. Walked to the desk and was processed quickly and efficiently with a bright smile and great attitude. Obviously room wasn’t ready at 1030am so she noted room preference and took my number to call when it was ready. Off to the shuttle for the 1 mile trip to the park   Shuttle driver was personable and pleasant as well. In fact everyone we dealt with was a pleasure. Great staff representation.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Good location and value for money,"Nice spacious rooms, comfortable and clean. Good bathroom amenities. Bar fridge was a joke, though; not sure why it was even there because it didn't keep anything cool. When I enquired with Reception, they said they could send up a fridge for $20. Very off-putting was the smell of cigarette smoke from the casino; it permeated throughout the hotel. Nice gym. A pool wouldn't go astray.",4

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great experience...and we don't gamble!,"The bathroom was spacious and accommodating with extra towels and amenities.  Windows were floor to ceiling providing a sweeping view of downtown Detroit.

But we enjoyed our stay. Lovely lounge with continental breakfast.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very Accommodating Hotel,"Had a wonderful Anniversary stay at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.  Was surprised by the hotel with chocolate covered strawberries to celebrate our anniversary.  The room was really nice and the bathroom was large.  Room was quiet except for you could hear noise from the hallway.  The hotel was very accommodating to our needs.  We did go to the casino and my only complaint would be that it was smoky.  They did have a non-smoking section, but the game choices arent as good.  We ate at the buffet and had a large selection of food and many that they cooked for you on the spot.  Overall, it was a nice little get away.",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Dirty rooms, irresponsible management","My room was never cleaned the 3 nights I stayed there. I took pictures and showed management and I was told it be cleaned (every day, same promise). The same food was on the floor from the previous guests as well as the stains on the sheets. All I got was apologies but never a clean room. To top it off, my car was significantly damaged in the handicapped section of the resort parking lot. Filed a report with security, pictures taken but can't get anyone in Risk Management to call me back and resolve this issue. Frustrated with the lack of response and accountability.",1

Bathroom was huge with a separate jacuzzi tub, the room was very clean! We arrived around 5pm and check in was very quick! I like that they have security checking to make sure u are a hotel guest before u go to the elevator. We went to the buffet on Sunday and it was excellent, so many choices!  The free shuttle transfer to Little ceasers arena was great! They pick u up at the casino valet and drop u off about 2 blocks from the arena and then pick u back up at the same area! We went to the lodge diner after the concert and the service was horrible! The nachos were good once we finally received them about 45 minutes later. Other then the Diner it was an excellent stay and I would…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"""OK""","I've, been here several times, i ""do not"" like the parking & the only one way to enter the building nor the security standing at entrance & elevator.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Educational seminar attendance in conference rooms.,Great location for a conference. Parking was easy and plentiful. The room itself was spacious and comfortable.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Good Hotel and Casino,"Rooms were a little dated and had older dirty carpet, but quite comfortable beds. Fantastic services available. Belhop was outstanding. Easy use of the door keys. Hotel restaurants were somewhat expensive, but I guess that is to be expected when at a casino, however the ones we went to were giving large portions of very good food. Nice selection of restaurants as well. And then you have multiple entries to the casino. We went for a real estate banquet/convention and training seminars. All in all it was a very nice experience. We plan to go again and will be recommending our future events continue to be held there.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,casino hotel,"this hotel is clean, child friendly. Has a very large bath tub for soaking.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Casino Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for Valentine's Day. While we were in Detroit we saw the Mike Epps show. There was free shuttle to the show from the hotel, which was awesome! The check- in process was fairly simple. Upon entering our room it smelled clean. The room was very spacious and well kept. The view was good. We could see the bridge to Canada. There was a separate shower and tub, the toilet was isolated, and there were more than enough mirrors. The only shortcoming to the room was there was a nightly charge to use a microwave and the window was leaking in our room.   The attached casino and restaurants was a real gem. We could easily slip out of bed and gamble any time we wanted. I would definitely visit again!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Not the best stay,I stayed there over the holidays. The AC in my room was broken s it was very hot. The entire place smells like smoke. I don't think that the facility has an adequate air control system for the gaming floor because it was very bad. The food was decent and the staf was amazing.,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very nice,"We stayed here to catch a Toronto Raptors vs Detroit Pistons game in March and are glad we did. Our corner king room was modern, large and included a full length jacuzzi tub. They provide a free shuttle to Little Caesar's arena (make sure you grab your wrist band when you check in or you aren't getting on the bus).  We had an included breakfast with our booking, simple, but filled the hole.You should be able to find something you like there.   The complimentary valet parking was efficient with polite staff, on top of that the parking lot is constantly patrolled.  The food court closer to the Sound Board end is reasonably priced and our choices were quite tasty.    Happily we had already booked another stay for April and are looking forward to that trip now that we've learned the…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Anniversary,"We loved our experience at Motor City hotel. It was easy to get in the parking garage. Rooms were spacious and the hotel provided extras. The chocolate strawberries placed in the room were wonderful. The entire staff was friendly. They had great security measures in place. The rooms were reasonably priced. The food in Iridescence was amazing. They offer a variety from their menu. I had salmon and my husband had steak. This is the pineapple upside down cake, a dessert offered from Iridescence. We plan to return again.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Great Stay, Even on a Snowstorm!","Stayed in this hotel for 6 days for a conference, our view was very lovely.  Although it snowed (snowstorm) and the temperature outside was -33 Degrees celsius, we are very lucky that their heater was working properly considering that their occupancy was quite high and i can imagine the heater usage, etc.. on our 5th day there was a fire alarm and my only complain was, there were different explanations which made some of us panic. All in all it was good, room service is good and always on time. You just have to be savvy with their room service on TV (you will be surprised it is so easy) otherwise you will wait forever for someone to answer the phone for room service.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Super comfortable rooms!,The rooms are big and the view from the 13th floor was great.  The carpe is starting to look a little worn but all of the furniture was good.  The beds are super comfortable and the room was very quiet even though this is a casino hotel.  The bathrooms are huge and the only thing I would change is to add a showerhead with different pressure settings.  The spa is top notch!  I am not a casino person and stayed there for work but it's still a great place to stay.  The restaurant offerings were pretty decent although the service was marginal.  Prices were reasonable.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,My Sister and I overnight stay,We had a great stay. I would recommend this hotel for business and pleasure. Very friendly staff.I left my insulin in the refrigerator and called back and they went out of their way to check for me and they held my meds until I could pick them up later that day.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice view if your are on the right side of the hotel,This place is great.  They have promotions all the time hopefully you have played enough and you can comp the room!!  It's great you can have a great night at the casino and yu don't have to worry about driving it's attached. Bands/music. The casino/hotel is accessible by all freeways.  Tons of restaurants within that you can use your comps or you can order room service if it is to late.  Lots of bars everywhere inside.   I suggest bringing your own robe...I didn't find it all that comfortable. Maybe some people do it comes with a warning if you take it you will be charged $100...totally not worth that amount - felt like cardboard.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Nice place to stay, close to Little Cesars Arena",We went to the Eric Church Concert & made a weekend of it.  The Hotel staff was very helpful.  As I was checking in a gentleman was helping my husband w/ the wrist bands...  They have a shuttle to the arena which is very nice.  The rooms were spacious & clean.  The only complaint I would have is that the casino itself is very smoky.  They do have a non smoking section but it is very small & no black jack tables.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"not impressed, mediocre hotel ","the room floor was wet upon arrival, nothing inside the mini-bar. the rooms are slightly outdated and there was no outlet on one side of the bed. don’t take the free shuttle unless you are ok with waiting in the cold for a long time. was told room service would take 20 min to get. an hour later i called to inquire about our food.. said it would be up soon. no sorry or offer to discount our food for the ridiculous wait. the food at the grand river burger place was so bad we did not finish it even though we had to stand and wait for over 30 min for our order. the food court smelled so bad of cigarette smoke that we did not even bother venturing into the casino. we have stayed at nicer hotels for the same price or even less. ",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Fantastic,"We had an excellent stay at the hotel. We were in town for the Cher concert. The desk staff was amazing, security was friendly, and they even offer free shuttle to LCA. Room was spacious and clean, separate tub/shower and great views. The lodge diner on the other hand....I'd avoid that at all costs. Will most definately stay again during baseball season. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Stay,"I booked MotorCity through Hotwire.  Free valet parking. Easy check in great doorman. Was able to get 4 wrist bands for shuttle to concert.  Room was beautiful, spacious and clean. Very quiet night.  Ate  both dinner and breakfast, pricey.  I have had better. The shuttle was the best.  Picked up right outside of hotel.  Dropped off behind LCA.  After the concert two shuttles waiting.  Dropped us back at hotel.  Definitely the best way to go to LCA. Will do again.  ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Not very impressed,"I was here for my workplace Holiday Party.  The ""Amnesia Room"" was fantastic, the food was amazing, however, the room although it was nice, had a horrible sewer smell in it.  I even went through and put water down all of the drains thinking that it could help, and it didn't.  I was pretty disappointed with paying as much as I did for the room that I had this issue.  ",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very good and attentive staff,Great shuttle service. Nice staff and nice rooms. Lots of choice in food.  Parking is free.  Convienient shuttle to arena. Rooms were large and confortable.  Not noisy during the night.   We really appreciated the attentiveness of the staff since my friend became ill during our stay,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice stay in Detroit,"I was also very disappointed that the hotel did not offer any shuttle service for the figure skating championships, even though some hotel staff indicated it would be available.  A number of guests inquired about having the shuttle at least on a few nights and the hotel made no accommodation.  However the rooms were very nice, the bathrooms were large and well designed and the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel also had a variety of eating options at different price levels which was convenient, and the food was very good.   Anthony at the bellman's desk really is a great ambassador for the hotel.  He made a huge difference in my overall experience at the hotel.  He went above and beyond to help make sure we had a good stay.  He's truly a star.   If I were…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Would stay again,"In general, this is a great place to stay. Good food, great front desk staff. My only two complaints were housekeeping didn't bother to check the room and replenish supplies (towels, coffee) on 3 of 6 days. Also, this hotel states that they have courtesy van service to major events in the surrounding area; however, even though we had a 6-day event at the arena (and many people staying at this hotel for this event), they wouldn't shuttle us to the arena because they only do so for hockey and basketball games, and concerts. We took a cab or Uber several times a day. Cabs don't run the meter. They charge whatever they want, which most of the time was a complete rip off. Uber in Detroit wasn't any better since they only pick up at certain locations around the arena and it was below…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Smoky in areas.  Just so you know.  Otherwise very clean with friendly professional staff,We went into this experience pretty excited.  We would not normally choose to stay at a casino but we thought the extra cost of the hotel combined with the casino would provide a unique experience for our family.  We were here for an event at Little Caesars Arena.  We got checked in stopped by our room to drop things off then headed down to explore the hotel and adjoined casino/promenade.  There was a whiff of smoke smell in the lobby but we did not think much of it.  We were pretty shocked when we got to the promenade and it reeked of smoke.  We had not done our research.  Smoking is allowed in casinos still.  The casino is open to the rest of the spaces and air freely flows out of the casino into the other spaces including all the restaurants here (except Iridescence on 16th…,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Not bad not good,"The stay at this hotel was very disappointing.  The 1st room we checked into was filthy.  There was hair on the table, dirty refrigerator, food on the corners of the bed frame and on the floor.  We were moved to another room and it was a little better, but had a smell that eventually faded after we opened the door to let some fresh air in.  We went to work out the next morning and 2 of the machines were not working and we found out that we could not take advantage of  the spa, due to some type of plumbing issue.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,A nice night out,We visited in November 2018 for a concert. The room was clean and spacious with a great view.  I enjoyed the art deco theme of the decor throughout the property.  Common areas were clean and well-maintained. Lots of dining options but I found them to be over-priced for the most part. Would consider staying here again.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Visitor,I found everything fine and enjoyable. I was celebrating my birthday and my family and friends enjoyed the food at the boufait and the entertainment. We also visited the casino and everyone has a wonderful time playing the slots,1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Free Room Stay!!!,Bad New's!!! Was given a Room for the Handi ap when I need a Room with a Tub in it!! The Staff wouldn't accommodate me and I 'am Pissed!!! I'am also a V.I.P. Poker Player in the Poker Room. What a Joke!!! You have to play 300 hrs of Poker in 3 months to become a V.I.P.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great place to holds a meeting,"I had a to arrange a meeting for 15 people coming from west and east coasts with overnight stays. The staff was wonderful to work with. The attendees were able to reserve their rooms rooms through a link provided by the hotel. They also helped arrange transportation to the Hockey game the night before the meeting. The rooms were great, the food service was perfect. The staff made everything work and I received all the complements from the guests. No reason to go anywhere else for a meeting in Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Time to step up your game.,"The positives: Fast checkin, free parking, clean lobby, somewhat friendly staff. The negatives: Carpet in my hotel room was disgusting, no outlets by nightstands, alarm clock in room not working, bed was filthy “see pictures”. Sleeping pillows were dirty.   Was in Detroit for business and stayed for one night. Casino floor was busy but plenty of games available. Plenty of security staff around. Room quality and cleanliness was a huge let down.",2

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great for a quick weekend in Detroit,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a Def Leppard concert in July. It's beautiful inside and super clean. The room was huge and very cozy. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel and the food was pretty good as well. After the concert, we came back and hung out in the Casino for a few hours and I ended up getting a slice of pizza that was bigger than my head! I would come here in the future for any quick stays or if I attend another concert nearby.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Guests evicted from next door; no sleep all night, will not be returning","Unfortunately, despite an overall positive experience from the hotel overall, from 1am to 5am we were bothered by loud noises from the guests in rooms surrounding ours. There were doors banging, guests screaming at eachother, pounding on the walls, screaming in the hallways ""Casandra, where are my cigarettes!!"" (Outside our door as if the voice was in our room). Multiple door knocking - ""I lost my key in the hallway, Let me in!!"" We called guest services at 1am and again at 4am. The guests were eventually evicted around 5am. We were hoping for an ""oasis away from home"". We were on vacation for my birthday and away from our 4 small boys (ages 3-10) The point of getting away to a hotel is catching up on sleep. Sadly that was not the case. Although the manager was exceptionally…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Night out,"Overnight stay, dinner at Iredensce this restaurant is ran well my compliments to the manager; the wait staff also served us very well and welcoming. Our waiter was a seasoned veteran been there from the start and he is just fabulous! The food was perfect every dish from start to finish, thank you all for a fantastic dinner experience! The hotel room was a major disappointment, the carpet was filthy, stained and just plain gross, this room 821 is in need of a refresh right away, very very disappointing. We enjoyed the live entertainment in the casino.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Don't believe the haters,"One of the best hotels i have stayed in, and i have stayed in many.  The Buffet food was outstanding, and i grade on a curve meaning based on the best food i have ever tasted in Michigan (The Jamaican Pot restaurant) and how close it comes to that restaurant.   The room we stayed in was clean and large and the bed very comfortable.  The staff treats you like family members and even remember you after one meeting.  The entertainment is top notch.  Bottom line, you won't be disappointed!",1

My only choice when staying in Detroit !! ,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Courteous and helpful staff,"I had an issue with my room and it was addressed quickly. The staff was accommodating and friendly. We also got great service and attention while grabbing a late night snack at the 24 hour diner. The suite and/or deluxe rooms are nice, the other rooms are  just okay and fall in the ""value"" category, I make that comment to help travelers manage their expectations. The shuttle service is a great amenity. ",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Giant Rooms,"This hotel had the largest rooms, bathrooms, sleeping areas, and showers of any hotel I have seen before. I booked a standard king room, but I felt as though I had room for an entire family. The free breakfast and gym are two excellent amenities, and the hotel portion is very secluded from the casino (no cigarette smoke smell in the hotel at all).",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,My little get away ,"I had a suite and enjoyed it. Very spacious, it was big enough to have guest up and still have your own privacy. Please take advantage of the tub, a great way to relax. Only think missing is a stove lol",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great place for a sports weekend.,My son booked us in for a week long sports vacation and the hotel and amenities were first class! I would definitely stay here again! Close to Detroit sports teams and their venues via free shuttle from the hotel....there and back.,5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Well recommended!,"I stayed here for 6 days with a friend who is visually impaired and was suitably impressed with the efficiency,courtesy and friendliness of the staff.The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable and after a long (2) flights from the UK that was most welcome.I must admit before I came to Detroit I had the impression it was a dirty,polluted city and the people could not be bothered with tourists but I was clearly mistaken on both counts! Even th e weather was not as cold as I expected! The people of Detroit really made us welcome and I left with fond memories.If you are looking to stay in Detroit I would seriously consider the Motorcity.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Fabulous place,I stayed the night. The room was beautiful and quiet. The bed was so comfy. There was a free shuttle to Little Caesars Arena too. Free slippers 😃  the bath products are nice too. Be careful that you don’t hit your leg on the end of the bed though 😩,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,My stay was worth the grade of an A+!,"In October I stayed at the hotel for a few days. Everyone from the guest check in desk down to the casino hosts were all wonderfully kind. I booked a deluxe king room which had all the amenities needed for my vacation. Initially I had a small problem with my room which was immediately taken care of by the director of rooms-Fred Isaacs. Mr.Isaacs was beyond,friendly and understanding. He graciously upgraded my room. I would definitely recommend staying here! My next visit is already booked.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Disappointing and terrible service.,"After calling ahead to ensure there wouldn't be a problem, the hotel refused to use the business card on file for the reservation. I sat 8n the lobby for 3 hours waiting for a resolution. I wasn't offered an apology or any form of recompense.The room reeked of smoke despite beimg billed as 'nonsmoking.'  After paying $6 for room service coffee that came without cream, I called back to ask for some. They sent up a handful of powdered fake creamer, and refused to provide actual cream. The decor is cheesy, the staff does not seem to care about their jobs, and the whole experience was disappointing. Would not recommend for any reason.",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Fun for a night out,"My husband and I went here for a night out. Room was nice for the price, and Iridesence was a very nice restaurant. I enjoyed everything except the smoky casino. It is hard to believe smoking is allowed.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,EXCELLENT!!!,"Excellent, clean and very courteous staffs.  Excellent view of the Detroit riverside.  We booked 2 rooms and upon registering were told that we have been upgraded to VIP customer.  This means that we had access to free breakfast and free cocktail and hors-doeuvres.  The food was pretty good.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Hot Slots and great buffet!,I enjoyed a day visit to MotorCity Casino and the grand buffet after several hours of gaming! It had machines of all types and plenty of table play too. I know its been around for many years but seems to be going strong. Great band playing in the casino/bar area made me wanna dance. I liked the availability of cash/bill breaking machines and Cashier windows as well as restrooms.  The buffet was so great! Such a wide selection. Be sure to leave room for dessert!!!,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice hotel with convenient location for arena,"We chose this hotel for it's close proximity to the hockey arena. We had a very good stay. Check-in was quick and easy. We had valet service included in our room charge and this was very fast with good service.   Our room was impressive. Large room with a very large washroom - sink, large jet tub, shower, and separate small room for the toilet. The toiletries from their spa were very nice. There were bathrobes and plenty of towels. Since our room was very close to the elevator it was a bit loud but we still had a good sleep.   The hotel has a free shuttle service that runs to/from the arena. This was a bonus on a cold night.   The only poor/average part of our stay was the restaurants. We ate at dinner at one (The Lodge diner) and had a late night coffee and cake from another…",4

Parking was easy and check in was smooth with great staff.   Our deluxe king corner suite was amazing. Large, luxurious and the bathroom was decadent with Jacuzzi tub, separate shower and water closet.   Amenities in the hotel were great, proximity to the casino and downtown were a plus.   Will stay here again for sure. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Exceeded Expectations,"We stayed here because we were going to a concert at Little Caesars Arena and the hotel provides free parking and free shuttle service to many of the popular venues downtown.  Everything about our stay was terrific.  We ate dinner at the Diner in the hotel, walked through the casino which was large and very well laid out, and loved our room.  The bathroom was huge and the room itself left us wishing we had had more time to just enjoy the great space.  We will definitely stay here again if we have a need to be in the Detroit area.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Amazing stay!,"From the minute we got here I was super impressed. The hotel is very cool looing from the outside, and our room was ready when we got there early at 1pm. We were also told they give a complimentary shuttle to and from all sports games. GREAT! They have a whole food court attached to the hotel with some places to grab a quick bite or sit down for some food. They have restaurants on the top floor but we did not go up to them. Our room was on the 10th floor and the room was really big! Huge windows with a view of downtown and big bathroom. We got room service a couple times and it was fast. Casino was nice. There was one bartender who was super rude to a customer. So much so that we actually moved from the bar and never went back to him. It is about a 15 minute ride to the Motown…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Motorcity Casino rocks,My wife and I just got married and had booked a room for two nights and let me tell you that Motorcity definitely knows how to take care of you!

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Update from No Reply review June 15, 2018","I had posted a poor rating on June 15th 2018 regarding my attempts to contact the customer service online. I had some questions I was hoping to get answered before booking a room for my wife and her best friend that were celebrating a belated birthday.  I never did receive a reply about my request, but did receive a response from the Hotel Management a few day later in my No Reply review here on tripadvisor. Because of the venue they were going to attend was closest to the Motor City instead of the other two casinos in Downtown Detroit. My wife convinced me to book the room at Motor City, against my better judgement I booked the room.  A few days before they arrived, I did contact the Hotel and spoke with one of there employees. She was very helpful in answering my questions and…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Excellent view from room.,We stayed in a room with a view of the bridge to Canada. It was great! room was clean and modern. The Assembly Line Buffet was a better than average buffet with a lot of choices. We plan to make another 2 day R&R trip and will stay here again.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Executive King not what expected,"We had a girlfriends weekend for a Maroon 5 concert at LCA and booked a room at Motor City Casino.  I got the Executive King suite 1/2 off through an online deal.  First let me say, the hotel is very nice considering it's in an area still being revitalized. We felt very safe during our stay and being able to park in a secure parking garage was also a plus.  The hotel  is very clean and modern with lots of food options.  Our room was also very clean an updated however it was way smaller than expected! I had booked the room because I had requested a room that would sleep 4. There was 1 king bed, that was it! No sofa sleeper.  Luckily a friend had an air mattress just in case we needed it. Also, we were on an executive floor which required key access. With the executive stay, you…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Weekend fun,Great venue for weekend adventure. Rooms are excellent in quality. Interactions with staff were good. Food at restaurants was all good. Casino smoky; but there are limited non smoking area to gamble. Free shuttle to events at arenas.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Motor City excellence!,"The staff and hotel was excellent!  We were there for just an overnight to attend a Gala in the Sound Board room.  Everything from valet, to bell hop, to check in, to the room was wonderful!  We are not casino people but I did walk thru and again was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of that area.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in and around the Detroit area!!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Our new Detroit ""go to""","When we travel for concerts or other events, my criteria for choosing where to stay is based on proximity to the venue, late night dining options for after the show, and options for other things to do if we have time.  MotorCity checked all the boxes in spades!  It's very easy to access the property from the interstate and it's well marked to figure out where to go for hotel vs. casino.  I liked having the valet option inside the parking garage - I'm sure it's especially welcomed during inclement weather or winter!  Check-in was friendly and efficient and our room was spacious and well-maintained.  My only nitpicks (and these are minor!) are I would have liked to have a 2nd trash can by the desk and plastic cups for bathroom use.  The only options I saw were wine glasses or…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,5 star everything!,"This hotel is first class in every way.  We don’t have a Ritz or a Four Seasons in Detroit (yet).  If you are looking for that kind of hotel, I would stay here.  The Iridescence restaurant has a great view, great food, and great service.  There a lot of gamblers that come to the casino that takes away from the elegance.  If you are looking for a 5 star hotel, this place is great.  It isn’t as close to downtown as everything else but other than that, it is perfect.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very close to Little Caesar's Arena,We chose this hotel due to it's close proximity to Little Caesar's Arena. It's likely a short walk but the hotel offers a free shuttle running every 15 minutes before and after a Red Wings game. I also enjoyed the free valet parking the hotel offers which was quick and courteous. The hotel was quite comfortable and staff are exceptionally friendly. We are likely to return.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,We stay here every time,"I love this hotel so much. The staff are always kind and accommodating. This is my favorite hotel to stay at when traveling to Detroit for a concert or sporting event. I fully take advantage of their shuttle to and from the events. I love there that are many food options as well. The rooms are spacious, modern, and clean. The beds and pillow are super comfortable. The bathroom is huge with separate tub and walk in shower. The views of Detroit and the bridge to Canada are also great. 10/10 ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Excellent every time!,"My husband and I have had an excellent experience every time we have stayed here at Motor City.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,A Wonderful Stay!!,This hotel is an absolute star!  It all started with the welcoming staff and the ease of our reservation. The enire Motorcity family was always helpful/welcoming and professional. Our room was beautiful!!!  Decor and style was fresh and updated and the room was very clean. The bed was comfy and the blackout curtains allowed us to sleep in until 10AM!!  The luxurious shower and bath was a very nice added amenity and the scent of the toiletries are very desirable. If you are in Detroit for any length of time you should stay here!  We also had dinner and it was amazing!  Cheers to you Motorcity-we will be back very SOON!!!!,5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Girls trip ,"First of all the customer service was impeccable, everyone was very friendly. I took points away because the room just didn't seem clean, there was a large red spot on the floor and the sherts were wrinkled,  they looked a bit worn out actually. It was a nice room and I hate to take away but cleanliness is a must. Also our room was never cleaned even though we were gone all day, we did get a generous amount returned when we complained at checkout. Again, I can't stress enough how friendly and accommodating the staff is at the hotel and casino. ",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,High Recommend MotorCity,My husband and arrived at MotorCity for the first night of our honeymoon vacation. The hotel employees went above and beyond with courtesy. The spa service was relaxing and impressive! The casino was entertaining! 10/10! We would highly recommend!,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Housekeeping Issues ,I left my make up room light on at 8:30 a.m. I returned to my room at 5:15 p.m. and my room hadn’t been serviced. I called downstairs and the GSA asked me if I was sure I didn’t have on the DND light. Her response was we will let management know. I don’t know if that means they will clean the room or not. After being out all day I wanted to return to a clean room and relax. A manager came up and was apologetic. It was just annoying returning to an unkept room but they are going to service my room.,1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,The Wedding Trip,The hotel was really nice and clean and the staff was great. Free valet parking was so good and the staff always had a smile on there face.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice stay beautiful accommodations ,"I stayed here 3 days for business!   Great room with nice views of the city.  The bathroom with both a tub and shower was very spa like.  The roof top restaurant has wonderful views of the city although a little expensive for a single traveler. Having said that, the salmon entree was definitely memorable, best suited for a special occasion!  Room service was very prompt with large portions.  I’m not a gambler but thought I’d spend a little time in the casino. I left soon upon entering because of a strong cigarette smell even in the non smoking side. Detroit in general was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed my 3 days there with plenty to do and see. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Perfection!,"Perfection! Even if you  lose or not a  gambler. The spa is great.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Best hotel I've stayed at in a long time!,"We stayed for 2 nights while in town for the Bruno Mars concert. (It was uh-mazing by the way!) EVERYTHING about this place has already caused us to plan another trip back.  It was so easy to find first of all. It is a huge complex, but signs are everywhere telling you where to go. We pulled right up into the FREE valet and ventured in. The front desk had our reservation down as a King room with 2 of us ladies. I asked if there was a room with double beds available. There was and he switched us to it, but it wasn't ready yet (we were early). We went to check out the property - that kept us busy until our room was ready.  The room was spectacular! Very clean and welcoming. The bathroom was great. Clean, clean, clean! We LOVED it! Heard zero noise from the hallways or neighboring…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very good hotel ,"I stayed here for 2 nights. It’s easy to find, although it’s a bit isolated in terms of other buildings around and being about a mile from the main part of downtown. It’s an easy walk of less than 15 minutes but it’s far from picturesque.   Parking at the hotel is free and plentiful. Check in was easy. The security staff who check your room key before you arrive at the elevators were always cheerful, as were many of the staff in the hotel and casino.   The room I had (710) looked out towards downtown. It was a nice big room, comfortable bed, seats and good hanging space. The bathroom is excellent. Separate cubicle for toilet, big walk-in shower, bath tub and a huge area around the sink for your toiletries etc.   One final thing - the elevators. Whoever programmed these is a…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Bathrooms to live for,"This is one of the better hotels I ever stayed at. I would mark as a negative that there is lots of smoke wafting from the casino part all the way through the fist floor, and I stayed there both in 2013 and 2018 - nothing changed, and I believe they need to control that. Also, the landscape around the hotel reminds of the war zone, with boarded properties and outright ruins - this is something hotel cannot control of course, but the City of Detroit is slowly coming about, filling in these blighted areas with something sensible. At this point there is nothing really within walking distance from hotel - you have to drive or take shuttle. Although on the positive side - parking's free! But the bathrooms in this hotel - I haven't seen anything similar anywhere so far (no, I never…",4

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great place to stay for a wedding at Garden Theatre,They provide shuttle service to and from the venue. The room is very spacious and nice. And everyone seemed to have a great time at the casino.  I would suggest daily parking because it only cost you a tip,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Pleasure,"We stayed at the MGM two years ago and it’s still the same. I just like this place. The rooms are good size and so are the shower/ toilet area. Cleaning is good as well. The room has a pad coffee machine and a mini bar. If you like casinos this is a good choice. There are many good restaurants in the MGM, one to recommend is Wolfgang Puck.  I would stay here again if I come to Detroit.  ",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Disappointing,"My husband and I have very busy schedules and not much time for relaxation these days, so I booked a two-night stay at Motor City several months in advance after seeing from our calendar that this would be a good time for us.  We had stayed there before and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, even though there were a few room issues, such as a bathroom door that wouldn't fully close, nothing major.  We figured it was just a chance fluke, since during previous stays the rooms had been excellent.  We booked a Deluxe Corner King for this stay and were really looking forward to it.  I was trying to book directly with the hotel but kept getting re-routed to a third-party site for some reason, so that's how I made the reservation.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Could Have Been Better,"A very nice hotel in the seventies or maybe the eighties. But has been offered nowadays far surpasses what you get at this once a grand hotel.   The hotel offers huge well equipped rooms but that is where the buck stops. Dirty stained carpet everywhere. Ceramic and tiled floors inside the room never got cleaned during our 8 night stay or even from before our arrival.   Bathroom toiletries don’t get replenished unless you complain at the front desk, which by the way is staffed by wonderful people.  The free Wifi service leaves so much to be desired. It dies out almost every few minutes regardless of time. Be it morning, evening or after midnight.

Location is terrible,  there is nothing walking distance and restaurants are not really good at the hotel, so even to buy a bottle of water or eat something you need transportation from the hotel to downtown.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Go, stay, eat and drink","Excellent service.  Staff work visibly hard to keep up with customer needs.  Great place for good clean fun.  Excellent food in the Lodge and always some good music at the Chromium Bar.  Slots were not giving me love, but I keep going back.  Valet Parking is so appreciated.",5

Everyone was great, thoughtful customer service. Casino was busy later, and we really liked the pillow menu👍 See you again soon. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Restful away,My overnight experience was great.  Everything in the room was very clean.  A little spray of something aromatice softly scented I feel should be sprayed in the cleaned rooms.  It was not odorous but it needs something that is inviting to the senses.  The desk clerk  was very gracious when I asked could I have a room facing the river after I registered.  All the staff was helpful and polite.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Wonderful large rooms ,"The rooms in this hotel are very large.  The beds are comfortable and the rooms are well appointed.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice but...,"Our room was clean as usual, but think they need to invest in new mattresses and pillows. Our friends were with us and they had a hard time sleeping too. Mattress was bumpy and their pillows were terrible! Nice hotel. Love the lobby, but please get new mattresses!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Really impressed!,"Stayed overnight on Aug.16th. My husband and I came to Detroit from Cleveland to see Jeff Lynne's ELO show at Little Caesar's arena. We specifically chose Motor City because they had a shuttle to and from the arena.  We stayed in room 430. We were really impressed. Nice big room. Very clean and with all the amenities. Big screen tv with plenty of channels, including HBO. Huge bathroom with a separate tub and shower. Even had a door for the toilet. 2 robes and slippers were in the room for use. Nice! Air conditioner nice and cold.  Every staff member we encountered were friendly and accommodating. Every housekeeping employee we walked by gave a friendly hello or asked how we were. The security checking for room keys did the same. Great bartender at the bar station. Friendly staff…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very pleasant stay!,I enjoyed my stay. Rooms are nice and spacious. Club metro offered the room for $99 making it very affordable. Check-in was fast and convenient as well as checking out! Dtour spa is an amazing experience but their services are a bit on the pricey side.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Attending a concert ,"Everything about the hotel was above expectations!! The staff was great, the location, safety, and cleanliness!! Would DEFINITELY stay again!! Didnt get a chance to go into casino but the hotel itself was well worth the money!!! ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,The best service ever,The staff was amazing and accommodating. I had an event here and i was so impressed with how helpful and available everyone was. Literally they made my night perfect . Charlotte the banquet manager was awesome. She rolled up her sleeves and had a great relationship with her staff. My room was amazing with a great view . I literally recommend using their event space and hotel rooms. 10/10,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Weekend Getway,"the room was okay, but I did not get my $10.00 free play, I was not able to make my reservation on line. So I call the hotel and the customer service rep made my reservation for me, but she did not inform me that I would not be eligible to get my free play because it was not on line.  Not until I question someone about it, I had a problem with the website at that time.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,RN,My room was very nice and clean. Reservationist was friendly and very accomadable. The Manager was very nice and professional and saw to me having a comfortable stay.The view was outstanding over seeing city of Detroit. There are various food  Restaurants. THE food was delicious and you don't have to wait in a long line to get your food or to be serve.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great food, fun casino","We stayed in a room with a king size bed overlooking the city. The room was beautiful and clean, and the bed was so comfortable! The bathroom was amazing and the bathtub was enormous- big enough for two people to sit in, have tons of room, and be immersed up to our shoulders. I have literally never taken a better more relaxin bath. The buffet was amazing with a huge selection and reasonably priced. Room service menu/customer service was amazing. Customer service overall was fantastic. And the casino was fun and entertaining for hours! A lovely stay, I will definitely be returning to Motor City!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Property with Tons To Do,"I really enjoy travel and I hate people that get on here that nit pick every little thing so I will give you the objective truth. This is really a nice property. We pulled into the garage and the valet attendants were courteous, helped us with bags, everything as expected, smooth check-in. The rooms are plush and spacious. I love the fact it had a wine fridge. The negatives were we only had 2 wash cloths. I know that sounds petty but there were like 8 towels in there but I used up both wash cloths and my husband looked at me like...well you can finish the rest. They provided this thin waffle robe so I said I'll take a bath and put the robe on and this robe hit me around my elbows and barely closed.  I showed my husband and we had a good laugh. Other hotel and cruise robes fit me…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great night.,Great hotel. Won a little and had fun doing it. Great staff good food. Fast bar tenders and quick wait staff. I always enjoy myself when I stay at the casino. I earn alot of comps and always get bonus play. They also give away great gifts from time to time and free rooms!,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Terrible.,We had a terrible stay here. These were our issues (in no particular order):  1. Our room was not ready on arrival. It was finally ready at 5pm.  2. My husband and I booked a room that had two double beds. When we booked (via Delta) it said that rollaway beds are available on request. We needed a third bed because we have a 14 year old son and a 16 year old daughter. As you can imagine they will NOT sleep in the same bed. Upon arrival at the hotel we were told that a rollaway bed was not possible as it is a fire hazard! Instead they offered us extra bedding! We had to use these so that my son could sleep on the ground. This is unacceptable. When booking online we had to enter our children’s ages. I can’t understand how it is that a room with only two double beds can be booked…,1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,I Love This Place,We were in town for our family reunion & my brother booked here. The room was really nice and elegant but there were stains in the carpet. The live band that was performing in the Casino was amazing. They had us dancing and singing all night. I had a blast and was not ready for them to end the show. So much entertainment & the food was delicious! You will not be disappointed!!! ,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Business Trip Hotel,"Traveling to Detroit weekly on business and staying in most of the downtown hotels. MotorCity is a little ways outside the main ""downtown"" hub, but newness and elegance of the rooms are worth it to me. Great food options and a friendly staff. I plan to be a regular. No worries at all about smoke  from the casino, never noticed it once in the lobby, rooms or restaurants. If you need a pretty city view, Detroit is probably not the right place anyway. My rooms all had typical city views. Some tall building, some freeways, and no, its not Paris or Rome, it's Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Not Worth The Money,"Extremely disappointed in my stay here. I booked a room with “city views” but was given a few of a ramp / parking lot. Normally, I’m quiet but I decided to ask for what I booked since it was $200 for one night on a Monday. The staff was nice when I asked. I was still seeing a parking lot but just a bit higher (moved from floor 3 to 8). The windows were filthy & the view I had I couldn’t enjoy because it was so dirty. The chair in my room was dirty (purple stain marks on it), there was a red stain on the floor, one lamp was burnt out, the light switch in my bathroom would get stuck on & when I got there the toilet was clogged with toilet paper. For being highly rated, I was surprised.",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,The perfect casino hotel! ,"The rooms was clean and had many upgrades!  A HUGE bathroom with deep tub and a separate walk-in tile shower. The bathroom also has a makeup mirror that lights up.  The entertainment center has a safe, small drink bar area with a refrigerator and includes Starbucks coffee. The television is a great size too. The bed is comfy and has a variety of pillows. The window overlooking the Detroit skyline is floor to ceiling and is impressive. You can see the old Tiger stadium field at night all lit up!  The staff is friendly and accommodating. Bell service and valet makes it so easy for moving in and out. There are a number of options for food including room service, too!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Ms.Brooks,I always have a great time when I visit or stay. Very friendly knowledgeable staff and the Lodge Diner in the food court has the biggest serving of nachos and the best waffle I've ever had. Everything about the hotel is awesome but they need to do better on having all the slots and money machines in working condition.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Everything was awesome except the WiFi,"The room was great, staff was extremely helpful and nice and everything in the conference was awesome. The only thing I will say is the WiFi service in my room was terrible unless I was right by the door or using the bathroom.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Cozy full function hotel,"I had stayed one night at the hotel.  The room is very modern and fashion. Offered water, free Seattle coffee sash. Very spacious and clean.  The bed is amazingly comfortable. I booked a king size bed for myself during my business trip. I had a wonderful sleep at the MotorCity Casino.  The front desk staffs were nice and helpful. At one time before my leave from the hotel; I lost my mobile phone. I was serious panic due to all of my travel plan information are on my mobile and I traveled alone. Front desk help me to call my numbers and finally I found one nice person picked up my phone and sent to the security centre.   I had really good stay with the Motocity Casino. Will definitely go back again. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Motorcity casino best in Detroit,"Detroit native here and I LOVE MOTORCITY. Casino is large with big variety of slots, tables and large poker area. The best part is THE PAYOUTS. Loosest slots in the city. Hotel is beautiful, luxury at its finest. Motorcity moves Detroit!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Massage at Motor City Casino,I had a wonderful time at detour spa at the Motor City Casino. Roderick was my masseuse he was very nice and did a great job at paying attention to where I needed it the most. I would definitely go back to see Rodger thank you so much for your great service Sir,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,An amazing place in Detroit,"My parents and I visit Detroit for the first time and decided to stay close to downtown so we don't have to drive around. This hotel is the bomb, literally. Watch my pictures to see what I am talking about.  THe room is big and filled with amenities. The beds and their sheets are soft and comfortable; oh, and the pillows are heaven!. The bathroom has high quality toiletries and the towels are so soft you could wear them all day. Also, you can't beat the views of downtown Detroit from the rooms. Also, you have a Spa (I tried it and was such a delight) and a big gym open 24 hrs a day. I would improve some things, though: for example, the breakfast is the most ridiculous breakfast I have ever seen in a 4-stars hotel. It's very limited. The fact that it is a casino created a problem…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Under Construction can't wait till its done!!,"At the time we were there, they were chiseling down the waterfall wall & let me tell you even on the 3rd floor you could feel the vibration. It didn't bother us, I just felt for the staff. They all had to wear earplugs & we yelled to talk to eachother. Lol. You can tell their doing some much needed fixing up. On the 3rd floor it looked to have new carpet, but since that's the first time on that floor I'm not too sure. The rooms are always clean & fresh, kinda surprising since you can walk down the hall on any given night & smell the ""good stuff"". The bathrooms are as big as the room itself, nice soaking tub. They just need to add a microwave to all the rooms.  I brought down my friends who have never been to Motor City & they had a blast. The only thing is I requested a higher…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Beautiful hotel room with gorgeous view,"The hotel,and casino area was very clean. The hotel staff was knowledge and friendly. The hotel room was on the 14th floor facing  Canada,with a gorgeous view. The casino was clean with fresh coffee. The slot attendants were fast and friendly. I'm looking forward to my next visit.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,All the amenities you need,"My wife and I came to Detroit for a special event but most rooms were already booked. We decided to stay at the Motor City Casino and were pleasantly pleased with our choice. The amenities were all you would need to keep you entertained. The hotel has a theater for live concerts with notable entertainers, several restaurants which serve good food at reasonable pricing. The thing about the restaurants is that they gave generous portions of food and a bag for leftovers for later in your room. You can go into the casino if you want because it is separated from all other amenities and I recommend this resort for your traveling pleasure.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Please Do Better,Motor City is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful city but they really need to do better with the cleanness of their rooms. We live in the area and stayed downtown for a week long conference. Once we got checked in and went to the first room it looked like the curtains and carpet had blood splatter on them. We immediately returned to the front desk and was given a second room. The second room was very dingy looking and I really felt uncomfortable sleeping in the bed these rooms really need to be upgraded. So the next day no one cleaned our room at all and on the second day we must have been last on the list because we had completed a whole day at the convention and the room had not been cleaned yet. I understand that this is a casino and gaming is probably more important but you…,2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nothing but poker,If you want action this is the place to go. Always a wait would recomend you call ahead for seating. Only downside is they dont comp for playing poker. Have a nice snack area with pizza and fruits and sandwiches.  ,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great hotel and service,We stayed here for two nights (passing trough and visiting Detroit).   Info to visit Detroit city: there is a bus stop not far from the hotel that takes you straight to the centre of Detroit.  Room: we had a bigger room with a view of Detroit which was nice of course. Large shower and bath. Free Starbucks coffee in the room.  Service: The valet service was free (but a tip is nice offcourse). There is security all over the building (at night they guard the car park as well). There is security at the elevators to go to your room. A lot of security.. but friendly security.  Restaurants/Casino: I loved the different options of restaurants. The food was good. My boyfriend had a very good time getting to know some locals at the poker table.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Couples concert ,I choose this hotel because of the high rating and transportation to the arena . I would rate the cleanliness of the hotel room 3 out 5.  The hotel rooms are a little out dated in my opinion but I can be a little OCD so to some it might be higher . I would recommend this hotel if you want somewhere decent to stay and will be going to a concert and don’t want to fuss with parking . ,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,MotorCity Casino,"The hotel at MotorCity Cadino is one of my favorites. I had a room on the 12th floor and the view of downtown and the bridge to Canada was fantastic. The bar in the hotel lobby has a nice ambiance whether you are alone, with a date, or a group.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Very nice room, decent comps and lots of food choices","The room had everything I needed, hair dryer, iron, plenty of towels, robes, nice bath products, separate toilet room, nice tub and shower stall with good pressure, comfy bed, nice tv, small fridge and coffee maker with individual Starbucks inserts.  Hotel carpet in general is stained and needs more cleaning. For some reason housekeeping thought it was a good idea to block hallway with an open ironing board just an accident waiting to happen.  All staff was friendly.  Slots were stingy. Smoke not too bad in my opinion.   The buffet always has plenty of tasty food as well as many more choices in the food court.  Our room was free as well as our food from comps.  Also had $55 free play for the two days..  One strange thing was an fire alarm test was performed at 5 am or some time…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great place for business and fun.,"Very nice place to hold business meetings,Great food. Very customer friendly in the casino and hotel.We had an all day event and after our meeting we had so much fun,they had free giveaways (t-shirts and keyrings) live band playing. I can't wait to go back.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,No Reply,"This review is not about the Hotel its about the customer service on there website. I was attempting to contact Motor City Casino, to see if they would be able to assist with a question I had regarding a room at their Hotel. My wife and best friend were planing a girls night out to go to a show and celebrate a birthday. They also wanted to go to a Casino to try their luck and spend the night so they didn't have to drive.  They looked at the Three Casino in the Downtown area, and decided on Motor City. I have sent Three request on there website where it states you should leave an email, i received an email reply (Your question was received and has been forwarded to the appropriate department for a prompt reply.)

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Hotel, Nice! Casino- meh...","This was my second time here, stayed on the 13th floor, corner suite which I highly recommend. Beautiful view of the Detroit River, Ambassador Bridge, & downtown.  I believe floor 13 & above are privy to the lounge and restaurant services on the 16th floor- very nice! PS you hv to scan your card inside the elevator to select anything past the 12th floor.  No one told us that so we walked around the 12th floor until we found a very nice staff member to assist. Only issue inside the room was trash had not been removed from the previous guests. The hotel provides a shuttle to Comerica Park for the game which was fantastic. We did walk back after the game so it’s close by however I would not recommend that to me most, especially those not familiar with the area. A cab or Uber will…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice casino,"Motor city is a very nice casino, I just wish it was non-smoking! I still prefer to drive to toledo so I can enjoy the casino without all the smoke. Other than that, the casino is beautiful and has good newer slots. ",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Excellent ,"This hotel is wonderful.  We stayed here for the recent Jays vs Tigers series at Comerica park.  The hotel offers a free shuttle to and from the game and our driver even did a tour of downtown Detroit for us on the way to the game.  The hotel room was beautiful and the free parking was a great added bonus too.  The concierge level had a nice breakfast and an amazing evening reception - a personal thanks to Elizabeth and her partner who worked the reception on Saturday night June 2nd.  Their service was better than amazing.  We stayed in this hotel with our kids (ages 9 and 11), and are planning to make this an annual event.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Good Hotel, Great Service","Stayed here for an overnight after a late birthday dinner in Downtown Detroit. Since we arrived on a Friday afternoon, there was a long line of weekend gamblers lined up to check in. To make the wait easier, one of the managers came out and gave bottles of water to everyone waiting in line. A nice touch of service to welcome you to the hotel!  The good service continued with prompt room service and a well-stocked hors d'oeuvre buffet in the Club Lounge.  We liked the hotel, the room, the views of the city from the 14th floor. We also got a great deal on our room - half the price of the other casinos downtown.    The only negative was the Club Lounge breakfast buffet - great food, but the staff were not able to keep up with the flow of people coming to eat. The lounge being on…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Not the cleanest room,"When it comes to traveling, I am not the pickiest person, I am usually pretty easy going and don't tend to complain.  We showed up early to check in around 1:30pm and of course our room was not ready yet, but that was fine. We headed to the ballgame and came back after the game to check in. Immediately upon entering the room it is tiled and the bathroom is to the right. Decent sized bathroom. Except on the tile there looked to be a spot of dried up blood on the floor just outside of the bathroom. Immediately disgusted. The carpet in the bedroom area was noticeably dirty and the kicker was when I went into bed, the sheets were so worn that the entire corner of the sheet was completely ripped apart. Who puts clean sheets on that are all ripped and full of holes. The pillows were…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Surprising Treat ,"I found this hotel on Hotwire after being screwed over by another hotel in the area! What a steal! The hotel was really nice! The rooms are super clean, bathrooms are big, tubs are big, beds are big and comfy! The rooms are very modern and I was extremely pleased with our wonderful last minute deal😀! The hotel contains a casino (of course), several restaurants (diner has awesome breakfast burrito!!), and rooms have A/C!! I know people think that's usually a given but there are shady hotels in the area so it's good to know this hotel has all working amenities, great customer service with a staff that will actually work with you, and they also have security so you don't have to worry about some drunk jerks trying to get into your room late at night when they're done with the…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great location,Traveled to Detroit for a Convention for FreeMasons the hotel was booked from the year before but the staff treated u as an individual security was tight in the hotel and only keycards were allowed upmtonthe room we got 30 dollars a day rebate that we could’ve ap by in anyone one of the many restaurants in the hotel being from the Bahamas I was concerned about the cold but they had heat lamps in the foyer so there was very littw need for a jacket misplaced my phone and security didn’t rest until it was found wonderful place wonderful staff wonderful experience will be back next year  And as an added bonus with Canada being almost across the road we took advantage of that as well,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Place for a downtown overnight,"Went to a concert and decided to stay at Motor City Casino hotel, and it turned out is was  a great decision. Saved money on free parking and Uber charges (the Hotel has a free shuttle to downtown venues, Cool!!) The bed comfortable and the bathroom was nice with the deep soaking tub and separate shower. Also the Bathroom has a door to the toilet for privacy. I Would have given the hotel an ""Excellent"" rating, but the room was not very clean. Nobody had wiped the counters off after drinks from the party before us. So I was suspicious as to how clean the rest of the room was (carpet, bathroom, bedspread, ect.). Anyhow loved the way it all worked out, and we will be back again.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,MCC hotel,"MotorCity Casino Hotel is a fantastic hotel to stay. It definitely feels like you are out of town even if you are only down the street. The rooms are large, staff was very professional and helpful. The food is excellent and I definitely enjoyed the casino.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,30th Anniversary Trip,"I am kind of bewildered as to what to review.  Spent about $400 between the two of us at the casino and no luck.  I played slots and my husband poker.  Never saw anyone win on slots, I mean not a single sole.  Weird.   Used the complementary shuttle to go to the ballgame and that was great.  This hotel is kind of in the middle of nowhere.  Told them ahead of time that it was our 30th Anniversary and they send up some chocolate covered strawberries.  A very nice touch.   The rooms are dated but okay as far as cleanliness.   One thing that really ticked me off is that when we left our room at 11:00 am or so they asked us if we wanted our room cleaned.  I return to the room 7 hours later and nothings been cleaned or touched.  Very disappointing.  I’m presently sitting in the lobby…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Birthday Pampering,Girls day at the spa for my birthday. Had Jan Atcheson as my massage therapist and she was beyond amazing! I had the Motor City 80 min massage. I get massages other places regularly and this was a far superior experience!,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"""Awesome Stay! ""","I stay at Motor City Hotel / Casino once a month. This Stay was a 2 night Birthday Stay. Their rooms are all wonderful, but for this stay they gave me a suite. It was a wow moment for me. They really know how to treat you on your special day, but then again they always treat me as if it was a special day. No matter where you eat the food is great. There is 2 floors with lots of slots, and gaming tables to choose from. Can't wait to go back next month.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Wonderful stay,"I received a special discount through my employer so not only was this a great deal but they also upgraded us to a jr suite and we got complimentary appetizers and breakfast.  The amenities in the room were top quality. My hisband even commented about how much he liked the soap. The double shower and the super deep tub were amazing. We had a free pass for the spa but forgot our bathing suits but it seemed like we had our own spa in our room anyway. There were chocolates in the room Starbucks coffee and water, robes and slippers.  And room service brought us a cupcake bc I had mentioned it was our anniversary which I thought was a really nice touch. It was such a special stay and we felt so pampered. Cant wait to go back.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Friday night at Motorcity hotel/casino,"I normally stay overnight during the week at least once a month because it's too crowded on the weekend but this time we decided to stay Friday night and I must say I had a wonderful experience from the time I checked in.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great beds! ,Loved our room! The deep soaking tub was marvelous! The casino is so big! Felt like I was in Vegas. The bed was one of the best I've slept in in a hotel! Definitely would stay again! Only downside is getting lost in the casino lol,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Not bad, but not the best either.........","First visit to Detroit, and decided it may be fun to stay at a Casino.  I would have given it 4 stars, but the cigarette smoke was so bad in the Casino, I just couldn't handle it.  All and all, friendly folks there, and clean rooms.  Food was good, too.  Very good band was playing both nights.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Overnight Escape,"Fantastic visit at MotorCity Casino Hotel. We had not been at MotorCity in a few years. We had planned to go to mid-Michigan for a getaway, but the Winter/Spring weather caused us to cancel. When I found that I was able to book a last minute reservation, we jumped at the chance. It was excellent from the moment we arrived. Check in is 4:00, but our room was ready at 1. The room was spotless, and had all the extras that Las Vegas doesn’t even provide!  Starbucks coffee maker in the room, terry robes and slippers provided for each guest, refrigerator in room, comfortable bedding, with tons of pillows. Didn’t Win gambling, but experienced some good moments and excitement. The staff was friendly and professional ...and very efficient! We definitely won’t wait a few years to return. …",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Love this place.,"Had a great stay, staff are the nicest people and room was excellent. I was offered a free room for being a casino club member, the exercise room is nice and they offer spa items. Lots of food options available to you.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Great place to stay, play, eat and be entertained!","Whatever brings you to the D, this is the place to stay. Comfortable beds, rooms with a view! It's got every amenity wanted and needed. Cleanliness is great. Located close to everything downtown Detroit. So many different restaurants to enjoy for any taste. Casino is the one that gives the best comps! I don't think some other casino, even with it's Las Vegas connection can compare to these comps! Point play, reward play, you name it! The dealers are friendly and the slots are generous. Business meeting, entertainment? Whatever draws you here, this hotel is top notch and right where everything is readily available.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Wolverines final four game room 411..Amazing!!,"Arriving at the casino/hotel we had to wait until a little after 4 pm. so we could get into our room.  The room was nice, but having only double beds to sleep on with four gentleman was disappointing.  Lots of security around.  Our room overlooked the parking garage and the sea of people coming and going.  We were watching the Michigan Wolverines basketball game and wow what a game.  Go Blue!!  Have to be age 21 to go into the casino, no one won any money as well.  I will stay here again but a little expensive for a nights stay.  We were able to walk to the Masonic temple for the Judas Priest concert which was only a 10-15 min walk.  Free parking.  Come and enjoy the nice rooms and overall experience of the casino/hotel.  Overall it was a great  Easter weekend!!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Casino,"If you like to have the casino atmosphere at hand and don’t mind the intermittent smell of cigarettes, this one is for you. The service is ok, staff are friendly, and you can get pretty much everything you need right there in the building.   I’m not a fan but you can reserve anything from well appointed standard rooms to absolutely gorgeous suites and they do a great job with very large functions.   There is a rooftop restaurant with outstanding food and service, paired with a beautiful city view at night.   I gave them a three instead of something higher because they are not smoke free. ",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Upon arrival, I was surprised with an upgrade!  After my hectic day it really made me feel special.","The room was absolutely breathtaking!  I felt like I was special - being treated with all the special things.   The complimentary concierge was wonderful - the light dinner featured scallops, pork eggrolls, beef sandwiches, and some really large peel and eat shrimp!  Continental breakfast with hot oatmeal, cold cereal, bagels, donuts, pastry, breads, and platters of fruit. Two coolers of drinks offered multiple varieties.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,2 Night in MotorCity,"We booked a 2 night stay whilst in town to sightsee. This seemed a good location for what we wanted. Arrived late on a Thursday night. Car Park was a little intimidating but there was plenty of security around to put us at ease. Check in was really easy, Emerald was very polite and professional. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite and this came with a complimentary breakfast on both days which was really good and a welcome addition. The room was clean, spacious and well equipped. We ordered room service that night. Decent value and the food was good and came quickly. I used the gym which was ok for a hotel gym, had everything you needed. The is a spa but t seemed a bit overpriced so I didn't use. The second night we ate in the 24 hour restaurant and again, good food at a good…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Was a good time,"We hit all 3 casino in detroit. We didnt have much luck here, but have in the past here. The guards just talked between themselves when we came thru security check point, which i thought was rude. Usually they are nice and friendly. The machines were very tight. People were very crabby.",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,In town for concert ,Free shuttle was great and efficient. Did not have to wait long. Rooms were great and employees were all great BUT the front desk. Need more training. Charged extra on my card. Watch your bank account so you are not ripped off. Will not return as they have no clue what they are doing!!,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Pleasant Surprise,Stayed for location near Little Caesars Arena - was pleased with hotel shuttle which was a main reason for staying at property.  I don't gamble so the casino was not of interest.  But the rooms were great - wonderful bathroom with a huge tub to accommodate my height.  I stayed over the weekend and appreciated the local newspaper outside door (USA Today during the week).  Great workout facilities open 24 hours.  Great bed.  Just a good visit all around.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Our Semi-Annual Retrerat,"Took 17 people to the hotel for a 3 day, 2 night retreat,  Everything was done beyond our expectations.  We used the Hotel shuttle service several times and they were very clean, on time, and the drivers quite friendly.The sales and catering department was very professional as was the catering manager we dealt with.  Would stay there again.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Had a wonderful stay.,Always a clean and comfortable room.  The beds are so comfortable.  Love that you have wine glasses in the room.  Also we received a voucher for a free Dearborn ham as part of the rewards program in the casino which we will enjoy at Easter.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Better than I Expected,"This was the first time that we have stayed at Motor City and we will be back.  The room was very nice, like Vegas nice and the staff was nice!  The buffet was very good and I don't usually like buffets.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Weekend casino trip,You can hit a bunch of different casinos if you drive around Detroit and even go a crossed Windsor. Motor city has the loosest slots and the coolest music. What are cities buffet is really nice and they had a seafood dinner all you can eat. I’m allergic to fish but people seem to like it. I like the dessert bar.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Unforgettable Birthday,"The parking structure was a little confusing when we first came in but after figuring it out, we found it to be very convenient. Check in was easy and our room was spacious and clean; I love rooms with robes and opulent bathroom. We had a mysterious wet spot on the hotel floor however. After waiting about 15 minutes after our reservation time we were seated at a table with a great view. Dinner at Iridescence was delicious and we opted to go to the casino in the morning to avoid the crowd. The security guard checking identification at the entrance to the casino was very rude and condescending which I was taken aback by because we just spent a pretty penny over the weekend. ",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Bad neighbor's,"The room itself was Gr8, but the room next to mine was HORRIBLE..... The music was loud and I had to go tell the security team on 3 different times.. Having to be at work at 5a ; it wasn't a good night for sleeping",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Pistons game ,Proximity of hotel to arena was perfect. The hotel offers a free shuttle to and from arena. Hotel very clean and up to date. Valet parking was very quick and professional. After a night at a BB game it was fun to come back to hotel and gamble a bit. ,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,overpriced the a hotel,We had to switch rooms because the panel on the electric box was off... the sink and tub were not as clean as it should have been with human hair strands in both (and this was WITHOUT my glasses) the beds are comfy. very noisy in hallway and the smell weed all night.. got a good contact buzz though. ;) ,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Amazing casino/hotel/restaurant ,"It was my first time at this casino. I was impressed with the layout on the inside and they have a lot of places on the inside to eat at and also to have a drink at the bar. The restaurant at the top, Iridescence, is on the 16th floor. Great views of the city + great food. The hotel is located right off the freeway and close to Downtown Detroit. I recommend this casino to any local resident or out of towner. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice hotel .... bad housekeeping,"This is nice hotel. Check in was fast and efficient no problem. Nice free parking easy access to hotel. Room was spacious, very nice bathroom large TV and fast internet. Comfy mattress large windows. Fast elevators we didn't have to wait at all. Room was quiet (8th Floor). When we checked in floor was dirty and housekeeping didn't vacuum the floor (even there were visible garbage on the floor). Housekeeping didn't restock tea. Overall impression is good however they need to pay serious attention to housekeeping staff. It's not up to 4.5 star hotel standards...Nice fitness room.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Rooms Good - Forget the Food,High quality spacious rooms. Good and responsive room service and very friendly staff.  Not a great place for doing business and as for food - truly awful mass produced cheap junk. You will need to take a cab to the main downtown area in order to have a good meal.  ,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Our Anniversary Date!,"What a Great way to Celebrate your Love one, the Motor City is our Go to for Concert Eatery when we want a Nice Suite on 15th Fla!

You CAN'T Beet That ENJOY!! We Did!!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Hotel Stay and Red Wings Game,"Room service was excellent!  We didn’t get back to the hotel until after midnight and thought the menu would be very limited. Not true!!  The food was piping hot, portions were huge, and we actually ended up ordering enough food for 4 people, when it was just the two of us. I ordered the club sandwich and Caesar salad. Both were absolutely delicious, hot and fresh. My husband ordered the double burger and fries, and they were just as tasty. As I said, portions were huge!!!  But for the same quality and quantity, we would have paid at least double in Canada for such a wonderful spread. Ordering was easy, and the attendant who brought the food, and the presentation was top notch!!!  Thanks to Motor City Casino Hotel for a superb late night dining experience, along with your…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Dinner, Show and Overnight Stay .... Awesome","I live about a 30-45 minutes from Motor City Casino, but after we bought tix to a show at the Soundboard we decided have dinner before the show at Iridescence and stay the night after the show.    First impression checking into the hotel was excellent.  Front desk service was fast and friendly.  Next our dinner reservations were at Iridescence.  I had many friends that said this restaurant was one of the best in Detroit .... they were right.  Drinks were great, appetizer was great and the dinner was perfect.  Service was top notch.  The room we stayed in was in the 13th floor as far away from the elevator as possible (as requested).  It was clean and well decorated .... nothing out-dated.  We are looking forward to staying here again in the future.  Great job by the Motor City…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Good!  Very Friendly People,"NO RESORT FEES!  (really none)   We were in town for a quick getaway weekend and caught a Red Wings game too. Last time we stayed at MGM and had issues with shuttles.  Motor City had shuttles going every 20 minutes efficiently.   Had to deal with rude Chicago fans, but that's pretty standard.    Jacuzzi bath was awesome and the large thick bath towels were fabulous as well as the cozy bathrobes.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Not Perfect, But Pleasantly Surprised","We were in town for a Red Wings game on a Thursday night.  Arriving there was uneventful, very easy on/off the M-10 and no congestion.  Casino Valet and Valet Parking was a bit confusing but we easily figured it out and the valets  were very professional.   Front desk and concierge were very kind and very helpful.  Last time we were in Detroit we stayed at MGM and had issues with just getting a ride to the arena.  Motor City had shuttles going every 20 minutes or so and we easily arrive at the arena this time.  Getting home took a bit longer because you have a people jam at the pick up corner and you always get the rude drunks that are pushing and shoving.  The second round of shuttles were quick to arrive and we were back within 45 minutes.    Our room was super nice and very…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Surprise,"I had some concerns About staying in downtown Detroit but the trip and stay was surprisingly safe, comfortable, and enjoyable. The hotel is part of the casino and the self park was free and easy to get to. The bell staff was very friendly and helpful. The front desk people were the same...very friendly and helpful, and patient with all my questions and worries. The hotel has great security though you don’t readily notice them. They blend in by design. Our room was very clean, very comfortable and spacious. The room has two armorois for closets, very classy. We had an overview of the Detroit skyline from the west.  The hotel offered a free shuttle service to the Little Caesar’s Arena which was very prompt as advertised. We gambled a little, ate at the bistro which also was good.…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Feedback for Housekeeping ,"Housekeeping had numerous of infractions. Brown stains were found on pillow case, mattress cover had hair on it (very long hair), refrigerator had fingerprints on it and I didn't use. Beverage area was very dusty. The housekeeping was a bit unacceptable to be considering this is a outstanding Casino Hotel. I'm a HK Supervisor myself so I know what things should look like and I was a bit unhappy. Hotel guest services were amazing! Front desk answered all my questions very well. When I had an issue with my hot water not working they sent someone up and it began to work. The valet services were great as well! Will I stay again? Yes, when Housekeeping improve because their rooms are too nice for any infractions. ",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Wonderful,"My wife and I celebrated her birthday here on a overnight stay. The food was awesome the band was great and the room had a view of the city of Detroit. I treated her to the D spa which included massage, hot tub and eucalyptus sauna. The hotel staff was top notch. They specialize in more than just gambling.",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Friendly staff and clean room,Every person that we came in contact with was so friendly and helpful.  My mom is handicapped and they had plenty of wheelchairs to accommodate her.  The room was very nice and clean.  The have a very deep soaking tub that was wonderful!  :),5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Mixed Feelings about MotorCity Casino & Hotel,"I stayed at the MotorCity Casino and Hotel while in Detroit for the auto show. The front desk and gift shop staff were very friendly. When we checked in, the hallway on the floor of our room had laundry bags and other items waiting to be picked up by cleaning and serving staff. There appeared to be a blue bag of dirty linens right outside our door when we entered. The room itself was comfortable, with a mini fridge, coffee maker, and cozy bed. I really liked the layout of the bathroom, and it was stocked with plenty of towels. Since there is a casino, there was a lot of noise in the hall from guests coming in and out at all hours, which can make it difficult to sleep, so take your ear plugs. We checked out around 7:45 am the next day. The blue bag of dirty linens was still…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Stay,We spent one night here as a little get away. Had a nice time. The room was clean and beautiful as was the rest of the facility. Valet parking was free. Food was delicious. We truly enjoyed our time here.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Awful Beds Cannot be Made Up Well,"Carpet really dirty.  Bed sheets did not fit and bed linens could not be tucked in to make the fit tight.  Bathroom cleanliness slipshod.  Best thing about the hotel was that its elevators are fast.  When you get to the Lobby floor, the smell of cigarette smoke was heavy.  The food court was pretty downscale.  Room service took quite a while.  Probably will not stay here again.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great fun,"Fun and rewards...to go and spend and win is a rewarding feeling. I'm  not saying I won big but to come back even or with a little sometimes makes all the difference to wanting to come again. It's always clean. They do smoke there but the machines are all clean and wiped down, no left over cups or glasses from drinks. Very nice atmosphere. Always open!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Acceptable but not much better ,"Been staying at MotorCity for a few years now during Detroit Auto Show. On the positive side, rooms are nice and bed is comfortable. On the negative side, sound proofing is horrendous, room service food is not good and services provided leave a lot to be desired. This time, coffee maker was leaking, phone was not working and laundry came back not ironed. Not a great experience...",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Party time,My wife and I arrived with two other couples at the valet park. As soon as we were getting out of our cars we were given a tag. We went right inside to get our rooms check in was quick and pleasant. We all had our room keys in minutes and headed upstairs to get ready for the night.        We all met in the lobby bar for a drink. This was the only downside to the hotel the lobby bar is small and their liqueur and beer choices are very limited. ,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Red Wings,We spent a weekend at the hotel to go to the Red Wings and the Lions games.  The hotel was great! Parking was convenient and easy; the hotel staff was very helpful; the rooms were very nice; the restaurants were nice (a lot of food and decently priced); the location was convenient for the games we wanted to see.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Beautiful room in the D,The check in was fast and efficient. Security ensures only guest can go up the elevator which was nice. The room was huge a nice big bed huge windows nice sitting area nice tv. The highlight was the bathroom. Huge tub and shower with robes too wear and all other toiletries you would need. We were attending a pistons game and the hotel offered a free shuttle which was great. It was easy on the way there . On the way back however we were waiting a while. And due to the extreme cold we took a cab back which was my only complaint. The casino was just ok. But it was nice to have places to eat and drink all inside due to the cold weather. Overall a good stay,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Birthday visit ,"Found it on hotels.com for a really good price! The room was very nice, valet parking is complimentary & there was nice entertainment in the casino. Very close to Little Ceasars Arena and all the other great things downtown Detroit has to offfer",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Business Trip,"I found the king suite to be very affordable (in part due to a company discount) and VERY spacious. The room was very clean. It was very nice to have appetizers from 5-7 PM for free. However I can never give a 5 star review at a hotel when the bathroom doesn’t not have an exhaust fan, especially at this price of a hotel. An exhaust fan makes a big difference in ability to style hair and not make the whole place a sauna. The only other complaint is that there were waters, snacks and such in the room with no information available at check in or in the room on whether they were complimentary or would be charged. ",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Excellent Overnight Accommodations ,"I enjoyed my stay at the MotorCity Casino Hotel. The room was excellent and clean. The bed was very comfortable and relaxing. We hadplenty of towels and additional amenities in the room. The view on the 14th floor was breathtaking. I highly recommend staying on a higher level floor. The staff provided great customer service. My next time in the city of Detroit, this is where I will stay.  ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Motor City Casino Hotel,"I stayed at the Motor City Casino Hotel December 5&6, 2017 for business and the hotel has a lot to offer. Even though I did not gamble during my stay I found the views of from the hotel overlooking the city were very good from the 25th floor of the hotel. With a shopping mall and casino inside the confines of the property and plenty of conference rooms and parking available, it made it an excellent place to hold a business meeting.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,beautiful hotel and casino,"This hotel is now the closest to the Little Caesar's arena-I'm sure shuttle is provided but it is even within walking distance.  We attended a concert and were so happy to see they had a 24 hour restaurant.  Staff were great, had ample parking and even valet service",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"My Visit at The MotorCity Casino Hotel was AWESOME, Very clean and Comfortable and the bathroom is to die for. Loved it","MotorCity Casino Hotel was Awesome, Rooms very clean and Comfortable and the bathroom is to die for. Right off the freeway. The food in the food court at Little Caesars was very good.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Overnight Stay,"Beautiful rooms.  Just a quick overnight stay w/gambling.  Hotel beautiful-Casino is very nice, but smoking is allowed  :(  yuk  They offer a non smoking section, but unfortunately it is a small room - kinda disappointing",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Pleasantly surprised!,Booked because we were attending a concert at the new little Caesars arena and thought we could walk but was told at check in that they had a shuttle. Got to the room and it was large an beautiful. Reminded me of my lovely room at the Mandalay in Vegas. Awesome bathroom too. So time to go to the concert thinking I'd still walk or cab as I never depend on the shuttles as they are usually unreliable but nope got on the shuttle with ease and even coming home no problem at all. I loved my whole experience here and I'm booked again for my next concert.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Enjoyable ,MotorCity Casino Hotel is arguably one of the better places to stay in downtown Detroit.  Pros: A modern and comfortable room Prompt and friendly staff A wide variety of restaurants to choose from Excellent location  Solid casino floor with plenty of options Moderately priced   Cons:  The vents in our hotel room were obviously left uncleaned for weeks if not months  Carpets also needed additional attention/cleaning  Lodge Diner was a disappointing dining experience   ,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice Casino and hotel!,"Stayed on the 9th floor for the Thanksgiving Lions game. Room, especially the bathroom, was awesome! Clean and good view. Only issue was the bed frame was bigger than the mattress and I don't know how many times my friend and I hit our shins on the corners.  Did well in the casino at table games. Easy access to game floor. Ate at the diner on property versus the buffet. Still was able to get a Thanksgiving meal at the diner, so that was a nice touch!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,mini sister vacation,"always have a fun time here, everyone is super friendly & I really love the live band every night. Food, drink, music & gambling.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Birthday Celebration,"The front desk clerk Leah was very friendly and accommodating. The hotel room was clean and we loved the extras, the premium shampoo, conditioners and soaps that the hotel provided were a nice touch.Oh yeah! they made my daughters birthday memorable by giving us a pass to the 15th floor for appetizers and breakfast. Thanks!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Get-a-way,"This stay was a world away!!!! MotorCity Casino Hotel is wonderful as the attendants were all beautiful.  The rooms are very nice, spacious and clean.  The view of Detroit was just breath taken. The casino was a great place to visit and I had a great time there as well.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,2 Day Get-A-Way,"We were at Motor City Casino this week. I found the rooms to be very nice and large. The beds were comfy, nice linens and the pillows were nice as well. The bathroom was spacious with a separate room for the toilet. Very nice. It was also quiet. The odd time I heard people out in the hall but that was short lived. I did find this hotel to be laid out weird. There was a lot of walking, ramps to go up and down and escalaters as well. I did not find the casino too smokey as some people had said in their reviews. The restaurants were really good with huge portions of food. So much that my friend and I could not finish our food. Also in other reviews, people had said that some of the staff to be rude. Personally, I did not find this. Everyone I spoke to was most friendly and very…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great hotel & casino,"Loved it, in town for a concert. Check in was smooth & fast. As for check out the line was long but moved pretty fast. Room was clean. Casino was fun. Staff was friendly and helpful. We loved eating at the diner in the hotel. Good value. We would stay again.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Stay,"This is a great hotel. The rooms are large, well furnished, with comfortable beds, and many amenities. Their business facilities are very good. Their staff is friendly, and eager to help. The security at the room elevators make you feel very safe. The room service breakfast was the best I've ever had.  I was only there two nights, and look forward to going back. Detroit is a great city, and this hotel is a great asset to it!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Personal,"I love MotorCity Hotel, the only thing I didn't like was someone in the room next to me was heavy smoking cigarettes. They got fined for 250.00🤤 People need to follow the rules...🚭🚭 The restaurants have delicious food and drinks, live bands, flat screen tv's and the air quality is good. I would definitely refer anyone to visit this hotel",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Rooms Are Nice - Casino is AWFULLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Stayed overnight for the first time to see Jerry Seinfeld in concert at Fox. Booked the room WAY in advance. Requested a high floor - quiet area, nice room.  Got stuck on the 4th floor - RIGHT in FRONT OF THE ELEVATORS - got to enjoy the loud idiots coming and going. The casino is HORRIBLE. That smoke overtakes to from the minute you get inside the building and just permeates you, your hair, your clothes.......you sit there trying to play a machine and all around you the idiots are puffing away - blowing smoke toward you. And the machines NEVER seem to pay off -Blew threw a couple hundred over the night and so did the wife. Crappy slots. The room was nice. Bathroom huge and incredible. Had a crappy view of the parking deck.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice room and bathroom,This was a decent hotel comfortable bad Nice bathroom with tub and shower and separate toilet and closure the Room was well appointed However that carpeting in the hallways was filthy! I wanted to give this a 3 star but the Room quality made up for filthy carpet in the Hall .  ,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very Impressed!!,"My husband and I, as well as other family members stayed here and we were very pleased with our stay! From the classy, clean rooms to the tasty food and beautiful Casino. We would highly recommend it and we will be going back!! Thank you to all the wonderful staff, especially Anthony and Big John, for taking care of us!!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Concert Downtown,"A friend and I stayed here one night while in town for a concert at Little Caesar’s Arena. We were running late, and the parking situation was a little confusing. Apparently we had parked in the casino parking garage. There was a complimentary shuttle to take us to the concert, and when the driver realized we were running late, he was very accommodating and took us to the Arena right away. When we arrived back at the hotel after the concert, we were told there was an issue with our reservation. We had called the day before to let them know we would be arriving late, and were told it would be no problem. They did not have our reserved room with two beds, but offered us a king room with a roll away bed. We requested a deal on a second nights stay for the inconvenience, but were…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,dont know if ill ever stay again,stayed over the weekend for my birthday and my stay was fine but the gentleman that helped us behind the desk was very rude wasn't polite overcharged me for the stay and I had to jump through hoops with my card company just to get my money back. Motorcity was my favorite hotel but because of the customer service I don't think ill ever stay again.,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Got it all,"Stayed here for the Steelers/Lions game. Casino, restaurants, night life. Perfect location. Nice staff. Casino was set up weird. But overall great. Room was large and perfect for us. Will stay here again in future. Only thing that was sketchy was the shuttles to and from game. They drop you off about a mile from Ford field. I recommend a Uber.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Will NEVER stay here again,"I stayed at the this hotel during the Detroit Free Press Marathon.  Upon arrival, I checked the bed and room as I do for any hotel stay.  What I found was disgusting.  Pulled back the top sheets and hair (different lengths and types) were found literally. If that was not disgusting enough, on the side of the bed was a stain that appeared to be an""excitement"" stain to put it nicely or ejaculation to be blunt.  The curtains were badly stained and the hem was not in tact. After notifying management they sent room staff and while they were changing the mattress cover and sheets, a bead and an earring fell onto the floor. I am convinced they have not been changing the sheets. The manager, Kevin, seemed unphased.  Later in the evening, my neighbor was smoking weed and it smelled so…",1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very Nice Stay,"We had a very nice room with a great view of downtown. There was a jacuzzi bath and a very large bathroom with separate toilet area and separate shower. The bed was comfortable and they had Starbucks for room coffee. You want to go directly to the hotel parking lot rather than that for casino: so that means driving around the complex if coming from I75 or downtown. There is no left turn allowed to get to the hotel, so go around to the casino. This is a good place to stay since no resort fees and there is free parking. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Fun hotel and casino!,"We stayed here back in April for my birthday. The location is not great - nothing at all within walking distance, but Uber was cheap enough. The rooms were nice and it was easy to get to the casino. I had no complaints with the hotel itself and would stay here again.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice place,"Stayed for 2 nights for work and it was a good hotel. Room was large, clean and comfortable. I do not gamble so did not experience the casino. I would have liked to go to Iridescence or the Spa but they are both closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and that is when I was there. The signage is not very good to find yourself around but the staff is very friendly and helpful. Free valet parking with super quick service!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Fabulous Hotel! ,"We stayed at this hotel for one night on October 20th, 2017. My husband and I are pretty picky, but as soon as we walked in, we both loved it. Our room was clean, up-to-date and beautifully appointed.  I loved the layout of the room, the spacious washroom, fabulous tub with separate walk-in shower.  Even though the hotel was at 98% capacity, we had a peaceful night's sleep and we were not disturbed.  All of the staff members we interacted with were wonderful, everyone was very friendly and helpful - special mention to Reginald at the elevator station.   I've stated other hotels in Detroit, and this is my favorite by far! We will definitely be back!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,All in one place.,"Had a great time. Food, service, staff and casino were very good. Would certainly go again. Location is a bit out of they way if you want to be in the heart of downtown, but limited shuttle service is available.",1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Fantastic experience ,We were in town for the marathon and this was one of the only hotels we could find. Luckily for us we did. The staff was fantastic from the moment. They upgraded us as well which was very nice but we would have been happy either way. Plenty of food choices too. Not gamblers so I can't comment on the casino. ,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Love the bathrooms,"We stayed the night before the marathon/half marathon in Detroit. We were able to get a very reasonable rate compared to everywhere else I checked in town. This was the 3rd time I stayed here. The parking is a little bit confusing. The GPS tried to take us to the parking for the casino, rather than the hotel. Once you get to the correct ramp, it's very easy. They have a cool light system that lights up green for any open spaces in the row, or red for occupied spots. This makes parking so much easier than driving up and down the long rows.   Check in was easy. The room itself was very nice, and quite spacious. We had a view of the Ambassador Bridge. The bathroom was great. I would love to have a set up like that at home. There is a large tub with a standalone shower. The toilet…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very NIce Stay,We were very happy with our stay in this hotel.  The room was large and the bathrooms very 'spa' like.  2 negative comments: the rugs were stained in spots and the neighbourhood is questionable.  We wanted to take a walk in the evening but there was no where to go.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Surprise Getaway,"For our surprise anniversary getaway,  Motorcity Casino Hotel was selected because it's close proximity to the Little Caesar Arena, great choice! The hotel staff were very pleasant and efficient. The offered a free shuttle service to hockey game was a welcome surprise! The room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was delicious at casino restaurant with prompt service and lots of smiles. Overall experience was great and will be making another reservation when we attend another downtown sporting event.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,First class hotel ,"First class in every way. Service efficient and friendly. Rooms large, well laid out, lovely amenities. Bed particularly comfortable. Everything clean. Four restaurants since it is also a casino. One fine dining, others more mid-level but good. The casino is like all casinos. I wasn't here for that but stayed on a business trip. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Room Review,"The service was very good and the rooms were spacious, but for the price...we were not impressed. The floors in the room were stained, the beds were lumpy and the furniture was stained, ripped and outdated. A few updates would go a long way in making guests feel comfortable & clean. For one night it was doable, but not worth the $$.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Don't leave anything,"The hotel was very nice - you will want to stay in the hotel because the surrounding area is slighty questionable - but expect airport prices for food and drink. I was charged an import beer charge -$6 - for a Blue Moon - which is bottled in Colorado. The biggest problem that the group I was with had - there were 13 of us for a convention group - was that some of us left items in the rooms when we left.  I know that we were the ones that left things, but when we called the hotel and gave specific directions as to where the items were placed that we left, we were told that nothing had been turned by housekeeping.  The items were not exceedingly expensive - in the $20-$40 range, but they were all left in places that housekeeping should have found.  Oh well, I hope they can charge…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Beautiful hotel and great location,"My friend and I stayed just one night because we were in town for a concert at the Fox Theatre but we would have loved to stay longer. The hotel staff were so nice and friendly, our room was beautiful and we had dinner at the buffet that was fantastic. If you are in town for a performance or sporting event, the hotel is just a 5 minute taxi ride to the arena or theatre. Our driver said the area was very safe but I don’t think I’d want to walk back after an event. It’s worth the $7-$10 ride. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,great place to stay,"I have stayed there twice in the past couple of weeks, and was pleased each time.  Rooms were nice, staff was polite and helpful.  Rooms had alemenities you could ask for...robes, slippers, hair dryer, water in room fridge...ice was close by each time.  Beds are extremely comfortable...",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Motor City Rocks!,"I was in town for the Paul McCartney concert. Great hotel, easy to find. Free parking was a breeze, and a nice bonus. At check-in was given a wrist band for free shuttle rides to and from the concert venue! The place was spotless and very attractive. Staff was excellent, super-friendly. The room was great. Not much of a view, but wasn’t here for that. Bed was great, top linens. Towels could have been larger. Spacious, well-appointed room. All in all, a near-perfect hotel experience.  The only improvement would be if the hotel offered airport shuttle service.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Thanks,Thank you for free room promotion. Gave away free LED lanterns   Buffet was good and had a great variety. Discounted buffet with club metro card. So many perks offered. Room was nice and a comfortable sleep. Motor city offers so many more perks if you are a club metro member vs other local casinos. ,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very nice ,"Very nice room. Excellent customer service. Probably time to replace the mattresses in these rooms, they were a little soft and worn.The food we sampled was better than we expected for a casino.Customer service was on point. Good location for a concert at Little Caesars arena as well.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Overnight visit to attend McCartney  Concert ,"This is an exceptional hotel. All the staff are professional, friendly and helpful. The security is exceptional with attendants at the entrance to the hotel elevators. We felt very safe and comfortable , they even provided a free shuttle to and from the concert venue. The room is very large, well furnished and the bed and bathroom were exceptional. Free valet parking was another bonus for a large city. This was ny second visit and will definitely return. The location is ideal...within ten minutes of Little Ceasars arena and the Fox Theatre. Kudos to all the staff for providing a most comfortable and enjoyable stay.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Another good visit,"This is the 8th time this year we have stayed and it is the same every time, very good.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Large Hotel/Resort in Good Location,"Two night stay end of September 2017. Check-in was painless, staff were very welcoming and kind. Room was large, bathroom had both stand up shower and seperate soaker tub. Cleanliness could be improved (soap stains on edge of tub, dust and crumbs on some counter tops and in cupboards. Walls are very thin, able to hear all conversations in hallway and all noises from rooms on either sides.  Lobby and casino layout are a bit confusing at first. Staff were always very helpful and cheerful. Restaurant Iridescence on the 16th floor was amazing! Beautiful room/lounge, view, and food! Staff were amazing as well! All in all a great hotel, great location, and great staff! ",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,The Detroit Motorcity Casino Entertainment,"We visited this cool casino in from Washington DC. We caught an Act by a band called Darron Moore & The 14th Floor.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Fabulous Service & Facility,"Super impressed with the friendly professional staff. Everyone we met from the first day to the last was happy to help, give tips, and even happy hugs. Our room was a king suite, and it was Amazing. The deep soaking tub was fantastic. The towels were super fluffy, even a bathrobe to finish the experience. View was fabulous as well.   Casino was busy on a Monday night. Didn't feel like we were the only ones there which was nice. Roulette tables were highest I have seen with $15 spins. (We are used to $5 mid week).   Buffet was super pricey for a Monday night at $50, but went off property to find dinner. Breakfast on the other hand at the Lodge on property was SO GOOD. Fried pancakes & thick cut bacon for me. (The small order was Plenty!)  Super secure space for Detroit! Great…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Great room, service is amazing","Just spent the weekend in Detroit.  We decided to stay at Motorcity Casino.  This place it great.  The hotel is very clean with very nice rooms.  I stay in lots of hotels and cleanliness is very important to me, and equally important is service!  This place has the best of both worlds.  EVERYONE we spoke to was so nice!  It really is refreshing to see such great service.  Keep up the good work!",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Top Notch place to stay when in Detroit,"The customer service was EXCELLENT!   More places need to take lessons from this place.   Even though there were thousands of guests, our bellman always remembered us!!!! Hotel was clean, food at all of the restaurants was exceptional.   Ate at the rooftop restaurant one night and was able to see fireworks.  Waiter took care of us. Hotel has a shuttle service to the Detroit Tigers stadium.   Highly recommend this hotel when coming to Detroit MI",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice hotel room!!,I really liked the place. The hotel room that we got was very spacious the staff was very nice and the location of the hotel is not far from downtown. On the other hand this might sound a little strange but I just wished that they had a little bit more choices on the food area.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,In town for our anniversary,"We went for our anniversary, room had all we needed and a comfy bed great night sleep an awesome bathroom, great place.to stay and play and eat.  We even did fairly well at the slots, absolutely no complaints.  Would definely recommend.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Great Service, Large Bathrooms, Slightly Dated","This was a lovely hotel, although a bit dated. The bathroom is huge and a three-part retreat so it was my favorite part of the hotel as well as the view from the 15th floor, where they serve a relatively low-scale continental breakfast. The hotel, like the city, has a feeling of being a bit past its heyday but all of the staff were kind and helpful. Anthony the bellman was wonderful. The free valet parking is helpful but with in and out, the tipping of the bellman ended up being almost the cost of parking. The neighborhood around the hotel is definitely not for walking around so be prepared that this is a just for sleep destination.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great staff!!!,"The room was so nice! We were put on the 14th floor and everything was perfect. It was a stay to attend testing at a local hospital and we chose this hotel because they would shuttle us to and fro. What a godsend that was is a town full of construction and we had never been there before! The staff was so kind and courteous. Will definitely go back but on, hopefully, better terms. Didn't play in the casino but went through it. Amazing! Won't disappoint.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,In town for a baseball series,"My wife and I drove in from Milwaukee to see our baseball team play the Tigers and we chose the hotel due previous reviews posted here.  We were not disappointed.  The check-in process was quick and easy.  The front desk staff made us aware of buffet hours and all of the amenities available.  The room view lacked beauty as were facing a parking lot, but the room itself was spacious, clean, and overall very nice.  The casino was fine, we only played $10 bucks each in order to say that we gambled, but the place seemed fine.  There was a lot of leftover garbage on many a machines, but maybe that's how casinos are?  We don't gamble much...  The casino is about a 20-25 minute walk to Comerica Park and Ford Field-not too bad.  Overall, we were completely satisfied with the…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great experience!,"Quick and easy check-in, friendly and informative staff. Big comfy bed and pillows, and more than ample towels. Casino floor was clean and it has been updated where you can order drinks from your slot machine, I really loved that feature!

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,I love it,"I love visiting this hotel, in the last months I have stayed about 4 times maybe more. The rooms are very comfortable and nice. Our room had a beautiful view of the detroit lake and the Ambassador Bridge of Canada. Lots of variety of food on the buffet. Other dining options and delicious meals. All the staff are very helpful and friendly. They give us freeplay to play in the casino and there are different promotions and giveaways. I recommend staying at this hotel, it has different areas to have a good time and share.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Nice hotel, clean room",We loved our one night stay. Large room and bathroom (stayed in the deluxe king room). Comfortable bed. Quick and easy check in. Helpful and friendly staff throughout the hotel and casino. Being attached to the casino was a bonus. Plus there was plenty of on site dining options. Overall a nice hotel!,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Wonderful night in Detroit,The hotel front desk is outstanding!  Checkin is easy and quick. Staff couldn't be more accommodating. Casino floor was super crowded - it was a tiger game night. Casino floor is also dated and dirty - given how crowded it was it shouldn't be taken in to account. There is staff on the floor continuously picking up after the messy guests it just seems impossible to stay ahead of the crowd. The hotel room is so comfy and clean. And the shampoo is out of this world!!!!,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Motown friendly,"We found the rooms to be excellent, very well appointed & comfortable with excellent furnishings & TV. Parking close to hotel. Loved the Motown music in the casino. Friendly dealers & patrons. Quick checkin & friendly staff. Good variety of food choices. Decent comp. No issues whatsoever. Enjoyed our stay!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Could Be Improved,"The hotel room was nice, however, the phone did not work. The WI-FI is very slow.  For the price it should be much better.  The food is not very good.  The buffet was mediocre at best. The lounges in the hotel are dark and not very comfortable.  The staff is the only saving grace.  They are very friendly and helpful.  It just could be so much better.  Very disappointing.",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Beware,"I hesitate to write this reviews since all my stays have been casino comps (free) but my last stay may very well be my last. The robes they supply won't fit anyone that weighs over 98 lbs so I always bring my own. Last stay I ended up accidentally leaving it hanging on the back of the bathroom door. I called within hours of leaving and of course ""no one turned it in."" Seems to me it would have been easy to question the housekeeper that cleaned the room but apparently they wouldn't bother........ This isn't the first time, a previous stay my wife left her phone charger and received the same response ""no one turned it in"" a relative left her sunglasses laying on the bed. She hadn't even left the hotel and they refused to let her go back to the room to get them, when she finally…",1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very Nice,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a wedding. I was totally impressed with the hotel staff and the rooms. We had some late nights and the restaurants didn't disappoint either. Our room was clean and quiet. I visited Detroit quite a bit and had never stayed here. I definitely would book again.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,There are good things and some not so good things....,"For full disclosure, I lived in Detroit for years and never once came here before I moved away, but I stayed in this hotel because a friend got married there and all the events were within the casino property.  The good things about the MotorCity Casino Hotel:  free valet parking, the staff is really wonderful and polite and they try to go the extra mile, the casino/hotel is relatively easy to navigate, the rooms are comfortable - but nothing exceptional.  The less than awesome things:  the room was clean, but would have expected a little more (there was some kind of mysterious spill in the middle of the floor that was a large damp circle for about 2 days and didn't dry), the hotel robes hanging in the bathroom appeared to have gone through the laundry a few times and were less…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Top notch weekend,"We couldn't ask for a better experience for a weekend staycation downtown.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,A very nice Hotel and Casino.,"A friend and I traveled to Detroit to see the Metallica concert at Comerica Park. We arrived about 2 hours before check-in, but were able to take care of the info at the front desk while our room was being cleaned. We were entertained at the casino for about 45 minutes when they called to say that our room was ready. The room was nice and spacious. There was glassware of all types, robes in the closets and the choice of shower or garden tub in the bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were just like the ones I have at home. Everything was neat and tidy, and I highly recommend the hotel accommodations. This will be my Detroit home since it's so well situated with all of the sporting and dining attractions.",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Poor Management/ Customer Service,"My mother had a room reserved for July 9, 2017.  We arrived at the hotel to a dirty room!  The bed was a mess and dirty towels were on the floor.  We proceeded back down to the lobby to bring this to the attention of management.  When we requested to speak to the manager on staff that night (9ish) he was rude and provided poor hospitality.  When we requested some sort of accommodation for the issue he then stated that he did, he gave us another room.  I then responded, well of course you did, we obviously couldn't stay in the dirty room!  He rudely responds, I could've made you wait in the lobby for housekeeping to go and clean the room.  At this time I am taken aback by this young mans lack of respect for my mother and I, his obvious poor management skills and overall…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Marvellous Motorcity,"After a stay in a supposedly 5 star hotel in Chicago that was dreadfully expensive and pretty shonky this was a breath of fresh air.  From the moment we arrived to use the free valet parking the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful.  Most notably we really appreciated the concierge ringing around to find a laundry service were we could leave our things and collect later - there is a laundry service in the hotel but these are usually pricey and having been on holiday for sometime by the time we got here there was a lot to wash.  Our room was large, clean with great views towards Canada.  The bed was a king and very comfortable, lighting in the room was also very good.  The bathroom was enormous, one of the largest I have ever had in a hotel anywhere.  I was very…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Chhh..changes!,This place used to be my husband and I's favorite getaway even if it was just for one night. We would stay and order room service for breakfast. We would check-out and then gamble. Now this place has became a bit rowdy and now I would prefer to go to the other local casinos instead of this one.,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice Night out as the local casino,"Spent a night at the Motor city Casino Hotel over the holiday weekend. After spending the day visiting local wineries across river in Essex and Harlow Canada we checked in. The check in was  snap and the host explained that there were free Hors Oeuvres on the 15th floor. We booked a promo which included an executive room and $50.00 food credit. Book directly on the property web site, there are other promos including one with the spa.  Very surprised by quality of the Hors Oeuvres, excellent with huge shrimp and nicely stacked sandwiches and pork poppers and chicken wings.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Great price, interesting joint","The room was amazing, multiple rooms including a separate bedroom, tub room, and living room. Good dining room area would allow you to stay here for weeks. Wonderful rooftop pool with bar, and the casino is of a decent size with friendly staff. The neighbourhood is a little sketchy, but safe enough to walk around, we did so well into the evening, though there isn't much to do.

My room wasn't ready when I arrived at 4:00 pm but when I told the desk clerk I needed to get ready for a dinner party she was able to find a room that was ready for me.  Something I liked was that they had security staff checking people before you could get down the hall to the hotel elevators.  The room was very nice.  Large bathroom, king bed, desk, two comfortable chairs.  Room included free wifi.  Very roomy.  Only negative was a lack of power and USB charger ports on the desk.  One nice thing that happened was in their gift shop.  I stopped to get a drink and snack to take back to my room after dinner.

There were noticeable stains around the room and the carpet could be vacuumed a lot better. Some sheets and towels had tears. The room and hotel area did not smell like smoke. The bathroom was amazing. I did a thorough search for bed bugs and did not find any or evidence the three nights I was there.  Staff was very nice and pleasant. There are decent late night food choices in the food court.   I would recommend staying here. But if you want to be downtown for events/festivals and don't plan to gamble, find a hotel that is walking distance to Hart Plaza. I had to grab an uber to go downtown and visit restaurants. ",4

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Absolutely Amazing ,"We chose this hotel because it offered a free shuttle to Karmanos Cancer Center.  We used the Garage Valet parking service. The bellman, Anthony,  greeted us and whisked our luggage and my mom away in a wheelchair. He was the nicest, most sincere bellman I've ever encountered. He truly cared and was sure to ask how my Mom's appointment went that day.  However, every staff member was super kind and helpful. Shante at the concierge desk, helped us set up shuttle times, Emerald at the front desk, super efficient and friendly. Beverly, our shuttle driver was awesome. Our other shuttle driver was so funny, but forgot to get his name.  The hotel itself is beautiful and well maintained.  Getting from point A to point B was never a long walk.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Good personnel, a long in the tooth facility","What great, friendly & professional people.  I interacted with Front Desk, Casino, Convention Services, F & B, Valet, Shops and these people were very good.  The only down side were security.  Door security was fine.  Casino security were often talking, loud, yelling at each other across the hallway, not paying attention.  Typical was the ""counter"" who was so excited telling his story his counter jumped out of his hand into a guest and bounced to the floor.  Both at Casino entrance and in the casino when 2 or more security were gathered it was like a New Orleans brass band.  Just shut up.  The facility was OK, just getting old.  The carpets down the hallway are vacuumed, BUT the areas just either side of the room doors where there is a small 12' x 12' square is not.  These area…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Weekend Getaway,"I visited this hotel in April while attending a Red Wings game. The hotel staff was nice and the shuttle to and from the hotel to the Joe Louis Arena was convenient. Unfortunately our shower in the bathroom had black mold in it. Overall the hotel was good but it definitely needs a deep cleaning, everything looks fairly new but not very clean. ",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Oops.. your room is NOT ready,I stayed here for a business conference and arrived at 8:00am. I did not expect my room to be ready since I know that check in is later in the day. To my surprise they had a room for me. So I went up and when I opened the door I took a step in to see a person's leg on the bed. I immediately turned around and shut the door quietly to not disturbed the person who was sleeping. I went back to the desk and let them know there was someone already in that room. I am not one to get very upset about things like that since I know sometimes things just happen. The desk staff was very nice and apologized and moved me to the executive suite level. I just wonder what would have happened if that person was up and not asleep.   When I got to an unoccupied room I thought it was very nice. The…,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Great time, ok rooms","Stayed here after earning a free room!  It was a nice getaway for me and probably wouldn't pay more than $100/night to stay here.  The walls are paper THIN!! I thought the person in the next room was standing outside my door talking.  Check in/out went smooth and the clerk (Henry) was very accommodating when I checked in.  Room service was nice as well.  ATTN MANAGEMENT: in room 802, there is a big gap between the window and wall connecting to the next room.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Night out in downtown Detroit,"Great night at the Motor City Hotel.  Nice room, nice staff and the Spa was great.  We do this every couple months and will continue. Casino eating venue was not the greatest.  However, there are lot's of places to eat in the New Center Area, Mexican Village and Downtown Detroit.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Went for the Tigers home opener,"The room was average but the worst part was all the noise in the hallways. We were on the end of the hallway and that didn't matter, lots of commotion into the morning hours made it difficult to sleep. ",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Gorgeous,"We came into town for a Tigers game and a concert at the Fox. The hotel is very clean with a ton of nice touches in the room. Our view was nothing much but no matter since the room was so nice. They had a free shuttle to and from the game, quick ride. Some people walked but it is a long walk in some not so nice areas. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Noisy and Smokey,"While the hotel itself is fairly nice, and we got the room for a good price, our experience at the hotel was pretty poor.  The people in the room next to us were having a party at 1:00 a.m. with loud, blaring music.  I had to call the front desk about it (which I've never had to do before), but nothing was done about it.  It was after 3:00 a.m. before we could finally get back to sleep.  The room also smelled pretty smokey, despite supposedly being a non-smoking room.  I would not recommend it, unless you're just planning to party and don't have any desire to sleep in your hotel room.",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Wonderful room, Bad pillows","My husband surprised me for my birthday this weekend with a two nights stay.  The hotel was wonderful and I absolutely LOVED my Swedish Massage at the spa.  However, my massage was not very effective the day after due to the TERRIBLE pillows in the room.  My husband is now experiencing back pains and I neck pains and I did not sleep for two nights trying to make the pillows more comfortable.  The only thing I would suggest is investing in much better pillows in the rooms, it would make a world of difference.  I will come back, just with my own pillows.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Played an hour got a free room,Last year i played a hour on my players card got a free night stay. I booked my hotel on 3-31-17.  The staff was friendly on the hotel end. But some of the women at the club metro center in the casino seemed like you where a bother. But i liked coming here. It was a fun time. They do not have a pool. They do have a spa that you have to pay for. I always win at this casino or i break even. Weekends are so busy. Friday was nuts. It was hard to find a seat. But then everyone got their government checks so...yeah. rooms where kinda clean. Towels smelled like fried food. Bath tub was a little dirty and the ceiling above the tub look like it needed work. But the room was free. So im not going to nit pick. They did have a walk in shower  and bathrobes with slippers. Halls where loud…,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,One night for The Joe,"We were in town for a Red Wings game and needed a place to stay.  We ended up with Motor City Casino thru Hotwire and were completely satisfied with our stay.  Our room was wonderful (the view was over the parking lot, but oh well) and the bathroom and shower/tub were spacious and very nice (marble everywhere).  The casino is smoky, but you get what you get there.  I just want to put out there that there were rumors that this hotel had bed bugs, which we inspected for and DID NOT find...so keep calm about that.  We would stay here again.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Beautiful hotel; staff needs some serious re-training,"I stayed at Motor City this past Saturday (3/25/17). Let me start off by saying that I have no ""major"" complaints, rather my short stay was plagued by a series of small instances of not-so-great service that, when taken together, gave me a rather poor opinion of this place. What really upsets me though is that I stayed there on my wedding night, and what should have been a very magical night was sort of ruined by this experience. We could have stayed anywhere in town, and we chose Motor City because of it's breathtaking beauty and (what could have been) view of the city.  I don't have many details to share, but I have to say that just about every single interaction that I had with every single employee - from the phone call ahead of time, to the associate at check out - made me…",2

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Winner,"Absolutely loved Motor City Hotel Casino! Three of us booked a one night stay through booking.com and received an amazing rate for two king rooms.  (Room 625 and 627) We were traveling for a Restaurant Food Show in Novi, and when the hotels were all booked in that area, we found Motor City Casino Hotel, and we are so GLAD we did!!  It was easy to find and conveniently located right off the highway.  Our initial impression of the landscape of the building put us in a great mood.  The valet parking was fast and easy.  The reception check in was efficient, quick, and very informative.  The clerk gave us instructions where everything was located and was extremely courteous.   Our rooms were absolutely amazing. Super comfortable and a feeling of safeness.  These rooms were definitely…",5

We are huge TIGER FANS and always stay here. It is MOTOWN TO A TEE! We took a motor home to casino and security was awesome also!,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great rooms!,"Very clean rooms, great views of the city, friendly service and lots to do!  There are enough options for dining and drinks that you do not have to leave hotel/casino.  I would highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,I won't return,"I won't return and that is saying a lot and considering we gambled less than 20 minutes and walked away with a $1600 jackpot.  The hotel is poorly run.  Trash in halls for long periods of time, uncontrolled noise levels in rooms and a staff that is mostly unfriendly.  Both nights in the hotel we experienced 4 and 5 am extreme noise from boisterous voices from the neighbors for multiple hours without pause that the staff did nothing about.  Even little things like the ability to call the valet from your room and simply providing wall outlets bedside were missing.  The iridescence restaurant had pitiful service and sub par quality. Not with it.  The Casino was typical but on the busiest night had a lot of cigarette smoke to the point of eyes burning at times. The spa was average…",2

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Clean Comfortable. ,"One night into a 4 night stay. Clean room. Big soft bed. House keeping tidied up nicely. Im not much of a gambler, but the connected casino is nice. Spent a few hours exploring, playing penny slots and walking around and didn't lose all of my money yet. The immediate area does not offer much else, but a 6$ uber ride will get you where you want to be.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Room,Hotel was super clean and updated.  Amenities are fabulous and the restaurants are great too.  Nice and quick access to the Casino as well.  Would totally recommend staying there for fun or work travel.  You will love it!,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Close to no where,"I was expecting much more from this hotel, but unfortunately did not happen. This hotel is located in a desert area of Detroit, you can't walk on the vicinity, it is dangerous. The cassino smells cigarette smoke, breakfast it is simple, reception small and crowded. The bedroom was OK, and the roof top restaurant it is way beyond the quality of this hotel, I was surprised how good was the quality of the food and service. My average grade should be 6. Next time I should try a better location in downtown. ",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Relaxing and fun, some improvement needed","We've spent several nights at this property, usually through a casino rewards promotion. It's always relaxing and fun. I'm not sure we'd pay full price to stay here due to some improvements that can be made, but it's a lot of fun when it's free or discounted.  The hotel rooms are above average, but now (in 2017) perhaps in need of an upgrade. The highlight of the hotel room is the bathroom. It's spacious and elegant and the large soaking tub with the waterfall tap is the best! I love the soaps provided by D Tour Spa. Other highlights are the TV/entertainment system (everything can be ordered from the remote) and the great views. The bed is nice and the noise level from room to room is great. There is some noise from the hallway sometimes. The carpet and decor could stand for an…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Game stay,My boyfriend and I stayed there after a hockey game! The room was wonderful and we liked the casino too. Very easy and friendly check-in. The valet service to the game and back was also great!! We'd stay again and recommended to others.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Average at best. Too busy, too many problems.... Would not return.","Was looking forward to our first visit to this hotel. Was attending for a show at the Sound Board. That was a great space and night, the rest of the hotel, not so. First impressions, ok. Long line up to check in, went quickly and smoothly. Paid a good rate for the hotel, so, that was a good start, and checked in with an open mind. Upon arriving in the room, thought it was ok, but realized quickly that it did not feel overall clean, but being one night, soldiered on. The carpet hallways were very dirty, and in need of a good cleaning. I needed an extension cord, to plug something in needing to be placed on the night stand. That took 2 calls, and 3 hours to arrive. Strike one. Casino, strike 2. If you are a smoker, great; nice casino. As a non smoker, you are relegated to one of…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great view of Detroit,The rooms were large and upscale.  The view of Detroit's skyline was a site to see.  Very nice staff.  Casino points can earn you free nights at the hotel. My wife and I get our best returns from playing the slots there than any other Detroit area casino.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Used to be really nice,"We stayed here for Valentine's Day and I was disappointed in the rooms. When they first opened the hotel and rooms were so nice, so much better than Greektown casino. This time we were on the 8th floor at the very end of the hall, across from housekeeping. That didn't bother me. What did bother me was the fact that the carpet was dirty in the hallway, dresser drawers were off track, the curtains were falling off the rod, the floor was sticky as if it hadn't been cleaned, the mini bar which is usually filled with mixers, snacks, etc was open and empty, the coffee maker didn't work, and the jetted tub was suspect. I wanted to take a soak but didn't believe the tub had been properly cleaned because there were still water marks from glasses alongside the tub. Since I didn't travel…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Love this place,"Music is great.  Slots are loose.  Buffet is excellent.  The smoke doesn't get to me either.  I still lose but can play longer here than other Detroit casinos.  I play pennies, some quarters and dollar machines.  ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Alright...,"Staff was friendly, but the room was kinda dirty. There was no fitted sheet so it was not properly folded over mattress that revealed a stain. There was food crumbs in the fridge. Chair off of the table by window had debris. Wallpaper and bed frame showed marks and stains.  What made up for it? The bathroom! It was spotless, huge, and was like having a private spa. I understand that casino hotels see a larger party crowd and high turnover of rooms, if it was cleaner I would have been able to rate higher.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"For the price, it was a very nice room but several features were lacking.","The actual facility is nice, it is very strange that there is someone checking your room key as you head to the elevators. I guess being in downtown Detroit there are some issue with security. It was weird, but ultimately, probably a good thing. The room was a good size, nice king bed with soft sheets and decent mattress. It was a little softer than I would like but perfectly fine. The cleanliness was not what I would expect from a 4 star hotel that brags about their diamonds. The bathroom in several places were not clean and the toiletries in the shower were from the previous guests. The bathroom did have a great tub and nice shower stall, water pressure was not great. The TV was very nice and had an easy to use menu. The temperature is always a big deal for me, I hate being…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Rm 933,"I stayed on a weekday, the price was about $150 thru a travel agency. Check in is after 4pm and check out is before 11am. There is a small bar in the check-inn lobby. You cannot buy a 6 pack to go, they will sell you one beer to take with you. The room was very spacious, the bathroom had a big tub and a separate shower with 2 shower heads. I had fun using both just to say I did. Every member of the staff was polite, friendly, & helpful. Hotel parking is close by, they have free valet or park yourself. Valet is covered, free is out in the open. On the 15th floor they have the butler room for continental breakfast in the AM and snacks in the PM. I wasn't impressed with the offering for breakfast. If you're good with bagels, fruit, & oatmeal then you will be all set. You could also…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,The Lodge Diner at Motor City Casino ,"So we were at the casino and very hungry so we checked into the restaurant options and after reading the menu posted outside- figured we would eat at The Lodge. The food was actually really good- I had a chicken schwarma wrap with coleslaw and my friend had the grilled cheese and soup combo.  Both of us enjoyed our food, but he wished that they had not put sour cream in his chili ( the choices were clam chowder, chili or French onion soup). They seated us in an odd seat that was all by itself over by where the food is cooked and put for the waitresses and waiters to pick up. There seemed to be a lot of yelling going on.  Orders, requests, questions etc. I watched a nacho order sit up there for 12 minutes getting cold.  A woman waitress took our order then the food was delivered…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice Hotel but......,"Stayed Jan. 23-26th, the room was fabulous with wonderful amenities.  We ate at the buffet, had room service, and grabbed dessert from an open air stand inside the hotel.  All our meals were great.   The personnel at the hotel were very friendly and helpful.   The casino, however, was a smoke filled room that would choke even a smoker.   If you simply walk through the casino you will come out smelling like a cigarette.   The ventilation needs a total overhaul.   I have been in many casinos in my time and have never experienced one like this.   Fortunately, it is separated from the hotel so that the smell does not carry over.   If staying here simply for the hotel then it is a wonderful place to stay.   They even have free continental breakfast on the 15th floor.   I am rating…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice updated rooms,First-time visit to Detroit and hotel was recommended by our doctor.  Nice place but we did experience a couple of minor issues. 1) the hallway traffic was loud and it felt like the crowd would never calm down but it was a casino hotel on a weekend... by 1 or 2 am it was quiet and never really disturbed us tremendously 2) no electrical outlets near the bed for our phones or CPAP machine - I always carry a short ext cord so it was remedied 3) the most annoying thing was the movies... about ten minutes in and the thing quits - it just stopped mid-sentence.  I backed it up and it went on for another ten minutes and quit just beyond the last stop... this went on for a couple of rewinds then I called the desk and just cancelled the movie and thought I would try another one...

The bathrooms were larger than expected with a soaking tub and an oversized shower. stayed here for 4 nights. my let down was more on service. I had to call a couple times to get my iron replaced, the second time was because they never came by the first time On my last night, I called the front desk to inquire about a late check-out, only to be informed that they do not offer a late check-out.

Free shuttle to the Auto Show was a bonus.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very nice hotel,"Stayed here for several nights on business.  The hotel is very nice- my room was large and comfortable and clean.  I only wish there were more electric outlets available bedside, but not a huge deal.  Also- there are several restaurants in the hotel but the odd thing is the coffee shop (Sweet Ride) doesn't carry any healthy items for breakfast.  Ex:  Yogurt, oatmeal, etc.  If they could start carrying those types of items it would be perfect.  Every single member of the staff was unfailingly polite and helpful.  It made for an excellent stay.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Suite,"I wish I could have stayed longer because I had a beautiful suite. The living area and kitchenette where perfect. The bathroom was very spacious. It had a separate tub and shower (with dual shower heads). The room was clean and had nice bath products. I do feel that the room lacked outlets and charging stations though. You feel very safe as they have a security guard checking your keys before you take the elevator up to your room. Check in was also smooth (although my room wasn't ready at check in). While the casino is very smoky, my room did not smell of smoke nor did check-in or lobby areas. I would definitely stay again.",4

I don't like to gamble too much, but if I did I would play the blackjack tables. Of the three main casinos Motorcity is the best place to get a pulse on what city like is like and plus most of the people I have encountered while people watching have all been very nice.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Mini Vacation,"We experienced many aspects of the hotel beginning from the valet to the check out process. Valet was prompt and professional. Valet attendant assisted with removing luggage from car.  Immediately greeted upon entering and directed to lobby. Check in process was smooth and friendly. Security posted at entrance to elevators to rooms checking for room keys, etc. We felt safe and comforted in knowing that security was posted 24/7 guarding access to the hotel rooms (Detroit doesn't have the greatest of reputations). We stayed on the 12th floor. Room was clean and offered view of Detroit River, Ambassador Bridge, and GM RenCen. Housekeeping was awesome!

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice Hotel but walls are paper thin!!,"The hotel and casino are very nice. We had a deluxe king room and it was very modern and updated. The room was very clean and the bed was firm but comfortable. All the hotel and casino staff were very friendly. Also - get the nachos at the diner in the food court area. They are delicious! My reasoning for 3 stars is because the walls are paper thin. We could hear people in other rooms flush their toilets, and could hear people talking as they walked down the hallway. But the worst part was being woken up at 3am by people in a room near us having sex. THEN at about 8am we were woken up by the fire alarm going off in the whole building. Scared the crap out of us! It ended up being nothing but was super annoying and inconvenient. I would probably stay here again, but for no longer…",3

I enjoyed the pink Cadillac pedicure.  They have a hot tub, sauna, and steam room along with a nice sitting area with water, tea, and snacks.  The casino is extremely smokey and we couldn't find a decent size non-smoking bar for us to sit at which stunk.  There were 12 of us.  Everything else was great.  Free parking on site.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Some glitz; Many issues,"I was booked here for business. There is some glitz to this hotel attached to a casino. The room was nice enough and had some desirable amenities. However, the room wasn't available when I checked in; there was no remote in the room; there was little hot water for the morning shower; the stench of cigarette smoke in the areas near the eateries was awful; and, the noise made a good night's sleep nearly impossible.",3

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Impressive Room. Incredible Food. Exceptional Experience.,"My wife and I recently stayed at Motor City and it was everything we hoped it would be. Check-in took no more than four minutes. Our room overlooked all of Detroit and Windsor. It was clean, modern, comfortable (and equipped with a small fridge for the cold beverages that you expertly pack to consume while you wait for your wife to get ready). We headed up to Iridescence for an absolutely incredible meal and impeccable service. I can't say enough about this experience. We've dined at some of the best restaurants in the country and Iridescence ranks at the top. After dinner we grabbed a cab and headed to a show at the Shelter. The cabby was great.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Outside looks great inside less impressive,"My husband stayed 4 nights at Motor City Casino Hotel for a work conference. We live in the area and I was excited to join him because I've looked into a 'Stay-cation' there.  (MGM Grand & Westin Book Cadillac were the other two...which are pricier...)  Room was cheaply decorated, bathroom had nice floor and accent tile, but the walls were wall-papered to look like tile and I saw many 'flaws' in the finishes.  Mattress in room was aweful.  We made the comment that the decor reminded us of 1970's German ""Wohnwand""  which are these kind of tacky all-encompassing entertainment cabinets that take over the space.  The bed is settled into one and the TV into another...maybe a better comparison would be who cruise ships decorate their cabins??  Ballroom decor looked like it is…",3

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"clean and quiet, but off the beaten path","Clean and quiet.  Staff is all very friendly, but the place is off the beaten path.  We were hoping for a more pedestrian friendly place.  They have a shuttle that is convenient, but this part of Detroit has not been re-developed.  Maybe in a few years, the rest of the neighborhood will catch up with this great hotel.   Much can be said about the great staff.  Check in was quick, coat check was friendly and Anthony was especially helpful with directions and suggestions.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Best Downtown Detroit Hotel,"The bathroom is one of the most amazing bathrooms that I have ever been in. The bathroom is bigger than some hotel rooms I have been in. There is a large bathtub big enough for two. A huge all tiled shower with a large rain shower head. There is also a toilet with a door for the ultimate amount of privacy. Then there is the room. The bed is so comfortable, it is a dream. The views of downtown are breathtaking. The television is so interactive and totally dummy proof. I know the hotel was full, but I did not hear a soul in the halls. This is the ultimate in Detroit luxury. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great rooms!,"We recently stayed at the hotel because we went to a Halloween party in the area. Check-in had a bit of a line but it went quickly. We stayed in Room 1132 which was a corner room that had a great view of the Detroit skyline. The room was beautiful. Everything was clean and comfortable. There wasn't a fridge or a microwave, which didn't matter because we were only using it for the night. The toilet had it's own door so you could still get ready at the sink if someone has to use the toilet. The tub. Oh the tub!!! It is rare that you find a standard room with such a wonderful tub. I took 2 bubblebaths. The shower area is also separate. Plenty of towels and washcloths, a hairdryer, cotton swabs and cotton balls. I think the bath products smelled like cleaning products but some…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Nice Bathroom, fridge not cleaned",We stayed for two nights. When we arrived the service was nice and room seemed great. Bathroom was perfect and just what we wanted. The issue was the mini refrigerator that contained the last guests opened alcoholic beverages which of course made us wonder about overall cleanliness.  We called desk and no one came to clean so we did. To top off first night after extremely long evening when we went to get in bed sheets were ripped. First night it was too late to call down we figured they would be changed by next night. We were wrong. Overall stay was fine but they seem to lack attention to details.,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,High Quality room - Average service,Great amenities in rooms. Very nice 4-fixture bathroom with closed door for toilet area. Slow front desk service and very slow response to complaints of room noise from nearby guest rooms. Explicit warning signs for quite time after 10PM as seen in other high end hotels is necessary.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Best Night Sleep,"My friends and I were in town for a halloween party. The rooms were spacious , very tastfully decorated, and well stocked. The beds were so comfortable, just sitting on them made you want to curl up and sleep. Only disappointmwnt was the lack of a fridge, but we had a wine chiller. It was strange but we made do. I would recommend staying any time, but not exactly a place for children.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Lovely Room!,We had a fabulous room with a stunning view of Detroit! The Ambassador Bridge to Canada lit up at night makes a breath-taking site! Great place to stay when in the area. Casino downstairs adds excitement too. Highly recommend.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Best Hotel Staff,"I flew in for the weekend and decided to stay here.. Had everything, casino. restaurants, shopping, in room service.  It was a mini town all rolled into one.  But the best part was their customer service.  From security valet, front desk to bell hop, everyone was extraordinary..  I will most definitely be staying here again...",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice casino resort hotel,"We came here to stay for the weekend of my best friend's wedding. The hotel room was clean and room service was good. We got breakfast for room service. The other restaurants in the hotel were ok on food. I was not impressed. The casino itself was incredibly packed and smoky. I am a non smoker and do not like crowded areas, so the casino was not my cup of tea. We enjoyed our stay! Compared to other hotels in the area, this was one of the best ones.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Disappointed,"Had some time to kill before going to airport, so a casino seemed like a good place to go. They refused to hold our luggage and couldn't go in casino with it. Never in a million years did I think a casino would turn people away.",1

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Super rooms and service,"This hotel which is connected to the casino has some of the  largest (basic) rooms I have stay in.

In addition the TV is nice and large and the WIFI is great.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Starting to show  some age,"In Detroit and stayed at the Motorcity Casino hotel to do a little gambling. This is my first time here. Tried checking in around 3:45 pm but room was not ready. I did get a call about 15 minutes later to inform me it was ready, caused some issues. Staff here has been very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Room was large and we'll appointed but noticed small holes in top blanket on bed and carpet was stained even though it appeared it was cleaned. Carpet also on 11th floor was stained. I booked early and don't think I got a great rate even though I pre-paid well in advance. Hotel is starting show some wear and tear. Very busy the entire time we were there but things do run smoothly at all levels, Casino, food court and sound board entertainment. I enjoyed myself but…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Just ok. Better options in area. ,"I spent two nights at MotorCity Casino Hotel back in August and I have to say that I wasn't really blown away by anything this property had to offer. The room was decent in size and clean, but the hallways absolutely reeked of weed which was a complete turnoff. Also, low ceilings/awkward layout in the casino and a sketchy outside neighborhood didn't help either. Comps were reasonable based on play, but I don't think that'll be enough to convince me to return, except maybe to try Iridescence. MGM is a much classier pick in my opinion.   ",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great stay with a great view!!,"The room was very nice, Complete with wine/beer fridge. Spacious bathroom with separate tub and a walk in shower. Bed was comfortable. The carpet was kind of dirty in the halls,but over all it was a great stay.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Nice rooms, terrible location","Rooms were great...very roomy and nicely appointed. Unfortunately I was there on business and wasn't interested in the casino. As a result I felt like I was stranded on an island because it is NOT in a nice area. You certainly wouldn't want to walk anywhere because it far and not a nice area. The restaurants in the hotel are way overpriced so you are forced, if you want a reasonable meal, to take a taxi/Uber. I was concerned with the cleanliness of the linens, there was something (makeup/blood/???) on the robe. When I brought it to management's attention, they offered to replace the linens in my room. I asked how I was supposed to trust that since the current linens were supposed to be clean, but they didn't respond. Outside that instance, the staff (security, cleaning, etc) was…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Stay ,"I stayed here during Labor Day weekend. A great hotel. Spacious rooms. We were on the 13th floor and had access to complimentary breakfast and evening drinks/appetizers. We had a great view of the bridge to Canada. Wonderful bars and be sure to stop by the restaurants, especially the sweets bar and The Lodge. Complimentary wine chill coolers in each our room. Well appointed bathrooms. Lots of room and modern. We didn't make it to the casino. I'm sure we missed a treat. They also have live music/bands. Stop by the bar too! Great atmosphere ! Great Stay. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice room,Just stayed at the Motorcity casino and hotel. The room was nice and big. The bed was comfortable and you have a section of different types of pillows. The room had two robes and night slippers for the guest to use. It had a whirlpool tub with 6 jets and a nice size shower as well. The only drawback is that the carpet is stained and spotted. I added a picture of the view I had from the 8th floor. Very good stay. The staff was friendly.   ,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Loved this hotel,"The hotel was super nice and the stuff was very friendly and accommodating.  The extra bonus was that we stayed there to go to a Detroit Tigers and was advised by the front desk clerk that they offer a free shuttle there and back to Comerica Park, we were going to cab it.  It was so easy to get it and take it back.  The bathroom was very spacious, the rooms were nice but would have preferred queen beds for the family.",5

Staff was very professional!  Room was spotless. Can't wait to stay again! Casino is running a great offer right now! If you get a players card and play for an hour, you get A free room.  You can't beat that. Excellent sexy getaway minutes from the burbs!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Beautiful hotel in a great location in Detroit,"Everyone there was so friendly and helpful.  Hotel room was beautiful, we were given a free upgrade.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Night Out,This is  just not a night of haveing a chance to win at the slots or on the tables what ever you perfer but a excellent place to eat me  I love the lodge what a great meal to have and enough to share if you wanted.  the price is great and for breakfast i would say have the salmon egg benidict and lunch the CLUB so good but alot to eat enough for two and dinner the potroast very good my fav. plus there is the buffet alittel expencive if you dont have comps but still worth full price. and they have the hotel restaraunt  on the 16 th floor very nice tooand save room to stop off at the deseart room  very yummy.easy on and off the freeway thats why i like it so much and they are very nice all around have fun and good luck if you go. the rooms at the hotel are very nice too.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very nice!,"First trip to Motor City.  The hotel was very nice. The room was beautiful.  Stayed on the 13th floor, so I think we had one of the bigger rooms.  It was clean, quiet, modern, a huge beautiful bathroom.  All the amenities you could ask for, a wonderfully comfortable bed, lots of towels and a nice big TV.  Both check in and out were smooth and hassle free.  I would definitely stay here again. The casino was bright, and the atmosphere was good.  The air quality was good, but what I liked most is that they had such a good variety of slots and all the latest games.  Even though I didn't win, I was able to play for quite awhile.  If you like to play slots.this is the place to come in Detroit.  Compared to MGM, this place is a whole lot grander!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Overall, a nice surprise....","Going to a casino hotel in Detroit for a conference, we weren't quite sure what to expect. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised at the experience.  The hotel is clean and well maintained. The check in was smooth and the staff professional.  Our room was large, comfortable and had an upscale feel to the bathroom. The soaking tub was grand and the walk in shower spacious.  The carpet was clean, having just been shampooned. The only downside was it was still damp, and it wasn't until the 2nd day we could walk in socks without their becoming damp. One strange incident: The alarm clock was not working, so we called for assistance. Two hours later we called again, this time a new clock arrived in about 30 minutes. However, the young man bringing it had no idea how to disengage the…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Stay,"Conveniently located, comfortable rooms and very friendly staff.   The dealers at the casino were friendly and engaging.  The entire staff throughout the hotel was very welcoming and willing to answer questions and assist when needed.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,This hotel is great !!,"I loved staying at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.  It is spotlessly clean and the casino was lots of fun - I'm not normally a gambler, I was just there for the car show.  The only down side is that I'm a Canadian and they allow smoking in public places in the USA  - that was hard on our breathing at the casino but I'm in their country so I just tolerate it.  The horse race game at the casino was a lot of fun and they had live music.  Detroit itself is a bit run down but its still a great city with a majestic feel to it.  To me it was like driving through Gotham City....I expected to see Batman.  It has a powerful look about it - the architecture is a wonder to look at.  Even though reports are not good for safety....I never felt unsafe for a single second - I loved Detroit actually…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great view - big rooms,"I stayed at the MotorCity Casino hotel for a night with two young children. I was a bit worried that it wasn't an obvious family friendly location - but our stay worked out well.   The hotel is linked to the casinos - but we stayed on the fifteenth floor, so were well away from any noise. There was also security in reception and a keycard needed in the lift to access our floor.   The room itself was spacious with a double shower in the bathroom and a tv in the mirror. The view from the room of downtown and the Ambassador Bridge was spectacular, and there was a small but welcome breakfast in the morning.  My only complaint - which I raised with the hotel - was their apparent need to test the fire alarms twice between 4-5am. The announcement warning of a simulated test woke me up,…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice Casino Downtown,"It seems like Detroit is trying to spruce up its downtown, and they ve started by building a bunch of luxury casinos, this being one of them. It is a nice casino as well as a nice hotel that feels 100% safe and luxurious right downtown Detroit. It is close to the baseball park, football field and hockey rink making it a great place to stay if you are going down for sporting events.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Loud, dirty, needs maintenance","I stayed with my spouse for 5 days. We had to call management and security multiple times because of the noise level at all hours of the night. While they were responsive, it was ridiculous. Our Do Not Disturb button was broken. The shower door was impossible to open without 2 of us pulling on it. The light bulbs were blown in the bathroom. The toilet leaked. The drapes were falling off the track. The carpet was stained all through the hall. A large dead cockroach laid in the common hallway for days before it was ultimately removed.  I will never stay there again. It was really bad.",1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Great Weekend Getaway. Modern, Clean, and Comfy.","We were very impressed with the Motor City Casino Hotel. The rooms were very large with very comfy beds and huge bathrooms. Everything seemed very updated and well laid out.   The staff was friendly throughout the hotel. Check-in was quick and the worker at the front desk was very helpful. The housekeeping staff also went out of their way to be very friendly.   The hotel is located close to Comerica Park, so its a good option for those coming into town for a game. You can walk to the park from the hotel, but the area isn't the safest part of town, as a result there is a free shuttle, which comes in handy.   The casino itself is large with plenty of different gaming options. There are bars throughout, along with TVs for entertainment, so its easy to catch a game while you're…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Just outside of downtown,"Room was beautiful, hotel was beautiful, casino was huge and staff was friendly.  Parking was easy and free.  But, if it's possible, do not get a room that' adjoined to another.  Ours was, and we could hear everything our neighbor was saying through what must've been a very thin door.  I thought someone was yelling in the hallway and was about it call the front desk, but it was actually just the person in the room next to me talking, he wasn't being overly loud or yelling.  Also, if you're looking for somewhere by all the downtown action, this one isn't for you.  Nothing in walking distance but still only a few miles from downtown.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Hotel ,"Only stayed briefly for a few nights whilst visiting Detroit however the hotel is amazing. The rooms are very large and spacious with incredibly comfy beds and nicely decorated rooms with new furnishings. Each room comes with a Starbucks coffee machine which is a nice touch and the bathroom is also very large and modern. The room is filled with lots of amenities including a large plasma TV. Hotel staff very very friendly and lots of food options available near the casino and also the room service. Nothing around the hotel to visit or look at but a trip to greektown is recommended which is only 5 mins away in a taxi, which can be found in casino valet which is very very easy. Would definitely come back to Detroit to visit this hotel.",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great First Impression That Didn't Last,"I was instantly impressed by the check in, the friendliness of the people, and blown away by the size of the room! We had a great view of the city and were located on a higher floor. There was a large tub, a separate bathroom from the shower/tub.  There were robe/slipper for one. I was impressed by the drink bar and the amount of storage room for our luggage. The ice machine was down the hall which was nice as well and we were conveniently located at the casino.    For the bad part and why I had to rate average,  I went to use the fridge and it would not open. Since we brought a cooler, I let it go.  I tried to use the very large awesome bathtub BUT there was no hot water. I am not even sure if it was hooked up!  Since it was later at night that I discovered this, there was no…",3

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Best part of this place are its people!,"Stayed here on business, just one night but great stay!   Room was beautiful, view (high floor) of the city was spectacular, bed incredibly comfortable and room amenities high end. Enjoyed a wonderful meal in their fine dining restaurant, Iridescence, which provides every table with incredible views of the city. The wine list was quite impressive and the staff was very friendly and helpful but not hovering - able to really enjoy a leisure meal.  The next day, I was very impressed that hotel provided me with a shuttle to go across town for my meeting - a special shout out to Beverly and Bill for carting me back and forth.  Their genuine friendliness was highly appreciated (meeting was stressful).  Hotel was wonderful, but I left most impressed with the people who worked there -…",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Time for renovation,"We have been here several times over the years. It's great to be able to go right downstairs to eat, play in the casino, and enjoy free music in the Chromatics lounge however, it is time for a renovation. The carpet looked dirty and had stains both in the room and the hallways. I love the layout of the bathroom with separate shower and tub, and separate toilet area. Rooms are large. Unless the price matches the condition of the hotel, We may not return for an overnight stay until a renovation takes place. ",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Happy Birthday at Motor City Hotel,"We stayed at Motor City so I could wake up there on my birthday and it was awesome! We hit jackpots all over the place, nothing huge but nice to stay in the play and leave ahead. Because it was my birthday, the hotel desk agent upgraded us to an awesome suite on a higher floor with a view. He gave us a pass for free light snacks and continental breakfast in the butler's lounge because it was my birthday. They play the birthday song when you put your card in on your birthday and give you free play. The atmosphere at Motor City is great (wish it was non-smoking though). The Player's Club agents are helpful and friendly. The restaurant and floor service people act happy to see you and they treat you like they are glad you are there.  We learned that you can't use comps to pay for…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Ups and Downs,"The Security is great. The room is clean, spacious, and well kept. The view is beautiful. We were on the 12th floor. There is a fridge but it is stocked with 10 dollar drinks so you cant use it unless you want to pay for their stuff. There is no microwave. The remote didn't work. We called maintenance for some batteries. They didn't show. Luckily the nice lady that cleans the rooms happen to have some batteries. We changed them out and the remote worked. Then we had to call maintenance back because the top of some machine over the fridge was pulled off, exposing the motherboard. They were called twice that day and once the next. Never showed.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Tamla Motown lives at Motorcity,"Even if you don't stay at this hotel, visiting it is a must while in Detroit.

Plenty to drink and lotsa slot machines if that's your thing.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Enjoyed Our Stay,"Location is decent, right on the edge of downtown river walk area. Felt safe and there was police presence around the area. Security was friendly and helpful in the hotel and casino areas. Room was lovely, bell hop recommended asking for an even numbered room next time to face the riverfront area. We stayed in 1223 and the view was fine. When we come back we will try an even numbered room. We preferred to be up higher and didn't have any noise issues.   Bathroom was great with a wonderful soaker tub and tiled shower. One vanity but it had a water closet. King size bed was comfortable and they have a wonderful selection of pillows.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Place!,"This review should have been written a few weeks ago, but traveling and getting caught up is tiring!  My husband I stayed at this hotel while on our tour of baseball stadiums.  My requirements for a hotel are clean and non-smoking!  This place was that and more!  We had a great time while here and were well taken care of for sure!  The employees #1 goal is to make you feel welcome and happy throughout your stay!  Kudos to Erika, Tyler, Quentin, Noah, and many more including a cashier whose name i didn't seem to get!  Their customer service skills are exceptional and made me feel like they were so happy I was there!

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,A great stay in Detroit,"We had a great visit to MotorCity casino and Detroit in general. We were in town to see the Tigers and White Sox play, and the hotel shuttled us all around Detroit so that we didn't have to get in our car at all. They let us check in 3 hours early, the staff was super friendly and accommodating, and the room was nice. Huge, amazing bathroom and comfortable beds. We ended up with a free room upgrade and ate a nice continental breakfast with an amazing view. The only draw back is that the hotel is slightly off the beaten path from downtown, however, that wouldn't stop us from staying there again. All in all, we had a great experience. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Staycation,"My wife and I live near Detroit. We decided to spend the night at Motor City Casino after watching a concert at the SoundBoard. I was pleasantly surprised the rooms were very nice and we had an incredible view of downtown, the Detroit River, Ambassador Bridge, and Old Tiger Stadium site from out suite. The casino was - well your normal casino. The SoundBoard auditorium was nice and had good views of the stage. The things that really impressed me was the professionalism of the staff. I can't say enough nice things about how we were treated. AWESOME PEOPLE!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Went to the soundboard for concert.

Would not recommend seeing a show there unless you have main floor seating.,1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Mr. Mark Lucey ,"I had a outstanding stay at the Motor City Casino and Hotel. The casino was busy and quite vibrant. The room was spotless, modernized, and quite comfortable. The staff were very professional and took great pride in ensuring our stay was a pleasant one. My only complaint was that there was no Compact Refrigerator in the room to store food items. There was a fridge in the room but it was filled with hotel supplied beverages that were all for sale, nothing else. Overall, it was great stay and if I should ever travel to Detroit again I will seriously consider staying at Motor City. ",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Chromatic lounge needs renovated,Went to the chromatic ounge to see a special band. The acoustics are lousy. Could barely hear the singer over the instruments. The sound bounces off all the shiny stuff and the floor. There were no chairs for the tall tables. My mom is disabled and there was no where for her to sit. There are large poles blocking the view of the stage everywhere. And the sound for the machines bleed over the singer. The rest of the place is good-except for the smoking.,2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,The Best of Detroit,"Amazing hotel.  Can't understand how anyone would give it less than five stars--and I hardly ever give anything five stars.  I was sent here for a conference, so my room was paid for.  However, I have to imagine that even if I'd paid for it myself, my impression would still be the same.  The restaurants were great.  It was well-located.  All of the staff were beyond friendly.  Highly recommend.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Awesome place,This was a great place to stay.  Very friendly and polite at check-in.  Rooms were comfy and clean.  I loved the bathtub!  At check-in they gave me an upgrade that included breakfast in the morning. Great experience. I will be back.,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Birthday stay,Nice hotel overall but very expensive.   They try to nickel and dime you constantly. Went for a birthday.  Casino pretty smokey.

It said you're order was successful. We waited for the food for over an hour. I'm in the bathroom, my friend is in the room when he hears the door trying to be opened. He thought it was room service but it was a random guy and he walked in our room. He sees my friend and says are you serious? They gave me a key to this room. I guess they messed up.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice Rooms And Fitness Center But...,Stayed here while visiting daughter who lives by Wayne St. The rooms are very spacious with extra comfortable beds and 42in(?) flat screens. The bathrooms are as nice as Ritz or 4-Seasons. The hallway carpeting leading to the guest rooms was noticeably dirty. The complimentary fitness center was was nicely equipped. The hotel staff was helpful. Finding the main entrance to the hotel was tricky which is hard to believe for a neon lighted 16 story building. The entry from valet parking is not that inviting and the lobby and restaurant areas are devoid of natural light.   There is nothing within walking distance of the hotel except some vacant houses. One night a couple came arguing down the hall to a room near ours at 2am. The argument escalated to the point where I thought…,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Stay at a Good Price!,"Stayed here in Feb 2015 visiting family so I got to see my own room and a number of cousins' rooms too.  The rooms are large, sunny, clean and lovely.  My room had a huge soaking tub as well as the standard and very lovely shower.  The rooms were mostly perfectly silent except one Saturday night when the room right next to mine was holding a litter of wild children.  Those kids were screaming and running back and forth like there were some sort of wolf chasing them!  It took two phone calls to the front desk (both made after 10 pm, so it's not like I was being unreasonable) and thank goodness the staff took care of it.  I highly recommend MotorCity!  The restaurants were not to my taste but reasonable American standard Mall Food.  Excellent and reliable shuttle service!",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice hotel bad neighborhood,I loved the hotel and the staff. However it is a casino so you get all sorts of people. The front desk staff was kind enough to put me in the top floors with key-only access on the elevators. However this is not a neighborhood that I would feel comfortable walking at night. The hotel itself? Loved it.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Needs more finesse, spa excellent","Spent one night at the hotel for an event in their top floor lounge that evening. Overall, the experience was good, but nothing to be super excited over. Management DID respond to my concerns from the check-out survey, however. Details below.  Aspects of the room were in need of some TLC - furniture was beat up, carpets were stained, and the shower didn't drain properly (the drain was in the high end of the shower stall, so the water pooled about a half-inch to an inch with every shower). The toilet seat a black scuff/stain on it.  Ate at the buffet, which was average. Service was VERY slow (it took about ten minutes for someone to ask if we needed drinks, and our plates weren't cleared in a timely manner. We also sat next to a table stacked high with its previous users dishes…",4

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Wedding Bliss @ MotorCity Casino & Hotel,"We chose to stay at MotorCity Casino and Hotel, as we were having a wedding and wanted a place where guests could come back to is they wanted (to gamble, lay down, drink, etc).   We chose WISELY. We stayed in the executive room, with plenty of living space, a soft bed, and an immaculate spa tub.   Lounge: The room came with a spacious lounge, with comfy sofas and chairs. Nice entertainment selection. Good view of the city.  Room: The bed was soft, and it was equipped with a TV.   Bathroom: VERY spacious. There's a waterfall shower (dual shower actually). The bath was big enough for my husband and I. And, the bath had a waterfall faucet, and jacuzzi. It was amazing. There were double sinks, a separate toilet room, a vanity, a separate closet.   Eating: There was a breakfast…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice place in the heart of the city.,"My wife and I were heading to Detroit for a concert and chose the MotorCity casino due to the price and reviews.  The rooms were wonderfully appointed, clean and comfortable!  Some nice amenities you don't often find now a days (real glasses, Robes, Slippers etc.)  The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and the staff was amazing!  Everyone we ran into from the front desk staff, security, custodians, housekeepers etc. had a smile and a greeting for us!  Totally unexpected by me in Detroit and a nice surprise.  My only minor problems were the room hallways are either in need of updating or a better cleaning.  Carpets appeared to be soiled especially around the baseboards.  Not a big deal but for a 4 diamond property, I expected better.  This was our first time here and it…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Well appointed rooms,This has actually a very nice hotel where we enjoyed our stay. The staff was very courteous and well trained. It was exceptionally clean and the room was comfortable with a view of the Detroit river and the Ambassador Bridge. Downside-drunks trying to find their room at 2:00 in the morning waking you up with their rudeness. It would be nice if casino hotels would have like a quiet wing or floor away from the noise of people who don't care about their image. As in when you arrive you can check the quiet floor on your hotel forms. A lot of us would appreciate it.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Good times,"Our room was clean, large and spacious - bathroom also. Internet worked very well. Check in took a little while and we did express check out. Bed was very comfortable. Fitness area is okay. It is nice to just go downstairs and have the option of so many different places to eat in the same building. Loads of covered parking. For sure I would stay here again even though the area around is pretty rough.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Pleasantly suprised,"Great hotel - easy to access, parking was easy, check-in was a breeze.  Staff was friendly and helpful. Security at the elevators ensures only guests travel up to rooms. Hotel was clean and stylish, bathroom was nicely upgraded, nice fluffy towels, great shower and water pressure, bed was super comfortable.  Rooms were not quite as sound-proofed, but not bad.  We dined in restaurant downstairs and service and food were both good.  Used their complimentary shuttle to attend a Redwings game, very handy!  Played a little in the casino - only complaints: 1) BJ table minimums were too high; 2) drink service was non-existent while playing slots, though soft drinks have self-access; and 3) casino is very smoky, especially on lower level.  It's a $25 fee to use the pool/spa, so didn't…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay,"We were visiting Detroit for a hockey game, so we only stayed for one night, but I wish I could have extended our trip.  Every single staff member I encountered was friendly, courteous, and professional.  Our plane landed really early in the morning and check in isn't until 4pm, but they had a room available when we arrived and let us check in with no extra charge.  The room was clean.  The fitness center offers everything you could need and more.  The casino was a perfect place to spend my Saturday evening.  Had a great time.  If I ever find myself in Detroit again, I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Stopped for a romantic evening,"This is by far the best hotel in detroit metro. There are deals on hotels .com and similiar websites. And the room was super nice, king size bed full tub and shower, spacious. The restaurant on the top floor was amazing. We spent 300 on our meal and it was worth every penny!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Christmas Day 2015,"We had a smooth early check in and was given an upgraded room. The room was gorgeous and I enjoyed the jacuzzi. The casino was a little smokey and the buffet was nice although I did find a piece of plastic in my greens, the manager did apologize for that. I would have rated higher but we were awakened by the fire alarm and a voice telling us to vacate our rooms which we did. No one knew why the alarm went off and we were told we could go back to our rooms.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Class Act!,"Well, really, what can you say bad about a Casino and Hotel? Beautiful spacious room. Free Wifi. Checked in early with no additional costs. Casino in hotel. While it is no Vegas, it is certainly a minor league version in accommodations. The only problem with the hotel is its location. The instant you left the property, there is an aura of unease and guardedness. We attended a football game and everything (food, stadium) is only a $5.00 cab ride. Having said that, a terrific hotel. Staff answered our questions and provided guidance, advice, and direction. Free valet parking. Would definitely stay again. Price was $200 for two double beds. Cannot beat that for what is offered.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Love it,"We enjoy this hotel because of the room service, the lounge bar in the first floor and our favorite is the iridescence resturant in the top of the building. Im also a big fan of the. D. Tour spa. I'm not a big gambler and I think the casino is over crowded most of the time but I still like to stay there because of the other things they offer.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very Clean and lots of sceurity,"Impressed with the cleanliness, employees were walking around cleaning. Employees weren't that friendly, otherwise I would have rated 5 stars. I felt safe with all the security walking around. I didn't hear a lot of bells going off in the casino. I lost $400 within an hour. I asked my friend if they noticed anything different from the other casinos. They pointed out very little excitement with bells going off and winners yelling. Fun, but they need to give the place a shot of excitement. Maybe the employees will be friendlier and interact more with the guests. ",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Greektown is better,"I come to Detroit several times a year. I was pretty excited to stay here and it was nice that we were upgraded to a suite. PROS: 1)Suite has a nice bathroom 2) ample seating 3)Good thick curtains to help block out light. 4) large floor plan. 5) Overall clean. CONS: 1) NOISE; the walls are incredibly thin. People walking in the halls sound like they are in your room and could clearly hear the activities of our wall neighbors. (This is a big negative for me). 2) The casino is crowded. They need activities with better spacing to improve traffic through the areas and improve ambiance. 3) Many small imperfections in the room; lights not working, scratches on some furniture/doors, dents in the lamp shades. 4) not really walkable to a lot of attractions/restaurants. 5) hotel parking…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,fantastic,"We came for one night to go to a Lions game, the staff were great and very friendly, the rooms were spacious, renovated and amazing. Nikita at the breakfast restaurant downstairs was perfect. we would come back again. If you are a non-smoker, be careful of you go to the casino, most people smoke and the smoke is overwhelming....but the hotel was great!!!  ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"A lot of extra costs and ""pet-friendly"" is a huge over-statement.","Motor City was the only pet-friendly casino/hotel that we were able to find in Detroit. We were definitely discouraged by the $125 non-refundable pet fee, but we were really looking forward to the added entertainment of the casino while visiting family. For $125, I would definitely expect some pet-specific extras or at least acknowledgement that we had a dog. I would guess 90% of the employees didn't even think dogs were allowed and stopped us EVERY single time we took our dog outside for bathroom breaks. They would ask if she was a service dog and when we said no, they would ask for papers and not really believe us when we said we were staying at the hotel with her--just a really frustrating experience. In addition, the front desk told us that security would give us access to…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Better 2nd time around,"Staff was very welcoming and available.  Pet friendly for service animals, though security could use a refresher on ADA guidelines.  Rooms very nice and worth it and accommodations as well.  You don't want to really leave the hotel everything is there for what you're needing for just a get away.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,More like a ghetto Motel.,"Check in person was not very friendly.  No smiles at all. The room was ok. Bathroom had dirt and hair in the corners of the floor. Nicks and scuff marks, fingerprints on the walls. Stains on carpet in the hallways and in room. Guests being loud in the hallways and rooms down the hall. Kids screaming at 11pm. How is this a 4 star Hotel?? Casino staff was horrible. My slot machine malfunctioned. It took about 10 minutes for someone to show up and then seemed to have an attitude like I was a bother. She said.. this machine does this all the time. I would never stay again even if it was free!",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Night time visitor,"We stayed here on December 16, 2015 after a Kenny G concert. The hotel location is not in a very good area. At first impression, the hotel seems nice but when I flipped on the light switch in the bathroom, this bug was lurking there. I took a photo before killing it. When I showed it to the manager in the morning, he said that the room would be treated. ",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Midweek getaway!,"Awesome place, room was upgraded, desk staff was so friendly and accommodating. Security was excellent, might be a little excessive as had to show room key right after my check in but I guess that is not a bad thing......",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,My mom's birthday ,Going to the casino really is not my thing.  But I'm trying to explore every venue our fine city has to offer.  I thought i would just go more to check out the building. I was not impressed. It was basic. Nothing that made me stay around & want to spend my money.  I like a little ambience. ,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Good for a few hours of fun,Stopped in at this casino on the way back from Birchrun MI  shopping.  Not to fond of trying to find our way in and the area. But all went well. Found the money wen quick so the visit was not long. Did not hear a lot of winners going off. Could of been just the Sunday we were there.,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,great detroit destination,the liveliest casino in Detroit--they have top bands always playing & they are free-- they also have paid shows with big celebrities--we were there today for thanksgiving & had their buffet--$31 & excellent--there was about an hour wait it was so busy-- it was thanksgiving--usually their buffet is $28--there are other nice restaurants there also--,5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Stuck in snow storm!,"My fiancé and I stayed here while we got stuck in a snow storm earlier in the year. It was actually Superbowl weekend I remember because the hotel was very busy!  Or room was quite large and really nice and comfortable. We actually felt like we were in Vegas! Casino was  fun but we did not last very long because of the cigarette smoke. The Non-smoking section was in the middle of the casino but was poorly ventilated and did not feel at all like a ""non-smoking"" section at all! They have a few restaurants including a buffet style restaurant but unfortunately they were not open yet for dinner so we ended up going out. Because it was a pretty bad snow storm a lot of the restaurants in the are closed down early so we ended up at Whole Foods where we founds some amazing dishes at…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Excellent stay for a concert,"Booked a concert package at the Sound Board.  Package included a deluxe room with two concert tickets at the casino concert venue called ""Sound Board.""    When we arrived it was very busy and it was apparent the hotel was booked.  They have complimentary valet parking but the parking garage is connected to the hotel so it's no big deal to do it yourself.  Very nice parking garage.  Check in was very quick and we were informed that we were upgraded to an Executive Suite for no additional charge.  What a pleasant surprise!  Beautiful view of Detroit from our 15th floor room. Room was absolutely spotless and elegant.  See photos of actual room.  We received complimentary snacks and continental breakfast with the upgrade.  Beds were comfortable and there was not much noise at night…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Cons outweigh the pros, unfortunately","This is a difficult review to write, because there are some really endearing things about the hotel, but unfortunately it's not enough to outdo all the negatives. We stayed here last night, after I had a great stay there a few years ago. Both times were special occasions, and the hotel did a wonderful thing with a surprise delivery both times. The rooms are beautiful and generally clean (although a little dusty), and the bed is comfortable. However, our entire floor smelled like weed last night-not a little bit, but extremely overpowering. If you opened the door, the smell came down the rather long hallway all the way to the bed. We notified reception when we called for a different need, and they said a manager would be up to ""have a sniff"", but nothing changed. When I said…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Pleasantly surprised,"Checked in to the hotel, having seats for the Meat Loaf concert. Did not buy the ticket package - but rather went online to get the best price. Enjoyed the easy of finding the place and the security around it. Room was great, spacious, and clean. Slept well until the early morning when 'guests' seem to be have an argument about getting to the airport for an early flight - Hey, I didn't book it! Certainly would stay there again if the need arises.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Loudest hotel I've ever stayed at,"Do not stay here if you want to get any sleep.  Unfortunately we stayed here for one night and had the worst experience ever.  The intense smell of smoke alone is enough to deter anyone from staying here.  The hotel lobby and elevator look so run down, and in need of some DEEP cleaning.  We had to call security three times throughout the night due to loud partying from multiple rooms.  It got so bad that at 4am we wanted to actually switch rooms.  The actual rooms are pretty nice, floor to ceiling windows and modern bathrooms but the noise factor and the lobby ruined it for us.",1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Once upon a time...,"Once upon a time this was a really nice hotel. I actually got engaged here years ago. My husband and I stayed here in a Deluxe Suite for a little long weekend/stay-cation. We usually spend most of our time in our room and make an appearance here and there in the casino.  Pros: Room service is good, cheap and quick. Most know hitting all 3 is near impossible. Also, linens in the rooms are clean and soft.  Cons: Room smelled musty, like the previous guest hadn't completely checked out and a few things (furniture) in the room were broken. I kinda expected that from a standard room but not in a suite. Maybe have the carpets cleaned? Possibly charge the people that party too hard and break things in the room so they can be replaced. Possibly just replace broken furniture anyways.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,GREAT Experience!,"This hotel was very nice - I had read some of the reviews previously - and was a bit leery to stay here - boy was I wrong!  Check in was a slow process - there were a about four people ahead of us, however the line moved quickly.  We asked for King upgrade - if they had any and they were able to accommodate us - which I thought was amazing.  We also received a free continental breakfast - however we didn't end up using it.  Our room was great - it had an awesome soaker tub - which I used later on.  The bed was very comfortable - and loved the fainting couch.  We originally got misdirected to the wrong floor (we must have heard the number wrong) and we asked for assistance - and we asked a worker on the floor who stayed with us until our issues was resolved - which I thought was…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,5 star service,"Detroit gets a bad and undeserved rap.  Not only is it a great city, but you can find a hotel with top notch service on par with international chains.  MotorCity is one of them.  Staff were courteous, and attentive, the view was fantastic, there were fantastic food options, and I could get high speed wifi access anywhere in the hotel.  Will definitely come again!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Nice hotel, so-so casino","We stayed here Oct.16 after watching the America's Got Talent live show. The room was large, clean, spacious and comfortable. It included robe, slippers and a beautiful bathroom. Our room also included a free evening buffet and free breakfast buffet on the 15th floor. Both were excellent and fresh with good selection. We felt the room was very good value and also appreciated the free valet parking. The casino wasn't so great, and I didn't like the layout of the restaurants outside the casino. It was dim, smoky and the patrons seemed sad and tired. The location of the casino is sketchy and I would never walk around outside in that area. But if you are just staying in the hotel for after a show, I do recommend it.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Is this what Vegas is like?!,"Great service! I've never been to Vegas but if it's like this sign me up! Very clean hotel with excellent staff. Room was ready right at check in time. Didn't win at the casino but had fun anyway. Discounts on food if you pay with cash or card, not if you use comp points. Food was awesome. Enjoyed some live entertainment at one of the bars. Amazing view of the city. If you stay on the upper floors you get free breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres. Very secure premises, lots of security on site and separate parking for hotel vs casino. Everything in this hotel was nice, really nice. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,MotorCity Casino Hotel birthday weekend,"I can't say enough about this well-oiled hotel property.  The staff was courteous and on their game -- from the front desk, to housekeeping, to restaurant staff.  It was my mother's 88th birthday, and we could not have asked for a more memorable experience.  The room was lovely, and the high-end linens, toiletries, Starbucks coffee, quality robes and décor made our stay extra special.  The waterfall tub was fun and elegant.  Would absolutely recommend this hotel.  The band that played Saturday night in the casino was sooooooo good.  Throwback Motown energy and big fun!  I am a Detroit native who now lives in Florida.  I had the BEST time in my home town.  Thanks, MotorCity Casino Hotel, for thinking of every little thing to cater to the tourist.  You've done your job…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Convienient Accomodations,"Motor City Casino Hotel is ok. The room we were given was not very clean as there was hair stuck all over the wall of the shower and a large brown spot on the back of one of the robes hanging in the restroom. I have stayed here before and it was spotless, so perhaps this time was just an off instance. The views of the city from the high floors in nice. The beds are very comfortable and they even have a pillow library you can access from your television.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very nice,"Room was clean and spacious. It smelled like cigarette smoke though. They offered to move me, but I had already unpacked, etc. Staff was very friendly and security was very tight. Cost $65.00 to get to hotel from airport, but really no other choice.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Mistakes,"When I booked this hotel, I made sure it was with two beds, not one as I was going with a buddy. When we got to our room, there was just the one bed. I went downstairs to the front desk and on our confirmation sheet it clearly stated TWO double beds. Their response; when you book for two adults the system automatically books a king because they figure it's a couple. Huh?? Sounds to me like they need a new system. They were supposed to bring up a cot but they never did.. Poor service overall. This is probably the first negative response I've wrote about anything, I'm not usually one to complain but I felt the need to leave this review in the hopes that people don't have the same problems as me here.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Exceeded expectations,"The staff at the hotel was unfailingly polite and professional.  Security was present but not overbearing.  They were checking guest keys before allowing guests to go up in the elevators.   The room was spacious and clean, with a large flat screen TV, jacuzzi tub, and walk-in shower.    The free internet service was some of the fastest I have ever used at a hotel.  ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Really enjoyed my stay!,"MotorCity Casino is SUPER swanky, very elegant and updated. The rooms themselves are huge and really nicely put together. The layout is great and really comfortable for 2-4 people in a single room. I loved staying here! The amenities are high end and the security is fantastic. I have stayed at the MGM as well and the only thing I like about the MGM better is the calibre of people specifically in the casino. The hotel portions are equal if not MotorCity is better. The casino I do like MGM better but that's fine it is only one element of an awesome trip! They also have a free shuttle to/from sports games which is a big plus!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Outstanding stay!,"Spent a couple nights at Motor City Casino and had a very good stay. Our first visit there.

Free valet parking, convenient to everything in Detroit, which has a good vibe of hope and recovery going on.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Second stay was as good as the first,"I stayed here last year for the TourDeTroit ride and stayed here again this year.  The standard of the rooms, the size, comfort and everything is top-notch. As a member of the metro club in the casino, I was even able to take a shuttle to the Tigers game. The bathroom is ridiculous, a spacious shower and wonderful tile. I didn't use the tub, but it was separate from the shower and quite large. Beds were beyond comfortable. Our room had a view of Michigan Central and the Bridge.   Staff was very helpful and polite. Couldn't have been better.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Fantastic!,"Beautiful big rooms that are very clean, modern and well appointed. Far exceeded my expectation of what I would get when I booked this hotel unknown on Hotwire.   Parking is easy in the self park lot. Not much around the hotel other than a rough neighborhood but all you need is at the hotel.   The casino was a little sketchy but, I didn't gamble. Arrived pretty late on a business trip.

I hope they start to train their staff in customer service because I have no intentions of returning for quite a while, if ever.",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Beautiful Casino, Policies are annoying","We went to this hotel for my birthday the past weekend. The first impression of the hotel is amazing, and everything is beautifully decorated! The staff is amazing and friendly and the food good. What annoyed myself and my boyfriend is that they do not allow any outside alcohol, so we couldn't bring any wine up to our room to drink unless we snuck it in! Which is included in the ""policy"" section when you book.  Also, the fridge in the room is not useable- at all. There are overpriced beverages in there with sensors under them. So when we came back from dinner, I was excited to put my leftovers in the fridge, I found I couldn't unless I removed the $10 beer, in which case when it's removed from the sensor you get charged. That is EXTREMELY annoying, you get charged simply for…",4

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice place for a casino but no places to walk to for a convention,"We stayed at the hotel for a recent convention for 3 nights over Labor Day. I never even set foot in the casino so this is truly a review of only the hotel. Free valet parking, spacious rooms, and the staff were al very pleasant. We did order pillows from the cool pillow menu but never received them. Housekeeping did a fine job. We asked for a room adjacent or close by our friend who is handicapped and they put us in a connecting king room. Her handicap accessible room was perfect! Thank you!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Large, nice rooms in a centrally located, self sufficent facility","I stayed in a ""king room - one bed"" (which I had requested). . Rooms are very generously sized and nicely appointed. Bathtub and shower stall in large bathroom area, but only one sink. Don't go for the views - it is totally an urban landscape. The location is otherwise good - fairly close to almost anything you want in Detroit. Less than a half-hour to the airport (DTW).  While this was not my first choice of hotels originally (others were booked solid), I was very pleased with my stay and would go there again. It was a reasonably good value. There were Several choices for meals on the premises and free WiFi in rooms and generally around  the hotel.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Not what I expected,Upon arrival the room wasn't professionally clean. There were still signs of the previous guest.   The mini bar was supposed to come with a menu so we called the front desk and asked if we could get a copy sent to our room since the prices we assumed to be pretty expensive. The lady at the desk said she would send someone up ASAP. After waiting an hour no one came to our door. We proceeded to call back more than once without receiving any menu. Eventually we decided to try the deep dish pizza from the room service menu. When we received our pizza it was a Little Caesars Hot and Ready... priced over $20. We asked the waiter for a menu for the mini bar once again and she said she'd be right back with one. We never ended up getting that menu unfortunately.   Overall pretty poor…,2

I felt very safe inside with security people checking room cards before you get on the elevator. I arrived on a Monday evening & there was only a fast food court open.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,An unexpected gem in Detroit,"I was traveling on business and stayed at the Motorcity Casino Hotel. I was very impressed with the property.

A little pricey but good quality and ingredients.  Had two meals there during my time.  Wine list good.  Had a pea ravioli which was outstanding just so tasty.

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Great location, free parking, large rooms",This casino hotel is very business.  It has free valet parking for hotel guests. We checked into a spacious room. The room is average but could be better with renovation.  The bathroom is very large with a deep bath tub and a beautifully enclosed shower (best section of the guest room).  The hallway carpet need to be deeply cleaned or replaced.  The dining areas on the first floor were situated outside the casino area just beyond the hotel check in.  The food was good and the prices great!,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very Nice Hotel,"We stayed in a suite in MotorCity hotel, and very much enjoyed it. The suite had modern finishes and lots of space to stretch out, which was nice because we were there for a week for work. The gym area is very nice, and usually fairly empty most mornings I went. The spa was also nice. My massage was one of the best I've ever had, but I didn't think the facial was worth the money. The laundry service was quick, and very affordable. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars in the onsite dining options are not very good. We only went up to the restaurant on the top floor for drinks and an app one night, and I""m sure dinner would have been amazing, although you pay for it. The rest of the options from pizza to sandwiches to the buffet were just not good. That being said, I would…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice hotel. Typical outside Vegas casino,"Nice hotel given that downtown Detroit is not quite there in terms of a destination. Rooms are very nice, food is average. Casino is small and what you should expect outside Vegas. Best part is Sound Board. Great place to listen to live music!!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,A pleasant surprise,"Although it's a bit out of the way, they're like Avis and they try harder.  Really helpful staff who go out of their way to help and excellent rooms - big, comfortable bed, choice of pillows, and a huge bathroom with a great shower stall.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Enjoyable stay,"This is a fancy but comfortable hotel. Good service all the way around. The rooms are large and have all the extras you need. I really liked the armoir style entertainment center.It was easy to access everything. Everything else is convenient, the casino, restaurants, parking etc. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Recommended.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Awesome getaway in the heart of Detroit,"Very nice hotel, very nicely designed, updated, and clean.  Rooms with excellent views of the City or the Riverfront and Canada.  Excellent price compared to competing casino hotels.  Convenient complimentary valet parking.  Excellent restaurant, we enjoyed Iridescence restaurant which has spectacular views.  This is the perfect place to get away for a night.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Sleep well...,"After a fun-filled weekend, we elected to stay an additional night at the Hotel.  The room was very clean and beautifully appointed.  There was a slight issue with the key reader, which prevented the issuance of keys, however, management was very accommodating.  We opted for room served and was thrilled with our selection of pot roast, spring salad, and cheesecake.  Delicious!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,August 1-7 NMA conference,"Aesthetically, MotorCity rooms looks very nice.  The double room beds are on a platform and quite uncomfortable.  Housekeeping.  I did not have the rooms cleaned everyday however when I did place the sign to clean room, I had to call down at 6 pm to get the room clean with new towels and they made the bed with the same sheets and did not dust.  I am not OCD but they did a horrible job.  I placed all the trash in one location.  They did not take the trash out of the room.  I stayed for 6 days and asked for a refrigerator.  $20.00 dollars a day.  There is a minibar but I was told if anything was disturbed I would be charged for that.  I was at a medical convention and asked for a rollaway bed for a child that was staying over the night with us.  $40.00 and since we were in a…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Clean and friendly,"I stayed here for business in July 2015.  The staff was very friendly, and my room was extremely nice.  The amount of smoke in the hotel portion was minimal, which is nice for a non-smoker like me.  Ordered room service - they were professional and friendly.  And, the burger in the Pit Stop was delicious!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Don't Request a Late Check Out,"My daughter and I stayed one night, mid-week and in the morning, I called the desk to request a noon check-out so we could eat lunch there and possibly check out the casino before taking a cab to the airport. The woman on the phone said it would be a $50 charge to stay one hour extra. I asked for clarification, especially since I had used a platinum amex checking in, which usually guarantees late check-out. She was adamant that we could not stay. When we went downstair to check out, I told the desk person how disappointed we were that we did not get the extra hour, but she just said, ""yeah, sorry, that's the policy"". We were in town to attend a concert at Comerica Park, and noticed that many people were checking out that next morning. I'm pretty sure they could have accommodated…",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Comps!,"We stayed at Motor City for my birthday and it was awesome. They upgraded our room to the key only floor that includes the butler service for food and drinks that evening and a continental breakfast buffet the next morning. The concierge left a cupcake and birthday card in the room. That is way more than any other casino has ever done to make me feel special on my birthday. They play the Beatles birthday song on the bonus TV screens when you put in your player's card and you get $5 comp. This was our second stay at MC, and it was great. We stayed the next day and had the buffet lunch before we left and it was excellent. The only reason I didn't give the best rating was the TV remote didn't work, and we like to watch TV before bed and when we wake up, and neither are good times…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Fancy modern hotel - odd casino,The Casino Hotel was exactly as expected - to be a fancy party hotel attached to the casino. The lobby and ground level concessions are very oddly laid out with reception being far too undersized for the hotel. Parking is free and there is of course the casino attached but the layout of the facilities is not well connected. The room was spectacular though. Reading many of the other reviews I think we experienced all of the same highs and lows. The rooms are huge and very modern (but as one reviewer commented very dark furniture) with wall to wall windows. The bathroom I would like to have packed into my car and driven back home. The bathroom is slightly smaller than my condo in Toronto and very posh. Cleanliness was a bit of an issue as we found hairs everywhere but nothing…,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Loved our stay,"The staff at the front very busy but very attentive and friendly answered any questions we had.    We went to our room and was pleasantly surprised, big, clean, big bright window with a great view.  The bathroom was over and above most hotels, as bathrooms go.  I would recommend anyone to stay there, I mean we met Josh Donaldson in the lobby, I guess the Jays stay there when in Detroit.  Did we bug him, no we are Canadians, we just don't do that.  Just said hi on the way by.  Just a note about the casino, really liked it but my eyes started to bleed as the smoke from people smoking was just too much.   We could only take an hour then out of there.  I wasn't alone about that one.  My clothes had to immediately go into the laundry bag as the smoke smell was so bad.  They really…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Staff are excellent - casino has great variety and toons - comps are generous - slots payouts are okay at best,"Every staff member I encountered was polite, helpful and professional and there were several I met during my stay.  A special thanks to our 2 waitresses at the Diner (Breakfast and Dinner).  Didn't get their names but they were terrific as was the food.  Best Omelette and Club Sandwich ever with huge portions.  Great variety of slots on both levels of the casino.  They play great MotorCity toons!  Played penny slots average sized bets for 4 hours and had both meals comped.  That's what I call good customer service.  Like all casinos I wish the slots paid a bit better.  I think so much goes into freebies and comps that they tighten the slots to make up for it.  I'd rather they loosen the slots.  That would keep me coming back more often.  I don't smoke and I hate the smell.  I…",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Highly recommend!!!!,"Loved every moment of my stay here. My Husband and I had a wonderful dinner at the hotel restaurant Iridescence before traveling out to the city for a night on the town. Dinner was amazing, the hotel is beautiful and the staff very friendly. Can't wait to go back.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very nice stay!,"We spent one night here, had tickets to Tigers game! Definitely would highly recommend staying here! The rooms are very nice and clean and big! We had a king bed room. The stay was Fantastic, however think their staff could be more friendly. All around, definitely worth the stay. Would I spend another night here,  YES....!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Had its pros and cons,"MotorCity's property has an odd feel to it - like those riverboats they convert into casinos - and I later found it was a conversion, too (originally Wagner Bakery / factory, where Wonder Bread was manufactured). Our room was far from terrible, yet overall decor was too masculine to appeal to me - dark brown / neutral color scheme, massive furniture, probably everything to make an older male automobile lover feel quite at home. Bathroom was extremely nice - spacious and spa-like, complemented with two heavy-duty terry robes to wear (or buy, if you happened to fall in love with them). Unfortunately, despite its non-smoking designation, the smell of old smoke definitely lingered. The casino had a great variety and number of slots, but they took more than they gave back and I wish…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great place to stay!,"Had to have surgery so the VA recommended staying there. You get a discounted rate if they know you are  having a medical procedure. We got a room on the 14th floor and it was great. King size bed. Lots of pillows. Free breakfast . The security there is really good. You must show your key to get to the elevators. My key would not work and a gentleman named Anthony took care of it. All the people were very friendly and helpful. Lots of slot machines, blackjack tables. Won enough money to pay for the room..All the rooms are no smoking. Have to say it is the best hotel that I have stayed at since staying at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas . Close to Ford Field and where the Tigers play.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Exceeded expectations--beautiful rooms + big casino,"Stayed here for one night with USA Volleyball nationals and loved our stay. Beautiful rooms, immaculate bathrooms, one of the comfiest hotel beds I've stayed in. Buffet was very good--they even had sushi! Nice casino. Played both roulette and blackjack and for the most part had very friendly dealers. We really enjoyed our stay!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,The smoke is worse than you can imagine!,"The room rate should include a fireman's respirator so you can stand being in the casino long enough to gamble! The room was very nice, however, when one books a room in order to take advantage of the casino there is an expectation of being able to enjoy a little gambling. No such luck, I couldn't stand the smoke filled casino floor for more than 5 minutes! I asked for the non smoking section & was directed to a very small slot area. I was looking forward to some black jack & a few cocktails, but it seems these are only available if you can tolerate the smoke. I can't even begin to describe just how bad the smoke is!!! Stay away!!!",1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Nice casino, not so much the hotel.","I love this casino. It has a great variety of games, and the bars and restaurants are great. The hotel, however, always leaves something to be desired. I've stayed here several times, and always find the room to be less than clean. I've also encountered my fair share of grumpy staff members. It is, however, the best deal money wise of the three casino/hotels. ",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great Time,"I had never stayed here before but wanted to.  Check in took about 2 minutes...super efficient.  Got the key and went to the room to put our suitcases away.  We wanted to have some dinner and hit the casino.  The room was very nice.  Like a nice hotel in Las Vegas.  Beautiful bathroom with separate tub and shower plus bathrobes to use.  We had to test the beds and both the bed and pillows were very comfy.  Everything was very clean.  My only drawback was being on a lower floor just above the roof garage, we heard every loud radio on the cars below.  The boom boom boom went on until 3 am maybe even 4 am.  But it didn't keep me from wanting to return.  Had a great time!!",5

"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Manager calls room at 1:30 a.m. over a $96.00 dinner charge.,"Staying with two friends at the Motor City Casino Hotel turned into a nightmare--literally. After standing in line for the casino buffet, we were presented with machines, not a cashier. We chose to put the meals on our room bill and went in and enjoyed our dinner.  We returned to our room where we soon discovered the walls to be paper thin. You could hear everything that was going on! We did manage to go to sleep, but at 1:30 in the morning the phone started to ring. It was the manager informing us that the hold they had placed on the card--$100.00--was insufficient and we had to go down and pay the dinner bill immediately. The dinner bill was $96.00! My friend said it would be taken care of in the morning and voiced her displeasure. She went back to bed. 20 minutes later the…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Nice Room, Good Value","We have stayed a MCC quite a few times, and some of those times have been in favor of a free gamble and stay offer. This is a great hotel/casino experience.  Hotel is updated and relaxing, great spa and restaurants.  The amenities are pretty good as well, nothing overly fancy in the basic rooms but very comfy beds and the bathrooms are gorgeous.  Very unique set up.  Most rooms have a great view of the bridge or the city as well.    Only real issue is the location.  It is a little bit out of the downtown area, but most attractions can still be reached by taxi or they shuttle you to sports events.",4

While it has a slightly dated reception area, the room (#1424) was fresh and on par with some of the nicer hotels I've stayed  in.  I probably came to Detroit expecting something other than the friendliness of the people we met across the city and on staff here...I would stay here again, easy access to the downtown and some top eateries and pubs up Woodward.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great night of fun and festivities,Spent the night here because we had a gala to go to at the MGM Grand Hotel and this hotel was significantly cheaper.  It was a bit out of the way but the room was nice and the security on the main floor was reassuring.  The free valet parking was a great bonus and the live band that was there until 2 am was fun to watch. Overall the stay was lovely. ,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Time limits,Watch out they don't let you in between 2 am and 330 am without club card.  So do go see a show or fight then try to go.  Tried calling and had no real reason why they put on time limit.  Not on web site either.,1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,MotorCity Casino Hotel is just a good hotel,"The MotorCity Casino Hotel overall is just a good hotel. This was my first time staying at a casino hotel in Detroit and my first time staying at one in the past 5 years. There were many things that I liked and disliked, so I will list them below.   The positive aspects: - The gym was excellent!!! Great equipment, space, and air quality - There was a food court attached directly to the hotel. The diner in the food court was great for breakfast and had super friendly staff - Valet and self-parking were very easy and close by - Free WiFi throughout hotel and casino - King bedroom was great  -  Very large and open, bed was comfortable, TV worked well, plenty of clothing storage along with an electronic safe. Lighting was perfect throughout the room and the desk was large enough for…",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Poor customer service ,"I stayed at the Motorcity for a convention, and was very disappointed. The staff was very unfriendly,  in fact they were rude and abrupt. I was not welcomed to the casino, I would say good morning or hello to the staff and was ignored, and at checkout there was 1 person working and he was down right rude. The food was decent, the casino was mediocre.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel/casino to anyone.",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Visit Motor City Casino!,Love Motor City Casino! Food is great- entertainment is fabulous. Rooms are exceptionally clean- showers are fantastic. Detroit has come along ways- it's headed in the right direction. I wish the non smoking area was bigger- different-however; it is still a great time!,4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Great stay!,"Stayed here for opening weekend for the Tigers!  Very friendly staff, great bar specials in the casino.  Our room, along with hotel was very clean, but beds could've been a little more comfortable but still slept okay.  The only down side is, that it's not in the greatest neighborhood, but taxis and uber is available and inexpensive to take you anywhere in town! Security was visible on property and never had anything to worry about. I've stayed a few times before with no problems. I'd definitely stay here again! Ask for a higher room for the best views. Detroit IS a great city!! ",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Nice room.,"I enjoyed the room I stayed in. However, I was very disappointed in the selection of food offered in the casino. Stay away from Pit Stop. Beef brisket is sliced beef. Nothing brisket about it.  Bed was comfortable to sleep in. Which is a major plus. The tub in the bathroom was huge and the jets were a great addition. Totally took advantage of the tub. Room was clean and staff was friendly.",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Hotel Casino,"A very vibrant and lively place to go, the Casino is lots of fun. The hotel is ok but paper thin walls! The neighbors in the room next to us had a baby that was very unhappy, then around 2AM, people walking down the halls yelling and screaming. But over all the room was nice and clean. I would stay again maybe a different floor higher up.",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Filthy. Needs attention. ,"My husband and I stayed here after an event in downtown. We stay in Detroit frequently and hadn't been to Motor City for some time. It had been 5 years since our last stay which at that time was quite enjoyable. Sadly this visit was not the same.   We were given a room on the 6th floor. The room seemed to be in order, however a closer look showed it was in need of a deep cleaning. The bed linens were wrinkled as if they weren't freshly washed, the bathroom toilet area had a disgusting amount of pubic hair on the floor (a large clump), the coffee pot had stale coffee grounds left from who knows when. And the carpet seemed as though it hadn't been vaccumed recently.   In addition to the dirty room the noise level was horrendous. Throughout the night doors were slamming, people…",1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,WORST PLACE IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO RELAX,Horrible!! Just HORRIBLE! Worst mockery of customer service I have ever experienced IN MY LIFE!

The front desk lady looked sooooooo trashy smh dont come here!!!!!,1
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Better stay this time,"After a lengthy absence from Motorcity Casino (5 months) we decided to give it another chance. Our last visit was less than stellar, and I vowed to never return. Which was hard because MotorCity was always my FAVORITE in Detroit since the beginning. While I tried so hard to make MGM my new home, there was always something missing. So......against my better judgement I decided to give Motorcity another try. From the minute I checked into the hotel, I felt so comfortable and realized how much i missed it there. Had A great time in the casino as well. Fantastic selection of slots. We stayed on a Monday night, so it was not busy. We had no issue getting on a machine. We ate at the Lodge Diner. As always, the food was spot on and the service was quick and friendly. My only complaint…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,PRICELINE YOUR RESERVATION,"MotorCity Hotel is overpriced for what you pay. I am glad I used Priceline to reserve my room. I used the name your price tool and selected the Detroit area closest to the convention center because I was going to the Auto Show.    Priceline matched me with MotorCity Hotel. I was excited for this. After our stay, I thought to myself, WOW I would have been very disappointed had I paid full price.   100% NOT WORTH THE PRICE THEY ARE ASKING.   I bet their retention rates are LOW so they have to accept the Priceline bids to keep the rooms booked.",2
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Motor City Needs to Get the Motor Back!!!,Me and my husband purchased a package deal (hotel + concert tickets to the Soundboard). I only rated 3 points because of how great the concert was and the seats. The hotel needs to clean the carpet not only in the rooms but also in the halls. The furniture in the room was showing signs of wear and tear. For the amount of money that spent I truly expected more. We have stayed at other hotel chains and received better rooms and complimentary breakfast for less money. We had friends that stayed at the hotel the same night who had used their casino comps and they had the same exact room that we had but we paid way too much for nothing.,3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Perfect room, too bad for the view","Had a room on one of the lower floors so it looked out on the car deck. it didn't bother me much because the bed was good and so was the shower, great shampoo and verry happy with the coffee! :-) Thank you MotorCity!",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,"Nice hotel room, fabulous bathroom","We stayed here one night recently.  Check in process was pretty speedy, but the line waiting was slightly confusing because it was very difficult to tell who was next in line--however, everyone was kind and it all worked out.  The room was nice.  The room and bathroom were very clean, but the carpeting is a little tired.  The bathroom, however, was fabulous!  I totally loved the super-deep bathtub!!  There's a separate large shower and also in a corner of the bathroom area, there's another door to the toilet so if you're a 'private toilet' type of family, this is perfect. We ordered room service for breakfast the next morning and while it was fine, there was one funny thing about it.  I ordered a half-grapefruit and it was cut the wrong way.  Obviously whoever cuts their…",4
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Fantastic hotel with great views of Detroit and excellent facilities!,"This hotel is FANTASTIC and HUGE! With several on site restaurants, casino, gym, spa treatments and stunning views of Detroit this hotel is AMAZING! The restaurant at the top of the hotel is definitely worth a visit. The city of Detroit only a 15 minute drive away. I really enjoyed my stay here!",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,The waterfall tub is very relaxing," Finding a parking spot, or letting valet park your car. Your at ease when you stay at this hotel. Service was fast and friendly. The room was just outstanding and delightful. The waterfall tub  was just great. The walk in shower was soothing. Plenty of room to move around. The comfort of the bed was just so comfortable. I was on the 13th floor and the view was nice. The restaurants were packed but not too much of a wait. The casino was very nice and plenty of games to play. Even met Ben Affleck there as well. The only problem I saw was the some of the machines were too close to each other and it was hard to maneuver around. Great poker room too. Complementary pop and coffee also available. ",5
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Customer Service Lacking,"The hotel only requires a $50 deposit.  Nice, compared to other casino hotels in the area.  Friendly front desk agents and nice lobby.    The room is nicely appointed, and the decorative design of the room is very unique, better looking than the other casino hotels in the area.  Problem: housekeeping.  The room has a separate tub, shower, and toilet.  There was hair in the corners of the shower.  This means, either the shower was not cleaned thoroughly or not cleaned at all.  To make matters worse, I know I made a mistake and left clothes on the side of the tub.  I called lost and found...and it was never found...never reported from housekeeping.",3
"Detroit, MI",MotorCity Casino Hotel,Very nice.....long check in,"Stayed here for our stay to go see Garth Brooks.  The hotel is very nice- staff was friendly, but check in too a while- 15 min line.  When we came back downstairs, the line had to be 45 minutes!  Bed was VERY comfortable, along with nice sized room and great bathroom with tile shower and jet tub.  Free Valet is a nice bonus, especially since it was cold.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Front desk service was fantastic ,"My partner Eric and I come to Detroit for business often, and this is our favorite place to stay.  It was especially pleasant this time because Nyyota at the front desk was charming and helpful, offering advice and help about parking, dining, and business needs.  We miss some of the services that were suspended due to the pandemic, but it was more than made up for my Nyyota’s care.  Look forward to the next visit. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Terrible customer service. Answer your darn phone!,"If you want your anniversary, birthday, conference, or just a night in Detroit completely ruined, look no further than this property!  From staff that can't be bothered to answer the phone at ANY TIME during our stay, inaccurate and contradictory parking information on the website, a lying front desk clerk who claims to be the manager of the entire hotel, nobody to answer the phone to help when we ran out of toilet paper, no shampoo in the shower, non-existent water pressure in the shower, non-working power outlets near the bed (inability to hook up my CPAP machine!), a leaky ice bucket, and a staff that couldn't give a rat's behind, this hotel has it all! First, I am all about COVID Safety and have no issue with valet parking being suspended if the hotel feels that it is in the guests' best safety interest.  HOWEVER, it is noted on the hotel's website homepage and the third-party site I booked through that it IS available. (To be fair, there was another note buried in a linked page and under a dropdown heading that listed valet parking as discontinued, but that contradicts the information on the homepage and I didn't find it before my arrival.)  My issue? After waiting at the valet stand, which had no sign posted about valet not being offered, I called the hotel to inquire if a valet was coming or see what my other parking options were. I called the front desk FOUR TIMES! (My wife also tried calling while I circled the block!) Each time, the phone rang, and rang, and rang some more, and nobody answered! Unacceptable! We did finally find parking in a garage adjacent to the hotel, but c'mon, a 4-star hotel and the front desk can't be bothered to answer the phone for 10-15 minutes while I sat like a fool at the valet stand and circled the block four times in an unfamiliar city. Hilariously enough, later that evening, my wife and I spent ten minutes outside the valet stand while waiting for a Lyft ride, and while doing so, we spent our time informing other guests that valet was discontinued, as several guests also were unsuccessfully waiting on valet and trying to reach the inattentive front desk staff by phone. (We talked to at least 6-7 drivers, some of whom already had unloaded luggage to the curb!) Our bathroom, while spacious, was less functional than the ones at the Motel 6 I crash at in suburban Ohio each December as part of a work reunion tradition.  The shower had almost no water pressure. The water poured full force out of the tub faucet and hardly any came out of the shower head. (Yes, I know how to operate a shower, it was not a user error!) There was no shampoo in the shower for me. (My wife brought her own). The sink ""hot"" water was basically boiling and the cold tap wasn't working. We had to brush our teeth, shave, and wash our face without cold water. (Spoiler alert: Nobody answered the phone to address our concern!) Speaking of our bathroom and staff not answering the phone, nobody answered to assist us when my wife ran out of toilet paper and she had to use tissues. I went down to the front desk to speak with the alleged ""manager."" He was rude, arrogant, and condescending. He offered no apology for not answering the phone, tried to make me feel like I am an idiot for not digging deep into their website to find info about valet, and became argumentative with me about my other issues.  He made no note of nor addressed any of my valid concerns. (After dismissing each of my concerns one-by-one, he just shrugged and said ""Yeah, what else?"")  After he was of ZERO assistance to correcting our bathroom issues, no apology for not answering the phone, and being incredibly condescending, I asked if there was ANYONE else I could talk to. He said there was not. I asked who was above him. ""Nobody, I'm the manager!""  He is NOT the manager. (Possibly a shift manager? But I called Marriott to complain about my stay and the clerk's rudeness and they confirmed he is not the head/general manager of the hotel. There IS somebody above him, he just lied and refused to elevate my concerns to a more senior staff member or provide me with access to contact her.) In the spirit of fairness and full disclosure, he did offer me 5,000 rewards points IF I signed up for a loyalty program while giving out all of my personal information to him at the front desk in front of other guests. (I later found an email from Marriott -- Westin parent company -- offering me 2,500 points just for signing up! What a joke!)  I asked what exactly ""5,000 points"" meant. He told me 20,000 would get me a free stay at that property and failed to explain how one acquired more points. (Also a lie! 35,000 points is needed, according to the hotel's website.) I typically travel only for work for hotel stays or Air BNB for personal trips, so loyalty points at a hotel don't do a whole lot for me, especially when I would have been only 1/7 of the way to a free night and have to spend an additional $3,000 at Marriott properties to earn a free night there! We would have switched rooms had someone answered the phone and provided assistance, but by the time this NON-MANAGER was done making me feel like an idiot and an undervalued guest, we had already showered (in minimal shower pressure), got ready, and had to leave to make our dinner reservation on time and we didn't want to pack up our things and move at 11:00 PM upon return. The alleged ""manager"" said he couldn't even consider adjusting the room rate because I booked through a third party. I called the third party (who has the only customer service agent sympathetic to my concerns). The representative told me that there is ABSOLUTELY something the hotel CAN do about a rate for rooms booked through them by giving an exception to said third party that allows them to issue me a partial refund/full refund/credit. The third party called the hotel to discuss this possibility and advocate on my behalf. But....You'll never believe this! Nobody answered the phone! They opened a case for me (as did Marriott customer service when I called them), but it's been a full week now and neither the hotel, Marriott, nor third party has reached out to me.) While perhaps out of the hotel's control and not actually part of my complaints, we were on the 18th floor and put in the last room at the absolute end of the long hallway and had a lame view of the hotel wall and an alley way. (I had read reviews about the hotel with guests raving about the great city views.) We were near a staff door that we could hear opening and closing and hear staff chatting in the evening. (Again, not the end of the world, but compiled with everything else, it was irritating.) Minor things do go wrong, but coupled with everything else, it was also irritating that at least one power outlet didn't work (closest to the bed and most convenient for my wife's hairdryer; and where I would hook up my CPAP, which I now couldn't do, and got a terrible night's sleep as a result, despite an incredibly comfortable bed). Oh, our ice bucket had a leak in it, too. This was our wedding anniversary weekend, and because my wife had been dying to try a restaurant near the hotel, off to Detroit we went! We drove from Canton, OH (3.5 hours) My wife wanted to stay at a 2.5 star hotel in a less-desirable location for a lesser price, but I insisted that we stay in this alleged 4-star hotel. Man, did I look like an idiot! I was so worked up by the rude manager that I could barely enjoy our (very expensive) anniversary dinner. I didn't want to spend a combined two hours of our mini-getaway circling the hotel while trying to reach the front desk about parking issues, riding the elevator down 18 floors to speak with a discourteous employee, and being on the phone with Marriott customer service (and the company I booked through) in a failed effort to resolve my issues. To be fair, the hotel was very clean, COVID guidelines were well followed, the beds were comfortable, our room was quite spacious, there was a large and efficient elevator bank, a Starbucks on the first floor, and we LUCKILY GUESSED the right place to park (no thanks to staff!) and the hotel validated parking for all guests in that garage. Unfortunately, those are the only good things I can say.  I don't think that cold running water, toilet paper, shampoo, sufficient water pressure shower, and having a staff member answer the phone at some point during our stay are unreasonable things to ask of a Motel 6, let alone a 4-star hotel. The absolute shame of it is that if the staff had been friendly, helpful, attentive, or at least answered the gosh darn phone, many of our bigger issues could have been easily resolved.… guests' best safety interest.  HOWEVER, it is noted on the hotel's website homepage and the third-party site I booked through that it IS available. (To be fair, there was another note buried in a linked page and under a dropdown heading that listed valet parking as discontinued, but that contradicts the information on the homepage and I didn't find it before my arrival.)  My issue? After waiting at the valet stand, which had no sign posted about valet not being offered, I called the hotel to inquire if a valet was coming or see what my other parking options were. I called the front desk FOUR TIMES! (My wife also tried calling while I circled the block!) Each time, the phone rang, and rang, and rang some more, and nobody answered! Unacceptable! We did finally find parking in a garage adjacent to the hotel, but c'mon, a 4-star hotel and the front desk can't be bothered to answer the phone for 10-15 minutes while I sat like a fool at the valet stand and circled the block four times in an unfamiliar city. Hilariously enough, later that evening, my wife and I spent ten minutes outside the valet stand while waiting for a Lyft ride, and while doing so, we spent our time informing other guests that valet was discontinued, as several guests also were unsuccessfully waiting on valet and trying to reach the inattentive front desk staff by phone. (We talked to at least 6-7 drivers, some of whom already had unloaded luggage to the curb!) Our bathroom, while spacious, was less functional than the ones at the Motel 6 I crash at in suburban Ohio each December as part of a work reunion tradition.  The shower had almost no water pressure. The water poured full force out of the tub faucet and hardly any came out of the shower head. (Yes, I know how to operate a shower, it was not a user error!) There was no shampoo in the shower for me. (My wife brought her own). The sink ""hot"" water was basically boiling and the cold tap wasn't working. We had to brush our teeth, shave, and wash our face without cold water. (Spoiler alert: Nobody answered the phone to address our concern!) Speaking of our bathroom and staff not answering the phone, nobody answered to assist us when my wife ran out of toilet paper and she had to use tissues. I went down to the front desk to speak with the alleged ""manager."" He was rude, arrogant, and condescending. He offered no apology for not answering the phone, tried to make me feel like I am an idiot for not digging deep into their website to find info about valet, and became argumentative with me about my other issues.  He made no note of nor addressed any of my valid concerns. (After dismissing each of my concerns one-by-one, he just shrugged and said ""Yeah, what else?"")  After he was of ZERO assistance to correcting our bathroom issues, no apology for not answering the phone, and being incredibly condescending, I asked if there was ANYONE else I could talk to. He said there was not. I asked who was above him. ""Nobody, I'm the manager!""  He is NOT the manager. (Possibly a shift manager? But I called Marriott to complain about my stay and the clerk's rudeness and they confirmed he is not the head/general manager of the hotel. There IS somebody above him, he just lied and refused to elevate my concerns to a more senior staff member or provide me with access to contact her.) In the spirit of fairness and full disclosure, he did offer me 5,000 rewards points IF I signed up for a loyalty program while giving out all of my personal information to him at the front desk in front of other guests. (I later found an email from Marriott -- Westin parent company -- offering me 2,500 points just for signing up! What a joke!)  I asked what exactly ""5,000 points"" meant. He told me 20,000 would get me a free stay at that property and failed to explain how one acquired more points. (Also a lie! 35,000 points is needed, according to the hotel's website.) I typically travel only for work for hotel stays or Air BNB for personal trips, so loyalty points at a hotel don't do a whole lot for me, especially when I would have been only 1/7 of the way to a free night and have to spend an additional $3,000 at Marriott properties to earn a free night there! We would have switched rooms had someone answered the phone and provided assistance, but by the time this NON-MANAGER was done making me feel like an idiot and an undervalued guest, we had already showered (in minimal shower pressure), got ready, and had to leave to make our dinner reservation on time and we didn't want to pack up our things and move at 11:00 PM upon return. The alleged ""manager"" said he couldn't even consider adjusting the room rate because I booked through a third party. I called the third party (who has the only customer service agent sympathetic to my concerns). The representative told me that there is ABSOLUTELY something the hotel CAN do about a rate for rooms booked through them by giving an exception to said third party that allows them to issue me a partial refund/full refund/credit. The third party called the hotel to discuss this possibility and advocate on my behalf. But....You'll never believe this! Nobody answered the phone! They opened a case for me (as did Marriott customer service when I called them), but it's been a full week now and neither the hotel, Marriott, nor third party has reached out to me.) While perhaps out of the hotel's control and not actually part of my complaints, we were on the 18th floor and put in the last room at the absolute end of the long hallway and had a lame view of the hotel wall and an alley way. (I had read reviews about the hotel with guests raving about the great city views.) We were near a staff door that we could hear opening and closing and hear staff chatting in the evening. (Again, not the end of the world, but compiled with everything else, it was irritating.) Minor things do go wrong, but coupled with everything else, it was also irritating that at least one power outlet didn't work (closest to the bed and most convenient for my wife's hairdryer; and where I would hook up my CPAP, which I now couldn't do, and got a terrible night's sleep as a result, despite an incredibly comfortable bed). Oh, our ice bucket had a leak in it, too. This was our wedding anniversary weekend, and because my wife had been dying to try a restaurant near the hotel, off to Detroit we went! We drove from Canton, OH (3.5 hours) My wife wanted to stay at a 2.5 star hotel in a less-desirable location for a lesser price, but I insisted that we stay in this alleged 4-star hotel.

Checkin was great, room was ready and I was told they would bring up a roll around bed for my 8year old son. Room was clean and spacious, however bed for my son was never brought up as promised. We asked 4times throughout the stay. By the time the wedding was over and we were ready for bed and the night shift was on duty, we were upset and tired that the bed was not brought up. We expressed that to the night manager and he said we were not getting one. No apology, no service, no explanation. The lack of communication and problem solving skills of the night manager was appalling. All management should be sent to leadership classes to be able to communicate effectively. Also, there is no assistance with your luggage.…",1

The first room we were given smelled of (pet?) urine. We tried to discretely let the man at the front desk know about the smell, but he pretended that he couldn’t hear us, so we were forced to speak up so the other guests checking in were made to overhear our problem with the room. The same man gives us a different room directly above the room with the urine odor (829 then 929). Both rooms were situated at the far end of a hallway right next to a room labeled “housekeeping”. At this point we are feeling discriminated against, because why put someone directly above a room with a known odor issue?

I was able to book a couple nights for a reasonable price that didn't break the bank. The entire hotel was very clean and within walking distance to Comerica Park and Ford Field. It was also within walking distance to the water front and was very safe around the area. The staff was very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, the only parking available is valet which is a little on the expensive side, so you have to factor that into the price of your stay.

I called customer service of the 3rd party and was told Westin had sent them an email just a few hours earlier cancelling our reservation. THE MORNING OF!!!!

When we checked out, I asked for a hard copy receipt and the front desk clerk told me since I already paid for the room I would receive an email copy.  When I got home, I had an alert from my credit card company that the hotel charged me for the room on the credit card I used for the incidental charge.  The room had already been paid for and when I contacted the hotel directly,  I was immediately brushed off and was not treated fairly.

Check-in was horrendous, and finally after the 6th room, I had a room to stay in.  The first was occupied by someone else, the second the key wouldn't work and they moved me again (presumably because that was occupied by someone as well), the third was the wrong room type...I think that says enough.  Finally when I did get into the room, the safe was broken, with sharp edges that would cut you if you tried to open.  The remote control for the TV wouldn't work and all I could watch was the hotel preview channel for 45 minutes, until someone came (and yes I checked for buttons on the TV).  Complete mess from start to finish, I would expect more from this place.   Definitely the last time I stay here.",1

I can look past all of those things but I am absolutely horrified by my experience in the spa. I booked a deluxe spa pedicure to be able to relax and enjoy my stay on a Saturday morning. To say the spa is beyond disgusting and dilapidated is to say the least. I will let the photos do most of the talking. It also should be noted that could not get comfortable having a pedicure in an office chair with my feet in a bowl. I let the pedicure dry for 6 hours before putting on shoes and it still got completely ruined which points to old goop old polish.

Bed linen needs replacing. Of the furniture and decor in rooms and public spaces that isn't showing wear-and-tear, the design is tired. The design and color scheme looks very 2005-2006 ish. This is not what you expect for a Westin based on the new Westins today nor frankly what you expect considering the elegant architecture of the hotel's exterior.

The rooms are a nice size and the showers are clean. The price seems to go up pretty high at times but when at the normal cost this could be a nice place to stay.  ,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great location in downtown Detroit,"I've been to Detroit a few times over the past couple of years always staying at a different hotel. This one is by far my favorite. The rooms are spacious and the location is great for going out downtown. The service was just okay (valet team was slow to bring my bags up and then delivered them to the wrong room!) but otherwise, it was an enjoyable stay for a weekend wedding.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Elegantly Restored Historical Hotel,"Our room was beautiful - large sitting area with a TV & large bedroom area with another TV. The bed & bedding were very comfortable. The room had a refrigerator, safe & coffee maker - offering Starbuck's coffee & tea. The bathroom was spacious - with a large modern shower & a separate bath tub. My only disappointment was that there was only one robe included. It was so soft and comfortable that it would've been nice for both of us to experience the special treat.  The hotel is conveniently located, within walking distance to Comerica Park & Ford Field. The area has a good vibe - like it's going through a rebirth. Lots of trendy restaurants & bars. We were pleasantly surprised as it seems to be very clean & safe.  The check in process was quick & pleasant. We would definitely…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Fantastic hotel!  ,"I stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac for a conference at the Federal Courthouse across the street!  The room and location were great, staff was super friendly and helpful, room service was fantastic...the only reason it was not 5 star was the television situation was not great.  I had a giant tv, but very few channels actually worked so that was a little disappointing.  I had room service in two occasions and it was fantastic!!!  Look forward to visiting again!",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great time,The hotel was very clean. The staff was friendly. Top notch customer service by associates and management.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,One of my favorites in Detroit!,"I stayed at the Westin for a business trip. I've stayed there before, and I was happy to come back. I arrived in the morning, and my room wasn't ready, so I had breakfast the hotel's restaurant. My meal was delicious, and the waitstaff at the restaurant were super friendly. After breakfast, I got some work done in the lobby for a while. The lobby is great, because it has amply seating -- and plugs for all your electronics.   When my room was ready, I got my key, but when I went to the room, the key didn't work. It turns out, they wrote the wrong number on my little key card sleeve. Sorry to the person who might have been wondering who was trying to break into their room... After a trip back to the front desk, I got a working key. After a long day, this was a bit of a hassle, but…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Great Hotel, Location and Service","We had an enjoyable weekend stay, and was given an elite member upgrade to a very nice suite (thanks Susan!).  The hotel has a very nice old charm feel, and renovated with modern comfort. The Club lounge has the usual offerings for Elite members (breakfast, evening canapes/dessert, drinks, coffee, fruit, snack). We found the staff very friendly.  The hotel is centrally located within walking distance to the main Woodward Ave, and most of the attractions. We walked to watch a show at the Fox Theater on Sat night, which is located opposite the Comerica Park.   If you do not want to use valet parking, there is plenty of street parking outside the hotel along Washington Blvd, cost is $1 per hour (max 4 hr), and free after 10pm on Sat night and free all day Sunday.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice hotel...will return!,"My son, his two friends, and I have stayed at The Westin Cadillac twice within the past 3 years; we attended The Red Wings game both times.  Prior to our arrival, I called the hotel to inquire about private airport transportation. The young lady recommended Robert from 'frontline313 transportation'; she said Robert is based at The Westin hotel. I called and spoke to Robert--who is a true professional and reserved our airport transfers. Robert not only provided excellent transportation, he also became our trusted guide. Highly recommend using Robert for your transportation needs if staying at The Westin Cadillac.  Front desk was friendly, rooms were comfortable and clean. There was a large stain on one of the bed sheets but housekeeping apologized and quickly replaced it.…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Historic Building,"Room was huge, layout of the desk, beds and dressers offered a lot of space to skip around. The only drawback was the noise from outside. Guess this type of older building is not that sound proof. There was huge outdoor event close by the hotel which went quite late into the night. I was able to hear singers singing till the end. Curtains were thick but not able to cut out the noise. However, breakfast at the Boulevard Restaurant was very good. Both in service and the quality of the food. I had a very yummy egg white omelette. Also, the pizza at the Bar is exceptionally tasty. 8 slices for $15, what a steal.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Historic hotel in downtown Detroit,"I stayed for five nights in May. I paid £522 for room only through Priceline which advertises mystery hotels. This was one of those and room was allocation on arrival. So the rate was much reduced.  I was visiting Detroit for the Movement music festival so I needed a central hotel that was comfortable.The Westin fitted the bill perfectly.  A lot of DJ's were staying over the weekend and they had their own artists check in. So I shared the lift on a few occasions with DJ's playing at Movementl which was great fun trying not to behave startstruck.  Although the building is old it's been refurbished recently. As a result you get a very large room by modern standards but a little lacking in character.  No real complaints with the room. Plenty of storage, powerful shower, smart TV…",4

We had probably the best wedding meal I've ever tasted with salmon and petit Filet...both wonderful.  Very special tablecloths, raised bridal table, really nice and large dance floor, special chairs...all nice additions to a ""standard"" ballroom that was anything BUT standard.  Service was good.  So many side rooms and areas for cocktail hour, dressing rooms, ceremony, etc.  Lovely facility.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Lovely and Posh Hotel,"The bed was amazing, a California King. The room was a suite style room, with two large TVs and chairs.  The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub.   The hotel is walking distance from the little Cesars arena where we were able to see a concert.  An urber ride is $6-7 dollars.   Late checkout is available is you request it.   The service was impeccable and the Lounge area had a lovely vibe. Would definitely stay there again.",5

Anyhow that was day 1. Day 2 valet stated my key fob was dead so they couldn’t unlock my door, which is fine accidents do occur what wasn’t fine was getting the run around they had to order a locks Smith that took just about 3 hours to get there REALLY but told me every 10 mins it will be 10mins as if I had nothin better to do but waist 3 hours like I could of totally utilized those hours…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Fine Hotel,"This is an excellent choice for a downtown Detroit hotel, and it is within walking distance of Comerica Park, Ford Field and Little Caesar’s Arena. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, and the public areas are nice. Service is somewhat inconsistent, and fairly long waits for the valet are common.  On balance, though, this remains a fine downtown option.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,The Cadillac of Hotels,"I was pleasantly surprised by Detroit in general, and I'd say that this hotel is a big part of why I enjoyed my stay so much. Elegantly appointed rooms and common areas, perfect thermostat in the room, and a friendly and professional staff--what more could one ask for! The food in 24Grille and Roast were OUTSTANDING. Usually, even in the finest hotels, the food from the restaurants is just okay. The food here was good period. I ate four times in the hotel during my 3-night, 3.5-day stay. I also appreciated that there was a Starbucks in the lobby that opened at 6 AM--I had long days that started early and it was nice to know I wouldn't have to start my days without coffee and a little bite to eat. I normally don't deal with gift shops but I had to go get some toothpaste...can I…",4

We got an unexpected upgrade to the 23rd floor.  where we enjoyed delicious complimentary breakfast with a nice selection. This was particularly helpful since downtown Detroit isn’t the easiest place to find a bite to eat. Staff members in the lounge were delightful. We had a room with two double (not queen) beds. Reception desk generously offered and had a rollaway bed delivered, and then the kids didn’t have to share beds. Room was surprisingly large which was nice when everyone was getting ready. In addition to the beds, room had two comfy chairs and a desk. We had a very nice stay. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Motor City Gem,"Trailfinders booked us in here as the first stop on our American tour,we are so pleased they did! Firstly the building is a lovely older property which oozes class right in the middle of Detroit. We could safely walk to shops, restaurants, pubs and even the Detroit Tigers baseball stadium.Staff in the hotel were absolutely fantastic, the check in people especially just couldn't have been more helpful. Our room was on the 23rd floor which gave us free access to a private lounge offering free breakfast and evening nibbles. It looked to us that Detroit is on the up and if like us you are of an age where Tamla Motown means so much then it is well worth a visit. Thank you Westin and Detroit for making the start to our adventure so memorable.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,This place smells SO good. ,"Great hotel with friendly service and oh my, it smells so good. They offer little extras like lavender oil next to the bed and workout clothes that can be delivered to your room (although I didn’t use that service, I brought my own). They have a really nice fitness room with good treadmills. Check in and out was super easy. Detroit is a surprisingly nice city that I would return to and I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Wonderful Staff!,"We were in town for a film festival and our accommodations were provided for us here. The room was very spacious and looked to be fairly recently renovated. The King bed was very comfy and the amenities were great. The problem was the bathroom sink smelled like mildew. which would make the whole room smell like mildew if we didn't keep the drain closed. We told the desk at check out & they were very apologetic & said they would have moved us to another room, had we let them know. We were only there 3 days & by the time we problem solved it wasn't worth moving our room. The staff is stellar and Stephanie, our maid was awesome. She was so positive and friendly every day, so refreshing! A great stay.",4

This hotel location, room, amenities and service were all top notch. I highly recommend this place. The lounge is great and have great ppl work there. The front desk staff were nice and very helpful.   You would not regret it if you stay here. These guys changed some of my negative feeling about Marriott properties after a Boston stay the week before.   ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Pricey but very nice downtown hotel-beware large homeless presence however.,"Expensive, but very nice downtown hotel.  Large, comfortable and modern rooms.  Exercise room was kind of disappointing in terms of size and weightlifting equipment. One word of caution however.  Though located in a nice part of downtown, taking a walk even during the daytime you can expect to be harassed multiple times by homeless crazies.  Not only are there more of these denziens everywhere compared to other large urban centers, there is ZERO police presence on the streets or even on patrol.  It made exploring the City almost impossible.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Exceptional,"The location of this gorgeous hotel was in walking distance for us to Greektown casino. Walked there, taxi back at night.

I arrive at the hotel at 2:30 PM and I'm being told they are overbooked and I now have to stay at a hotel by the airport over 30 minutes away. If I would have known before today I could have made other arrangements and stayed at a hotel with better customer service, but no I wasn't told until all the rooms in downtown Detroit were completely booked. This is not how you treat a loyal BonVoy customer that stays in Marriott, Westin and Ritz properties multiple times a year. I will be taking my business elsewhere for future trips",1

Overall, the hotel is a beautiful and well run facility, It is simply amazing what they have been able to do with the restoration of this Detroit landmark. My room was fantastic! It was quite large, with both spacious sleeping areas and a huge bathroom. The staff provided excellent service at every interaction. The also do an outstanding job managing large events. We were one of several groups running events in the hotel, but they seemed to handle it flawlessly. The location is also unbeatable. It's an easy walk to anyplace you could want to go downtown. I highly recommend it!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Years ago was great.,"This has been my go to hotel in Detroit since they opened.  Lately though the room rate has been rising and service going down. On my most recent stay, the phone in the room kept making weird noises. Not a charging issue, or voicemail, etc. only solution was to yank it from wall (on advise from hotel operator). Also TV remote did not function, just said service not available. On the plus side, bartender was great, although drink prices are ridiculous. Room was clean. Shower was a tub with curtain, not glass enclosed as I would expect fro most higher end hotels. As a Bonvoy elite, I was not offered an upgrade. I’ve been staying here 4-5 times a year for 10 years, But now think the new Element nearby is much, much nicer.",3

However, the immediate area outside of the hotel may feel slightly more ""dingy"" than other (busier) areas of downtown; I, personally, have never had any issues though.

I was extremely pleased with my room. It was updated and clean. It was a very nice setup. The hotel staff was very friendly. We ate breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel on the 2nd floor and it was very good. It was 48 bucks for 2 people, which was expensive for breakfast, but the food was great. The food that we had at our event that night was really good as well. I would recommend this hotel to anybody staying in downtown. Very pleased.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Very good, not cheap",Nice large rooms where are not over fussy and everything works fine.

Pricing is a bit over the top but I was at an event in the hotel,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Girls Night Out,"The hotel was in a great location. Parking was difficult so its helps to valet. The floors are secure and only accessible via key card. It is clean and has up to date modern decor. 1st room was in location with building view and had a small mildew smell. We were relocated to a city view which had more natural light and a better smell. The pool was nice and hot tub as well. We went to the Spa it was nice, very small locker room, and a lot of noise from the nearby restaurant.The missus was excellent aside from the noise. Later found out that the Spa is a seperate business entity. Over great stay and uber was cheap to Fish Bone and Greek Town Casino.",4

To slip into a warm, comfortable, relaxing bed and fall quickly to sleep.  That is the Heavenly bed.",5

Walked from hotel to Comerica Park for Tigers game, Fox Theater and tour of downtown architecture.  Having been in Detroit several times, it is very nice to see the transformation.  We even walked to shopping on Woodward (Nike, Under Armour, Moosejaw, Shinola, etc).  Restaurants at hotel appeared nice but pricier then we wanted with kids in tow.  Found a lot of options in walking distance.  Starbucks in lobby was nice.  Valet was convenient (a little pricy).  Check in very easy.  All made for a great long weekend.",5

Great black out curtains. The bathroom had a great shower, nice towels etc.  The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of 5 is I really don’t think it is worth the advertised price on the website (300-400/night). We got a great deal through a third party website. I wouldn’t have paid 400, it is a nice hotel, beautiful lobby with decent amenities but the room was nothing extravagant. The room we stayed in was clean but there were stains on both the floor…",4

Room was cold and took forever to warm up.  Carpet worn and tired.  Shower was look warm at best.  Movies/television kept going out - said it was weather satellite problem.  Room service food was not good - medium burger fried to a crisp and $100 pancake breakfast the next morning inedible.  We stayed there a decade ago and couldn't have been happier.  Terrible value.

Service was slow at times and nonexistent at other times. That being said, it was pretty expensive. We also paid ahead of time through a third party site and then were charged an additional daily fee upon arrival. We were disappointed to see that free wifi was only available to certain Marriott members. ",3

Room was large and well laid out but some torn carpet and smelled faintly like cat pee.

The bed was comfortable, I had a refrigerator, the closet was large, and functional desk. However, the TV had problems getting a signal (staff told me to reboot it) most of the time, but eventually came on. The room was large but only had a chair. There was plenty of room for a couch that would have been comfortable. The shower was just OK. The head dropped water on my head, but did not direct water at me. Overall, the room was very good, but could have been better for the money. One highlight was sticky bread French toast in the restaurant (but very expensive).",4

Fast forward to when I arrive. I am platinum so I went to the elite line for check in, where one of the desk agents notified me in a rather judgement tone that I had to go over to the other desk to checkin. Now I understand I am young for a platinum premier (or titanium, whatever its called now), but I wasn't a big fan of the stereotyping.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Good stay - nothing stood out however,"This is one of those reviews that are tough to write because while there is nothing that was wrong with the stay, there’s nothing to rave about either. The room was a good size, bathroom adequate and staff pleasant . Location is an easy walk to Little Caesars Arena or Comerica Park. The area seems to be under a revival with lots of building in the area. Perhaps the only real criticism would be that the doors bang rather loudly so hopefully you don’t have early risers or late returns around you. I found the bar area set up rather odd - more like a living room with no tables. Hard to find seating when there is a large group in the hotel. The 24 Grill is located in the hotel which was mediocre but Roast also in the hotel was amazing (expensive but delicious). There is a Starbucks…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nicely refurbished comfortable hotel,"I thought this was a nice hotel.  It has a convenient location in downtown Detroit. They did not a nice job refurbishing the building so that it feels modern, while still retaining a number of historic features.  Our room had a great view looking west, including the bridge to Canada.  The hotel is very big, so at times it has a little of a convention hotel feel to it.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but certainly not an intimate hotel.  On the other hand, it is very convenient to have a number of dining options in the building.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Good stay in downtown Detroit,"We stayed here in March 2016, so this is a belated review.  We chose this hotel because we wanted a central location in Detroit in a safe area with secure parking. The hotel location is convenient, and the parking service was efficient.

It has been rehabilitated after falling into disrepair like much of Detroit.  Large rooms.  Clean.  Room layout does not allow you to watch the TV from the desk.  There is only one chair tucked into a corner all the way across the room from the TV.  19th Floor gave a good view of Ford Field, but a view toward the river would have been preferred.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Nice hotel, excellent rooms!",I spent a few nights at the Westin Book Cadillac during a recent business trip.  Registration was smooth and very friendly in the second floor lobby.  My room was very large and well appointed.  Tons of outlets in all the right places or charging my devices or working at the desk.  The bathroom was a spacious as the room with a great shower with a rain head and spray wand.  The ground floor bar had a good vibe.  Good wifi throughout the property.  I stayed on a high floor and far from the elevator so it was nice and quiet for sleeping.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Good choice for downtown,"Heart of downtown Detroit, very accessible to the surprisingly vibrant scene that has emerged.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Symphonic Experience,"We stayed here recently for 2 nights and enjoyed every second of it. Check in Saturday was a bit lengthy but we were happy to see so many people staying at the hotel. Our room was on the Club Level, corner room, beautiful view of the city, a plenty of room for the 2 of us to roam, relax and spend time with our small dog. Yes, our dog was welcomed here!  The bed was heavenly and I enjoyed the soft robe. We had drinks and appetizers in the 24 Grille Saturday afternoon and our bartender, Matt, was extraordinary. The food was just right and the drinks were mixed perfectly.  We stopped in the gift shop and had a lovely conversation with (I believe) Nicole. What a great ambassador to the hotel and city of Detroit! Sunday morning we took a nice long walk around the immediate area and…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Simply great!,"This is a great hotel. Very classic and comfortable. I stayed in the 18th floor and the view out the window was the GM building. During my stay, GM announced their 15% personnel reduction so it was quite an experience. Everything is ""walkable"" from here.  There is a Starbucks in the first floor and the place is very open. The service is great and meeting rooms are very well equipped.   The room was comfortable, but it did have one drawback. The TV was away from the working desk so watching the news while on the laptop was a bit difficult. The bathroom was big and well equipped as well.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,4.5/5 experience,"Pros: - Club lounge is awesome. I had breakfast and dinner there and the service was great. Good space with a nice view. - Upgraded room with a nice view. Very spacious. Bathroom was nice. - Pleasant staff all along the way (valet, check in, club lounge).  Cons:  - Detroit is cold in the winter. This is a fact of life. I cranked the heat in my room but there were a lot of windows (which is good) but it still felt cold at times. I think it's just a function of insulation not being thick enough to keep heat from getting out, but I am more prone to being cold than most. - Carpet in my room needed cleaning or replacing.  Will definitely return if I am ever in Detroit again.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Loved our stay,"Loved the stay. Very friendly staff. Big room Excellent bed, loved the bed, nice and big. And had a good Bathroom.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Best Bar Service Ever!,"I was in Detroit for a family wedding. Some friends and I went to the Motor Bar for one cocktail before heading out for the evening (night before the wedding). Let me say that the one cocktail turned into a full night of fun just staying right there at the Motor Bar. And this was completely because of the phenomenal service we received from the bartender, Dave. First off, he makes the best old-fashioned I have ever had. But more importantly, he is just the friendliest and coolest bartender I think I’ve ever had wait on me.  He is super professional, but down to earth at the same time. Honestly, I feel like I made a new friend! 😊 I will always stop in to see if he’s working when I’m in town.  Also of note, the atmosphere at the Motor Bar is so classic and chic. Love it!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"iconic hotel, in the past","We had high expectations for this place but it's now like any standard midrange business hotel with little personality.  Our room was fine and clean.  Location was very god.   Overall it seemed overpriced for what it was and we were disappointed.  We had a few problems while we were there- one is that the workers went on strike while we in the middle of our trip, and they did not seem prepared for this (not to mention it raised serious questions about how they were paying their staff).  In addition there was an extremely loud party on our floor that kept us up all night and the staff did not intervene to quiet them, nor did they offer to move us to another room.",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great rebirth of a fine classic hotel,"This was our second stay at the Book Cadillac. Westin must be congratulated on a great renovation of a fine old building. Our room was almost perfect (the washbasin plug didn’t work) and the wi-fi worked well. Service at the front desk was very pleasant. The breakfast menu was very interesting but only à-la-carte, which made it extraordinarily expensive.  We used the valet parking for convenience, which was very expensive. You are strongly urged not to park independently because the entire area where you might unload your bags was occupied by the valet parking. There was an enormous wedding (or maybe more than one) happening when we were there and the hotel seemed to take it in its stride and there was no noticeable disruption for other hotel guests. Our room was exceptionally…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Nice Hotel, Great Location","This is a large, well appointed hotel in the heart of Detroit’s revitalized Downtown.  The rooms are comfortable and spacious, and the restaurants and bars are quite good. Indeed Roast, a steak house, is a terrific place for dinner.  Service is friendly, although the hotel always seems to be somewhat understaffed.  We have stayed at the Book Cadillac several times per year for the past 4 or 5 years: It is ideal for those traveling to a Lions, Tigers, Red Wings or Pistons game. We will be back in 2019. ",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Check In is always a wait,Each time we have stayed the hotel is beautiful but the check in line always seems to be a mile long. Does not make a good first impression. The rooms are wonderful once you get there! Roast is a delicious restaurant in the lobby.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Underwhelmed,"The building itself is amazing. For me, I wanted to stay here my entire life. It closed in the 80s before I had the chance and I really thought it was headed for implosion. I tip my hat to the investors and city officials that saved this wonderful piece of history and architecture. If you look at what the state of the hotel was in 2008, you can be nothing but amazed that as much of the original interior was preserved in the renovation. In the Motor Bar in particular, you can see the handcrafting of the ceiling and pillars. The rooms are nice and the bedding is wonderful, maintaining Westin's reputation in that regard. Where the Book Cadillac falls short is with the staff. When one drops $400 a night for a room, exceptional service is to be expected, here it is, for the most part…",3

Housekeeping and executive club staff incredibly nice and gracious. Attended to every request. And genuinely nice ladies. Thanks!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Beware of strike,Hugely disappointing visit to hotel. Noise from 7am to 8pm due to strike action.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,A Detroit Gem,"My family and I stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac for one evening as we attended a wedding in the area. We were welcomed immediately by the valet team as we drove up to the entrance. They were also very helpful in directing us as it was our first visit to the hotel. As we walked through the revolving doors, there were more employees waiting to greet us and guide us in. The check in process was seamless and the front desk personnel was very helpful.  We stayed in a traditional king room which did not at all have a nice view but that didn’t matter much. The room itself was pretty nice however I was shocked that it didn’t have a full length mirror (especially with the money that was being spent).   The hotel bar, 24 Grill, is a must visit... we actually went there before the…",5

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Beware of protesters on strike!,"I was there recently to attend a concert at Ford Field.  When we got there we were surprised to see protesters at the entrance.  They were yelling into mega phones, and had large bass drums.  They terrified the children that were with us, and confronted us about supporting the hotel.  The venue is beautiful, and staff is great, but this is a big disturbance.  They quit for the night at 8, but were back at 7am and woke everyone up.  Before you book, I'd call and ask if the protest is done.  According to staff it's been going on for a month.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Unfortunate Circumstances,"First off, this is a very nice historic hotel. It was renovated about 10 years ago. It is strategically placed for sightseeing in Detroit. It is near the q line station for transportation around the city and it is within walking distance of The Little Caesars Arena. We would generally pick a less expensive hotel but thought we would treat ourselves.  As we arrived at the main entrance, we noted that there were picketers marching and beating drums in front of the hotel. The noise could be heard throughout the hotel. This may or may not be out of the hotel control but it was certainly a negative for us.  Also, there are no good parking options other than valet which was $35.00 per night. All in all, I would recommend this hotel but make sure the strike is settled before you go! I…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Noisy and horrible hospitality,Had the worst time at this hotel when I came to stay for a night for a family wedding. I was at first going to stay at a less expensive hotel but heard this hotel was so nice I had to stay here. First off there are protestors outside and they are banging on drums and whistles all day. Also in the morning I was woken up by a marathon outside at 6am. I understand that is not in their control but they didn’t seem apologetic or accommodating about the situation. Not only that but valet was horrible literally waited 40 minutes to get my car. And the bell boy who brought my luggage down took maybe 20 minutes to come down to give me my luggage and was pretty rude about it too. I will never stay at this hotel again and feel as though I should be refunded my money because this stay was…,1
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Destination disappointment ,I had a friend from Philly flying in for a couple of nights.  She lived in Michigan during our college years a couple decades ago and I was eager to show off a much improved downtown Detroit.  I reserved a room at the Westin Book Cadillac hoping for a first-rate experience.  The hotel did not meet normal Westin standards.  The valet was very good and the lobby was beautiful.  However the service was underwhelming.  The front desk person was on his phone.  The hallway to the room was dingy.  The room was large but there was one small chair for the “seating” area.  We left to tour around the city for the day and when we returned the room was not serviced.  I called to request service and the front desk person told me they only service rooms every 3 days.  What?  She reluctantly…,3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great hotel within easy walking distance of sights,"Spent one night here before flying home.  The hotel is in a vintage building downtown with easy walking distance to restaurants, pharmacies, and touristy stops (like the Spirit of Detroit, Joe Louis' fist, and the waterfront facing Windsor).     My room was well appointed with a very comfortable king bed, a chaise, desk, and large, flat screen television.  The Club Lounge was stocked well with refreshments and an assortment of warm and cold items for breakfast.  The gym was very nice with many treadmills and about 8 fitness machines.  Overall, I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,I used to love this place,"We live an hour outside of Detroit and usually stay at the Westin for concerts and Lions games. Yesterday we spent the night for a concert. We pulled up to Valet and there were several, loud, in your face picketers yelling at us as we walked in the front door. (There is a hotel worker labor strike) We checked in and the guy said he would put us on a high floor so we wouldn’t hear the noise. At 6am people with loudspeakers and drums yelled all around the hotel “time to get up”...the banging continued. Since housekeeping was part of the strike, the room wasn’t up to par. There were no robes. The furniture was dusty. Stay away from this place until the strike is settled. Until it is we will use other hotels such as Aloft.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Family Wedding,"While the hotel is beautiful, we had a less than satisfactory visit. There was a strike going on with a megaphone and drums that was allowed to continue on into the late hours of the night and resumed before the sun came up. Although several people in our large booking complained nothing was done to compensate our complaints. Management finally called the police the morning we were checking out. This is a very pricey place to stay and then they have the nerve to charge for parking and internet. They will never see us again",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice visit on recent trip,"Stayed three nights. Easy to get to from airport.  Like others, we stayed during strike, but hotel staff worked hard to guide us in and out (even using an alternative entrance) past the protesters.  Remodeled with modern touches; service at front desk was excellent (manager came out when line was long and guided people along). Food in downstairs bar was pretty good; service there was also good. I graded lower as room carpet was somewhat worn and room was only moderately well lighted. Lots of history at this place, convenient to downtown locations, including sports venues.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,They On Strike. Pay Your Workers.,"Unfortunately, with late notice I had to cross the picket line and stay here. Tried to switch to Aloft which was booked full. My co-worker had to switch rooms twice because the first two they gave her weren't clean. The second was maybe occupied by another person - TV was on, towels on floor, food plates on bed. I guess there's no way to know when a hotel will be on strike, but you hear the workers horns and drumming all night long. Pay the people Westin. They work hard for the money, so you better treat them right.",1
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Waste Of Money!,Workers On Strike. Upon entering & leaving the hotel we were Yelled & Cursed at. It was so embarrassing we almost skipped our Dinner reservations.The strikers also Beat drums all Night. Our pillows were dirty & bath tub stopped up. Calls to the front desk was Unanswered. I requested a refund & was told no. Will not stay here again & I do not recommend staying here.,1
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Be Aware- 98% of Employees on Strike,"I struggled to give this place a low rating but based on our last couple days there I unfortunately have to.  Our weekend started out great on Friday, early check in, great room overlooking the river on the Club Floor and great service from the staff.  This hotel is in a great location and as we came in for the Lions game it was well situated.    Sunday morning at 4am we were awoken by loud drumming coming from the street.  We were on the 23rd floor and could still hear drumming and chanting from what we found out was the 98% of employees that had gone on strike.   This continued throughout the day and into the evening, starting up again the following morning at 4am.  With the employees on strike they mainly have the management working the jobs onsite but have cut back a lot of…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,In the midst of a strike.,"When we checked in, we were offered the "" green option"" which meant our room would be cleaned  once every three days.  I travel a lot, and am very familiar with environmental sensitivity involving towels, sheets etc  Not a problem.  But it was clear this was about hiring fewer housekeepers.  This was confirmed when the hotel workers went on strike.  They earn less than  in other  comparable hotels.  We were placed on the ""green option"", with overflowing trash cans, unmade beds, etc.  Managers from other Westins were doing their best in unfamiliar jobs.  I would not go there until they iron out their labor issues.  It was unpleasant crossing a picket line and staying in a depressing dirty room.  There are lots of other hotels in Detroit!!!!",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Damaged car,My family stayed there this past weekend. When the valet delivered our car I noticed that there were stains running down the driver side door. It appears as if something had dripped in two places that then left streaks down the door. We had no opportunity to discuss this with the valet as an employee strike was going on all around us and we were directed to move our car along as fast as we could load our bags. I had a 6 hour drive home and tried to wash it off then but no luck. It appears as if something caustic had been dripping on it. I'm afraid there is now paint damage. I contacted the hotel last night and was called back by security but was told that they likely would not honor the claim. I'm still waiting to hear from them again. Since we were there for a wedding I had…,3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Stay vacation ,"I enjoyed my stay at the Westin, love the way they renovated the old historic building. The express service was good and the room was very comfy. There are only a few things that was a little concerning which was that while relaxing before we hit the streets the tv was not working properly kept displaying “no signal”, I called express service and they explained the situation as a bad weather issue. The operator gave me some instructions to fix the problem but doing it every time the signal went out was really irritating so we just watched tv on our phones. This isn’t a 2 star hotel by no means and for the price a night compared to my stay at other hotels using the same cable provider with similar weather and a cheaper rate is unacceptable. The other issue I thought was…",4

I’ve even booked multiple meetings for my team at the hotel, so this is not a one-and-done experience.  Now for the current rating.  It is based upon the lack of follow up from both staff and management to resolve a simple billing issue of using a business credit card switching to a personal card.  When we checked in on August 30th, we had 2 rooms booked yet noticed it was billed to my corporate card.  At check-in, we were politely advised that no problem to switch charges to personal card.

Mattress was shot and worn out.  EVERY window in the room needed cleaning (Jeez--one would think there would be clean windows in the middle of summer, but they were so dirty you could not clearly see out of them--it's a high rise for gosh sakes in a city and want to see the view), the walls behind the drapes (once opened you saw) had either dried up blood or food on them--housekeeping clearly missed. Door to room next door slammed all night long. Other issues which I won't put here existed as well.

Just a note:  be sure to sign up for the free SPG/Marriott rewards program, so you can have free internet access.  Also, be aware there is a $35/day valet fee to park.  With my Hotwire rate of $113 for a Friday night in August, it was a bargain.  The hotel was a short walk to restaurants and convenience stores (that sell beer and wine!).  My husband and I shared a room, and my teenaged daughters shared a room.  We all agreed that our rooms were very quiet.",5

Our coffee maker was always stocked, the bed was super comfortable, and all in all, I would not hesitate to recommend the property. My only issues were with the valet. They were not very good. When we checked in there was no one to properly greet us. I think a head doorman is needed. One time I dropped off my car (a Camaro) and watched as the lone valet spent more time cutting up with two friends who were not in uniform than take care of my car.

Check-in is on the second floor, there was no obvious meet and greet from the entrance on the ground floor/street. After check-in, there was no bell-person in sight to help us with our cases. There were no signposts for breakfast in the hotel. The rooms were large and clean but with no character. The coffee machine leaked and coffee/tea had not been re-stocked properly. We were not able to log on to wifi, as it required sign up to SPG.  The location was central, but nowhere nearby to get breakfast (as far as we could see). Might be fine for business stop-over.

Great view of downtown and the river with complementary breakfast. The room was quite roomy. The bathroom could accommodate a bed in the large space. It had a large window in the bathroom that could be opened about 4 inches. That is important to me, which is why I prefer old hotels. We took advantage of the pool and it was great. Parking is by valet only, but it is efficient. There are several restaurants in the hotel. We ate filet mignon at Roast, which did not disappoint.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,If only I could see the skyline....,This hotel occupies an amazing historic building. The rooms are spacious and well appointed- but the windows are FILTHY. In a city undergoing a revitalization where all facades are being power washed— they need to get on board. Location to the football and baseball stadiums is great. A short walk or if the weather is bad you can take the tram for .75- the station is across the street.

Our room was very large and modern and the bathroom was as well. The drawbacks are really the service. First of all we drove up to the hotel and there were at least 10 valets standing around chatting and not one came over to us. We had to get out of the car and call them over. Second was that the cleaning service never came to our room, or any of our friends’ rooms who were there for the wedding. We all had went to a baseball game that afternoon and then needed to shower and get ready for the wedding which was at 6pm.

Their breakfast restaurant called The Blvd. cooked me a  a very healthy and very tasty scramble. The service was great. Location was excellent in downtown. The only negative was the horrendous mattress I slept in. It has a huge crater in it. Terrible for your back no matter who you are. It needed to be retired and replaced. I have found this to be a common thread in some of my Hilton Hotel stays,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Below Average Business Hotel,"Stayed two nights in a suite for business.  I have both Starwood and Hotels.com status but no one cared.  Reception was competent but not particularly warm or professional - it felt more like a retail transaction than a high-end hotel check-in.  Room was ok, I'd say it was remodeled around 5 years ago but it's pretty basic.  I ordered room service for breakfast, left at around 9am, and when I returned to my room at around 11pm the breakfast tray was still on the table and the room hadn't been cleaned (I did not have the do not disturb sign on).    I really love Detroit and I know there are a few new hotels coming on line in the next year, which is great because there are not enough rooms downtown.  I won't stay here again if I can avoid it and I hope the competition forces them…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice Hotel but.......,"I stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac for a business conference and was anticipating a lovely stay there.  I was disappointed to say the least.  The Westin was at full capacity.  When I arrived, at 1:30 pm, prior to check in, I did stop by the front desk to see if I could check in early.  I was told that at the moment they didn’t have any clean rooms but they would call me as soon as one became available.  I gave them my number, was told it would be around 30 minutes, which was fine with me.  Two hours later, I went to double check with the front desk, after I has seen multiple people arrive and check in.  They proceeded to check me in then search for my luggage which they stored for me.  Thirty minutes later, my luggage appeared.  The room was nice and spacious, with a huge…",2

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Wonderful  Weekend,"We enjoyed a wonderful stay here.  The accommodations were nice, but what really makes  this hotel shine is the staff.   Our stay required some special accommodations and some adjustments had to be made on arrival. This was taken care of by a staff that was patient, pleasant  and accommodating.  As a team they represented the essence of what hospitality should  be.    The first person you deal with when arriving to a hotel is a bellman. Imer, our bellman was a gem, making sure we were fully taken care of and satisfied.  The front desk and particularly Alex was very attentive to our special needs with multiple rooms and accommodations for young children, making sure that we would be comfortable.  Alex made sure  we were satisfied by showing us various room options to  be sure we…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Good option, crowds are a challenge","Traveled to attend a concert at the casino.  Stayed for one night at the Westin. Great location, beautiful exterior.  Lobby is on the 2nd floor, I personally prefer a first floor entry.  I arrived at 2:30pm, I had requested early check-in for noon,  My room was not available, the front indicated early check-in requests are not guaranteed.  They noted they were flipping the house and my room would also not be available by the normal check-in time.  So while the staff was cordial, my first contact was not a positive experience.  The room was clean, large, seemed to be an accessible room based on the configuration of the shower and the disposition of the closet.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Staycation at Westin Book Cadillac was heavenly!,"I stayed four nights at the Westin Book Cadillac while attending River Days concerts.  It was my first time at this Westin venue but it will not be my last.  From the first person I encountered at the Valet to the registration the Bellmen etc. I received prompt, courteous and competent attention.    My stay at this hotel was like ""Calgon took me away"". I took the People Mover everyday accept during an afternoon rain storm.  Very convenient location for attending any downtown event.   Full disclosure I added the three days to a one day reservation because of a fantastic HOTWIRE deal.",4

Plus points are having a Starbucks right at level 1, and wonderful interior of the rooms, which I will described in detail in the following paragraph. Negative points are the pricing can be high if you are at peak season and the shower facilities can be better.  The interior of the rooms are great with a nice high bed and comfortable settings. Extremely large LCD TV with lots of channels to watch. Sufficient space for a group of 2-3. The toilet is extremely large with nice setup except the shower facilities.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Valet is becoming an issue again and again,"We have been coming to the Westin ever since the rebirth of this terrific hotel, staying here about 5-6 times/year as it is also centrally located for concerts, stadiums or just hanging out in the D.  Over the past couple of years, the valet services has been challenging.  We’ve been stuck on Michigan Ave, patiently awaiting our turn as groups of “valet” individuals are huddled in a group, chatting amongst themselves, while the line grows, impacting traffic.  What’s more is that there are a number of cars parked, with valet, directly in front of hotel, creating only 1-2 spaces for folks to pull in for valet, creating an unnecessary wait and backup.  Going further, the wait time to pick up your car can be 30 minutes.  We have now had an issue EVERY SINGLE TIME over the past 2…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice Stay,"I recently stayed at the Westin in downtown Detroit. The Westin is a higher end hotel with great amenities. I love the bed, late check out policy, and the rain shower head. I also LOVE that you can rent workout gear.They also leave lavender oil to place on the sheets! The only downside was that the walls were thin. I could very clearly hear what was happening outside my room in the hallways. I must have been on a loud floor because I could hear everything! Overall, I really did love my stay.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice rooms,"The rooms are very spacious and the service was wonderful. The location is very close to a few great restaurants and the MGM casino as well. Make sure to eat at the coney island diner, as it's only a few steps away.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great Location,"I informed my teenage son that he should take note that he was in Detroit during its rebuilding. The Westin is fabulous. It is clean, safe, has friendly staff and is in an amazing location. There is plenty of parking, you can walk to so many areas of interest. It is close to the Q Line, which is very inexpensive transportation. There are also cycle rickshaws one can hire in the area. The hotel has everything one could ask for, including in-house restaurants, pool, whirlpool, fitness center, and shops. The shops have some amazing deals, which was a pleasant surprise. Not only do I recommend the Westin, but I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Best spot in the ciry,"My husband and I stayed here the night before we got married, and booked the room 3 hours before we arrived. Without telling them it was the night before, they upgraded our room, upgraded our WiFi, gave us 4 drink vouchers and free breakfast.   The rooms are cozy and large, and the suite has lots of space. Comfy beds, plush linens, and soft towels. Location is in the middle of downtown and great for walking around.   Will stay here again 100%",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great Downtown Location,"Check in was easy but note it is on the 2nd floor! My room was very, very spacious and super clean. Workspace was an okay size with enough electrical plugs. Wi-Fi was a good strong signal. The bed was very comfortable. The room was really quiet and I slept extremely soundly. Bathroom was a very good size and even had a robe if you wanted it. I parked next door for $20 per night - it was a floor above where the Hotel Valet parks you for $35 per night. It was a 24 hour manned location. Great stay - I would come back for sure.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice Detroit hotel,"Detroit is working hard on improving, and the Book Cadillac is a reflection of that. My husband and I stayed here for two nights. Our room was large and the bathroom was spacious. Everything in the room seemed modern and up-to-date. The front desk service was friendly. The bar is beautiful but expensive - we had drinks and an amazing dessert there. Good proximity to Fox Theater, Comerica Park, etc. I would definitely stay here again. It beats the Marriott in the RenCen for sure.",4

The staff is wonderful and the rooms are large and quiet. The conference was very well serviced by the banquet team and the food was quite good.  One quibble: business travelers like me often rely on hotel business centers for their computing needs. While this hotel mentions a business center on its website, it doesn't tell you that they charge $6.95 for 15 minutes of use of the ONE computer that isn't even in a room, but up against a lobby wall. I told a staff member that this was like charging me per lap to use the pool and she graciously cut me a key to the executive lounge, where I was able to complete an urgent project.   I realize that business centers are a courtesy and…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,A disappointing anniversary trip!,"Husband and I stayed at the Westin to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. We specifically chose the Westin because of its reputation for excellence and it’s location - right in downtown Detroit. As we were celebrating with a mini-getaway (we live up north), we wanted something a little nicer, a little grander - kind of a spoil ourselves kind of weekend. However, the Westin Book Cadillac did not live up to its reputation and we were greatly disappointed.   First of all, the hallway to our room was littered with room service trays that had been there long enough that the hall smelled like a tuna sandwich. We didn’t think much of that at first, but when the trays were still there when we returned back from dinner around 930pm (we originally spotted them at around 3pm) and…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Very nice hotel, not the greatest stay","The hotel is very nice, as well as the staff, which is the only reason this review isn't 2 stars. But I gotta say, for the price, I wouldn't stay there again.   I joined their reward program to get the free wifi but the wifi never worked! That goes for our broken coffee machine in the room too. But the most disappointing part of it was I had a constant backache my whole weekend (at a wedding) because the bed was by far the most uncomfortable bed I've ever slept in. Just overall not the quality I'd expect from such a classy hotel :(.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great historic downtown Detroit hotel,"We were very impressed with the Westin.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Loved it, but too many glitches for 5 stars","I really enjoyed a recent 3 day (some business/some tourism) stay at the Westin Book Cadillac.  Detroit greatly exceeded my expectations.  I've never spent any time in the Motor City and part of me expected a crime-ridden, arsonized Mad Max landscape.  Instead I found a really interesting, diverse, historic city with something interesting around almost every corner.  At no time during my 3 day visit did I ever feel unsafe.  The Book Cadillac is well located.  Facilities are excellent.    Rooms, however are drab but very functional.  The frig was appreciated. The wi-fi was very spotty -- in three days I had to sign in something like 7 times.  Ditto for the keyless card system -- it worked only about 75% of the time and the cards were easily demagnetized.  I loved the hot tub, but…",4

The service was exceptional.  The shoe shiner was excellent, Ises at the front desk is an asset to Westin offering a great first impression.  The entire staff was excellent.  The conference rooms and lobby areas are a work of art.  One suggestion, my room was room 1307 and the carpet is badly stained in the room, a little gross for a Westin.  Make sure you don’t get this room.  Other than the carpet the room was exceptional.  Meals at business events were exceptional as well.  I would welcome an opportunity to stay there again...just not 1307 until the carpets are cleaned...,",4

The location is excellent for downtown; very close various office buildings, and near to the water and the shops that are emerging in that area.  The staff is fabulously friendly.  I like the check in team.  Everybody’s attitude is great.   The bar next to the check-in is a nice space.  It has a sense of openness and is much lighter than many hotel bars.  The rooms are totally standard.  Grey - as is Westin’s favorite color.  No hint of the old building really remains in the new rooms, sadly.  Everything has been clean and well-ordered.  No trouble with noise.  The hotel features good amenities.  It has a good gym, a pool, coffee shop, and a restaurant on site.  (The…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Well done for a convention hotel,"Part of a large group. Service was excellent and staff attentive and pleasant. Rooms nicely done and generously sized. Not much in the way of views, even on higher floors, if that is important to you. Restaurant (Roast) on site has a very good wine list and food was excellent, but pretty much steak house style. For a larger hotel they did everything really well. Would certainly go back.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Awesome,"One of the nicest hotels I have ever been to. Friendly from the moment we arrived. We booked last minute through Priceline, actually while sitting on a street in Detroit. Usually my experience has been that hotels treat you as a second class citizen when you do this but not here. We were greeted cordially and immediately. Everyone was wonderful. We were upgraded to an amazing club level room and had a perfectly awesome night. Wished we could have stayed longer and explored Detroit but had to press on to our ultimate destination. I would go back in a heartbeat. Truly world class.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,An exceptional experience,"From the minute I walked up to the front desk we had an enjoyable visit. When the gal who checked us in found out that we were using our one night getaway to get refreshed, she gave us a complimentary upgrade. The hotel was far from full, but still, a complimentary upgrade was such a gift to us.  The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable.  Can't beat the Westin pillows. And they gave us late checkout too!  A most enjoyable time together at The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit!",5

I'm a frequent traveler and in this case an SPG member, so I've stayed in many Westins, Sheratons, et.  I have to say that the Book Cadillac ranks in the top 3 or so SPG hotels I've every stayed in -- it was that good.  Every single staff member I dealt with, including housekeeping (probably about 8 in all) were enthusiastic, helpful, committed to the customer experience - one rarely encounters such consistency!  And the rooms are lovely, quite spacious, well maintained, lovely bathrooms.  I asked when the hotel was last renovated (it seemed quite fresh and new) and was told a reno is scheduled for 2018-19, but that they take extra pride in maintaining everything to tip-top condition.  I'll say!  Also, our event in the hotel was…",5

We stayed @ the Westin Book Cadillac in Downtown Detroit.  We arrived early and received excellent service at the front desk.  Our room was nice.  The bathroom was splendid with the twin headed shower.  Unfortunately, outside our door were several old room service trays along the hallway.  It was very disconcerting. We called on more than one occasion to the trays picked up, to no avail.  All things considered, the stay was ok but did not meet expectations for a Starwood property.",2

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Not my best visit,"I have stayed at this hotel once before for a business meeting s vernal years ago, and recall a very good experience.  This time around, I would say it was fine, but the little things stood out in a bad way.  One was housekeeping.  We arrived at our room when checking in and there was a stack of dirty plates and wine glasses inches from our door.  I get it... some random guest might have left it there, but I have never had that happen before so I thought it was weird.  Then, I had a horrible night sleep... and I blame the pillows.  Pillows are so subjective, but these were not my personal cup of tea.  They looked big and cozy, but they were super soft so I felt like I was lying flat on my back as my head sunk into the pillows... terrible night sleep.  Then, as we were checking…",3

Would not recommend, would not return. ",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,When the 4 star stops being luxury hotel?,"The hotel has a great location, rooms are nice and clean but for the price of $260 US a traveler should at least have vanity kit shower cap and shoe horn in the room. This is the second Westin I stayed in for the last three months and the comments are the same. If they want to remain 4 or 5 star hotel they really need to keep up with a little things. I am also wondering why more and more mini bars are empty in the rooms.",3

I travel a lot and no other hotel has waited UNTIL THEYVE SWIPED MY CARD AND GOT MY SIGNATURE TO TELL ME THAT MY ROOM WASNT AVAILABLE. I reserved a King, they gave me a double. I’m used to traveling with my older sister. And she recently passed away so now I’m stuck looking at this dumb bed that won’t be occupied. Normally if there’s something wrong with a reservation they tell you before you pay the freaking bill. I’m so disappointed. I’m actually angry. WHY WOULDNT U SAY ANYTHING BEFORE I WAS HEADING UP.

Awesome hotel in safe walking distance of everything downtown. Staff is amazing always opening doors for you.  Asking if you need help with anything.  Always say Good Morning.  Not just the front desk staff I mean all the staff.  Valet guys are great.  Nice pool...little if the small side but does the trick.  Nice hottub.  Yes this hotel is on the pricey side but you get what you pay for.  I don't personally eat here cause I find the prices expensive.   Many great restaurants in the area.  This hotel pays attention to the little details that make your stay go from good to great.  Robes in the room , to even essential oils in your room to help you sleep.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Good Hotel for Downtown Detroit,"We were in Detroit for the weekend, checking out some restaurants, visiting friends, and headed to a performance at the Opera House.    The Westin Book Cadillac had a great location for all of this; we were within walking distance of the Opera House, downtown buildings undergoing renovations and improvements, and some good restaurants.  That said, we often found ourselves using Uber, too--not a hit on the hotel, but the reality of a spread-out city, like Detroit, with relatively few public transportation options.  We had really high-hopes for the hotel, having seen pictures of its gorgeous exterior and having read a bit about the hotel's history online.  While there was nothing wrong with the hotel, both of us were surprised that the interior of the hotel was generic--the…",4

There are plenty of good restaurants around and it appeared quite safe place.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,EXTREMELY DISHONEST MANAGEMENT,We booked this hotel for new years Eve. Check in was extremely hectic with an over 30 min line up because very there was a wedding and most of the guests were checking in around the time we got there. We were informed of a $50 hold which was pretty standard but I'll get to that.  The room was clean and the beds were comfortable as expected but nothing to write home about. We met up with our friends  of 8 years and since it's been months since we've seen each other we decided to grab dinner at roast with in the hotel and stay in to catch up.  As we checked out that's when we were informed of a $250 charge that was simply unsubstantiated. The manager was unavailable at the time and though the front desk reassured us that this would be taken care of and that we would be contacted…,1
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,My favorite Detroit hotel,"We stayed at the Westin during a weekend trip to the auto show. The hotel is in a beautiful building in the heart of downtown. We got a very spacious double room on a high floor, and all the furnishings were modern and well-kept. The room also came with a massive TV and comfortable workspace. I also thought the employees offered friendly and helpful service, including quick check-in and room service. Valet parking is $35 overnight, but you can go in and out as often as you want with that rate. The WiFi was free for SPG members and was a decent speed, though not blazing fast. ",5

DID NOT NOTICE any lack of quality or service, so WELL DONE. - internet about 12 MBPS, typical for hotels - elevators were easier to use this time due to installation of card key-scanners (just hold your room key against it until light turns green). You need a card key since the hotel also includes a bunch of actual condos on separate floors. The elevator needs to know if you're a hotel guest or a resident.   Bottom line -…",5

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great time during some really cold weather.,"We stayed there between Christmas and New Years and had a wonderful time. It was just me and my wife without the kids. The only time we left the room was to go down to Roast for dinner. Roast remains one of the top 5 restaurants in town and it didn't disappoint. It was really nice that on such a cold night, we didn't even have to put our coats on for a 4 star meal. Early check in and late check out were nice perks for the room The staff and valets were friendly. Other than trying to get the room temp right, it was a flawless experience.  ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,The charge dispute from Hades,"This will be my first one star review so don't expect anything good here  I ended up at The Westin because a few old friends who are finishing their residency in Chicago were coming to Detroit for a wedding on the 30th of December so my partner and I decided to take the long drive from Toronto and spend NYE in Detroit out of all places.  We spent the night in and only went downstairs to Roast to grab some food. Yes the room was sub par for the $500+ price tag, but hey, it's NYE right? We made the best of it, had fun and caught up with our old friends.  My issue with the hotel arose during checkout and 13 days later, seems as though no end is in sight.  I got a huge $250USD (~$330CAD) charge and I asked to speak to someone who can reslove the issue. I was nothing short of a…",1

We walked around the area, Campus Martius and vicinity, did some shopping there. While cold it is still a good place to explore. We had dinner at the steakhouse Roast downstairs, which was good (great service, food was pretty good but not excellent), then on the recommendation of our check-in agent we went to the Dime Store for breakfast, which is just a block or 2 away.  In the process of leaving we called the valet only to find out the car battery died and they were attempting to charge it.  Long story short, the valets (particularly the supervisor) worked for over an hour to try and jump the vehicle, eventually succeeding using their own vehicles.  The service was really above and beyond.  Overall a great stay in…",5

Lots of good, clean equipment.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Nice, but was expecting a bit more. ","The hotel has been nicely restored.  The beds are comfortable.  Our bathroom was lacking water pressure so we could not fully enjoy the rain shower head.  We were missing a bathrobe which was rectified by the hotel, but unfortunately the one they brought had a stain on it.  The location is decent and you can get to the restaurants and shops on Woodward fairly easily. It would be really nice especially in the winter if the self-park garage behind the hotel actually connected to the hotel so you don't have to walk outside. The fitness area had a nice variety of machines that were in good condition. ",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great stay close to the Fox,"The Westin is a great place to stay if visiting the Fox Theatre, Tiger Stadium or Ford Field. You can walk to each place and it seemed very safe. It is fun when there are events at each venue because so many people are out and about. The Westin is clean and very comfortable. The restaurant, Roast, is wonderful - make reservations ahead of time. Valet parking is pricey but so much more convenient than trying to drive in and park somewhere near the Fox. The attendants are friendly and quick. Our only complaint about the hotel is the lack of food and beverage options after 11 pm. There isn't even a vending machine for a bottle of water - but we have now learned to bring our own. Just plan ahead. It is a great option for staying in downtown Detroit.",5

They did a fantastic job renovating this classic old hotel into a modern, comfortable place to stay. The look of the hotel is very classic yet modern and the finishes were well done. The room was large and well appointed with all the modern conveniences and a beautifiul and large bathroom. The only complaint I had was the modern shower fixture required an operating manual to figure out how to get water out of the showerhead.   Staff was very attentive and made my stay more enjoyable, even though the NIU Huskies lost to Duke in the Bowl Game.   Go Huskies",4

Beds were rather hard for my taste but bedding was very nice. It was odd we were told to go down to the bar when we called for room service for a bottle of champagne. When we went down to get it the price was $10 more than it was on the room service menu. When we mentioned it they told us it wasn’t. Well, it is. I wasn’t going to argue with them but they should change the room service menu if they upped the price. Location is good. You can walk to football, baseball and hockey easily.

Westins generally offer good hotels for the value and this is no exception the Renovations have provided a hotel with huge rooms that are also well appointed.  As for location, it is right in the heart of downtown and just a couple blocks either direction to the People Mover and the QLine.

Parking was a bit expensive so I opted for the lot across the street who charged $15 per night. Rooms were very big! Nice comfy beds and linens. Only downfall was that all I could see from my 17th floor room was rooftops from other tall building, and there were almost no restaurants nearby that served regular American food late at night.

Clean rooms, awesome ""weston-quality sleeping"". (I stay at westins a lot because i've always been able to sleep well in westins.)

For breakfast we ate at the Boulevard Room which was delicious also. Before check out we walked to The Nike store and Campus Martius Park.

The public space and guest rooms were faultlessly clean.  The guest bed, pillows, sheets were deeply comfortable.  We were surprised though, so you should plan ahead - reservations only in 24 Grill.  Although the dining room was empty at 5:30pm it was 'reservation only'.",5

But for over $350. a night we did not get any type of breakfast the next morning. Nothing. Nor was our room cleaned the next day until after 5pm.

The person he spoke to said an early check in would be no problem because the hotel was not fully occupied the night before. Once we arrived, my husband stood in the standard check in line to wait his turn to check in. A front desk agent came up to the Elite check in desk and offered to assist us.

You bring the car up to off load on one street, and pick it up later on another, something that was not really explained to me, as I stood waiting where I had dropped it off.

For a start the main elevator bank was very slow and not working properly. The hotel was updating the elevator software and each guest needed to use two cards, one to get in their room and one to access the floor in the elevator.  Throughout our stay, the entire process proved difficult as on top of the software update the hotel was undergoing a city inspection of its elevator bank.  On Monday the entire elevator bank was stopped and guests had to use the service elevator which is located far away from the guest elevators.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Comfortable Stay..,"The rooms were big and comfortable! My family and I were able to stay in 1 room comfortably and it was located in a great area! The Italian restaurant nearby was absolutely incredible. There is also a grocery store just down the street, which made it extremely convenient.   The friendly staff added to our overall experience and I would definitely recommend this hotel to those going to Detroit!",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Beautiful facility/ accommodating staff,"Had a great experience staying at the Westin. The hotel is beautiful, and I appreciated the extra large television in my room along with a pretty good size bathroom as well. They have a couple good restaurants as well. I will be back.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Great, historic hotel","Very nicely appointed hotel, DeAndre is a great greeter and the rooms and service are well worth it for the stay. Good central downtown location. Lots of places to walk too especially along Woodward Ave.   ",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Westin Cadillac Downtown Detroit,"Great service and very comfortable and clean rooms.  Good location to walk to Comerica Park/Ford Field.  Great staff at the 49 Grill for dinner, had breakfast at the Boulevard  Room which was OK.  Roasters was closed for private events both days of my stay",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nicest Hotel in Detroit,"As we all know Detroit is known for being a city of well not the best experiences. I am happy to say the city is truly bouncing back at a historic rapid pace. The Westin thus far is the nicest hotel in Detroit. There are a lot of new hotels being built, but for now this is the one. It has two good restaurants, and a coffee shop on the main floor. The rooms are spacious although on one of my stays I could hear the person next to us in the bathroom word for word, but that only happened once.   It is located in the heart of Detroit, and with in walking distance are some great restaurants and bars. Check out my review for Wright & Company.. Oh my..  In all I would recommend this hotel...",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great Stay,I had a quick stay here while in town for my cousins Wedding. The room upgrade was very nice and the location was very good. Room was kept very well and everyone was helpful. Will come back if back in Detroit.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Good location, beware the double beds!","Ninth floor room, ADA compliant so the bathroom was large (I never asked for ADA room)  I booked it per ""wedding"" instructions, but the room overlooked a dreary tall building and a grey parking lot. I did a double thinking my granddaughters could join me but the beds were 1st, very soft and slept 'hot"" and 2, they were double beds, not queen; ac is noisy.  Room service was prompt and good but very pricey and a room service charge added. There was another hotel across the street I wished I had considered. Too much money/points for the experience. Nice bar and a well known restaurant for dinner, but I did not have time to try it.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great weekend in Detroit ,"Great hotel in downtown Detroit for everyone. Just spent two nights and it was wonderful, very clean, large rooms and friendly, courteous staff. The location is perfect, 5 minute walk to anything downtown. Will definitely stay again when visiting Detroit. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Very disappointed ,"My family and I have always chose this hotel for any events we have done down town Detroit. We've even had a room just to have a night out on the town, because we typically find good deals. So my husband chose this hotel for our wedding night to make the end of our night even more special. When he booked the room he was told he had the second best suite in the hotel with a city view and was charged $550 for the room. We get to our room on the 15 floor, that's smaller then any room we have had at the Westin, look out our window only to see we are facing the building and are basically looking into other people's rooms. The only thing the front desk could offer us was a refund on our room, after trying to charge my husband $550 on a basic room. They said they had given our suite…",1
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is beautiful with comfortable, clean rooms. I slept very well. The staff was so sweet and helpful. Valet is quick and efficient. I wish I could have stayed for more than one night. I'd definitely stay here again during my next trip to Detroit. There isn't wifi in the rooms, which was an issue when my sister needed to do some work. There is wifi in the common areas, though.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Lions game visit,"On an August weekend we journeyed to Detroit for the Lions-Patriot game.  What a lovely hotel!  Excellent staff, beautiful room with large bathroom, quiet, and squeaky clean.  It was a wonderful experience and when travels take me back to Detroit, I will stay here.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Large, comfortable rooms in central Detroit","This was my first visit to D and it was a combo business/vacation trip.  The room was large (I had two beds) and the bathroom was large as well with a waterfall shower head.  My wife got a massage at the Spa and thought it was good as well.  The pool area was very clean and more well kept than most hotel pools.  As an elite awards member after the merger, don't forget to ask for your ""compensation"" (AKA Free drink).  I was a little disappointed that I have to ask for that from staff.  It should be acknowledged from check-in.  (a fellow traveler let me know to do so)",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice Hotel with Large Rooms,The area around the hotel is being revitalized but there are good choices for dining close by. The rooms are large and comfortable with very large flat screen TVs. While the coffee shop is under construction there is a temporary space at the bar for morning coffee and pastries. Good for business meetings but not really family friendly. The staff is very friendly and helpful.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,I really want to love them,"I come to Detroit often for business,and I've stayed at the book Cadillac a couple of times. Generally it's a good business hotel with comfortable rooms and good service. However, each time I've stayed they've dropped the ball on something. It's usually minor, but this time was the final straw for me. I requested an early morning check in since I was arriving on a red eye. When I got to the airport I called to see if they'd be able to honor this request--if they couldn't, I was going to check into their airport hotel as I was exhausted. They assured me that they checked with the manager and that it wouldn't be a problem to check in immediately. When I arrived, I was dismissively told that there were no rooms available. I spoke with the Manager who something about it being a…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Very pleasant,"We had two pets with us and there was no charge for them!  All of the staff were courteous and helpful.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Downtown, good location","This is a well managed property, with good location in downtown Detroit.  I was upgraded to a corner executive suite which was very nice and spacious. The revival of the area is impressive and a walk around the area and renovated ""strip"" is worthwhile.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great service ,We arrived fairly tired after a long travel day and were greeted by the lovely Micah Smith.   She was so friendly.   We laughed and chatted for a bit and she was so accommodating.   We got hooked up with a great room and excited for our room service.   Here for a cpl nights and all we can say is feels like the perfect place to be right now.   ,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Excellent 1 night Stay,"I had an excellent 1 night stay here the day after boxing day while on business to see a client in Detroit. Being in a rush and also being an SPG Gold Member, the lady at the check in gave me an upgraded room and swiftly executed the check in process as she could see I was in a rush. The attention to detail made this an excellent property in my opinion. I look forward to staying here next time.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Felt like home,I am originally from Detroit and recently came home for a quick family occasion. Hubby booked the Westin Book Cadillac and from the moment we arrive and Damon assisted us with or valet parking to checkin which was very smooth we felt like we were back home. The hotel is beautiful the staff were friendly and attentive. The rooms were large and beds were comfortable. the view from the 19th floor was a good view of the Downtown skyline. We did not get a chance to visit the restaurants but did notice they were almost always full.  There was several wedding parties going on but the hotel still  maintain there personal guest hospitality. We will be back for another visit soon .. We would recommend The Westin Book  Cadillac Detroit to anyone looking for a nice hotel downtown Detroit.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Better than my last visit,"The last time I visited this Westin location, I was very disappointed with my experience.  I wasn't sure if I would ever come back but due some weather delays, I ended up stuck in Detroit and had little choices available since many people were booking last minute accommodations. I ended up giving this hotel a second chance and I have to say that it was better than my last visit.  The reception staff were nice and empathized with my situation.  I got a nice clean room, on a high floor and a view of the city.  I'm still disappointed in the lounge as I feel they can do so much more, so that will be my only negative comment this time around.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,One good reason to love Detroit,"Great place to spend a weekend. The location made walking to attractions very easy and it is easy to get to from the interstate. Our room was a junior suite, quite large, and comfortable.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Perfect location and excellent service,"My friend and I stayed at the Book Cadillac for 3 nights and found it was the best possible hotel for our needs.  We were close to the RiverWalk, many fantastic (new) restaurants, Greektown, The Eastern Market, and much more. The staff could not have been friendlier and our rooms had a great view of the river and Canada. LOVED our stay and will definitely be back. Detroit is back... it brings a smile.",5

At check in I was upgraded to the executive floor which included the executive lounge and the free breakfast and evening hor-dourves. My room was spacious and very warm and inviting. The bathroom was large with hot and powerful shower. The room was very quiet. Wi-Fi worked very well. The bed was super comfortable. Parking is valet or self pay park next door. There is a pool and gym. The whole hotel was spotless clean. It is located pretty central downtown and easy to walk to many eating places and bars, etc. Sad to leave but I will be back.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Downtown Delight!,"Location, location, libations! Comerica Park was less than a 10 minute walk away, the DIA was a $7 cab ride, Cliff Bell's legendary supper club was right down the street and the hotel restaurant ""Roast"" had great drinks at great prices.

The hotel is in a great location situated in the heart of downtown, walking distance to restaurants, bars, and shopping. The room was spacious and clean. Every person I talked to was very nice and helpful. I can't say enough wonderful things about the people of Detroit. Just walking around the city, I was able to meet many locals who welcomed me to their city. I am so happy that Detroit is making a comeback. I will return to explore the city some more very soon and I will definitely choose the Westin!",5

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Good location amd service,We found the Westin great for our needs for a short stay in Detroit.  Its close to the river as well as Greektown and Washington Ave for shops and the Comerica stadium. Good little bar - bathtub across the street as well which served as a convenient stop off on the way home as the hotel bar is fairly anonymous.  Room was great and staff helpful.  Detroit still shows signs of struggling but we found the locals upbeat and proud of their City.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Lousy Executive Lounge and in a Dangerous Part of Town""",PROS: Hotel room is clean and beds are comfortable.  Air conditioning isn't the best but helps if you put the fan on high to keep room reasonably cool.     CONS:    Especially for women business travelers - This hotel located in a very dangerous section of town.  I took a walk and was grabbed less than 50 feet from the hotel by a drug dealer and then another man who I thought for sure was going to mug me in pure daylight - luckily someone came by and pretended like they knew me and the others walked away and I kindly thanked him as he  pointed me back towards my hotel.

The bathrooms are very large!  The lobby bar was hopping at night.  The 24Grill was great for lunch and they had an amazing Sunday brunch for $25 !   Dinner at Roast, their fine dining restaurant, was excellent although quite expensive.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Dangerous part of town, Hotel not fully operable still under construction","Upon checking in I discovered that the pool was not available, one of the reasons i chose this hotel, after further inspection much of the hotel lobby was also under construction, the hotel itself is in a dangerous part of town as some hustlers who seemed friendly at street level, came up to my room, after passing through security ect, and stole my cell phone and car keys, absolutely no compensation was offered by the hotel, instead i was given a $60.00 bill for using the phone in my room to contact the police.",1
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Valet RUINS everything ,Rooms were lovely. Room keys that were required to operate elevators needed to be replaced multiple times and they were the joke of everyone staying there. Housekeeping couldn't be bothered to replace half empty (or more) shampoo. Wifi was difficult to get and stay signed into for some reason. But the ONE reason I would NEVER EVER stay here again is that the Parking Valet on Sunday morning was a hot mess. We called from our room and went directly down to wait and wait AND WAIT. ONE HOUR LATER the manager of the valet departments only explanation was that our car must have come down and waited too long for us and had to be sent back down. That was a complete BOLD FACE LIE AND AN INSULT TO MY INTELLIGENCE. He offered to comp us one day of parking fee but wasting an hour of my…,2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice Stay at the Westin Book Cadillac,"The Westin Book Cadillac is truly the only decent hotel in downtown Detroit. My room was clean, spacious, and well-maintained. The staff were also responsive, prompt, and friendly. Special thanks to Zaw Oo, David Wilt, and Ari (from the Front Desk). I appreciated the food and beverage offerings in the Westin Executive Club Lounge, especially the mini wellingtons in the evening. I loved them!   One minor suggestion: I would recommend that the hotel work out some of the kinks with the room keys, as the key access to the Club Lounge and the elevators seemed temperamental at times.  Overall, I had a great stay. I would not hesitate to return to this hotel whenever I come back to downtown Detroit.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice. Easy access to Cobo center.,"I choose this location in hopes it was close to the Cobo center for kids competitions. And the walk was easy!!    It was very nice, clean, but didn't have any of the nice things that I'm used to having when I go to 4*.  The pool was closed, which kids were sad about... and so was I, as I planned on that being entertainment for the down time!  I usually don't pay for parking... and at this place we did... and it was more expensive than what I just paid in Miami Beach!  They had restaurants, but they looked too fancy to take kids who just want chicken fingers and fries...  I love breakfast included in the stay, and this place does not offer...  Club Level- breakfast up there was very good!!  Healthy! Loved all the fruit! Perfect for athletes going into competition!!  The beds…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Excellent, Modern Hotel in the Heart of Detroit","My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights for a wedding that was nearby and absolutely loved it! They put us in a fantastic room on the 22nd floor that was spacious, clean and modern. The beds are extremely comfortable and the showers are awesome! The staff was really friendly, and using the valet to park the car didn't cause any major problems. Parking is a little expensive at $35 a night, but there are other parking lots around the hotel where you can park for cheaper. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere luxurious to stay in Detroit!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Good Location,"Overall the hotel was clean, had a friendly staff and was in a good location.  If you have stayed in a Westin before its pretty average to other Westin Hotels.  Modern, clean, comfortable beds and friendly staff.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great location,"We stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac for a tournament at the Cobo Center.  It is a very nice hotel with a pool and spacious fitness room.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  I would like to specifically recognize Antonio.  He handled our luggage upon arrival and spent a few minutes helping us get oriented with Detroit.  In addition, the following day he saw my son and I wandering around looking for ice cream, before recommending we order room service, he checked to make sure it was available.   We saw him a few other times after, and he would ask how our stay was.  I was impressed with his infectious personality and over all customer service orientation.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice hotel.,"We stayed for a family wedding.  Nice hotel. We stayed in a standard twin room, but this is not a 'budget' hotel and for the price (€169 before tax €194 inc all the taxes a night) I would expect breakfast and wifi to be included. I was surprised this was not the case. ",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Beautiful stay,"We booked through third party and I was concerned but the staff was perfect and made sure our stay was perfect. Everything from check in to check out was smooth. We walked to Comerica Park, walked downtown and walked to Greektown. This was the perfect location to go anywhere. We never needed our vehicle until check out.  We had a room with 2 double beds (beds were very comfortable). The room had alot of floor space.  There was a mini fridge hidden in the dresser and a large flat screen tv. The bathroom was big and updated. Everything was perfect. We love staying downtown, this will be our new hotel when we are in the area. ",5

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Think again,"Nothing special about this hotel and a lot against. Standard big Westin hotel layout. Nothing that stands out about the building. A little old (worn out carpets), and not very well kept. Most importantly, not good in service specially at the reception desk. I was there for a business conference contracted to the hotel well in advance (usually 150-200 attendees). My first bad experience was right at the registration desk. Having reservations made by my organization (again, well in advance), I came to check in after check-out time just to be explained that there were no available rooms and asked to wait until some were cleaned and made available. A reasonable request. The young man who talked to me said he would call my cell as soon as my room was available in 10-15 minutes. I…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,A Classic,"This was part a pleasure and part business stay. Very nicely redone hotel. We walked to Tigers Stadium and down to Greektown and along the river, so the location was good too. The room was spacious but the bathroom was HUGE!. Great view of the river from 2123. Odd that they had just the old style of tub with a shower in it though. It was fine but most new luxury hotel have walk in showers. Different but not bad. Staff was very pleasant. They forgot to clean our room but things happen I guess, plus it wasn't very dirty. The business part of the trip was very well done and in a beautiful setting! The place shows very well.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,The place to stay!,"Great location, fantastic property and right in the middle of the boom-town happenings. Campus Martius is only a few blocks away and the people Mover can get you to other downtown locations without having to get in your car. Great rooms overlooking downtown and helpful staff. Roast is fabulous, if expensive, restaurant, but well worth the price! We always try to stay here if possible.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Wonderful visit,"We stayed at the Westin because we were visiting family and attending an event at the hotel. The service was very good everywhere we went from the valet to the front desk. My husband is not crazy about valet parking, but the attendants do a wonderful job of representing Westin from the moment we pulled up to the front entrance. The staff was always friendly and always greeted us.  The hotel is centrally located near shopping, restaurants, and the Q line.  The accommodations are very up to date. The room is spacious.   We did have access to the club lounge, which has fantastic views of the city. The Westin is focusing on healthy options for food. Usually in the concierge/club lounge there is a lot of junk food. That was not the case here. I was traveling with two teenagers, and…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Perfect,Great stay at this hotel for a great price. Location is quiet and easy to get to anything. Jevram (sp?) at the front desk is an asset to the hotel - I asked him to sell me on the city and he did. He deserves whatever he can get. Thanks!,5

The hotel is immaculately kept and service exemplary. The standard room was large and inviting as was the bathroom.

So if you want to splurge a bit is luscious Westin Book Cadillac is for you!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Good ...,We have stayed there during the Movement Music Festival. Checking was smooth and we got our suite 1h before the check in which was much appreciated. However our bathroom mirror was dirty and we had some issues with the room service person. Front desk resolved the issue upon the check out. Overall our stay was great and staff were super nice. Will be back. ,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great pace to stay,I stayed here for 2 nights (including all day while on a course at the hotel).  Everyone who works here was friendly and helpful.

A short walk to Comerica Park although the Tigers weren't in town.  A great experience overall.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Very nice,We stayed here for our honeymoon back in 2015. I like that its walking distance from the Tiger stadium and Ford field. We were very pleased with the staff of how helpful they were. The rooms were very nice and clean. ,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Very Good Hotel Downtown Detroit,"Attended a conference for work at this hotel in June, 2017.  I would agree with the other reviewers - this is a very conveniently located hotel.  It's nice, very nice.  Clean, nice furnishings, nice ambiance, nice rooms, nice service.....nice.  Nondescript in many ways, I wouldn't necessarily say there's much character to this hotel, however don't let that distract you from my rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  I do very much like and appreciate Westin's heavenly beds and their shower heads. I would stay here again.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,A Building To Admire Only from Outside,"Detroit does not have good hotels, full stop. Well, Shinola and the Foundation Hotels are coming, but until then I had to put up with the Westin. Nothing inside the building reflects the impressive facade and architecture of the building. You could be in an airport hotel, a convention hotel along a freeway. This is where you start wondering why traveling is part of your job.",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great location,This hotel has a great location in downtown Detroit. Within walking distance of many restaurants and things to do it gave me a nice impression of Detroit. Service was wonderful and the beds were very comfortable. I would stay here again.,4

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Amazing Renovation,"My wife and I stayed this past December to attend a Wings game (saying goodbye to the Joe!). I was incredibly impressed with the restoration of this building. It is absolutely beautiful. Our room was very tastefully appointed and spacious. I don't recall finding one imperfection (which is exceedingly rare). We didn't really have too many encounters with the staff or have any special requests, but everyone we did encounter was polite and helpful. Car valet brought our vehicle around quickly. We had a drink from both the bar on street level (I can't recall the name) and upstairs, both had excellent service.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Best of Detroit,"I stay in Detroit on a fairly regular basis, and have done so for the past number of years.

Helpful attentive staff, wonderful amenities, clean spacious rooms, great restaurants, nice spa (not a Westin spa, mind you, but the massage and facial did the trick!). I travel a lot and it's hard to impress me these days, but...color me impressed! Bravo!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,A classic revamped,They have done a great job renovating the Westin Book Cadillac Detroit – once the tallest and one of the most glam hotels in the world. It really is a beautiful old building with and has been very well refurbished.  My room was lovely and spacious and was well equipped and stocked. Beds were very comfy and a BIG SHOUT out to Westin for their smart environmental policy (see pic)   The hotel has nice public spaces and a good selection of dining / drinking options (including ROAST – see other review).   Check in was efficient and friendly (big shout to Tammy !)   Smallish bad points to note:   + The key cards SUCKED. They didn’t always work in the elevator or the room lock unless you performed some sort of yoga maneuver.   + I noticed  that it took a long time to clear room service…,3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Beautiful hotel,"The hotel was quite new looking on the inside, clean and well designed. The bed was extremely comfortable and views were great. The room didn't let much light come in when the sun rose, which is a perk for me.  We checked in on a Friday at 4 pm and did have to wait about 20 minutes as there were maybe 10 people in line to check in. There was also a wait to drop my car off at the valet.  We also had trouble figuring out if room service was available because we saw conflicting info on the tv, online and pamphlets in the room. So we ended up going down to the bar and ordering the chipotle tacos to go which were delicious!  Overall we had a fun time here while in town for a wedding.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Detroit - A Pleasant Surprise,"Returning to the Motor City, on business, was a very pleasant surprise. The last time there, I found a city on the brink of death. Since the blow to the auto industry and the 2008 crash, the city seemed to be barely hanging on as a major U.S. city: jobs were lost on a grand scale;  crime was on the rise;  and things were looking dire. This time, Detroit looked like it had a new varnish...restaurants were full, and the downtown district was safe. The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit was a good place to land. Wonderful service and trendy décor made work very nice. Its location also made the visit very pleasant. Smack in the middle of downtown Detroit. We found a vibrant come-back city with so much to offer. The Detroit Institute of Art, which features Diego Rivera's amazing mural of…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Favorite Hotel in Detroit!,"Stayed here a couple times, once for the Detroit Auto Show.  Great updated and renovated hotel with huge rooms.  Nice restaurant/bar on 1st floor with good service, food and drinks.  Easy walk to Joe Louis Arena.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Just short of great,"Overall appearance, the hotel was pretty nice. However, the carpeted hallways of the hotel, as well as the carpet in the hotel room, needed a really good cleaning. There were numerous stains. The hotel staff were pleasant; no complaints there. The area the hotel is in is pretty sad. Actually, all of downtown Detroit is pretty sad, but it does seem to be making a comeback. Maybe in 3-5 years it'll be a poppin place again. I'd stay at this hotel again, but they really need to do a better job of keeping the hotel clean, particularly the carpets. ",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Real Good Option for the D,Came here on a business trip --- hotel is an old restored hotel.  Was really impressed by staff and hotel.  Fitness center was good.  Room was excellent.  Location is good and close to everything.  Hotel restaurant is also very good.  If coming to the D this is a very good option.  ,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Very nice hotel,"I stayed at the Westin for four nights during my trip to Detroit. In general, I was very happy and would stay here again.  The location: The hotel is located conveniently close to the interstate, so getting there from the airport is easy. It takes about 25 minutes, depending on traffic. I did not really explore the area, as I was mostly in Detroit for baseball. Comerica Park (and also Ford Field) is located just down the street and I was able to walk there within 5 minutes. After night games, I did not feel unsafe in the area. Right next to the hotel, there is a small store which I visited frequently to buy snacks and soda for the room.  The room: The room was very nice and clean. However, I was missing a safe. I may have overlooked it, but I did search the cabinets available…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,My Go-To in Detroit,"For over three years I make it a habit to stay here. I usually book it because it is walking distance to everything I am doing, but many times it happens to fall on my wedding anniversary, as it did again this year. My husband and I were upgraded with a number of perks which was very nice. The rooms are large, I love the shower, bed, there's free wifi, and a few restaurants (I recommend brunch at 24 Grille). The room service pricing I thought was quite reasonable, and the food was pretty fantastic.  The only annoying thing is the parking garage was taken taken over by the building next door some time ago, and the lot across the street is something I would not recommend from personal experience. For the price you might as well use the valet.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,I expected more from a Westin ,"Hotel looks pretty from the outside and is equally nice on the inside.  The reception is located on the second floor is very small.  I found the reception not to be very helpful when checking in.  No acknowledgement of my Platinum status, no offering to explain the amenities of the hotel, and when I asked a question about the area, I was given a very brief answer and if I was bothering the individual serving me.    The breakfast in the lounge is also somewhat average and didn't a great selection.  On the positive side, the room was very clean and the bell boys were extremely courteous.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Cool building, but interior it feels like every other Westin","Built inside a historic Detroit building, on the surface the Westin has promise.  But inside it feels like every other Westin, and lacks a lot of the charm that it could have.  The lobby bar was just so-so, the coffee establishment on site equally mediocre.  Dinner was fine, but not excellent.  About the best thing to recommend it is the fact that the beds are fantastic and it's reliable--which, I realize for many is a an asset.  For me, I was just hoping for more...",3

I like the butcher-block-style bathroom setup.  The wifi is reliable and the restaurants on site are pretty good.  I like that the hotel will provide a pre-printed map of local running routes if you ask for directions.  It's about a 15 minute walk to the river or 20 minutes to the Ren Cen.",4

It is conveniently located right in the middle of everything with many nice restaurants on the property and nearby.  The hotel is very pretty with a nice lobby. The platinum lounge is great to sit and get some work done or grab some snacks. The rooms are spacious, with great decor and views. They have a nice pool and gym, although I wish they had more cardio machines because it's always full. There's also a CrossFit one block from this property if anyone is interested.  I will definitely visit this property again whenever I'm in Detroit.",4

I will continue to return again and again. Thanks WBC!",5

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Clean and efficient place to stay in The Motor,"Over the years I've stayed at the RenCen just because you always get a great view of something, no matter which direction you're pointed. This time a colleague talked me into the Westin Book Cadillac. I was sort of expecting some kind of old-style Detroit charm that took in the city's 300 years of history. I'd always looked at the old high-rise buildings and imagined them packed with stately elegance from centuries past. The Book Cadillac is instead efficient, clean and, ultimately, just another Marriott. My room faced in, which meant I had a view of all the other rooms across the U-shaped building. Ask for an outside room so you can see something of Detroit. I also got the business floor so I got a decent breakfast. Valet parking took a while each time I got my car but they…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Wonderful Place to Stay,"We have stayed a handful of times at the Westin Book Cadillac and it has quickly become our ""go to"" hotel for nights out in Detroit.

Please treat yourself to a drink at the bar next to the lobby and take a seat on one of the couches and just take in the beauty of the historic building.  Rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms are very luxurious.  The rooms and hotel grounds are always clean, and the lobby area has this wonderful subtle perfume smell that will put you at ease.  We opt for valet service only because the location is so perfect, you can park once and walk to every downtown landmark.  For those not familiar with Detroit,…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Beautiful hotel,This hotel is beautiful! The staff is extremely friendly and polite. They treat you like royalty. The bar/lounge is also very nice and has great selection of drinks. The room was quite large and the bathroom was huge. The room had excellent amenities in general and the bed was awesomely comfortable in true heavenly bed style! The shower was also heavenly. This is not your typical crappy shower head like you get in most hotels. It was very plush and relaxing. I would definitely recommend this hotel.  ,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Beautiful building, excellent service, and fantastic room!","Well, let me just say one word: Impressive! I have never stayed at a Westin, and I was very impressed with everything - top to bottom. Front desk and room service was friendly and efficient, property was well maintained and comfortable, and exercise facilities, pool & spa were excellent! The bed was indeed heavenly, and the bath & toiletries were luxurious. The Deluxe room with king bed was in a quiet location in the hotel, and we had plenty of space in the room to relax and refresh.  We stayed one night for a 'romance' getaway to celebrate our engagement, and they had a nice tray of chocolates and pastries in our room with a note of congratulations. Top notch, all around! They only fell down one one thing -- I had requested 2 champagne glasses for the room, and they were not…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Holiday party at my sisters job,"We stayed at this lovely spot  after my sisters firm holiday party.  I'm from Michigan so I remember this place before the Westin bought it and revamped it in its entirety.  They actually now have residences in this spot.  It was lovely, the rooms were spacious as ever!  I could do cartwheels in this room.  The bathroom as well and the beds were lovely.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Stayed with a group after the Hockey game,"We stayed recently at the hotel with a group of people on Sunday night, booked 6 rooms. This is a second stay at this hotel, I have to say it wasn't as good as the last year stay. They DO NOT respect Gold and Platinum members at the hotel. Had to wait a long time in line, and overheard some other people in line complaining about long wait etc. During check out again waited 5 minutes in line for platinum guests, he was on the phone and wouldn't even look at me. I just politely changed to the other counter when the person left. I have to say that valet parking team is more polite than the front desk. Hotel looks good, nice historic old building, rooms nice but not as clean as they should be. We ordered wings at the bar around 10 PM or so, I have to say that I have never had worse…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great stay,"The staff is what makes this hotel stand out. Every single staff member was friendly, helpful, and professional. Special mention goes to Deidrea, the very lovely lady who delivered delicious granola to my room on multiple occasions; I was obsessed with the hotel's homemade granola and had it ordered to my room a couple of times per day!! It turned so comical, to the point where Deidrea actually left a huge ziplock bag full of granola in my room for me to take home. It was so funny and very sweet. I just ate some for breakfast at home, so, thank you, Deidrea!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Lovely,This is a beautifully renovated hotel with a great location and all the amenities.

I'm planning to come back in the summer!,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Beautiful Hotel,"Wonderful hotel with history and charm.  The staff is just lovely and so helpful.  It was close to museums and sports venues and so many great restaurants.  You could walk to it all easily or if you want, the people mover is a block away.  The rooms were so comfortable and spacious.  The only issue, and it is minor, is the housekeeping schedule.  My room rarely got serviced before 5pm.  Not a big deal and they brought me anything I needed even if I didn't have them do up the room at that time.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Nice hotel, but they charged $7.95 for wifi","Pro:  Great location, only a couple blocks from campus martius park.

Con: $7.95 for WIFI; Hot water coming out of both faucets; yellow stain marks on bed sheets;",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Lovely historic building,"I was never quite clear on what the building was before but it seemed historic with lots of old and seemingly historic features. There was nothing awful about this hotel, it was just average. The hotel staff were friendly but a little disorganized. For instance, at check in there was a long line at the Starwood Preferred Guest line but no one at regular check in and no one thought to wave people over when they freed up. There was an error with my key which did not get corrected until the second try at the desk. The room itself was spacious with some decent toiletries. But very loud. They were quite nice about this and did discount the room on check out but it did make it difficult to get to sleep and of course these sorts of things only happen later in the evening/night when you…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Rising like a Phoenix,Fifteen years ago I drove through downtown Detroit and was struck by a huge empty building which was Book Cadillac.  I had never seen such a large abandon building in the middle of a city's downtown.  Recently I stayed in the hotel and was very happy to see the transformation from fifteen years ago to today.  The hotel itself is what you expect from a Westin in terms of room quality and service which was all very good.,4

I live wedding where everyone can be in one area, but then there is a bar to escape to when you need a break.  This has to be the nicest hotel in Detroit.  Top notch all around.  I wish I knew the history of it.  Beautiful.  It's like Henry Ford would have lived here.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Average,"I would love to have given this a 5 star rating but no can do! Valet team was on the ball throughout my entire stay as was the front desk staff. A front desk agent named JaQuial Shaw treated me better than family and was very helpful and informative. But, there's just something about getting to your room and finding hairs in the bathroom and tub! Then I ordered room service and 45 minutes later it arrived cold...at least it was ONLY $42...lesson learned!!! The fitness center was roomy and nice complete with machines, ellipticals, freeweights and treadmills. Executive Lounge on the top floor literally served me the warmest food of my stay!  ",3

The location of the hotel is perfect, lots of restaurants in walking distance. We were part of a group who were celebrating an anniversary. I worked with Joy Day and John Frost with the rooming arrangements. They were so kind and professional. I asked a million questions and they were very patient with me.

Stephanie in housekeeping made sure I had everything I needed in my room.  I've never seen such uniformly friendly and helpful staff in a hotel.  Would highly recommend.  Their restaurant Roast is amazing also!!",5

The room was very comfortable and had a lovely view from the room / bath of the Detroit skyline and across the river into Canada.  The property is full service, with several dining options. We had a great meal at Roast, which is run by the famous Cleveland chef, Michael Symon. We also liked the coffee shop in the lobby call WBC, which has interesting breakfast items, juices  as well as Starbuck's coffee.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Beautiful hotel, great location ","My understanding is this hotel was renovated a few years ago and they've done a wonderful job. Easy to walk to several attractions and the Detroit People Mover is a stone's throw away. Staff is very friendly. Only complaint is the club level. Located on the top two floors, the rooms are great but the club lounge is just ok. The breakfast was also ok in the club lounge....eggs were cold and lacked any flavor. No alcohol drinks available for free in evening...I think I misunderstood that. They are available but at quite ridiculous prices....$15 for a glass of wine.  Don't want to dwell on the one thing that was off putting because overall the place is very nice and I would definitely recommend. Will stay there again if I return. ",4

The room was spacious with a comfy bed and the usual hotel amenities like tv, coffee maker, desk, closet, etc. The bed was comfy and we had a great nights sleep. The pillows are to die for. The bathroom was spacious with lots of counter room. I had room for makeup and toiletries. The shower was awesome and I now want to upgrade my shower head at home.  The location was perfect.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Family getaway for Autorama,"Weekend getaway with 2 adults and 3 kids to hit the Autorama.  We chose hotel because of proximity to Cobo Center.  Also there was close access to the Detroit People Mover.  Stayed in rooms that had access to Executive Club Lounge.  Check in was quick.  We were able to check in early to one of our rooms and later check in to the adjoining room.  At check in we were not informed of the lounge access, nut had seen it when we booked online.   Rooms were spacious with huge bathrooms.  Very nice showers with hand held and high mounted rain shower heads.  Perfect for bathing little kids who just got out of the pool.  We had a king room and a 2 doubled room. Many of outlets for charging electronics were accessible but desk area in rooms lack adequate lighting. Beds very comfortable…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Better than a lot of Westin Hotels,"Not the biggest fan of Westin Hotels but this one measured up.  First of all, the room was huge as was the bathroom.  Nice to have the space but I found it was set up awkwardly.  The desk was right by the door, the wall mounted TV pretty far from the bed and few other items that I think could have been set up differently.  The staff was great and I loved that they save this old building - it has style.",4

Overall, the stay was satisfactory, but hotel guest services could use an overhaul (or re-training).  I would have given more stars if it weren’t for the staff working in adjoining locations.  Room: Room with king bed was roomy and clean, but half of the room felt dark because of an empty corner with no furniture.  A small desk lamp was the only light for that side of the room.  A taller desk lamp might have helped.  Still there was no warmth to that sad empty corner.  Everything worked.  Just a little wear and tear here and there.  Bath: Bathroom was unusually spacious.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,As Nice As They Come In Downtown Detroit,"The Westin is large but has the feel of a smaller place. The staff is friendly and the rooms well furnished. I have stayed in Detroit several times recently including at the large impersonal Marriott. This was by far my best experience. I was here for meetings and the conference facilities were comfortable, efficient, and spotless. It is also centrally located so I found it easy to get to my meetings and to a few of the cutting edge Detroit restaurants.  The food in the restaurants at the Westin was not the best and I wouldn't chose it for a dining experience but it is my number one option for a hotel here. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Best Hotel in Detroit!,"We have stayed here multiple times and each time has always been a pleasure!  This is a beautiful Westin hotel and the historic building is breathtaking.  It is agreat 'staycation' or vacation location; it is close to the stadiums, casinos, and Campus Martius Park.   The pool, whirlpool, and fitness center are clean and comfortable. Michael Symon's Roast restaurant is fabulous and every meal we've enjoyed there has been delicious!  The rooms are clean and spacious. I recommend paying extra for the Club Level so you can enjoy appetizers at night and breakfast in the morning. It is worth the extra fee dollars, especially, if you're with your spouse or family/friends.  Also, the views of the city, river, and Canada are beautiful!  Enjoy!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Large, historic hotel close to the action of downtown Detroit","We arrived at check-in and it was expedient. We were upgraded to a suite, due to our SPG status.  The room was nice and we enjoyed having the extra sitting room to watch TV at the end of the day.  The bathroom was large with a smallish shower and a small, standard sized tub, which meant the bathroom was full of cold tiles.  They really need to add an additional rug or two to have something to stand on especially at the tub or shower, instead of a single tub mat.  I was hoping for a nice soaking tub for it to be a suite.   We used the executive lounge a few times and it wasn't maintained or cleaned as you would expect.

We left a clothing item behind accidentally. Once we contacted the right person, the hotel forwarded the item by parcel post within 2 days. No worries.  A couple of very good restaurants onsite.

The food is excellent and truly gourmet. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Motor City Weekend,We came to town to attend the Red Wings game and decided to stay downtown for the convenience and got an added attraction of visiting the Auto Show - which was excellent.

The bathroom was large, clean and there were plenty of towels. I did not get to see much of the hotels or use the pool/fitness room due to the large number of people staying. There was definitely a problem with checkout/check in because of the New Year's Holiday & the Lions football game. The staff was patient and I believe did the best they could. I did receive an e-mail explaining that there may be a problem at check in. I have been in contact with the hotel and have received a satisfactory response.

The building has been carefully restored to display its beautiful heritage attributes. We had made reservations beforehand and are SPG members. When we checked in, we were told that our room would have a great view, however, we were a bit disappointed to find that the view was of other rooms in the hotel. Due to its configuration (shaped kind of like a 'C'), plus the fact that we were near the end of the hall, there wasn't much of a view at all. I was disappointed that we were told one thing, only to find that it wasn't the case. Maybe the front desk staff should go on a tour of the rooms so that they would be more knowledgeable. I…",4

We really thought we had latched the door.  We were on the club floor!  Who would steal an iphone with a cracked screen, 3 chargers and earbuds?  The gentleman taking my statement was very nice, but offer nothing to help.  I had brought my daughter here for a special spa trip.  She ended up terrified and without her phone.  The spa is small, but the staff is very nice.  I would not spend that kind of money again for their services.",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great location but not worth the price,"We stayed at the Book Cadillac to participate in the New Year's Eve activities downtown and the Lions game on New Year's Day. The location is perfect for downtown festivities, and Michael Symon's Roast restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel was out of this world, as usual!  The hotel room was quite simple but clean, spacious, and the bed was comfortable.  The room was not well insulated for sound. We were able to hear nearby hotel guests through the bathroom vents (including bathroom noises which no one wants to hear), all hallway noise, and a barking dog in a nearby room, etc..  Having been completely renovated less than 10 years ago, I would have expected a few more updates (e.g. glass door shower - no tub with shower curtain)  In summary, the location is great, but…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Worst day ever,My husband and i checked in on Sunday January 1st. Took 2 1/2 hours to check in. We had to cancel a dinner date due to standing in line. When we go to the desk they told us our room wasn't ready....I told the desk person I WANTED a refund and surprise....she found us a room. Then she had the nerve to ask us if we wanted to pay for wifi.....seriously....WORST hotel I have ever stayed at.,1

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,The Book is Going downhill...,"I have stayed at this Westin several times. I typically am impressed and enjoy myself quite a bit. Unfortunately this last stay was just not up to the typical standard of this particular Westin.  The Staff seemed downtrodden. Upon arrival the valet was in a hurry to take our car and no one would help me unload about 6 bags that I ended up carrying in all by myself (including a pack and play). When we got to the front desk they provided extremely average service. Typically they are at least friendly, but they seemed completely non plussed. We are platinum members of starwood and asked for an upgrade which we usually are given without issue, she claimed to give us an upgrade, but we were just given a standard room with 2 queens. There were no amenities in the room as the platinum…",3

The bed comfortable (pillows way too soft though), bathroom large with a great shower and robe.  The mini fridge was just a great extra touch.  I didn't want to pay for room svc so I ordered from the sports bar downstairs and too it to my room...wow, excellent veggie burger and fries!! It was very cold outside so I didn't venture out...but the hotel itself is very accommodating with great customer service.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great Hotel in Downtown Detroit,"We stayed in the Westin on a Friday night being in town for a hockey game. It was a beautiful, older building that was restored with a classy feel. The staff was super helpful and courteous. They also had a small gift for us in our room. The room was very spacious and clean. The mattress, pillows and sheets were all very comfortable. The bathroom was large and everything was in great condition. The bar staff was friendly and they had good beer on tap. The only complaint I would have was the parking situation (Valet only for $30), but that was due to temporary construction in the area. Overall, this was an excellent hotel and I recommend to all.",5

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Standard Westin in a historic building,"I was staying at Westin Book Cadillac for work, and did not have any expectation about the hotel. It was a standard Westin experience; comfortable bed, spacious room, good food, impeccable service,etc. What surprised me was that the hotel is a historic building that was renovated several times over its lifespan. The interior does give out a classic vibe, but everything has been upgraded to meet the modern businessmen's needs. If traveling to Detroit for work, this hotel should be th go-to solution.",4

Our daughter is in restaurants all of the time. So she did great here. We stayed in the Corner 1 bedroom suite. It was very quiet, Clean, and accommodating. Post dinner we wanted to finish our wine in the room, the concierge sent up glasses and a wine opener before we could even make it to the room.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Among the Best Hotels in the United States,"Of the hundreds of hotels in which I've stayed, in the United States and overseas, the Westin Book Cadillac is at the top of the list!  Built in the late 1920s, and then ceasing to be a hotel for a number of years, this hotel was reopened I'm told in 2004 at an expense of $250 million dollars, with its prewar grandeur and architectural details in tact.  Having seemingly become the ""go-to"" venue for the social set in southeastern Michigan, I saw at least as many hotel visitors in black tie and ladies in formal gowns as I did on a recent May crossing of the Queen Mary 2.  I dined in three of the hotel's restaurants and they were very nice indeed.  The little gifts from hotel were a thoughtful touch, and included a bottle of water signed by staff members, a chocolate bar, and being…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,C'mon Valets step up your game. Who writes on the hood on the hood of someones car.,"Great experience from the Front desk to Motor bar. I'll get this out of the way now though. When the valet uses the hood of your car to write your last name on the ticket, not what I wanted for the impression. However this hotel is amazing, when we travel we always tour around to appreciate the architecture. There's some great work put in to this hotel, its beautiful. The room was perfect I'm usually pretty picky about this and there was nothing to find or look for. It was perfect so clean and the bed was great. The Motor Bar was great the food was good and beer was cold and the make a great "" Bombay with soda"" was great my wife said.  I should offer this heads up.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Very Nice Hotel, Disappointing Service","I like this hotel very much. It is nice looking, has large and comfortable rooms, and is in the heart of the revitalized downtown. The workout room is fine, and the Boulevard Room is a nice venue for breakfast. But we were very surprised and disappointed with housekeeping, which did not clean our room one day, and did not leave towels or shampoo on others. We also found the valet car service slow, although the employees were hustling.  In spite of the service problems, I will give this hotel another chance.",4

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Luxury hotel wrapped in a 1924 skyscraper ,"The Westin Book Cadillac is everything you'd expect from a Westin property. Well appointed rooms, very modern, spacious bathrooms and offering all the regular Westin amenities (including workout gear for a $5 rental so you can pack lighter). The Westin Club is on the 23rd floor. It is okay, nothing special except the views. The building is beautiful, first built in 1924, but when you're inside it feels brand new. They did a very nice job on the renovation. The acclaimed Roast restaurant is located on the first floor with the hotel lobby on the 2nd floor. Valet parking available. Enjoy. ",5

The room was clean not spotless but it was a 9 and that is important to me. The bar service was great and food at the bar was great . I cannot remember the bar tenders name in the afternoon and the evening but both of them were personable and professional .  We had breakfast in the morning which was delicious . I would definitely stay there again! ",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Beautiful Rooms,We had a great experience.  What a beautiful hotel. It was very clean and the rain shower was amazing. The bed was so comfortable.  I loved that there was actual starbucks coffee in the room.  It was a great value in my opinion. For such a nice hotel located in downtown it was very reasonably priced. The hotel has a great view of downtown Detroit and is central to so many things to do.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice property with service issues,"I recently spent one night at the Westin for a business trip. The property is well located in downtown Detroit where a massive improvement project is taking shape. My room was over-sized and well appointed, as expected from Westin.  However, the hotel is not well designed for convenience, with the registration desk on the second floor, and without adequate signage or staff providing direction. I walked around the entire first floor looking for the desk before I saw a small sign pointing up the escalator.   As a SPG Platinum member, I requested a late check out which was honored. However, when I returned to my room, housekeeping was already cleaning the room and my belongings had been removed.  And in spite of that serious issue and worry about what happened to my laptop,…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice hotel with a charming but limited old school feel,"Checking in you feel you are at the Westin. Nice, but let's face it, ""The Westin"" is one notch above a Marriott, where the word efficiency drives all decisions and style is something that happens to women when they get their hair done.  But once in the room you can feel mid - century Detroit - good and bad. Long on style but not unlike other older classic hotels, fitting modern needs into a room built decades ago presents some awkward angles. ",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Waited over 20 mins to check in,"Make sure you leave plenty of time, I guess unless your booking more than one your not wanted here.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Old,"Was expecting more from a Westin, even in downtown Detroit, but was sorely disappointed with the service here. No one was there on the first floor to tell me that the check in was on the second, so I was meandering around for about five minutes before I found someone who worked there. I didn't ask for it, but they put me in a handicap room. Had a view of a brick wall on another side of the building. Room was big and bed was comfortable. Bathroom and shower were fine too. Fortunately I was only there for one night,but I certainly will not be back the next time I am in the city.",3

After a few minutes they told me the kitchen called and told them they couldn't sell any more of those sandwiches today. What????? 4. There are no towel racks. 5. I was in and out of the room and out all evening and got no housekeeping service at all.  6. My second night here I couldn't sleep at all because someone was yelling and banging doors all night. I finally figured out how to call downstairs .  7. There is no free shuttle from the airport as one would expect an…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Excellent hotel,"We stayed at the Westin on a trip to watch the Detroit tigers.  The hotel was excellent.  Room was comfy and spacious.  Bathroom was extra large.  The pool felt like you were at a spa, not a hotel pool. Staff was very nice and as SPG members they gave us free a Wifi and offered us a $20 off the lowest rate I could find online b/c we decided to add an additional night to our stay.  Highly recommend, and If I am ever in Detroit again, I would stay at this top-notch Westin hotel. For sure a 4-star hotel in the heart of Detroit.

The check-in process is quick and the entire staff is friendly.  The rooms are a good size and were clean upon entering.  It looks as pictured.  The beds are pretty comfortable and you'll have a restful stay.  I have no complaints about my stay.  I even tried Roast and also 24 Grille situated inside of the hotel. It was pretty convenient to have them both downstairs.  It's situated in a good area and not far from other venues.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,My room was beautiful,"OK-  I'm a loyal Starwood guy, and I travel a lot.  So I probably got an upgrade.

If ever I am back in Detroit I'd only stay here.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Consistently Excellent,"I have stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac half a dozen times in the past year in a variety of rooms, each one excellent, beds are very comfortable, rooms are well-fitted with great views, large and open. This beautiful and historic hotel is well-situated downtown with access to all of the cultural and sports venues and near the hip Midtown, Eastern Market, and Corktown neighborhoods. The staff has always been pleasant and helpful. I haven't had much opportunity to try their breakfast (other than room service) and the two restaurants in-house are consistently good (not amazing). Just an all around good quality hotel, probably the best in Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,A Weekend at the Book Cadillac Hotel,"I was looking forward to staying here as I remember its grand reopening a few years ago as the Westin Book Cadillac. The Book Cadillac hotel has an interesting background and history going back to its opening in the late 20's when it was one of the grandest and tallest hotels in the world. The Operators of this hotel have missed a huge opportunity, if I were managing this hotel I would have old photographs and notes displayed about its past in the public areas and a complementary brochure in each room for the guests with pictures and  a chronicle of the history of the hotel.

The family members was my mom and she added me to her room. That day I made sure they had my reservation that I booked. They said yes. When the day came for me to check in for my reservation they couldn't find it and said because there were other people with reservation with the same last name ""the computer"" got confused!

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Spend your money somewhere else,We stayed at the Book Cadillac prior to moving overseas so we had 6 suitcases. None of the hotel personally made any effort to help us when we checked in. We had to find a luggage cart and load the it ourselves. Each time we left the hotel it took 15 to 20 minutes for the valet to pull the car around. The room could have used a thorough cleaning and the day we left we called for a luggage car twice. After 30 minutes we ferried our luggage to the elevator ourselves and then out to the front of the hotel. The hotel personnel in the lobby/entrance area couldn't even be bothered to hold the door for us. We only received assistance after unannounced that I was going to write a TripAdvisor review. ,2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Excellent -booked for my wife and son,"I booked a club room for my wife and 3 year old son while they were visiting the passport office.   The hotel made life very easy for me to book and pay on their behalf.   They found the staff helpful, the room a good size and very comfortable.   They made use of the club lounge that catered for both of them.  I chose the hotel after having dinner their while I had been in town a month previously and had stayed at the MGM and been in impressed by the quality of food.   While we don't visit Detroit often we will make the Westin our hotel of choice when in the city.  Good value for money. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Renovated and rescued, but not luxury",The hotel has a lot of history and some charm in the public rooms and spaces. The rooms are large but basic. I was on floor 10 - the bathroom was massive with a poor use of space - a shower / tub with inadequate water pressure and an isolated toilet and sink. The main bedroom had two queen beds with equally uncomfortable pillows. The staff are perhaps the saving grace of the hotel - they are efficient and friendly.,3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Solid Choice,The Westin is a big big hotel in downtown Detroit. It is close enough to walk to the sites within the downtown area - greektown and the waterfront. It is also walking distance from the Fox theatre.  The room i had was a good size with a big comfortable bed. The air conditioning was a bit loud and there was a bit of noise in the corridor.  There are a number of car parks nearby the hotel.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice Hotel!,"Look, it's not Le Sirenuse in Positano but Detroit ain't the Amalfi Coast is it!  However, this Westin was just fine.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,This is where to stay in Detroit,"Along with another couple, my wife and I travelled to Detroit to watch the Toronto Bllue Jays play the Detroit Tigers. Upon checking in I ran into some of the Toronto Blue Jays players in the lobby which was an awesome bonus.  The hotel is very clean and is very well appointed.  I don't think there could have been a better place to stay in the downtown.  We are able to walk to the ball park or various restaurants which was nice.  Jays game in Detroit...STAY HERE!!!!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Best Luxury Hotel In Downtown Detroit,Downtown Detroit is growing but the Westin Book Cadillac is the best luxury hotel out side of a casino property. The hotel rooms and suites are comfortable. I love the Westin's Heavenly bed. The hotel staff is nice and the aesthetics are great.  This property also houses Micheal Symon's Roast Restaurant. You know him from Iron Chef and the Chew. The food is awesome. There is one other restaurant on the property called 24 Grille. It's great for Sunday Brunch with the cost of unlimited mimosas. They show sports games if you are into that. My only complaint is the hotel valet parking. They are the worst.  I've been frequenting the hotel for over 6 years and I can tell you that the service has diminished over time. Park your patience with Valet.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Convenient,"Overall a decent hotel.  Front desk staff are friendly and check-in is quick, which is great when you've had a long day of travel to get there.  Rooms are average, but walls are thin - as others have mentioned, noise can be a bit of an issue if you are a light sleeper.  Compared to other options in the area, in my opinion, this is the best bet.  I'll be spending more time in Detroit in the future and will continue to stay at teh Westin Book Cadillac.",3

The location, in a beautiful historic downtown skyscraper, is just right. The service is OK in most respects. But there is not much competition in Downtown Detroit and the management seems to be comfortable in this knowledge. We have become reluctant regulars and lukewarm at best about the Book Cadillac. Most of our dissatisfaction comes from one big shortcoming. For years now we have tried to get the Book Cadillac management to pay more attention to this one very important part of running a fine hotel, but they haven't, at least not in our opinions.

Bed and sheets are very comfortable. -bar:  bar in the lobby serves really good drinks. -restaurant:  location of ""roast"" by iron chef Michael Symon.  Very good.    Negatives: -noise:  walls are very thin.  Also, doors do not drown out any noise from the hallway.  We heard conversations from the room next door and other things.   -check in:  front desk seems very unorganized.  A lot of upset people.   -valet and parking:  expensive.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Lovely hotel but noise is an issue,"Just returned from an overnight stay at the Westin. Check-in at 5:30pm went well although I got a sense from the guests around us that many had been waiting for rooms for quite some time. We stayed on the 21st floor and didn't have much of a view but the room was clean and comfortable. Service in the lobby bar was fantastic. My only complaint is that hallway noise at night was very, very loud. People weren't even talking loudly or screaming...the walls/doors are just that thin. Makes sleeping at night somewhat difficult despite the comfy bed and pillows. I would recommend requesting a room away from the elevators as I imagine the noise would be non-stop in that part of each floor. ",4

Go explore, as this hotel is in a perfect location. Visit the 24 Grille. Staff is knowledgeable of the menu and will give a good recommendation. Food is excellent. One downfall, beware of the valet!!! Went thru my center console to a point I suspect they took the car for a joy ride. Auto seat adjusted, radio stations reprogrammed, mirror adjusted. Record your mileage before giving them your car. REMOVE ALL VALUABLES. Yes I did report this to the Valet Manager or what I think is a manager. As well as the Hotel Management. Now in the process of contacting Westin corporate. The Westin management needs to replace this Valet service. Immediately.",5

I was assigned a room with two doubles instead of my request of a king, but I made the best of it.  The big problem with my room was the proximity to the elevator.  When other guest waited for the elevator it was like they were having conversations in my room. The toilet and facial tissues were both low on check in, but I let it go as I figured it would be checked the next morning.  My room was not cleaned because I chose green service which apparently means house keeping doesn't even go in your room.

The rooms are spacious. The bathroom is well lit. There aren't any refrigerators in the rooms. You will need to bring toothpaste , mouth wash and shower cap.

The elevators were quick and took us up to a beautiful room on the 14th floor. There was literally no view - but we weren't there to look out the window anyways.  The bed was incredibly comfy and the rain shower head was heavenly. It was great being so high up as there was NO noise!  We parked two blocks away for cheaper parking so cannot comment on valet.  There are some really nice restaurants in the hotel itself, and if you walk around the block there's some more little bars.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Peak pricing?,We paid $$$ for the room and I expected more. The location is great and we walked to Comerica. But I was expecting more. The room was clean but typically appointed. The valet parking has challenges at peak times. This is probably the best quality in downtown but I felt like I paid too much.  My 3 rating is based on lack of perceived value. ,3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Almost Perfect,"We stayed in the hotel in May Friday through Sunday (should've reviewed this sooner) for a family wedding in MI.  The hotel itself is upscale, and the rooms were very nice and comfortable.  Really nothing negative to say about that, but I was puzzled as to why housekeeping didn't straighten the room on Saturday.  It was as we left it.  I hated the elevator system of this hotel.  You MUST use your card, whether there is one person on the elevator or 10.  No mention of this was given at check-in, so there were times when it was chaotic on the elevators for those that had no instruction on how to use the room card to access the higher floors.  Honestly, it is a confusing system, and there were times we were on a crowded elevator waiting for people to use their cards in the ""slot""…",4

Wasn't expecting that much from the hotel, but it exceeded expectations for a Westin.  Staff was super friendly and helpful!  Design of interior is smart, elegant, and sophisticated.  Very good first impression.  Our suite was much larger than expected.  Design, again, was sophisticated and relaxing.  Great bathroom.    The exception was happy hour up in the executive lounge.  Service was advertised from 6 to 8.  We arrived at 6:10 and no one there other than two other guests wondering about happy hour.  I called guest services and reported.  ""Someone will be up shortly.""  Eventually a young woman arrived, but I suspect that this is not her regular duty.  Very slow in getting out the food.  At 6:30 I…",5

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Best Hotel in Detroit,"Every once in awhile, we decide to spend a weekend in Detroit. Almost every time we choose to stay at the Book Cadillac.   We were greeted warmly and genuinely, and were honored our request. We also were given (in our room) champagne for our 8th anniversary.   We had a beautiful view of Detroit and the Ambassador Bridge which looked beautiful at night.   The Heavenly Bed is still the best hotel bed I've slept on, although it could be a bit more firm for our taste.  Maybe five different people offered us help/assistance while we were there. We didn't need it, but what a great staff. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Right Choice For Our First Time to Detroit,"Our weekend in Detroit was planned around a family reunion. We chose the Cadillac Westin due to it being our first time to the city (so we wanted to stay downtown) and we were seeking comfort and a relaxing environment after full days with family. The Westin hit the mark for what we were looking for. We went to two of the three bars and 2 of the restaurants. Staying here was easy whether it was the check in process, valet, or just getting drinks. There were two weddings that weekend and the hotel was large enough that we never felt bombarded with people. We had the Jr Suite on the 16th floor that gave us a little more room for our stuff and visitors. We would stay here again.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice hotel,"I stayed here for a weekend trip to see the NY Mets/Tigers stadium. Its located in the downtown area of Detroit with many bars/restaurants all within walking distance. The hotel has two (2) restaurants located inside, both looked like great places to eat. The hotel also has a nice size lobby with a bar. The room I stayed in was a good size with large windows overlooking the downtown area. I used the gym, which for a hotel gym was pretty good. The gym had some machines and free weights along with the usual treadmills. There was an indoor pool and hot tub located next to the gym. The one complaint I had was someone was smoking marijuana in their room and the smoke was filling up the hallway. The smoke got worse as the day into the night progressed, to the point where you can smell…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Club floor beds,"While the club floor does offer larger rooms, the beds in Room 2307 desperately need to be replaced.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,A gem in downtown Detroit ,"I left today, completely impressed with the Westin.   Friendly staff, great service, always willing to help.   We had a snafu with getting our car when we were getting ready to leave, and Leslie C., with Premier Parking, and a hotel representative went over the top to make us comfirtable while we waited, buying us lunch and comping our parking fees.  A valet had our keys, forgot them in his pocket, so it took a minute to track him down.  Not even this snag could lower my rating because the over the top customer service was so impressive.  Thanks for the memorable stay, Westin!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Excellent hotel in downtown Detroit,"I stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac in early July while attending a wedding.  It is a lovely hotel within walking distance of the casinos, riverfront etc.  My room was on the 20th floor, and I had a fabulous view of the city.  The bed was comfortable with lots of pillows.  The bathroom was plenty big with all of the amenities.  There was very little noise and a huge TV, and I slept really well.  The staff was always very friendly and helpful.  We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant, and the food and service were both good (except they didn't have the gluten-free item that my friend wanted).  The front desk was helpful when I checked in because I couldn't remember if I was a Starwoods member or not.  The nice young lady looked me up, found me and updated my information! …",5

The Westin is a great place to stay while exploring some of the less rough corners of a city struggling to regenerate.  Nearby to many trendy downtown bars and corporate centers, the Westin provides easy accessibility to the waterfront and is within walking distance to 2 casinos if that's your thing!   The customer service was truly wonderful.  Everyone from the concierge to the doorman were lovely and helpful.  We utilized the pool area quite a bit and really enjoyed that-- I skipped working out... but had I fulfilled on my fitness goals, I would've had a well equipped facility to assist me in that!

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great Hotel in an Amazing City,"Before getting into the hotel review, I want to start with a few words about Detroit. This city has been taken through the ringer. It’s rough, it’s worn down, it’s aged. But it really is an amazing place. Detroit has a real and genuine grit and toughness that even the most hipster neighbourhoods in other cities could never replicate. It’s a city that’s seen it all, but it comes through with friendliness and earnestness that is completely admirable and welcoming. Yes, you have to watch yourself and be careful, yes, there is poverty, and yes, it’s very sad in places. But if you look past the top layers, you’ll find people that are trying very hard to build their city up again, and it was such a pleasure discovering pockets of neighbourhoods only to find excellent restaurants run…",5

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Not what I expected,"Stayed there based on a recommendation that this was the best hotel in downtown Detroit...and it might be. The hotel itself is decent. It's a typical hotel but I didn't see anything unique or inviting about it. Nothing that made me think - I'm in Detroit! Maybe there was a Cadillac somewhere but I didn't see it:-). Seems like a missed opportunity to add some local flare to the decor. The room was just average. The room phone didn't work. We weren't told about the minibar but were glad to discover it because room service ends very early. Argh. The front deck staff was nonchalant. Not what I expected for such a pricey hotel. That said, it was a good location from which to explore downtown Detroit. The urban garden across the street was especially cool.",3

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Excellent location for downtown,"We stayed on a Friday night when in town for a concert at the Masonic Temple. The location was a $5 cab ride from the hotel and a $10 cab ride on return--made sense to us and saved us from having to pull our car from valet and park at the venue.   We received an upgraded room on arrival, although the room size was magnificent we traded for a change from one King to two double beds. It worked out. We slept well and were even able to have the window open for fresh air during some of our stay. The room was clean, with some wear. We love that the water was free in our room--whether this was part of the upgrade or not, we are not sure. The staff are pleasant, the facility secure and downtown Detroit was a fun place to be, despite the construction going on in the area.  We had hoped…",4

Starting with planning the event, Emily Frederick was exceptional at coordinating and  finding the right details while working within our budget. She far exceeds professional standards, was timely with emails and worked with us for last minute requests. We never felt like we were dealing with the large corporation like the Westin and she was a friendly face during a daunting process.

As we getting ready to go out again for dinner housekeeping finally came by at 5:30 p.m.  We asked if they could give us another 30 minutes since we were in the middle of freshening up.  They said no problem.  When we returned later than night, again the room had NOT been touched.

There was nothing.  When I picked it up from valet after my meeting, we again went around the car and there was a ding in the door that was not there prior.

And we were so right.   Perhaps because it was a quieter weekend in Detroit, or perhaps we got lucky, we had a huge room. And it was in a quiet end of the hallway with the softest, best bed ever. Everything was clean, and well-kept and modern.   The hotel is considered somewhat in the downtown core, which is a bit tricky as there's not much always happening in the downtown core in Detroit on a weekend, but we did have a farmer's market one day, and a few good restaurants.

Went for a swim in the morning and tried out the hot tub...everything was clean and well maintained.

Low points:  I had trouble getting my key card to work in the elevator, and I heard others who had the same problem. It should not be stressful to simply use the elevator.  Valet was SLOOOW.

We found the rooms to be nice and stayed in both a suite and a general king room as well.

Of the four (registration) counters, only one was open and operating at the 3:00 PM check-in time.  Again, this line was at least five (5) parties deep.   When I was finally able to check-in, we were advised that there was not a room yet available.  We waited in the lobby with several other parties for over 1.5 hours before a room became available.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,So so,"First, it was a beautiful room, very clean, very spacious. There was no problem with the room at all, just a bit warmer then I would have liked it. One of the problems was the parking, it was a mess. There were at least 4 valets just standing around. When I walked up to one he pointed at the guy that way trying to help people and said, ""Our supervisor will help you."" And then turned and started talking to the others that were just standing there. So, after about 10 minutes we got our valet ticket and headed in to check in. To check in you have to go up to the 2nd floor. Once we found it, the guy that checked us in just asked for a credit card, went over the room we had reserved, and then seemed to be done with us.

I ended up with a Club Room which includes free breakfast (nice) and evening appetizers (a bit less nice).  It was a busy holiday weekend, but even so I think the place was a bit overpriced. I've stayed in 5-star places in Hawaii for about the same price.  Additionally, I was surprised to when I got my final bill, to find an $8 charge for internet. I neither signed up for the fee-service internet, nor did I use it. (And shouldn't this be included in a Club Room anyway? Sigh).

I would've rated it 4 out of 5 no problem had I just stayed that one time.  Every time seemed to get a little worse.  The second time, they once again couldn't find my reservation, and also had forgotten to put the credit card authorization on file as well.

The valet drop off is right next to an intersection which wreaks havoc on traffic. When I finally made it to the area, sometimes, I had to walk over to the valet guys who were standing by the door and walk them over to my car. Getting your car back is the real pain though. They often don't pick up the phone and it can take a good 30-40 mins to get your car back. And you're likely double-parked in so yeah, good luck.  2. Elevator woes. This is related to above, basically getting in and out of this hotel is SUPER SUPER hard. We had a ton of issues with the room…",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Detroit Westin Cadillac Hotel nice place,I was very pleased with the Westin in downtown Detroit. The city and the surrounding area has been and is being rejuvenated for a pleasant experience in Detroit. I attended a conference at the Como Center which was very close to the Westin. The restaurants at the Westin were all well run and I had associates that dined and stayed at the Westin as well.  The rooms and the staff were very nice. I would go there again. ,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Wonderful hotel, great location",Stayed here one night after a long day of travel.  Hotel is in a renovated old historical building.  Even still my room was spacious and very comfortable.  The fitness room provided plenty of equipment to get in a good workout. While I was there the spa was closed but looked to be quite nice.  The hotel was within easy waking distance of the sports facilities and many dining options.  The staff was friendly and helpful with any questions and concerns.  When in the area I will be back.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great hotel carved out of an old building,"I stayed at this property and was impressed by this grand old building near downtown Detroit. The Westin managed to create a very nice hotel using the older shell of the building. You can tell that it was not originally designed to be a hotel by the oddly shaped rooms. However, they've done a great job furnishing it and making you think you are in a brand new property.  The registration desk is up a level from the motor lobby, and is very open and bright. The desk folks were very nice and helpful, and check in was a breeze.   The room was bright and open, but as I mentioned, a little oddly shaped. The desk was off in its own little area, but quite functional. The bed and pillows were great, and there was no noise to speak of. The bathroom sported both a nice tub, as well as a…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Best hotel in the New Detroit,"Detroit does not have 5-star hotels downtown, but for a 4-star place the Westin Book Cadillac has a staff with great attitudes toward work. That makes all the difference. Like most Westin properties, the styling is cool and it is paired well with the marble and granite left over from the grand days of the Book Cadillac. The remodeling was a few years ago, but the shower heads, towels, beds, pillows, HVAC, etc, seem brand new. The rooms were a bit short on things like shower cap, and a refrig would be nice although this is a business trip place for the most part. As in reviews below, walls are thin, but I had no trouble with valet parking. Motor bar has creative cocktails that are fun for happy hour.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,An oasis of upscale comfort in downtown Detroit,"Largely due to self-inflicted injuries, Detroit has fallen out of favor as a tourist destination, so it was with some apprehension that I agreed to go there for business.  I was pleasantly surprised both at the resurgence of downtown Detroit and the comfort of the Westin Book Cadillac hotel.  I can recommend the in-house restaurant, ""24 Grille"" as well.  A recently re-done interior that projects elegance, clean, well-appointed rooms and a welcoming staff experience.    The breakfast restaurant, the ""Boulevard Room"", serves a nice selection of organic, high-antioxidant, healthy foods, with the typical greasy American fare as a second choice. That's a nice alternative, though the squeezed juices (I had a beet, kale, ginger concoction) should be approached with some care.  There…",4

Hotel is within walking distance to all the downtown attractions, Greektown, Comerica park, etc.  However, if you don't feel comfortable walking, cabs and Ubers are always nearby and very reasonable since it's such a short distance. Near many restaurants as well.  Rooms (double beds) are updated,spacious and clean even with 4 people in the room.  Large bathroom area too! Was not impressed with the spa, especially the ""lobby"" area of it.  Or, I should say, the lack of one. However, the staff was very kind.  Also, food and drink prices at ALL the hotel's restaurants were VERY pricey.  Example, a glass of orange juice at breakfast was $7.00, a burger and fries for lunch at their grill was $22!!!  Would stay here again if ever in the area, but would probably venture…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Very nice hotel in downtown,"My husband was here for a work conference and I joined him along with our infant for the week.  When we checked in, we were told that we had a premium double booked by the conference organizers.  We needed a king because of our baby and were told we could downgrade to a standard rm with a king.  Obviously we need the space and weren't happy with either choice, but David (Patterson?) at checkin was helpful and got us into a large King rm (not sure if it was a premium or executive).  The hotel is very clean and classy.  From the moment we drove in, Herschel was helpful getting all of our stuff onto a trolley.  And we had lots of stuff!  We ate at the Motor bar once.

My room was great and I found the service excellent.  We stayed in an Executive Suite (not a Club Suite) for two nights (Friday/Saturday, checking out Sunday morning). The room was every bit as clean and well-maintained as I could have hoped. The suite was comfortable and generously sized for the two of us and our small dog. We ordered room service three times and it was always efficient, courteous and tasty.

I would definitely stay at this hotel again in the future.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Physician ,So I arrived at the hotel and was pleased with the front desk staff and the room was clean however I had a theft and during the evaluation by the housekeeping supervisor a less than conciliatory tone was used after it was pointed out that though the housekeeper denied she entered my room the smart key lock recorded her swipe on the day in question.  It is always disconcerting to sustain a theft but to then go through the indignity of being lied to by the management only makes it worse.  So I would advise if you stay at this hotel you use the safe and lock any high end garments in your suitcase.,1
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Gracious Hotel in Downtown,"Stayed four nights in the hotel and relaxed each evening. On site restaurant and coffee shop are both quite good and very convenient. Hotel staff is helpful and the building is well kept. Our room was modestly sized, but adequate, and there was a nice view out the seventh floor window. Electronics and such are all to standard. Miss having a microwave and mini-frig in the room. Otherwise, for price, an excellent choice with convenient parking garage adjacent to the hotel, just off Michigan Avenue. I would gladly stay here again on future trips.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Very nice hotel,"Hotel was very clean and staff was friendly and accommodating. On site restaurants are very good and reasonably priced. Only issue I had was the noise in the hallways. There is a large gap between the floor and door which allows noises to enter room. I put a towel down and this muffled most of the noise. Otherwise, very nice hotel. ",4

I'm not a super neat or clean person, but these things stood out at this price point. the staff was beyond kind and accommodating, but even when I went to check out and asked for someone to help carry our bags, it took over half an hour, and I gave up and ended up carrying them out myself until the…",2

Returned that night with shirt disrupted and my daughter's hair tie (skrunchy) that was buried in outer pocket was now outside of the zipped outer pocket.

When we checked in we found our ""executive suite,"" was just like a regular hotel room, of the variety you might expect from a Hampton Inn. At check-in we mentioned we were in for a romantic getaway, but I guess since we didn't mention it at booking, we were not offered the champagne and chocolate strawberries we saw being distributed to other guest rooms.  The hotel itself is really rather ordinary.  It's big.  And old.  But really more conducive to business than leisure and not at all romantic.  We were very disappointed all around.

The staff are some of the friendliest of any of the SPG properties that I stayed at. They all understood the pains of being away from home and took the time to learn our names and room preferences. The rooms are very large and spacious. The suites are great. The only downside to the WBC is that lounge is lacking amenities offered at many of their competitors. The food in the lounge at night isn't very good, and there aren't many healthy options. It would also be nice to if they had wine and beer available in the lounge.   I also recommend checking out Roast while you stay, the happy hour is a steal. Avoid the 24 Grille restaurant, it is very disappointing and extremely overpriced,…",5

We were in town for less than 24 hours, so the convenience of the quick check in and out and the valet made this a perfect stay.

True to the Westin culture, the hotel retains elements of the past in its skeletal architecture but revamps and refines its interior to a quality spec.  Front desk personnel are solicitous to a fault and see to their guests every need with alacrity and a smile indicating that you are- indeed- a valued guest.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great Westin Located in the Heart of D,"This storied property which was originally opened in 1924 has gone through several transitions until it finally opened as the newly renovated Westin in 2008. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the rooms are just OK in size and lack the historical feeling they should have.  Located in the heart of Detroit within walking distance of Lafayette Coney Island (a true landmark and must stop), People Mover (above ground train with stops at Cobo, Joe Louis and Greektown) and less than a mile from MGM, this is a great location.   Hotel features two pretty good restaurants and three bars. Roast is an upscale steakhouse best known for its ""beast of the day"". Very nice city like bar. 24/7 Grille is typical American menu with very large bar and TV's. Lobby bar very quiet…",4

It was a short walk to the people mover station to get around to the arena and to Greektown to meet up with friends. The hotel itself is lovely. The beds were comfortable, most notably the bedding itself. :) The rooms were very spacious. The only odd thing was the way the sound carried from the room below us through the vent in the bathroom.

You won't regret it.",5

The Book Cadillac is one of my favorite hotels in the world.  The staff go above and beyond for you.   Ms. Greene at the front desk has to be the most attentive and helpful front desk managers I have ever met.  The club lounge is a great place to watch the world go by while overlooking the river towards Canada.  Don't miss Roast on the ground level for a meal you will not forget.

And, no one acknowledged me or the other gentlemen while in line.  Just ignored us for 1/2 hour.  I did not appreciate that.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Would have been EXCELLENT except for checkin mashup,"First, the bad......I arrived on Saturday Jan. 23/16 and the hotel was very busy with Disney auditions, the Auto Show and a Red Wings hockey game all happening that day. I'll say right up front that I was early.......it was around 1:30 PM. A pleasant woman staffer at checkin said my room was not yet ready (totally fair) but then proceeded to ""pre-register"" me. I never thought twice about that. She said they would call my cellphone when the room was available. And they took my bags for safe keeping. Nice, I thought.  I then went to the 24 Grille for lunch (it was very good) and very soon I got my phone call. I left the others in my party at the table while I went back to the lobby to complete my check in.  Well, now the lobby was filled with folks who were scattered-about,…",4

The hotel is beautiful and close to many downtown attractions.  I love the historic aspect from the outside and the room was very clean and accommodating.  We ended up eating in the hotel at Roast which is an exceptional steak house.  Price is higher which was expected and the wine selection is fantastic.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Worst Price-Quality Ratio I've Ever Experienced,"When I spend over $500 a night on a hotel, I'd like to feel pampered.  Our experience at the Westin Book-Cadillac was anything but pampering.  Here's why.  Admittedly, we visited on a busy evening.  Nonetheless, the valet service was completely unprepared for the volume of visitors, resulting in an additional 25 minutes to circle the block (at the insistence of the city police) to queue for valet parking.  We booked a club level room, thinking we'd relax with some hors d'oeuvres and a drink before our evening.  The club lounge was a disaster.  Dark, small, unclean and void of food and drink.  Three bruised apples in a bowl, some half cut cheese and a few bottles of water was what was offered.  We asked the attendant what was up and if we could get a glass of wine.  We were told…",1

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Tired needs updating ,"Overall not a bad experience. When I walked into my room, it smelled like foot odor covered with febreeze. The linens were thread bare. The shower curtain had holes. I stayed here about 4 years ago and the rooms looked exactly the same. Watch out for the door stop in the bathroom. It on the floor in front of the bathtub. Bad placement. I kicked it several times. Should be removed. It's not near the people mover and if you're going to cobo in the winter, you want to stay inside as much as you can. The nearest station is 2 blocks. You might as well go ahead and walk the 4 blocks to cobo. Front desk staff was super nice. Specifically Courtney.  ",4

We have stayed here many times in the past but this visit is a total disappointment.    Upon arrival last night we noticed the towel bars in the bathroom were falling off the walls and the shower head was loose and spraying water everywhere.   Then we asked for additional towels and one was unwashed.   This morning the television would not work. Upon telling the front desk they said they would rectify the situation.   Upon returning to the room the shower and towel bar situation were not fixed.  At least the dirty towels were removed.  The tv still did not work.

We got a really great deal at the Westin Cadillac so we decided to stay here.  It looks much further on the map but it turned out to be much closer to all of the action then I had thought.  I always thought it'd be too far away but the location is great!  It's only a short walk to Greek Town and not much further to the field.  The room was really, quiet, clean, large, and cozy and they also had two bars.  One is just off the hotel lobby and the other is a bar and restaurant and great for a nightcap.  It's also a very safe area with a lot of construction going on and we did walk back late at night both nights (after 1am).  Overall, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone going…",5

I was told there was a structure in back where we could park. At arrival I was told by the attendant that they no longer offered hotel parking. Luckily, we found nearby on the street parking. Other than parking issues it's a very luxe and pampering hotel. I love the late weekend checkout they offer. No service issues, very clean, would book again.",4

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Beautiful Hotel; management needs improvement,"I have now stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac three times in the last 2 years.  Each time the room was excellent, the hotel is beautiful and the setting is terrific.  Problem:  the management of the hotel is consistently poor.  I had to call to have my room cleaned twice in 4 days.  Asked for towels and pillows and had to call multiple times.  Talent for car slow, even when not crowded.  The room next to us had smokers (in a non-smoking hotel, and management did nothing about it in spite of our concerns being raised with them.  If they can get the service up to the caliber of the hotel, it will be a great destination.  Without it, I can't give it higher than average.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Terrible stay,"Took my wife there for what was suppose to be an amazing night...turned out to be one of the worst nights of my life. Don't go to the Spa, they have no idea how to give messages. I had pre ordered wine and strawberries to the room. Not there on time. I was up from 430-630 cause the people across the hall were having a multi room party. It took two calls to the front desk to get the problem resolved. Really disappointed in our trip as I worked hard to surprise my wife and make a memory for us.  ",1

The service here is un-beatable by any other Detroit hotel! Despite liking the Marriott at the Renaissance Center, my favorite hotel in downtown Detroit would have to be the Westin. From check in to check out, the staff is there every step of the way to make sure that you are completely happy, and are more than willing to go above and beyond service standards to make your stay a great one. The rooms are excellent, though they could use updating in the future. The beds are amazing (as always with Westins), the bathrooms are also wonderfully designed (again, as always with Westins).",5

The room was spotless and modern, the beds were comfortable, there were enough pillows to prop up the Elephant Man, the TV worked fine, and so on.I can't say I'd pay $425 or whatever it was a night, but if I ever return to Detroit and have hotel points to pay for it, I'll be back in the Westin again.",5

The ""Lollipop"" lamb chops from 24Grille were flavorful.  The unsettling thing about the hotel is that it is in a pretty sketchy area right downtown.  I believe there are at least 2 abandoned buildings directly across from the hotel - and many more all around.

We went to the bar inside the hotel, 24 Grille, where received great service from the bartender.   The only thing I didn't like was the hold. They put a $50 hold on my account and said it was for incidentals. I used the valet services and expected those fees to come out of incidentals, but they charged my credit card for the valet and still kept the separate $50 hold on my account.

Once inside you would think you were in any newer hotel pretty generic lobby, rooms etc. not much to show the old grandeur that this building once had.

We had hired a couple to perform dueling pianos, which really made the event really special.  As we were in the heart of the city we hit the casino's then coneys before ending the evening.

Lines were long and lacked some of the special customer service you would expect from a hotel like this especially from the front desk staff.

One negative point, there was a huge gap under the door to the hall which let in a lot of ambient light and LOTS of noise from drunk people returning in the wee hours.

The breakfast is not a self-service as usual, this is like a restaurant where you have to order your plates but the price is expansive, for instance 6$ for the coffee or 9$ if you want some fruits.

We booked late so could only get a king size bed but the room was large enough to accommodate a cot - which was a super comfortable single size mattress. There was a fridge where we kept some snacks.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,What a nice Westin,"Normally we are Marriott people, but decided to stray for this visit as our company had special rates set up and I must say well worth it.  The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit made me realize there are other hotels that uphold the standards we look for.  The staff was great, room was clean, and close to anything we could need.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Excellent stay,"The Westin Book Cadillac hotel was one of the best experiences I have had. Comfortable bed, comfortable room, a large bathroom/tub, etc... The staff was so helpful and professional. Everyone who works there seems to truly care about their job. The Roast restaurant is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to (iron chef owned Michael Symon's restaurant). The only critique I have is that there were no towel racks outside the bathtub....no where to place your towel after your shower.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Good experience,Visited on business for 2 nights - quick and easy check in and out. Service at the bar was pretty good and the food there was also surprisingly good. Seemed like a good location although we didn't venture too far. Easy walk to exhibition venue if that's the purpose of the trip. Didn't take breakfast so no comment on that. Taxi was $60 to the airport without a tip. I would use this again for sure. ,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Very good business hotel,Good location in downtown Detroit. Very nice building and staff were welcoming the  moment they see you. Was on the 21st floor so had a great view of the city and the river. Room was pleasant with comfortable beds and the bathroom well stocked with some good choice of toiletries.   Loved the club lounge on the 23rd floor where I enjoyed some lovely breakfasts and some hors d'oeuvres in the evening. Was very happy that I was able to go to some business locations very easily from the hotel including the Renaissance Centre.   Would definitely recommend it for business.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Massive rooms mediocre service,"I might give this hotel another try because of the size of the rooms.  Both the sleeping space and the bath room were well over the usual hotel room size.   However, the service needs some improvement.  When I arrived, the two people manning the front desk were very friendly and helpful.  I was assured that my complimentary wi-fi was taken care of; however, when it was time to check out it was on my bill.  When I arrived at my room after checking in, I noticed that the comforter had a stain.  I called to have it changed; and waited over an hour and a half.  But the staff did not change the bedding... they simply handed me the new linens to change myself.  They also brought me a pillow I had not requested.  By the time they finally arrived, the hotel restaurants had closed...They…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Average room and front desk excellent doormen and valet,We decided to try a different hotel for the annual Jazz festival.  The moment we arrived we debated the cost of valet since the garage was immediately behind the hotel.  The cost was worth every dollar.  The hotel is surrounded by vacant buildings and homeless citizens are one block away. All the young men working the entry were so nice and full of recommendations.  Additionally the bar/restaurant had great bartenders.  Great wine recomendations.  And Kudos to the young woman working the lobby bar alone Sunday night.  She was accommodating an so pleasant despite working everything on her own.   Big negative of the room - the entry door opens immediately to the bathroom  and our room window faced a brick wall.   Will we stay again? Yes.   The great Service made all the difference.,3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Classic hotel restored to perfection!,"We stayed here last weekend for 1 night. Valet worked great, we checked in and our room was fantastic - clean, up to date, nice bathroom. The lobby bar is really cool too. I was actually involved in the construction of this hotel a few years back so it was nice to finally spend the night.   We had a little problem - at about 2 am some people decided to have a party in our hallway. Very loud and inconsiderate people. But we called the desk and security took care of it in about 15 minutes!! Nice.  The location is great - walk to Comerica Park of Ford Field. A cab can get you anywhere else for $5-$10.   I think this is the nicest luxury hotel in the city!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Great location with spacious, quiet rooms","We stayed here twice, first at the beginning of our trip when we flew into Detroit, and again at the end of the trip. The first time they gave us a huge, beautiful room on the 21st floor, and gave us free breakfast because the room wasn't available at check-in time (they get packed when there is an event like a Lions game). They also very nicely added a bottle of champagne (on both visits!) since we were in town to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Second visit we also got a nice room (not as nice as the first, but still very nice with a huge bathroom) on the 20th floor. Both rooms were quiet, had nice views and nice décor. The hotel is central to the downtown area which has lovely architecture and some great new shops and restaurants. We could walk to everything, which was…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,A beautiful hotel is ugly if the service is not up to par!," This 1920's hotel is beautiful in a great location. But, it lacks service.My room had no view and had a musty smell. I went to desk to change it. Was told my group rate would not allow it, unless, I paid extra. Yet, all my colleagues were upgraded to club suites, which, made no sense, since, some used my credit card to secure charges. I stay at many Westins. This one sucks! Keys never worked. Breakfast and bars were expensive, & very slow. Staffed badly..Took , manager,rudely replied ""what do you want me to do?"" ",2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Absolutely amazing ,"We stayed at the westin for a wedding. The night before, we had stayed at a crowne plaza and could not wait to leave and go to the westin. Wow, what a difference. The westin was absolutely amazing. From the valet who brought me my bag I left in the car, to the bell-hop  who talked to me about jewelry.... just great! The rooms are gorgeous and so so spacious. Our room was insanely clean and tidy! Every bit of the hotel was clean, beautiful, and perfect. We absolutely will be back. ",5

The wedding was beautiful and the staff we great. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Comfortable, quiet, roomy","Never having visited this town before, I stopped here on my way to a conference in Boston. I stayed at 3 Westins in a row on this trip (9 consecutive Westin nights), and this was the nicer of the three. There was plenty of room to move around, and a separate bath and shower (although the bathtub was pretty shallow). The concierge sent me a note before a trip, asking about my plans, and she had a little packet ready for me when I got there, complete with a bag of three sodas and three bags of potato chips! The self-parking next door was quite reasonable at $10 a day. The room was quiet, and no earplugs necessary for this light sleeper. The property is 2 blocks from the people mover. The main negative is that breakfast will set you back over $30 with tax and tip, that and no free…",5

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Wedding night,My new husband and I stayed here after our wedding. The room was so beautiful! Very cozy and inviting. Probably the nicest hotel I have stayed in. The building is gorgeous. A larger walk in shower would have been nice but the existing faucets and multiple shower heads were nice. We brought our cards from our wedding to go through and to use some of the cash for our honeymoon. We didn't realize until 8 days later that we left a card behind with a significant amount of money in it. I thought it was a long shot but called to see if someone found it. They had it!!!! Couldn't believe it! Anywhere else and I think that money would have been long gone. We will definitely be back to stay!!,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Best Hotel in downtown Detroit,"This hotel is the best bet for a luxurious property in downtown Detroit. It has an appealing historical character, yet is well appointed and redesigned. The restoration process kept the architectural integrity of the building intact. The rooms are decent and well designed. The public spaces are inviting and spacious. The valet and bell people are very nice and offer good service. Front desk is decent. Service in general could be a problem in Detroit especially in the restaurants on the property and housekeeping. However, despite of some service challenges, this hotel has great management. Mrs. Schultz is a great general manager. She make the spg brand look good.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice Updated Hotel Needs improvement on Service and Procedure ,The hotel itself was nice and appeared to have been newly updated which was nice. When we arrived we had to wait for over an hour for our room to become available which is unacceptable considering we arrived at 5pm check in time is 3. This room had been paid for since June and we were told it's not their fault they were full the previous night. For a hotel with this ticket price the customer service was very rude by some but was also excellent by others so don't let a few spoil the work of the others. While we waited for the room with hundreds of other people I might add we were given a complimentary drink which we assumed would be for both people in our party but low in behold we were asked to pay for the second drink while we waited. To top the whole experience off we were…,2
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Very nicely renovated historic hotel in the heart of downtown Detroit,"I enjoyed my stay at the Book Cadillac.  It is amazing to think the hotel building was at one time shuttered and vacant.  The architects did a nice job renovating this historic building that is conveniently located.  The rooms are nice - beds are comfortable.  Bathrooms are huge, though perhaps could be a little plusher with amenities.  All in all a very pleasant place to stay. Service is good.",4

However, that is probably the best that can be said, and given the dearth of great lodging choices is downtown Detroit, that fact is the only reason for the survival of this property. Given the new a loft hotel which is much closer to the venues, it will be interesting to see the long term viability of this hotel. Detroit downtown seems to be finally coming out of its long slump. This is at best a average Westin- ok rooms, totally lacking in turndown service, ok staff, average dining . Area around hotel has been severely depressed, although buildings are being renovated now. I would definately look at newer properties in the stadium area as they come on line. Best thing about hotel is valet service, but…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Good and quick stay for the Tigers game,"I like the location of the Westin Book Cadillac for time before and after events at Comerica Park.  It is close enough to get to the park easily, but far enough away to not have any traffic issues.  Check in and check out were very easy.  Our room location wasn't the best, but we were able to check-in over an hour before the normal time, so nothing negative from me about the interior room.  We did choose the club level, which was a substantial increase in rate.  I'm sure the room was bigger than a standard room, but the actual club lounge was not worth any additional cost.  Other Westin Clubs I've used have been clean and stocked with lots of snacks and drinks, including complimentary beer and wine in the afternoons.  This Westin Club did not include this benefit, had few snacks…",4

The second visit (a room for 3 people), the room was even more spacious and the bathroom was quite large. The beds are luxurious and so comfortable to sleep in and best of all, the entire staff was pleasant, friendly, helpful, smiling, etc...

Despite the hotel being busy with the ZBB concert, the Motorhead concert, and a wedding reception in the hotel, the front desk staff quickly greeted us and checked us in.  The hotel is pretty big and has a couple of restaurants (Roast and 24 Grille), a coffee shop, spa and gift shop.

When you walk in off of Michigan Avenue you just turn left and then head to the main foyer and turn right to take the escalators up to the 2nd floor to check in. The area there on that floor? Beautiful and clean. The check in staff are fast and friendly. Make you feel very welcome. I have never stayed in a Westin Property before due to the rates are always out of my budget, but I got this on the Labour Day Weekend for $152 Canadian dollars a night on Priceline and it was going for $300 Canadian dollars a night on Expedia.

The hotel itself is very beautiful, has an amazing gym, a Starbucks in the lobby and friendly staff. Our first night in town we went out for dinner (Grand Trunk Pub - Great Vibe, Food and Beer!) and we decided to go to Roast when we got back to the hotel for drinks and dessert.

Excellent staff, warm greeting upon check-in and we were able to check in early. There’s parking attached to the hotel and the hotel will validate. Had to go up a few level to find a spot.

We also enjoyed Roast restaurant in the Lobby. Overall a nice stay.",4

You need to come in knowing that this is an old landmark property that has been renovated. If you don't appreciate that sort of thing, then you don't want to stay here. If you do, like I do, then you'll appreciate the tribute to Detroit architecture and building design. Our room was on the top floor and gorgeous, new furniture and décor and very spacious. The hotel went out of their way to accommodate my family. We ordered room service and it was great. We met with friends and had drinks at the hotel restaurant.

For $440 canadian dollars (about $350 american at the time), I expect a GREAT room. Instead, I got a crusty room that looked like it hadnt been renovated since the early 90s. The mattress sank in the middle and the pillow was so overstuffed with feathers. On top of everything, when we woke up, we saw that the sheets on one of the beds we slept on had blood stains (or feces....not sure). You could also hear everything from the hallway. It was the worst I had slept in years.  The pool was also closed because of some sewage issue. And the pool was one reason I had wanted to book this place!!

In the parking garage, one could see a sky bridge connecting the building to the parking lot on the 3rd floor, however, there was no signage in the elevator which was going down to ground level anyway so we proceeded to enter the hotel from the street.  The closest entrance to the hotel from the parking lot was on the side of the building.  At this entrance there is a set up stairs going up and a check in desk for one of their restaurants.

The feature where you can rent workout gear (and keep your brand new socks) for $5 is a gem; no more bulky sneakers in your luggage.  The highlight of the hotel wasn't it's beautiful architecture, central location, convenient restaurants and coffee bar, or even the lobby decor; it was the room. A lovely view from the 21st floor, a well appointed king sized bed, a huge updated bathroom, desk area, reading area, and large closet, made me feel right at home.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Pleasant stay,We spent 3 nights here for a convention that was in the convention center. I was initially disappointed that we didn't get a room at the Marriot where most of our group was but after stories about that hotel we were delighted to stay at the Westin. The rooms were lovely. The staff was top rate. The hallways were quiet at night and I had a great night sleep. It was a 4 block walk to the convention center. There are several nice restaurants and a place to get coffee and a reasonable priced breakfast. The area may be a little risky at night so use a cab. This was my first trip to Detroit so I wasn't sure what to expect. I would gladly stay here again.,4

The Westin Book Cadillac (God only knows where they got that name) is a nice blend of both.  I stayed one night for business and found the hotel to be very conveniently located.  There is parking in a modern parking garage next door (I think it was $15 per night).    If you can stand a block or two in front of the hotel, you will see it has a grand old facade. Inside, however, it is sleek and modern and very much in the Westin mold.  My room was  modern and roomy.  It did not have the boxy feel of some more modern hotels.  It did, however, have the plentiful pillows you see in other Westins.  Having said that, the room was modern.  Wi-fi was included in the price and was just fine for emails and web surfing. …",5

Close to great restaurants (Roast Steakhouse is located in the hotel) and the rooms were what I would expect of a Westin.  I will stay here on my next trip to Detroit, personal or business related.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Best Option in Downtown Detroit,"I have stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac multiple times, and I can say without hesitation that there is no better hotel option in downtown Detroit.  it's your typical Westin -- close your eyes and you can imagine yourself in any Westin in the continental U.S. -- but the staff is outgoing and friendly, they go out of their way to make sure you have a nice stay, and if you are SPG Platinum, they try to make sure that your every need is taken care of.  I wish all Westins offered this same level of service. The rooms are clean, modern, and reasonably new.  As a Platinum, I have never failed to get an upgrade when staying here, so it scores bonus points in my book. And, to top it off, the bar/restaurant in the lobby is great -- I highly recommend you stop by for a pint and some food.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Business trip,"I traveled to Detroit earlier this year for a work trip after being in several different cities. The hotel is very nice, clean and inviting. I did however experience a loss during my stay. Due to their proximity to the central bus terminal there are many sketchy characters in the are and someone had swiped my backpack off the luggage cart while I was checking in. I lost many valuable items which was very upsetting and frustrating. The manager on duty, Allison was extremely accommodating and sweet, she stayed with me and comforted me while we sorted out the police report etc. She even stayed later than her shift so I wasn't without a familiar face. Several weeks later the hotels insurance was able to pay me replacement value for my stolen items. They did everything they could to…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Accommodating accommodations,Great Gym.  Great room service selection.  Super rooms (large... Felt on par with a room in Vegas/Mandalay Bay type).  Parking was easy in the garage adjacent and behind the hotel itself.  Did not try the on site restaurant... But it looked very nice.  Highly recommend.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Clean, great smelling hotel","I stayed here recently for business.  I experienced great service from the valet to check-in and check out. The hotel smells very refreshing (green tea and aloe) and my room (a king) was a nice size and tastefully decorated.  I would have liked more water pressure in the bathroom, but most importantly, it was clean and smelled fresh. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The only complaint is that the hotel should offer complimentary WiFi in the rooms. If you can get free WiFi at McDonalds and lesser hotels, this should certainly be included at this price point!",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Very Very Good,Very Friendly and efficient staff . We would go back there again and recommend to  anybody. Perfect location for Detroit downtown. We were so amused with efficiency of the valet parking staff; they had employed more than enough staff to take care of any rush happens at the valet area.,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great Oasis in the City,"A great price and walking distance to some of the concert venues I was seeing shows at. Was surprised how spacious the entire hotel is and very nice as I expect a Westin to be. Rooms and bathrooms are massive, was incredibly quiet. Only strange thing was the mini fridge was locked, and it was a bit of a hike to my car in the adjacent garage. Didn't get a chance to sit down at the bar which looks to be very good and well designed, but will be staying here again. ",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Really enjoyed our visit!,"Great hotel!  The reviews are right!!  Classy feel and great bars/restaurants located right in the hotel.  The layout of the lobby area is a little strange, but great hotel!!  Would defiantly stay here again.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Clean, great view, friendly, quiet","The room was pretty clean as to be expected, they let you opt out of room cleaning for some kind of bonus.  The view from the room was awesome.  The only noise in the room comes through the vents in the bathrooms which must all be connected but wasn't bad.  The beds were comfy enough, etc.  Nice new bathrooms, overall great room.  Front desk was accomodating to any needs/changes etc.  Pool was small and shallow, the pics online make it look great.  The workout center was very well equipped for a hotel, loved that.  Easy to grab a cab, central to downtown walking, safe enough area.  Would recommend over other hotels nearby.",5

Upon checkin, the smart, efficient staff makes you feel like a VIP.  Our room on the 21st floor, was spacious,  accommodating, and had a beautiful view of the river.

Beautiful property and frankly being a starwoods member is so worth it because they never disappoint. Hotel was lovely, clean huge rooms and friendly service. Everyone was genuine and really tried hard to promote the positive things on this city.   When you see people passionate about the city and passionate about their jobs, you feel good. Yes at night the Hotel is sketchy but I'm from NYC and this is nothing new for me.   Everything is in walking distance and you wont be sorry if you booked this hotel!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Historic Elegance & Modern Comforts,"Stayed one night (Sunday) to catch the red eye out of Detroit. Only regret is we couldn't stay longer. As a fan of historic renovations/preservation decided to stay at Westin Book Cadillac which completed  renovations in 2008.  Valet and front desk were welcoming and friendly with prompt check in. Our room was on a higher floor with views of downtown & Ambassador Bridge span. The room was very spacious with king size bed and down bedding and the bathroom was voluminous.  We used the work out room which includes cardio, weight machines and free weights. The indoor pool and heated jet spa provided a perfect way  to unwind and relax.   For visitors interested in the hotel history, there are display cabinets at the check-in level that includes photos and memorabilia from the hotel's…",4

I was welcomed with a dessert plate that read happy birthday. The location was awesome. Its close to the people movers and american coney island. If you link your spg account with uber you can get spg points for your uber ride. I was placed in a corner room with both a view of the city and the river. The bedding and shower were amazing. The hotel was clean and they went above and beyond to welcome me.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Walk to Comerica Park,"Hotel is beautiful, clean and secure. Plenty of people monitoring the front door. Key cards were needed to access floors. It is within easy walking distance of Comerica Park. Check-in was a little frustrating. They got our reservation wrong and were going to give us one king bed for 3 people. They switched us but only had a handicapped room available. Then their computer broke and they couldn't make keys for us. They had our luggage sent up, but it took about 90 minutes to arrive. HOWEVER they did they right thing and comped us parking and 2 drinks at their bar. I don't know if I would stay here next time (it's expensive compared the other hotels that are in the immediate area) but overall I was satisfied with this attractive property.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Nice Hotel, sketchy area.","The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very spacious and clean, which was nice for five people in one room. The bathroom was also excellent. The hotel Service was average, nothing spectacular but not terrible either. We were in town for a wedding and have never been to Detroit. This is where our stay kind of got sour.  It's a shame how little there was to do around the hotel. No where to eat besides the Michael Symon restaurant in the hotel and 200 yards from the hotel were pan handlers and some very seedy looking individuals. My wife and family did not feel safe walking around the area in daylight and we are from Cleveland and spend a lot of time in the city. I think this hotel would be a lot nicer of there was more ""going on"" in the area. You could defintley see renovations…",3

I booked a king executive room,and it was very spacious!!!Free bottle of water is always welcomed in summer days!!!A large window in the bathroom was a special plus!!!The decoration of the room was a kind of austere,but it was clean and comfortable!! The biggest problem is the area around:drunks,soliciters,and unemployed people were wandering around!!We checked in on Sunday( 7/5) and there was not even a single CVS opened!!",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,The real deal,"This hotel really gives you that four star feel, concierge desk, beautiful lobby, and very very nice lounges. I stay here and walk to Comerica Park for Tiger games. The walk to Comerica is best done during daylight hours as the area hasn't been completely ""redeveloped"" I recommend valet parking because space it tight. The rooms are large with 10 foot ceilings and king size beds. Starbucks coffee and room service. I like it very much.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,What A Place!,My team and I travel a lot for business and we have been going to Detroit over the past few years.  Each time we have stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac Detroit and it has been a wonderful experience.  The rooms are spacious and always clean.  The staff is incredible to work with and the food options plentiful.  I recommend staying here whenever you need to visit Detroit!,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice Hotel but the area around it is quite dead,The Westin Book Cadillac is a very nice hotel in downtown Detroit with spacious rooms and quite nice amenities. The second floor lobby is large and spacious. We arrived early and no rooms were ready for us so the desk staff checked us in and then offered to call when a room was ready. We were there for a Blue Jays game and unbeknownst to us some of the Blue Jays players stay there. I actually ran into a couple of the players and they were friendly. My only complaint about the property was that the breakfast prices were absolutely ridiculous for what you received. This then begs the question as to why we even ate in the hotel restaurant - there is almost nothing open around the hotel. I've been told that Detroit is a ghost town on weekends but I picked the Book Cadillac thinking…,3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,The legend lives on,"The Book Cadillac was built in the 1920s and was Detroit's top-of-the-line hotel for over 50 years.  It was gutted and remodeled and reopened in 2008.  There is little of the original hotel interior left (sneak a peek at the Venetian ballroom), although there are two nice display cases near registration showing signature events in the hotel's history.    We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to an executive suite (thank you Starwood Preferred Guest Gold).  Lots of space, lots of storage.  The suite was at the end of the hall at a corner of the building, so it was very quiet.  We have stayed in hotel rooms smaller than the bathroom, which had a tub and a shower.  Other than one hiccup with valet parking, everything went great.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  The staff…",5

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Almost Missed Wedding,"The check-in was horrific and we almost missed the wedding because rooms weren't ready! Apparently the guests from the night before decided to stay PAST the checkout and there were no repercussions to them. So our wedding party suffered because we couldn't get rooms to get ready. In all my years of traveling both domestically and internationally, this delay, and poor explanation, is very unacceptable!",2

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great hotel - old exterior but renovated modern interior,"This is a great hotel.  I would give it 4.5 rating if I could.  It is a modern hotel inside.  We were on a high floor and had a great view of the Detroit skyline.  It is centrally located.  It's a pity that downtown Detroit felt like a ghost town at times, even though we were there over a weekend.  There are a surprisingly few places to shop and honestly, eat as well in the downtown area.  There are Coney Island hotdog restaurants across the street (on Michigan).  The room was very spacious.  They have black-out blinds in the room but the standby TV and alarm clock lights keep the room from being pitch black.  The blinds in the bathroom are the translucent honeycomb types so you have to close the bathroom door if you want more darkness.  The tub in the bathroom is relatively low…",4

Rooms have always been clean and very quiet, staff has been friendly and helpful and on this trip we found the pizza in the Motor Bar to be surprisingly good!  Short walk to the Fox, Comerica, and American or Lafayette Coney Island. Also, if you have the chance to duck into some of the halls to check out the architecture, do so.",5

My family and I (parents, siblings, spouses, etc) stay for two nights every year for our annual Tigers weekend. We always have an amazing time, and this one was no exception. We booked Traditional rooms, but were upgraded upon check-in to Deluxe rooms. The rooms are very similar, with the Deluxe rooms offering city views. Each room has a unique layout, so there is always an element of surprise when checking in which I appreciate. We all had Deluxe rooms, yet each of our rooms was layed out different.

The room and bathroom were large. The bed was comfortable. I was disappointed there were no data ports. The room seemed to be lacking the updated technology that I am accustomed to when staying at a hotel. When I called in advance to inquire about hair styling for guests attending a wedding, I was informed they could provide any assistance. Very disappointing considering there was a very large block of rooms booked for the occasion. We did not have time to avail ourselves of any other services such as the restaurant, gym, etc.",3

I have stayed at some nice hotels in my life but this was the absolute best. My family is from Detroit and I have heard stories of this building my whole life and it didn't disappoint. From the moment the airport van dropped us off (""Holy crap we get to stay here"") to when I saw the room and the view (""OMG all of this?!!) to when the bellhops remembered us and asked us how the Lions game went (""GO LIONS) it was the best stay I have ever had.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Right in the heart of downtown Detroit,I recently stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac for a short site seeing trip of Detroit.  I did not rent a car when I was in Motor City so it was important for me to find a hotel with a great location downtown.  The location of the Westin Book Cadillac cannot be beat.  It is about a 5-10 minute walk to Campus Martius and the rest of the other sites in downtown Detroit. It is also a 5-minute walk from the Michigan Avenue stop of the Detroit People Mover monorail so that was very convenient.   My hotel room was very comfortably sized and was clean. The hotel room was well appointed and modern as you'd expect from a Westin property.   I am an architecture fan and part of the draw to this hotel was the historic property of the Book Cadillac building.  While the hotel itself is very…,4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great Location!,Hotel is located in a beautiful historic building in downtown Detroit.  Super attentive and friendly staff on arrival. True 5 star experience! Lobby staff equally friendly. Deluxe rooms are not glamorous but very spacious and in good condition. Bed super comfy with many different pillows to choose from. Bathroom has only one sink. To shower you have to step into a low bathtub. Water pressure could have been better. No shower gel but just a bar of soap. Review is based on a room rate of 169$ plus tax.,5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great Stay During Bravo Bravo,My recent stay at The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit was wonderful. I was attending Bravo Bravo and received a special rate for the room. It was within close proximity to the venue. The hotel staff were very friendly and courteous. While I only live 40 minutes away it was a great idea to stay at the Westin that night. My room was extremely comfortable which made for a great night's sleep. The check in and out process was very smooth. As a SPG rewards guest I would highly recommend this hotel.,5

We had a nice surprise when we returned to our room later in the day, which was a plate of desserts and a bottle of water.   The location of this hotel is one of the best parts though.

Sadly for me, hotel no longer has the historic look one might expect, i.e. completely and adequately modernized.  Now more like a hotel for business people, with condos on the top floors.  While in admiration of the attempts being made to bring downtown Detroit back to life, I found area where hotel is located lacking in restaurants, shops, etc.  There are some beautiful art deco buildings in the area worth a walk.  Most disturbing was the rise in price obviously due to the Cubs/Tigers game; had I gone earlier/later in the week room price much cheaper.  Definitely not worth the price I paid.

The Westin's rooms are of an above average size and the housekeeping was of a very high standard. Staff were very friendly and efficient. It was particularly nice to be greeted by everyone that I met. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I value the fact that the Weston offers a green option for room cleaning.   On the negative side, the breakfast service was haphazard and clearly hampered by not enough staff. More importantly, quite why Westin chooses to charge for wifi access is beyond me.

We had to fight to get the rooms we booked and even then- the rooms were not ready on time (5pm)   It took several conversations and some anxiety to have the hotel do the right thing for us.

"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Detroit the ""comeback city"", the Book Cadillac is the place to come back to","If it has been awhile since you visited Detroit, it is time to return.  First be sure your GPS maps are current because downtown Detroit is a new place.  My trip prior was difficult with Woodward being torn up, it was difficult to get near the Westin.  Not anymore and there is a self-park secure facility adjacent the Hotel.  The Book Cadillac has always been special but it has a new glow and spit and polish.  My room was on the Club Floor with a lounge available serving appetizers in the evening and a hot breakfast in the morning.  Water and soda are available at all times as well as the use of business equipment.  My room overlooked the city and the Ambassador bridge was to the right.  The room was spotless, service was really good.  I dined at Michael Symon's the Roast, had an…",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Winter Weekend,had tickets to musical in Detroit so decided to make it a weekend with hotel stay. Recommended parking structure provided no entry into hotel. Had to carry bags in freezing cold 1 block to front door to enter. Decided to have dinner at signature restaurant in hotel. Very pricey for small portions and average service.,3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Comfortable accomodation in the downtown Detroit,"We spent a night here while attending a wedding in Detroit. The hotel is in the center of the historic district of Downtown and is quite a looker. The rooms are spacious and like all Westins, the decour and furnishings are standard. The Westin lounge on the 23rd floor is nice for grabbing waters and sodas. The hotel is within a few minutes walk to the Opera house, ball park, Ford Field, and GM building. Parking is $15 a day with in and out priveledges. My biggest gripe with the hotel is the front desk staff. Extremely slow and they seemed overwhelmed at all times of the day. Aside from that I would've given the hotel 5 stars.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,quite nice,"Very comfortable business hotel in the center of Detroit. Short walk to my company's offices as well as to the dinner spot we went to. My room was spacious and comfortable, and the service at the front desk was friendly and competent. The hotel bar was welcoming and comfortable, and reasonably priced (as hotel bars go). I had dinner there and the turkey BLT was actually a turkey club sandwich, HUGE with excellent fries. Disappointed at the number of beers on tap (3) but the bottle selection was excellent. The steakhouse in the hotel is also well-known, my colleague ate there at the bar while I had a drink with him. He loved his steak - which looked fantastic - and my drink was excellent. This was my second stay at this hotel and I will definitely stay there next time business…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Bad,"We are staying here Thursday-Sunday May 2015.  The hotel failed to inform their guests that their water was being worked on and unsanitary from the hours of 2-6am. They also did not provide safe water to use for brushing teeth, washing face, hands, etc. When confronted, the hotel stated they sent an email to all guests about this issue. But not all guests check their emails while on vacation. A letter or note or some type of alert should have been placed on each room and/ or under each door and /or on the bathroom sink so the guest did not use the unsanitary water. This hotel could care less about their customers ultimate wellbeing and health by not alerting them in the proper way of unsanitary water being flowed through their sinks and showers. Poor.  Poor. poor.  We are not…",1
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"Fully satisfactory, but not  first-class","Spacious, clean room with a comfy bed.   Excellent, though pricey, breakfast in the restaurant.   The spa is very outdated in its decor, but the massage and other services were excellent.   The pool is just utilitarian, but the fitness center has plenty of up-to-date equipment.    The rooms appear to have high-security metal doors that crash shut.   This creates a constant backdrop noise of banging and crashing in the corridors.    Not very restful.    What injected a really sour note was the check-in clerk's suggestion that I should ' go green' (sic) by agreeing to have NO HOUSEKEEPING at all throughout my stay.   She made it sound like they would be doing me a big favor by keeping the housekeepers out of my room entirely.  Sorry, but a first class hotel provides housekeeping. …",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,"One night business trip, better than expected","I traveled to this hotel for a one night business trip and to be honest my expectations were pretty low due to the stigma the city of  Detroit carries. Although the downtown area is down, it is not out. I found the hotel very convenient to Henry Ford Hospital and all of the sport venues were within eye shot as were multiple casinos. Check in was painless and the rooms were updated and large. Their onsite restaurant, Roast was very good (a little overpriced) and the coffee shop in the lobby was more than adequate.  I am looking forward to the Detroit resurgence and will make sure to have a leisure weekend to enjoy the fun side of Detroit.",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,My Favorite Hotel in Detroit,"I travel quite a bit to Detroit for business and have stayed at various hotels in the marketplace. I've found that the Westin Book Cadillac is my favorite for it's friendly and professional staff, convenient location to downtown, clean rooms as well as having the James Beard ranked restaurant Roast located on the ground floor.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Standard business hotel,"Like other Westin hotels, the Book Cadillac is huge with tons of business travelers. Room was spacious but with little amenities. Compared to other Westin hotels, this one was quite well maintained with electric outlets updated.   Although the food menu was quite disappointing, the quality was ok and room service was fast.   However, this hotel is not good for leisure travel. The club lounge was jam packed in the morning with dozens of people waiting around for seats.   Unless you are desperate for SPG points, you can do better with other hotels.",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Home Run,"Three night stay in Room 1721 for a seminar and banquet.  Ate 2 nights at the exquisite hotel restaurant, Roast. Tremendous meal. Loved it.   The room was spacious, beautiful and large bathroom, plush bed and terrific rain style type shower.  Each day the room was cleaned by noon.   Friendly, helpful staff.   The banquet was also excellent with the petit filet being the best I've had in a long time.  Love the Westin Book Cadillac Detroit!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Pretty good but.....,"We stayed for 2 nights and it was generally pretty good. Check in was great, valet parking was good, the room was spacious and attractive despite the huge stain on the mattress. Someone spilled their coffee? .....who knows. The windows in the entire building need cleaning. Our biggest problem was the lack of service in the restaurants and bars. Our first night we ate dinner at the 24 Grille and it was fine. But after we returned from the show around 10pm we went back to the 24 Grille and didn't get service for 15 minutes so we left. Next morning we went to  The Boulevard Club we didn't get seated for 20 minutes so we left as did the 3 parties in front of us who did get seated but no service once in the restaurant. Later that night at the Motor Bar, they had one very overworked…",3
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,A Starwood Gem in the Rough,"I stayed here (room 1621) for one night as I was in town on business and it is overall a great place to stay. The neighborhood surrounding the hotel borders on the flashy casino area  and also the more sketchy side but I felt safe while staying at the property. Check-in was a breeze. I was upgraded to a deluxe room overlooking the city and was very pleased. The room was huge and resembled an apartment. Typically comfy bed, flat screen tv that swiveled against the wall. Full length mirror and full tub with shower in a huge bathroom. I ordered room service for lunch and dinner and the food was decent hotel food. Expensive but you sort of expect that at a hotel. The room service staff were pleasant and he food arrived timely as with other hotels. I did not try the restaurants in…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Terrific stay,"Enjoyed a great 4 night stay in conjunction w/a conference we organized in the hotel. Guest rooms were spacious and clean featuring a modern design. Hotel layout was convenient with ballrooms, breakout spaces, restaurants, etc. Food was delicious and staff very helpful. Highly recommend this Detroit gem!",5
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Next visit again for sure,"It's my second time in Detroit and after my experience in the well overdue for renovation RenCen hotel I opted for the Westin. A friendly reception through valet as well as the front desk staff, a swift checkin were the first positive impressions that I had. My room, albeit facing the inside of the hotel complex (so zero view) was spacious, well laid out and the bed was as promised superb. The hotel has a great steakhouse which I reviewed separately but it's definitely worth a visit. The lobby bar is staffed with a competent and friendly barkeeper who is very quick and professional - a great way to end the day! I also tried the gym, very well equipped for a Detroit hotel, as well as the spa, where very competent personnel is running the show. All in all a very positive…",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice place!,"Stayed here one night. Got the room for a great price via hot wire. Rooms are very clean and spacious. Close to local bars, restaurants, casinos & attractions. Pool area was decent however we did not get to use it. Restaurants within the hotel were a bit pricey. The food at the pub at the hotel was decent same with the service. I will be back to this place as it was a great find !",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great spot to stay in Detroit!,"The hotel is situated in a good located. Close to lost of restaurants and attractions within the city. Clean and spacious rooms. Restaurants within the hotel are decent, yet slightly pricey. Good security system, room key needed to operate elevator. All in all a great place to stay & I will return.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great spot to stay in the city!,"Beautiful room, fantastically comfortable bed. Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Only downside was our room faced out to other rooms so we didn't have the great view that we were hoping for. All-in-all we had a wonderfully relaxing stay at the Book Cadillac and loved that it was close to so many things to walk to.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Nice hotel in city center,"this hotel is situated in the center of Detroit in a prestigious building. valet service; lobby on the second floor, staff friendly. rooms are spacious, quiet, very nice bed !!!, spacious bathroom, clean, TV ok. Stayed on the clubfloor. Club below usual level in comparable hotels ( Intercontinental, Hyatt), certainly in other parts of the world ( Asia). Clublounge closed on friday evening and during week-end ...) Breakfast VERY expensive. Asking money for everything ( use of internet, printing a document, ...). Restaurant in the hotel not very good. Probably still of the better hotels in town.",4
"Detroit, MI",The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,Great for Detroit,"I booked a room here for Sat Apr 25 to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday surprise (I got us Tigers tickets and a reservation at ROAST).   I'm originally from the area, but have lived in Chicago for many years (traitor, I know...). I could not believe how much downtown has changed. It was amazing, I felt like a tourist in my hometown.   For the hotel, the location is unparalleled. Right by the ballpark, Greektown, hot spots around Woodward. We did the self park option, and getting to the hotel was easy. Luckily, it was nice out - otherwise it would be an inconvenience (it's not covered).   The room itself was beautiful and the common spaces were so nice. We were on the 21st floor, so we had a very cool view of the transitioning city with a peak of Comerica Park. We also brought…",4
