"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Wish I could give 10 stars,We stayed here before taking a flight in the morning.  At this time the Gov of Colorado has arbitrarily shut down indoor dining in Denver (even tho we just came from a packed Beaver Creek). This hotel didn’t just shut down as it could have in the name of covid.  It maintained the fun things it offers as best as possible.  They still offered the free reception from 530 to 730 where one person from the room goes to the bar gets drinks and takes them back to the room.  In the morning there is still a wonderful delicious breakfast buffet the employee makes the meal for you and you take back to your room.  Credit to this hotel for being creative and doing its best to still offer great service.  This picture shows the beautiful spacious lobby that is normally hopping according to the bar tender. Also the suites are modern and have a door in case you have a snorer and need someone to sleep on the sleeper sofa.  Great job Embassy Suites!!!… bar tender.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Really nice hotel - Great airport location,"This hotel is lovely.   It's great to do the park and ride option, where you leave your car in their lot.  If you get there in time, they have snacks (not fancy) and drinks in the evening.   They have an onsite restaurant.  And the rooms are very nice.  Prices are competitive.  Perfect for early morning flights.   We use this hotel often.  It saves being nervous about the 45 mile drive, getting to the airport on time, especially in the winter.  I highly recommend it.  Be sure to join Hilton rewards.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nicer since Renovation,"Denver Airport area Embassy Suites.   Due to a change in travel plans, we ended up needing a hotel near the airport for 2nights. Selected Embassy Suites because we needed to get some work done in the room, and the layout with the desk in the main room is easy for two people to work from.  Was during Covid, and this hotel did as well as any of the others we've stayed in.   Room was recently renovated and nice.   Only issue we had was the airport pickup...took over an hour to get picked up. We were told it was due to light staffing ""due to Covid""   Saw several flight crews also waiting for pickup at other hotels and they were having similar issues.  Recommend this hotel if staying near the airport, need some work space and if a renovated room.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Dont stay at this hotel!,"What a horrible experience. Our flight was delayed so arrived around 11pm We went to three rooms,ALL DIRTY, we were told that we needed to wait 30 min while they cleaned our room, what? At 11pm. Finally found a clean room and got a king instead of 2 queens.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nightmare,"We called ahead to find a hotel near the airport.  We asked all the appropriate questions that are necessary due to Covid, such as the pool being open, restaurant in the hotel, etc.  When we arrived we were told there was no running water and the hotel is under constitution.  We were assigned a room.  We got to the room with all of our luggage and quite literally they were drilling and hammering in the adjoining room.  There was plaster dust on the railings and all over the carpet.  We went back down to the front desk where I expressed my concern over the room and the fact that we were not told about the lack of water and the construction. There was no apology offered or solution by the 'front desk manager' Kelly.  I had to ask for a different room.  This one was on the 7th floor.  Once again we transported our luggage back up.  As soon as we opened the door, the stench of stale smoke was overpowering (even though it was a non-smoking room).  At this point I was done.  We walked back down to the front desk and I told Kelly that I wanted refunded and we were leaving.  Again, no apology and no solution.  I asked to speak to the manager and was told he was on the phone.  We left and drove next door to the Tru by Hilton.  They at least had water and friendly staff.… floor.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not to standard,"As a frequent Hilton property guest, the Embassy Suites airport location is not up to standard. Our room was not thoroughly cleaned as expected due to Covid-19.  There were food droppings still on the carpet around the couch. In the main floor atrium sitting area, food droppings were in the carpet for most of the day. The hotel advertise that the rooms are being currently being remodeled with completion date of September 30.  I am assuming construction is behind schedule.  Front desk personal seemed disinterested in their jobs. Would not recommend this property.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Would stay again,"Ended up staying two separate, single-night stays within our travels to the Denver area (one night planned, second unplanned). I called initially before booking the first night to inquire about their COVID protocols and to understand how they were operating under their states’ orders. Traveling from out of state for my first time since the virus first hit the US, I was quite anxious about it. The GM, Michael, was very patient with all my questions and even answered some I didn’t even ask. We were very happy with our first night’s stay, when we ended up having to stay a second night at the end of our trip, we knew we wanted to stay in the same hotel. Glad we did. I know there are changes they have had to make relative to the epidemic whether it relates to staff, dining options, etc. But I commend Michael and his team for the work they are putting in to get through this time. I recommend this hotel to anyone passing through the Denver area and looking for a convenient and pleasant option in proximity to the airport. We will definitely stay here again should we find ourselves back in the Denver area.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great Staff, Great Stay","Staff is nice, helpful and informative.  There was a large that came right after our check in.  I observed the staff as I was wanting for my husband to park car.  Staff was efficient and respectful and worked very quickly to get all through in timely fashion.  Very impressed",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,My Go To hotel in the Denver/Aurora area,"I travel to this area quite often and this hotel has become my go to.  It's always clean, the breakfast is great, and the location works well for me.  I'm a Hilton Honors member so I try to stay at Hilton as often as possible.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nobody Seems to Care,"Customer service is alright. House keeping is terrible. Found hairs all over sheets. Reported, but nothing was done about it. Managers don’t care about anything, especially the GM. One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Birthday dreams,We decided to book two rooms adjoining and have my 14 year old's birthday party. The staff was extremely accommodating and allowed us to celebrate in the lobby. It was open but we felt like we had our own personal space. The kids enjoyed the pool. The staff also delivered a surprise dessert to my daughter and friends. They were very friendly and did some extra things for us. My daughter said her favorite part was the entire stay from check-in to check-out. Great place to have a birthday dream.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to hold business and training meetings,The hotel’s location being close to the airport and the diverse size of meeting/ conference rooms make it a great choice for business. The restaurant bar is an excellent addition. The only points I would like to see is coffee available all day and a lunch menu with smaller portions and lower price,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice big rooms.  ,"The rooms here are huge!  Fairly quiet so far.  Little things about this place bug me.  Broken hair dryer, key card system went haywire, shower curtain falling off the hooks and broken floor tiles.  The staff is friendly, nice restuarant and bar right in the middle.  Free breakfast had typical fare.  Had a managers reception each evening.  Not much food, but free drinks.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Place to Attend A Meeting,We attended the annual general meeting for our pony society.  Service was great from when we were picked up at the airport and sent back.  Food was appropriate and tasty.  Room was clean and well maintained.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Average stay,fire alarm was hanging from the wall.  The towels were extremely stiff from way too much bleach.  Took three times to get the digital key to work.  The location was convenient with respect to the airport,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Complimentary made-to-order breakfast,"This is the only hotel I've ever been in with a complimentary made-to-order breakfast. The other items offered were also excellent. The suites had two rooms with a coffee bar, desk and living room area in the first room. Very comfortable and having the bedroom away from the hall made it quiet for sleeping.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy suites wonderfull stay,In the past we have stayed at DoublTree located in Greenwood  Village which is a very nice property.   Since our flight w as leaving early in the am we decided to choose a property close to the airport  we  decided to try the Embassy Suites which is part of the hilton family.  We were so impressed that the next time in denver we stay at this property.  ,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent customer service and room,Rooms are large. Hotel is very focused on hospitality. Great experience. Will be back. The dinner and happy hour was a great plus. Food was good portion and fresh. Everyone was so friendly and the shuttle to the airport is a big plus. Reserve your ride early.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Need better communication ,We stay at this Embassy every time we fly out of DIA. We do so because of the parking. We stayed here in November of 2019 and parked for three weeks without a charge because we had a room before the flight and a room after the flight. This trip we were charged to park the night we stayed before the flight and was told we would be charged for 2 more days of parking when we return even with another nights reservation when we return. At the rate of the lodging it is now cheaper to stay at a different hotel and park at one of the shuttle lots,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not worth staying at- poor quality and service,"We did not have heat in room and said they would switch our room to another king on same floor. When we went to other room there were 2 queens and no king. We wanted a king because we paid for king. They did not even offer to help move us. So we stayed in our king room with a small heater they brought us. It would have been nice if they helped us or offered us a credit. Also, we requested a wake up call so we would not miss our early flight the next day. Sebastian made a note of this and no wake up call as requested. I am so glad I figured out the alarm clock in the room. The staff was very poor and not too helpful. Very disappointed in this hotel and it was not the cleanest either. I usually love Embassy Suites but this hotel was not worth it overall and we were very…",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Colorado family trip.,Our one night stay before heading to Winter Park was great! Its close to the airport and a great starting point to the mountains.  The complimentary breakfast was more than what we expected!! Everyone we encountered at this hotel was very sweet!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent short stay,"Excellent location to the Denver airport, great service by a enthusiastic staff.  We had a very good dinner at the airport the night we checked in and all of us loved it and the breakfast was solid as well.  The room was clean and held three adults with no problems.  I would stay here again without hesitation",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Checks all the boxes,"Great property and friendly helpful staff.  Fresh and modern with all of our required amenities.  Close to Buckley so visiting with my son is super convenient. Easy access to the highway system for day trips to the Springs, downtown Denver, AND that ""gotta get to airport"" situation.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Sad sad service but ok rooms and hotel,"The man checking us in was short and rude didn’t ever make eye contact. Never gave me water as a Hilton silver member, didn’t give me direction to the elevators.When I came back to get water he talked to another man about Disney and it being his favorite hotel chain FOR 15 minutes, I finally interrupted and asked for my water. He handed me a bag and didn’t make eye contact or anything and kept talking about Disney....",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great location beautiful Views,Beautiful view of the front range from our room the hotel is very convenient when flying into or out of Denver international airport. Our shuttle driver was a delight and so friendly. We would stay at the hotel again when traveling to Denver.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient to Airport,"We stayed here the night before our early morning flight home.  The hotel was recently renovated, and our room was nice and clean.  We left very early in the morning, so we didn't get to have breakfast. There's a gate to get in and out of the parking lot, and we had trouble using our ticket each time we left the hotel.  Fortunately, there's a call button to the front desk, and they raised he gate remotely.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"The stay was OK, BUT you CAN be choosy in this area!","Hotel is in a great location to the airport but you'll pay for parking and using the gate is a hassle.  Hotel serves complimentary breakfast/evening snacks.  The rooms are decently sized and all have interior entrances, but our room had very little air circulation which made it a bit stuffy.  Also be prepared to have staff come in early to clean the room, and if you're not ready - you may miss out on getting that bed made.  There are not a lot of food options nearby, but if you are willing to drive about 10 minutes you'll find the usual chains, but you'll also pass a lot of other hotel options along the way.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very nice Hilton property located close to the new Denver airport.,"The Embassy suites on Yampa is a very nice Hilton property, and is located close to the new Denver airport. Friendly front desk staff,nice commons area including bar and restaurant,and very nice suites. Great bed and pillows.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Housekeeping/Room Issues,"Dirty/Stained bathroom walls.  Housekeeping failed to show up.  There were many stains on the bathroom walls.  Housekeeping did not show up and I was told that my room could not be made/cleaned, etc. because the staff had left for the day",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Enjoyed our stay very much.,"The hotel was very nice, the staff was exceptionally helpful. We enjoyed the manager's reception and the free breakfast. Just be forewarned this hotel is not in the city proper but it's easy to drive to any amenities you'd wish to find.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Good hotel, unsophisticated food.","Perfectly good hotel with spacious and clean rooms, comfortable beds, good bathrooms, although with those horrid shower curtains for cutting costs on fittings.  Service was attentive, friendly.  Hotel was full and none of the requests made two months prior were pre-arranged; you get what they have as you arrive.  Only true negative was the unsophisticated breakfast with the usual 1 star brown water for coffee, orange color soda for orange juice, cheap danish and long-shelf life bread, melon as their idea of fruit and generally very unsophisticated and cheapo food at breakfast and at the free evening reception.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Comfortable in Denver,"I had a four night stay at this hotel.  The staff was very helpful, room clean with everything functioning and the location was convenient for work and restaurants.  I would recommend this hotel for everyone.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Needs some room renovations,"As soon as I opened the door to my room I noticed stains on the furniture and flooring. I was only staying for a couple day and didn’t plan to really use the living room area so I wasn’t concerned enough to report it for a room change. The bed was ok, but did make noise when you moved. I had issues with the coffee pot and shower curtain that I reported the first morning when I left for the day. Came back that evening and the issues were not fixed. The associate at the desk got it taken care of. I feel it should not have come to that, it should have been fixed while I was out during the day. The front desk staff were all friendly and smiling. The bartender did very well handling all the people in the bar area for the manager’s reception happy hour time. I did not get to enjoy the breakfast, so I have no feedback on that. But the morning I left it was before breakfast hours, but the front desk staff member (Bernard I think) was so nice to get me some boiled eggs from the kitchen. The facility is nice, but I do think for the price the rooms could use some sprucing up.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver business trip...,"Hotel is located on ""Hotel Alley"".....Tower Road has no less that 20 different hotels on this strip.  Conveniently located next to Denver Intl Airport but a solid 15-18 miles from downtown Denver.  Rental car a must.  Hotel is typical Embassy....rooms are clean and beds are very comfortable.  Complimentary breakfast and evening cocktail reception are always a nice touch.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Vacation,"Overall we had a great stay! The staff was great and very helpful. We appreciate the quality of service. The hotel is clean, and they have good amenities. Make sure you get a parking pass before leaving.  We will for sure stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,great!!,"best location for an early flight!!  the breakfast starting at 6 am was appreciated, as was the bar in the lobby!! will definitely join you again while in Denver or other locations.Loved the secure parking as well",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Older hotel and now you get to pay 9 bucks a night to park! ,"Pro: big suites, very comfortable bed and several tv choices. Good breakfast, made to order eggs, juices and coffee. Neutrogena products. Con: no instructions on how to use the air system. Our room was way to warm. The biggest issue we had was the 9 buck nightly parking fee. We spent several hundred dollars for the room and now you want to charge me for the privilege of parking my vehicle in your lot? The explanation we received from the front desk said ""Denver"" was wanting hotels to ""maintain"" their parking lot and ""several hotels"" in the area are now charging for parking. He also said it was a separate ""tax"" and could not be absorbed by the hotel. Imagine our surprise when we pulled out of the hotel the next morning and saw no other paid private parking in any of the hotels on the same street! Including the Hilton property right next door to this hotel. This is a pure money grab. Plenty of other choices on Tower Road alone along with 40th Avenue off Pena. Its the principle of the matter and not money. There are several signs in the lot stating they are no liable for your vehicle. So the ""extra security "" to be paid for out of the fee is not doing anything.  This Embassy Suites has lost our business forever. Yes, its on your website, congrats, doesn't make it right.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay,We have stayed at this location several times as it is near our friends home.  The quality of service from the front office was great and they provided every detail we needed without asking.  The rooms are very clean and we enjoy the complimentary breakfast.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Below average for Embassy Suites,The rooms are clean and spacious although the fixtures are cheap.  The food at the restaurant is so so.  The evening snacks at the managers reception are tasteless.  The free bar is nice.  HBO channels have been disconnected.  I'm really not sure why they want to charge for parking.  The hotel is out by the airport and there are plenty of other options so it seems like a disincentive to stay there.  I've stayed there a few times and think I'll try a different Hilton property next time.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Terrible Experience!!,"As a Hilton Honors Diamond Member, I stay at Hilton brand hotels over 100 nights each year.  The Embassy Suites Denver International Airport is on of the worst hotels ever.I received a letter from the General Manager giving instructions regarding the hotel shuttle when I arrived in Denver.  After waiting 45 minutes, the hotel told me the GM did not know what he was talking about and the wait time is much longer. Ouch!The Manager's Reception in the evenings is incredibly understaffed.  Only 1 bartender and a long line of customers.  All I wanted was a coke and it took more than 20 minutes.  I stayed 2 nights and had the same experience both evenings.  In the morning, there was no one available to prepare omelets/eggs.  Again, incredibly understaffed.I wrote and emailed the GM with my concerns.  6 weeks has passed and I never received any contact.  Once again confirming that this location does not have time/staff for their customers.  This is the worst Embassy Suites I have experienced in more than 20 years of travel.  Travelers beware!",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight stay before an early morning flight,"We stayed at the Embassy Suites before an early morning flight we had to catch.  Upon arrival we were checked in quickly.  We took our bags to our room and then headed downstairs to enjoy some free drinks and appetizers during their happy hour - and they were truly free!The room was very spacious and clean.  It had a large sitting area with a 4-5 person dinning table. Bathroom was large.  Bed was comfortable and pillows were great.  The room had a mini-fridge, microwave, bar sink, and coffee maker.The following morning we caught their 330am shuttle to the airport, which was right on time.  What I didn't expect was all the coffee and goodies to be out and ready for us that early in the morning so it was a wonderful surprise!  I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Boring Happy Hour,"I am a member and stay often at ES. This hotel was selected due to a very early flight home, day after we arrived here. The room is spacious and clean. A little rough on the edges of the bathroom boards, should be replaced. Comfortable bed, huge TV in living room. The happy hour main floor lobby is the most dullest that I have seen. Change the very dull dark blue carpet. The lighting is so dull above the bar area, or have someone clean them. No ambiance at all, needs some music, along with some new decor. It was so quiet in here, the only excitement here was the Mens final Tennis game on TV.I don't know what has happened but most of the ES appetizers have been very disappointing. They were very good at one time. No restaurant seating for dinner-you sit out where everyone could see you eating, nothing elegant, or private, very dull.The front desk needs to tell the guests more info regarding the shuttle to the airport. Mind you we had to be down by the lobby along with many others for a 3am or so pickup. What wasn't told to us, was that the shuttle driver had to stop at least four other hotels to pick up other people. Many of your guest on this shuttle complained of the fact you did not say this would be happening. You only said it was a 5 minute ride to airport and that we would make it. It is important to tell us we have stops in between. This made many on this shuttle a little nervous of getting to the five-seven minute ride to the airport. Then to top it off, the Denver Airport is under construction-interior. The nice shuttle driver has one main point of drop-off, will not take you to where you need to be. There was an accident right outside on the main road to the airport, that backed up. travel. You have to pay to park it this hotel, and you need to insert the ticket into the machine when exiting. One exit meter was out of order. We dropped off our rental the night before, and got an Uber from rental to this hotel. I recommend you do this as well. For all that need to find the security area is/was a joke! If you have an early morning plan accordingly. There won't be anyone around to help you at the airport for an early am departure. And the only one that was there-pointed many of us in a circle. We walked around and came back to where we started. Then at this time the ""pre-check"" was open. For a 6am departure back home, the Airport was very crowded.  I can not say that I recommend this hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Don't stay in room 212,"The concept of the hotel with the rooms all overlooking the bar, breakfast area is nice. It's a pretty lobby. The snacks and free drinks for 2 hrs is nice as well. But in reality voices carry, and while unwinding and watching tv, several times loud laughing could be heard through the door. Worse was the constant thumping, like a drum beating nonstop, or as my husband said like a harley idling 24/7 because of exhaust fans? Heating and cooling? Right below our window. Even with the fan/air conditioning on, and ear plugs the noise could be heard. It looks like a relatively new hotel, but the shower had caulk that was molding, and a gap in the corner where the shower panels didn't line up. Why not use a one piece shower? They also charge you $9 to park in the parking lot. So park in the street. Apparently ppl were leaving their car at the hotel while on vacation for a week and there wasn't enough parking for guests. It's very close to the airport that's why we stayed, but its not worth $160 Per night. Breakfast was nothing to write home about.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel,"Took shuttle bus from Denver Airport to hotel, check in very fast. Suite was absolutely brilliant, sorry to have been there for only one night! Suite spacious, clean and very comfy. Breakfast was top notch! Real crockery and cutlery as opposed to some hotels we stayed in! We booked shuttle back to airport and it was great too. Wished we had booked this hotel for our last night too instead of the one we did book.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A great Hotel 10 minutes from airport,This hotel is a great place to stay. They have a pool and fitness center on the first floor. The managers evening reception is nice. A variety of choices with drinks in the center of the room where the bar is. The rooms are spacious and the floors are quiet.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Now they charge for parking,"This has been my ""go to"" hotel for my past several trips to Denver.  I agree with all of the positive reviews below-- the rooms are clean, spacious, and comfortable, and the complimentary evening reception and breakfast are excellent.   However, I was disappointed that they are now charging for parking, a service that was free before.  While it was only $9, I feel that I was being nickel-and-dimed.  I asked the front desk why they are now charging for parking and the clerk indicated that it was for our security and to prevent non-guests of the hotel from parking there.  I'm not sure if I believe that answer:  this hotel is out in the middle of nowhere where land is cheap and plentiful--- is this really necessary?  Is this a way to increase their revenue without it showing on the room charge?  I would normally have given this hotel a five-star rating, but I knocked off a star because of this charge.  Also-- the TripAdvisor description of this hotel indicates that the parking is free-- that content needs to be updated.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not an average airport hotel,"We had a great 1 night stay in room 701.  701 is a corner executive room with a larger living room than a standard room.  Everything was in great working order.I had selected my room via the app, we arrived before check-in time and had a minimal wait for our room.Used the airport shuttle to and from the hotel and we were grateful to have that amenity.There are no shortages of hotels in that area.  Chose the ES because we love the brand, 2 room suites, plentiful managers reception-(Julio makes a perfect drink!), super breakfast and a caring attitude. We requested a 3:30am wake up call and on the dot, there was our call.  It was so nice to see coffee, tea, fruit, granola bars in the lobby at such an early hour!!  So, even though you may miss breakfast, at least you are offered something!Handful of eateries within walking distance, as well as a gas station and Med/Rec dispensary.2 small things I really missed was laundry facilities (they offer same day dry cleaning, but if you’re there for one night, the service won’t work).  Considered seeing if adjacent Homewood Suites/Tru properties had laundry facilities on property, but decided against it. And the other, no clock.Would stay here again!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,My Hotel When I Travel,"Embassy Suite by Hilton is my kind of hotel when I am away from home.  The room is large, a great evening reception, delicious breakfast included, great location with a reasonable price.  It is very easy to reserve.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Clean and comfortable with option to park our car and take a shuttle to the airport,We stayed here before an early flight and it was great. We parked our car for the duration of our trip and took their shuttle to the airport. It only takes 5 minutes to get there and the shuttle was on time and convenient. We will definitely do this again when we have an early flight out of DIA.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Courteous and accommodating staff,"Great location, excellent shuttle service, great staff, clean room. Evening reception was a little disappointing however, although the drinks kept coming! The variety and selection of the snacks at the Reception were not great.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Cozy hotel,We had to spend a night at a hotel close to the airport since we arrived Denver at late night. This hotel was a good fit for me since it was very close to the airport (and the rental companies). The room was clean and cozy. Breakfast was ok and I liked the waffles and eggs which were cooked upon order. Check in-out was easy as well.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Weekend with the Stones,"Came to town for the Stones concert and had a great weekend. The staff was great as well as the accommodations. Price was also very reasonable considering everything going on in town. The location is great for ease of access , your downtown in 15-20 minutes airport in 10",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Amazing Hotel for a family trip,This was a perfect gateway for our family vacation. It was very clean and eye appealing. The complimentary breakfast was amazing especially make-to-order omelettes. The evening complimentary drinks was a welcome break after a long day of trip.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,One night stay,Stayed here with my family after a week long camping trip. Hotel was clean and staff friendly.  They got us checked in early which was super helpful. Onsite restaurant was clean and meal was ok. Afternoon reception is always great with free well drinks and snacks.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Old, tired, loud, expensive, low value","Time to either completely renovate or tear down.  Must have been the first hotel put up next to the Denver International Airport when it opened up for flights.  The contract hides the Parking fees, the 3rd floor had an electrical transforming very loud noise located directly in the elevator.  The rooms A/C was about as loud, large stain in middle of the suite living room area, smelled of urine or something like that, may dog urine, who knows.  What a great welcome after driving all day and checking in late in the evening.  Taxes in this area....large.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Respectable lodging for the quick trip,"If you are flying into Denver for a quick meeting or short stay this Embassy Suites is a logical choice.  It is close to the airport with frequent shuttle service.  The rooms are spacious and clean. I often arrive in the evening and have found their dinner menu limited but good. The breakfast buffet is hot, and provides a decent array of options, including made to order omelets.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Unwelcoming, fly infested, no privacy",The front desk had absolutely no enthusiasm. Housekeeping walked into our room twice without knocking. The flies in the dining room was like eating outside. When I complained they gave me a fly swatter. It was way overpriced for the accommodations and service.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay at Embassy Suites DIA,"This is a nice Embassy Suites. You can't go wrong here if you need to be close to the airport.  The room was clean and spacious and perfect for us and our two kids.  King size bed was very comfortable.  The kids used the indoor pool and it was perfect for burning some energy after a long day of travel. If you aren't familiar with Denver, the airport is not terribly close to downtown Denver (airport sits among farms and crop fields west of Denver) so the main reason to stay here is if you need proximity to the airport for a flight the next day or you arrive late and just want a hotel nearby.  The dining options out this way are relatively limited.  The Embassy breakfast was good and about like you'd find at most other Embassy suites.  The price overall was a good value for the quality of the hotel and considering the prices of other hotels in the area.  Parking will cost you about $9 a day which isn't much and seems reasonable.  Also handy is a gas station across the street for refilling the rental car before returning.  All in all a good stay here for one night.  I would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay,"The suite was outstanding, with a great sleeping bed.  It had a great sitting area with a couch and chair and a table with chairs.  The area with the coffee pot and water had a sink with is great to have.  The bathroom was clean and spacious.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice extra touches,Room was clean and spacious with an excellent shower and comfortable bed. I heard good things about the free happy hour and everyone enjoyed the pool. The breakfasts were delicious and my egg white omelet was perfect. My only issue was that I had no wastebasket in the bedroom and couldn’t easily find the one in the living room/kitchen area.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Desert Biodome,"Great people and a fresh looking hotel here very conveniently located just 10 minutes from DEN. It was a very hot day, but the atrium area was incredibly warm. It was difficult to even sit and have a drink during happy hour. TIP: Check on the AC before staying here.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Beautiful hotel and good airport shuttle experience,"We stayed at this property on 6/29/19.  It was our last night in Colorado, and by far our favorite hotel out of the 6 different hotels we stayed at in a 10 day period of traveling out west. The hotel appeared to be new or at least recently renovated.  Upon check in, we were greeted by friendly staff.  She was very helpful in explaining how the shuttle to the airport worked and signed us up for the 4:00am shuttle the next morning.  Our room was very clean and overlooked the Denver skyline in the distance.  We had a rental car and decided that we wanted to go ahead and take it back that evening in order to not have to deal with it the next morning since our flight left at 6:00am.  So we took it back to Enterprise that evening, and Enterprise shuttled us to the airport.  Once at the airport, we had no trouble catching the shuttle to return to the hotel.  We made it back to the Embassy Suites in time for happy hour.  We sat at the bar because we wanted to order some food as well.  Sebastian (I think is his name ??) was on point!  The line for free drinks was so long, there were also several guests seated at the bar, and he had no help.  However, he kept that line moving and in between taking care of the line, he kept up with us.  He never let our glasses run empty and continued to check on, not just us, but all the other guests who were seated at the bar.  We were very impressed at how he was keeping up with everything all by himself.  We even watched him deal with a disgruntled guest who was rudely complaining about too much ice in her drink.  She was talking down to him and treating him like an idiot, but he handled her very graciously.  We also ordered food off of the menu.  The pork tacos and fish tacos were delicious!  We did not experience any other amenities at this hotel because we had to leave so early the next morning.  Our shuttle time was 4:00am, but we were down in the lobby early, so they went ahead and let us ride the 3:55am shuttle.  Be aware that this shuttle will stop at other hotels along the route, so give yourself enough time for a few extra stops if you are planning to shuttle to the airport.  We were in Denver for 4 nights but only stayed at this one for 1 night.  I wish we had stayed here all 4 nights.  I would most definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice place but Jacked up prices due to flight cancellations for weather!,So the hotel is nice.  Your regular Embassy Suites.  My big beef is that they jacked up the prices when flights were cancelled due to weather.  $350 for a room for 1 night when it is regularly $150 or less!,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Expensive, average hotel","Stayed here for one night before catching an early morning flight. Our room was mostly clean but I did find trash and dirty dishes while unpacking. Both phones in my room did not work, all lamps were unplugged. Beds were comfortable. Breakfast was ok. There was a sticky mess on the floor which seemed to have been well dried before I arrived. It was not cleaned during the 30 minutes while I was in the dining area. The staff I interacted with were not personalities I expect to encounter in the hospitality industry.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good property - Note on the shuttle,"Convenient location to the airport. Great breakfast. Clean and well appointed rooms. Good fitness center. What you expect from an Embassy Suites.One caution on the airport shuttle. It is contracted out to a provider that services 9 other hotels. You will need to be very assertive to get a seat on their shuttle during busy times as you are competing with a lot of other tired travellers. After an hour of trying and waiting, we took a taxi. When we expressed our frustration with management, they ultimately made us whole.Would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Excellent facilities, above and beyond service","Great hotel in the 'by airport' range. All rooms are suites so you can really relax and unwind when feeling cramped from travel. Family friendly, great for kids because of the extra space. Food range not huge but the quality, taste and portions are really good! Had the brussel sprouts with bacon and southwest salad with salmon - highly recommend. And service just great too. I nearly didn't get to stay as I'd managed to book myself in a week away from when I was due to arrive, and they were full to brim. The onsite manager was going out of his way running through just about every hotel in the book trying to find me somewhere to stay! Then we had great luck and someone freed up a room, and they took great care of me from there too. I saw them helping someone else out who had some difficulties as well. All in all, friendly, helpful, great facilities, great spaces. Very happy.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Bring your own bed sheets,The room was not clean!  The  bed sheets were dirty and not been clean.  Random children toys (from previous guest) and garbage in the dresser drawers.  Both TV's were unplugged from the wall.  I contacted the GM and he was less than helpful and didn't resolve the problems,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Short Notice,Got the room at midnight after delays and missing a connecting flight traveling with infant. Got the room for less than a 12 hour stay. It was excellent service from the shuttle to and from airport to the comfortable room for the family and the complimentary breakfast for the adults and kids.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Wonderful Denver hotel and very close to DEN airport,"We were on the 7th floor facing the July 4th fireworks- fantastic.  Furnishng all new and the bedding was great.  Staff helpful and energetic.  Happy Hour was wonderful with real ""food"" instead of chips and dip",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,The worst embassy suites in the world,The staff was rude and I felt like I as a customer was an inconvenience to them. The beds and pillows were from the 1970’s. The shower was slippery and my family fell twice in the bathtub. Told the front desk and bath mat was never offered. I asked for one over and over but it never came.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Poorly managed, Rude staff, Outdated, Inefficient washer and dryers and Charges for parking","This is one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at due to the staffs rude behavior, the outdated structure, the one dryer not working correctly, the breakfast being okay but not refiled as needed, and the parking fee is ridiculous when you're already charging $155.0 a night.  The staff seem to think they are bouncers at a club enforcing the no outside food policy in the lobby on some but definitely not all guest.  I watched them pick and chose people that were clearly eating food from outside the hotel and tell them they could not eat there and would need to take the food to their room.  I watched several times where they seemed to stand over and in an intimidating manner demand the guest remove the food.  I watched on another occasion where they actually tried to take the food away from the guest as he was eating it.  When I asked to speak to a manager about this they employee Jose brought over one of his co workers pretending to be the manager.  Later that evening a lady manager came over to speak with me as myself and  several other members of our team were watching tv on the sofa.  I began to explain the problem to her when she rudely interrupted me and began speaking over me.  I told her the conversation was not going anywhere and I would take it up with her boss in the morning.  A little while later I was sitting on the couch reading when security told me I would need to go to my room.  I went to my room and left a message for the manager that i would like to speak to him.  When myself and another guest met with the General Manager Michael Glover the next day he really didn't seem to care what we had to say and instead told us what great employees these people are and that they never get complaints about them.  The GM seemed more concerned with wither or not I made a comment about calling ICE because of the majority of the staff being Hispanic.  I told  him I never said that and the thought never crossed my mind. He gave me a grin in disbelief.  He then told me that staff felt threatened and were afraid to come into work.  He also stated that the manager had told him that I got into her face and was yelling at her.  At this point I asked him if he had cameras? He said yes, I asked him to please check the cameras from the previous night. He told me that the cameras do not cover the lobby area... even though if you look the cameras are clearly on the lobby area. I explained to him I never even stood up but was in a sitting position when his manager came to talk to me and explained to her the conversation was not going anywhere because she would not let me speak and I would take it up with him in the morning.  Two days later of our week long stay myself and two other members of our team were again watching tv on the sofa area when a member of their staff came over and began to scold us that we were not allowed to bring in outside drinks. We explained to her that those were not ours and one of us had just bought two $7 a piece beers from their bar.  I am so glad to be out of this crappy hotel and will never be back.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Average hotel near airport,This hotel was for a one day layover for DIA.  The reason why this is not a 5 star review is because the airport shuttle is sub standard.  This is a common complaint from other visitors.  The hotel knows about it but does nothing to remedy the situation.   We ended up paying for a cab after waiting 1.5 hours for a shuttle.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overpriced hotel,Overpriced hotel and charge for overnight parking..  Very surprised when arrived at hotel to find gate to parking lot.  Have used this hotel many times.  Room rates have increased substantially since our last stay.  Parking charge was the last straw for us.,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Stay!,"Embassy Suites- Great Stay!This was my first time at Embassy Suites and I was blown away. The accommodations were more than I could have asked for, from the roominess of the suite, to the food served at the complimentary breakfast, everything was top notch.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Have always loved this hotel...until now,"I am writing this review as I sit in the overcrowded pool area having asked for clean towels, twice. Upon check in, I was told that the airport shuttle was full for the morning unless we were willing to take a 3am or 5:35am shuttle. We requested 5 am as we have a 7:30 am flight, need to check bags, and are traveling with a small child. The front desk clerk finally stated that she could put us on the 5 am shuttle if we had our child ride on our lap. Hopefully that will work out.We are HHonors members and stay at this hotel several times a year every time we fly out of DIA as the ability to leave the car and take a shuttle used to be super convenient. Next time we will stay at the Westin in the airport where there is no need for a shuttle, and I have never wanted for a towel in their pool area.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent hotel!,"We stayed here for one night during our recent trip to Colorado, and it was an excellent experience! The staff was all friendly and professional. We had a late dinner in the restaurant and were impeccably served (and the food was really good!), breakfast the next morning was equally excellent. Our rooms were clean and comfortable with excellent amenities.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Experience!,I have used this hotel numerous times as an overnight stay prior to travel out of DIA.  They consistently deliver quality service.  The rooms are always fresh and clean and I enjoy relaxing and having dinner at the lobby bar.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,STELLAR EXPERIENCE,"On May 30, 2019 my Daughter-In-Law and GrandDaughter were traveling through Denver on a connecting flight to Montana.  Ultimately, their United Flight to MT was canceled, which caused them to have to stay overnight.  My DIL is not a seasoned traveler and my 15 yr. old GDD was understandably at the breaking point.This is important because my DIL called me from the airport, unsure what she should do.  Evidently, the UAL staff was not being all that helpful with overnight vouchers.  They 'ran out'.  Right away I got online to Hilton Honors and started to look for rooms and secured a room for the night at this Denver Airport Embassy Suites. Once the reservation was confirmed, I called the hotel directly to explain who was checking in, their situation and to make sure they had no more issues for the night.  I talked to SEBASTIAN, who was absolutely THE BEST customer service personnel I have worked with in a long time. He gave me detailed instructions on how to find the airport hotel shuttle, so I could pass them on to my DIL.  As this was 10:30 PM, she was tired, scared, and had trouble trying to navigate a near-deserted airport, so his help was immeasurable.  Sebastian also assured me he would 'look out' for them when they checked in.  He had toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant and even popcorn ready for them when they arrived.  (UAL of course, still had their luggage.)I am an HHHonors member for near 20 years and due to Sebastian, this is the best 'travel experience' I have ever encountered.  Even though I wasn't there!  He tuned the 'trip from hell' into a memorable travel tale.PS - Per my daughter-in-law, hotel cleanliness, room amenities and overall experience was AAAAA #1.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Stay near Denver Airport,Very good rooms. Excellent breakfast and good happy hour. Would recommend to any friends staying near the airport. The breakfast was definitely a cut above with the option to get a fresh omelette. Room was good sized and quiet.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,vegas trip,"the food and staff are top notch, and were very helpful, we had the filet and it was amazing, the pool was very nice and clean, hot tub was perfect, no problems at all, room was clean and new bed was comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place!!,"First off, the shuttle service from the airport was very easy. Check in was quick and easy. Very clean Hotel. Large rooms rooms with everything you need. The pool and spa were very nice. The food was really good.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Details,"Old hotel remodeled poorly with old lamps and equiptments. No USB charging ports on AC outlet/ Non working AC outlets. The staff behind counter could use some customer service training. Overall It was an ok stay, 9$ per day for parking is a rip off.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Clean & Comfortable,Clean & comfortable Embassy suites.  Friendly staff.  Ridiculous that they charge for parking when the street parking is free and plentiful for a 20 foot walk.  Even closer than most of the self parking spaces.  Not close to downtown.  About 10 minute drive from the airport.  A dispensary across the street.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice accommodations for an overnight stay close to the airport.,We were well satisfied with the accommodations for our overnight stay.  The hotel is located close to the airport with shuttle running every half hour.  The food is eye appealing and taste good at the restaurant in the hotel.  The rooms were comfortable and clean.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Heading downhill,"Although I've previously liked this hotel, a recent stay has made me realize this hotel has taken a turn for the worse. First there was the ridiculously complex parking gates which force you to pay a $9 daily penalty for bringing a car onto the premises. Then the suspension of any amenities, even a greeting, for being in their honors program. Next a rather hapless waitress serving dinner. When we finally made it to bed, after being up for 24 hours traveling from Europe, we are awakened by a call from the desk about a car parked in the entry area. We assured the caller our car was properly parked and gave them the location, We get back to sleep, only to get another call, this time from the manager, apparently to call us liars. This Fawlty Towers treatment was surprising and totally unnecessary. Think twice before choosing this hotel, which is clearly heading away from any standards of hospitality.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Weekend breakfast, expect delays","the service for breakfast, expect delays, the process or efficiency for not there because the cook to order breakfast and buffet are the same line.  I waited over 15 minutes to get buffet, my wife waited over 19 just for cook to order omelette.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Good, wanted a bit better service","Booked here on short notice after flight cancellation due to severe storms.  Nice rooms, noisy central atrium that includes the bar/restaurant is open to all rooms, which are on all sides of the square configuration. The bedrooms, at least, are on the outside of the suite, so quiet. Not easy to find shuttle at airport--the recording tells you to go to a door on the ""west side"" of the terminal. If you're not familiar with the airport and it's dark or storming outside, how does anyone tell what the west side is? Note--even-numbered exit doors are on the opposite side of the terminal from odd-numbered doors. Price was right, especially for short notice on unexpected layover.  Food in restaurant was good, though service around 10 pm could have been faster.  Pretty good quality breakfast for free--I don't think the breakfast included, especially a buffet, at most hotels is very appetizing, and usually has more limited selections than this one.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Airy and classy hotel/perfect for airport transit ,"Classy hotel with great facilities. I was thankful the manager let me check in early because my flight was cancelled. Suite was airy and big. The bed and pillow were my favorite. I had a sound sleep. But, the AC can be very noisy. Do ask for a quiet room. The digital key works well. There are gym and hot tub that helped me relax after long trip. Perfect for business and leisure travel.A few things to note. Shuttle bus from the airport is not frequent. Breakfast only serves till 9 AM and we weren't informed about it. Other than that, it's a nice hotel. I would come back.",4

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Hotel was FAB !,"Booked only one night before a flight out of Denver. While we often stay at Hiltons, this was a first at Embassy Suites. NICE! We arrived a bit late but grabbed a quick bevvie at bar happy hour. The room was perfecto!  So nice to relax in our lounge area ... big screen TV was great. Was super surprised that breakfast was real food ... we loved it! Nice coffee and fresh fruit & made to order egg whiles! Yay!  We spent a good hour in the indoor pool in the morning and was so chill before flying out. Also appreciated the upscale bath products. So our stay was a 9 of 10 ... only a loss of star because it's RIDICULOUS to pay $9/day to park in virtually the middle of NO-where!  Seriously folks, stop nickel and diming for parking in the middle of no-man's land!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Enjoyed my stay,It was very nice hotel enjoyed my stay and the staff was awesome. I would definitely stay there again. The breakfast was great.and loved the reception in the evenings after work. Transportation to the airport was very accessible.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Airport hotel,"As a hotel convenient to DIA, the hotel is one of the better ones. Definitely recommend stopping here. Shuttle to the airport is efficient, and driver was courteous. Food options for room service were limited.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Recommend to stay,"We have stayed here twice when we visited Denver in May. Nice comfy hotel with very friendly staff. The suite was very clean and nicely decorated and bed was comfortable. We got the premium suite this time and it had a variety of complimentary snacks available which were a life saver since our flight was delayed and we reached late after everything was closed. The view from the room was worth getting up early, you can see the Rockies covered with snow. The best part was the breakfast ( yes I m a foodie 😁) - they had so much variety from freshly made omlette and waffles to savory potatoes , cereals, fruits, french toast and of course juices , coffee and tea. I would give 5+ for that one. I don't drink alcohol but there is a complimentary happy hour every evening for the ones that do.( Another plus point am sure many  will appreciate )The staff was very friendly and smiling. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting Denver or passing by. I know I am going to for sure 😊",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great experience,I happen to be in Denver for a soccer event and stayed at this hotel for 6 days. My experience was very pleasant and would highly recommend others to stay at this hotel.  The free made to order breakfast was a special treat every morning and they even had an happy hour with free drinks and a substantial snack bar. Our room was comfortable with plenty of space and was fairly clean. I also took advantage of the free laundry facility which was an added bonus.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great experience for early flight out of DIA,"I stayed here the night before an early flight out of DIA.  I made it in around 5:30 pm and was greeted friendly at the front desk, reminded of the night managers reception, and the Diamond benefits.  I was surprised that free parking was not one of them.They had trail mix and veggies with the manager's reception, and the restaurant was serving food until late. I took my car to the rental car return facility and caught a shuttle back to the hotel and signed up for the 5:05 shuttle in the morning and the front desk took care of everything.In the morning the shuttle showed up right on time and no one was on the shuttle.  There was coffee in the lobby waiting on those that were early.In my room, there were some things that could have been cleaned and touched up but overall it was a nice room and I would stay there again.  I was happy with the room selection I was off in a corner and very low noise.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay,We stayed here because we had a very early morning flight to catch. Upon arrival we were greeted by Sebastian and he handled all of our questions and concerns amazingly. He was so pleasant and cheerful he really made our stay there memorable and is definitely a star employee! He also gave us some ideas for future travel plans we will definitely be back to the property thanks to his customer service!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Experience... But...,Over all this was a great place to stay. I ran into 2 problems the first problem was the room key. The digital key was not working nor the regular key card. I had to get a new key every time I left the room. I also ran into the hot tub issue and informed the front desk and nothing happened. Other than that it was an okay experience.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Value,"Nice Rooms, Great amenities, very nice staff.  Our stay was great.  The only complaint I would have on our stay was the breakfast staff.  Not very accommodating, did not replenish food, COLD items.  Very good omelette however! I would recommend this property",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Charge an additional fee to park in their parking lot??,"$155 for a room, then charged another $9 for the parking lot?  I decline and parked on street but was still charged.  I was very clear about being happy to park on the street and said I did not want to park in the parking lot.  With street lights etc street was more secure anyway.  But they still took my $9.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Hotel is nice on the outside but definitely didn’t meet Hilton standards,"We checked in for a little staycation, upon checking in I realized that I wasn’t put in the room requested. I called the hotel to ask about it because I checked in with my app they told me that they didn’t have a room that was offered. When we arrive we directly went to our room where we noticed that the room wasn’t completely cleaned. There was hair all over in the bathroom and tub. There were marks on mirrors. I asked my husband to go get some ice and when he grabbed the bucket it was full of water. I tried to call the front desk but couldn’t get through as it kept ringing busy. We then just decided to settle in for the evening, we turned on the tv to find out they didn’t have HBO which was a lot of the reason that we chose to stay at this particular hotel as the season premiere of a show we wanted to watch was on. What a huge let down. I followed up with the hotel the next day and it was also a huge let down. I will definitely not recommend this hotel to any of our out of town company.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Value and Convenience,"This is certainly our first choice when we park and fly out of DIA, but it is also a great location for other business and leisure. The close proximity to I-70, East Denver from Pena Blvd., and an easy destination traveling on I-25 from Wyoming. Be aware, however, that this hotel now charges a flat $9.00 parking fee to prevent non paying customers from stealing parking space and shuttle service from honest paying customers!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Busy hotel,The hotel was very nice but very busy.  The shuttle service took a while to pick us up.  Then we had to wait in a decent size line to check in and out.  The restaurant and bar closed pretty early.  Had to get room service which was pricey and not that great.  Overall the room and rest of the hotel were very clean.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Colorado Springs,"Daily cleaning could be improved.

Breakfast cooks could be more friendly, smile.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Feeling Special,"I have always liked Embassy Suites and this one is my new favorite. Everyone was so helpful, friendly and work to go above and beyond. How great is a hotel that sets out granola bars, fresh fruit, coffee and juice for early departing guests. What a surprise to find this waiting for me at 4:00am on my way to airport. Now that is hospitality!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great choice near the airport,"We love staying at the Embassy Suites especially for the extra space and privacy when traveling as a family, with the sofa sleeper in a separate room. We only stayed for one night since we had an early flight the next morning but the room was clean and spacious, the bed was comfortable, we had all the towels and toiletries needed, and both the check-in and check-out experience was quick and friendly. Even though breakfast wasn't fully set up and ready by the time we needed to catch the (complimentary!) shuttle to the airport we were happy to be able to grab some juice and pastries on the run.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Some good - some not so good,"Nice rooms, spacious and comfortable.  No bellman to assist with bags (they recruited someone), and shuttle was delayed and that is not good at midnight.  The hotel charges for internet $14.95/day for basic and $19.95 for premium.  A bit of overkill.  While I did not use the parking, they evidently charge you to park at the hotel. UGH!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Charging for parking, ONLY hotel in area charging","Beware: They charge for parking now as a guest of their hotel at $9/day.  It's the ONLY hotel charging for parking in the whole area so look elsewhere.  They don't list it anywhere on the email confirmation either.  When leaving the hotel the next day, the parking computer was frozen so we had to back up and go out a different way.  This seems very petty and greedy.The room was in need of maintenance: dangerously loose outlet over the wet bar area, caulking missing in the shower, clogged bathroom sink, and a very leaky window in the bedroom making it uncomfortable.  The breakfast was good and the evening reception was enjoyable, the bartender was extremely helpful and friendly.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel,I had a great stay.  Loved the hotel and will stay there again when I am traveling.  Liked the social and there was a very nice lobby to sit in and read.  The room was great.  It had everything you needed.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Three for Three,"This is our third stay-park-fly trip at ES DIA. It has been great each time.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great DIA hotel!,"Great service at front desk, bar and restaurant. Very clean and convenient! Fantastic breakfast. Cannot believe they had cheese blintzes. Yum! Appreciate the happy hour too! The bar/restaurant area is very comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Freezing lobby,","The lobby temperature was well below comfortable, even with my heavy winter coat and hat. Unfortunately, the open floor plan meant that dining room and bar were was cold as the lobby. This made our evening dinner unenjoyable.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great one night stay!,"Nice looking hotel, easy check-in, great happy hour.  I was there for an interview.  All rooms are suites and the interview was actually completed in one of the rooms.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Can I Have Hair Everywhere Please?,"Room was not cleaned.  There were pubic hairs everywhere in the shower and even on the bar of soap the cleaning people failed to remove from the Sasquatch that stayed in the room prior .  Hair all over the sink, floor, bar area, end tables in living room.  Questionable staining on the floors and overall the most nasty room I have ever seen.  Cleaning staff should be reprimanded.  I will not use this hotel again and could have stayed a cheaper hotel that would have been cleaner.",2

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Airport Proximity/ Business Trip/ Zero sleep. NOISY HOTEL- needs management control.,"My latest stay at this property will be the last.  This hotel sits near the airport and we used it for a quick sleep before a dawn flight.  Embassy Suites have the traditional atrium, which is a great feature! Love those atriums.THIS Embassy Suite has an atrium, but the noise ringing from it shakes the windows even at the top floor. The newly renovated bar below stays open late.  Multiple groups of kids running the floors echo.  A birthday party in the next room including a half dozen 9-yr olds was rocking til 1:30am.Crazy, noisy place awake all night.  We got some assistance from the night desk to quiet down the birthday girls, but that was only one piece of the chronic noise issue.I feel that the GM needs to address the level of ‘energy’ here and put some limitations on guests and some double pane glass on the rooms.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice hotel,"This hotel was newly decorated and modern. Huge atrium, clean rooms, beautiful Suites. I took the shuttle to the airport at 2 a.m. and had no issues. I was unable to utilize the breakfast however my husband and son utilized it and said it was great",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Staff in unclear what policies are,"We go to Florida every January and have begun staying at hotels close to DIA so we can catch early AM flights.  For the past 2 years (2018 and 2019) we have stayed at the Embassy Suites Denver International Airport.  Each year we have been very disappointed in not being able to get any breakfast service prior to leaving for our flight.  In 2018 we came down at 6:00AM when breakfast is supposed to start but they were still trying to get things setup.  We waited till about 6:15 and asked if they were ready and we were told just a few more minutes.  We had to leave and got no breakfast.  We decided to try again this year 2019. At checkin I asked what time breakfast was and was told 6:00 AM.  I relayed our experience and the clerk told me no problem.  'We can repare a to go breakfast just stop by desk later that night and order one'.  We stoped down later and the gentleman said he would check and came back and told us no to go boxes but fruit, yogurt, and granola bars are put out at 3:00 AM for guests who leave early.  Next AM, at 5:45 we were down checking out and could not find any of the items they had told us- yogurt, granola bars and fruit- and asked that desk clerk.  He kind of laughed and said they do put out fruit and pointed to a table where there were a couple of apples in a bowl.  I explained what I had been told and he said that is all they have.  I later communicated with the front desk manager via email.  Shewho was apologetic in an email back to me and said she would make sure everyone understd the policies.  I replied asking exctly what their policy is- absolutely no response which tells me they do not have any poicy to accomdate travelers who must leave prior to the 6:00 AM breakfast.  So, if you are leaving prior to 6:00 AM or even 6:15 AM sometimes- don't count on getting anything to eat!  We have stayed at many Embassy Suites over the years and NEVER had these kind of customer service issues and different stories from staff.  Hilton should learn from McDonalds who grew significantly by making sure each store had the same quality and service.  Hilton should take note.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay.  ,Well another great Embassy Suites to add to the list.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Breakfast didn't open when posted,The hotel was nice. Unfortunately the complimentary breakfast did not open at 6:00 AM as posted. At 6:00 the staff was just starting to set-up and I needed to depart by 6:15 to catch my flight. I waited until 6:05 and the area was still not open. I departed and picked up food at the airport. Very disappointed in the Embassy Food Service management.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Nice, typical Embassy Suites",I always appreciate the full breakfast and it's always good. The rooms are clean and quiet.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Compound,"I felt like I was in a compound, having to constantly fumble with exiting the hotel, due their parking gate with a crumpled receipt (after 4 days) to exit and for no apparent reason, as many other hotel immediately surrounding the ESH did not have parking gates.  They should remove them ASAP.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient to airport,"We stayed here on a Park Sleep and Fly deal for one night.

Main lobby is open and serves a happy hour with snacks in the evening and is the setting for dinner and full breakfast. Friendly waiters and decent food. We had happy hour snacks then decided to have dinner. Had the  quesadilla which was tasty and a burger--also pretty good.Rooms are 2-room suites. Comfortable and large, with a small fridge and a microwave. Plenty of space for luggage and folks. Left our car for a week in the well-lit  gated lot. Felt secure and we had no problems with our vehicle while gone.There is really nothing nearby in the way of attractions--although there are a number of restaurants and shops nearby. Closest thing is the airport, about 5 miles away. You need a car if you're staying here and expect to sight-see.Great location and good stay. We would definitely stay here again,",4

The usual snacks, dips and vegetables were set up on a table near the back wall. A limited menu was offered from the adjacent breakfast /kitchen area.We spent a quiet restful night. Breakfast was very good.We will stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Business Trip,Overall the hotel was a nice. There is a need to renovate the rooms some but overall the rooms were clean. The parking situation is my only bad remark abou this hotel. You have to py for parking and the process is kind of a detrement because you do not use your room keey to acces the gate. Breakfast and evening social are exceptional. Room service is quick. Overall I gice them a 9.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice hotel very close to the airport,"We typically stay at Embassy Suites when the kids are with us because of all of their amenities.  This was our first stay here and had a pleasant check-in (they allowed us to check in early because the other hotel that we had stayed at had an earlier check out).  There are gates at all of the parking lots and parking is $9/night unless you are a Hilton's Honor's member.  We were given our room- we had a corner king room and it was huge and had a great view of the mountains.    Plenty of space for our toddler to spread out.We went down for the evening social and were a little disappointed with the offerings for food and beverages.  Only domestic beers and the food was a tasteless cheese spread, snack mixes, veggies and dip and chips and salsa.  Other ES that we have stayed at have had craft beers and hot food- it was the same selections both nights we were there.  We ended up ordering room services that was pretty good.  The morning breakfast is always great and one of the biggest reasons we choose ES. The pool area was nice but the hot tub is outside and in single digit weather, not fun to run outside in a wet suit.  They had a nice workout room, but we didn't use it.  We were there for two days and needed to access the hotel shuttle.  The front desk staff seemed less than thrilled to be there and when we had an issue with the gate out of the parking lot, we had to drive back to the front desk and he was less than polite when we advised them there was an issue with the gate.    While we had a few minor issues, there was nothing that would prevent us from staying again.",4

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Rooms were dirty.,Went to 3 different rooms. Stains on all carpets. Bathroom walls filthy. Microwaves had crusted old food on microwave plates and spills. The hallway phone was dirty with something spilled on it. We travel all over and have stayed in many Hilton properties including Embassy Suites. Never seen one of this low quality.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Flight Delay - Unplanned Overnight,The hotel shuttle was still running promptly when I arrived at DIA at 1:00 am after a lengthy flight delay.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Close to the Airport,"We picked this hotel because of the brand and closeness to the airport.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice place to stay for 1 night.,Used the Hilton van pickup at the airport and a smoky smelling unmarked van picked us up.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Return stay,"Stayed there so we could leave our vehicle when we were in Europe for 12 days.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Clean and spacious,"This is a fairly new facility and has a very attractive atrium for breakfast, happy hour, meals and socializing. It has an indoor swimming pool but the hot tub is outside. The nicely decorated room we had was quite spacious with separate living room with a sofa, chair and a table for four. There was a mini-fridge, microwave and sink. The bathroom was nice and clean. The bedroom was spacious with plenty of room for luggage. Our only complaint was that the bed was quite hard and the pillows were flat. Also, the ATM was broken while we were there. On the upside, the maid service was excellent and front desk folks were very nice.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Would totally recommend!,"We stayed at this Hilton for a family gathering and could not have been more pleased with the room itself, especially the comfort of the bed!  We wanted to take the pillows with us! The complimentary breakfast was also excellent and the atmosphere of the bar area was very inviting.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,You're Paying to Park Now,"This is a very nice example of an Embassy Suites with all of the usual perks. I've stayed at this Embassy many times on my way out of the Denver airport. The location is very good if you like to stay near the airport the night before departure. They have been renovating the past couple of years and are now done. The results are very nice and they have freshened up the facility to like-new. The fitness room is adequate for a hotel, with a complete set of dumb bells, cable weight machine, treadmills, bikes and elliptical trainers. The pool is neat/clean. The manager's evening reception has a small selection of complimentary beer, wine and well drinks, and very light snacks. The selection of drinks and the snacks are not as extensive as other Embassy Suites I frequent, but hey, it's complimentary. Breakfast is good, with cooked-to-order eggs, and the area is well staffed and typically clean. The staff is generally friendly and professional. Now my gripe: after many years, it's now pay to park...$9 per night. This fee seems very out of place in this location. I'm used to paying to park in downtown hotels where parking is at a premium and there is no other free parking, but there is plenty of nearby free parking and NO other hotel in the area (there are many within blocks) charges for parking. In my opinion, this is a very rural type area and the parking fee is very out-of-place.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Will stay again,"The in hotel services are great, no need to leave the hotel if you don’t want to.  Breakfast was great, staff was helpful, bar had plenty of options, shuttle service was convenient, elevators were quick!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Perfect as always,"Another great stay at Embassy Suites.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Pretty entry way, boring and tired tooms","When I first entered this hotel, I liked what I saw: modern decor in a rustic yet sophisticated Colorado theme. Then I entered my room - what the heck? It looks like they placed a boring, 20 year old hotel room inside a newer hotel.The room was plenty spacious and the bed comfortable. But the room felt tired, drab and old.Bonus: this hotel is very near Rocky Mountain Arsenal wildlife area, with trails for runners / fitness walkers.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel,"Close to the airport, rooms are spacious. Free full breakfast is a plus.

The hotel is clean and the rooms provide plenty of space. Breakfast is one of the best This is my new Denver hotel of choice!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Overnight Stay,"The people at the front desk were very helpful and the room was upscale and modern, and the bed very comfortable. It was a great overnight stay with a good breakfast in the morning before I had to leave. Made to order omelettes! And the gate wasn't working when I was there so I didn't have to pay for parking either. The only issue I had was the pillows on the bed aren't that great. Other than that it was a wonderful stay",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,nice place to stay,"It's a really nice hotel.  you have to pay extra for wifi, but that was the only down side.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent accommodations for family,"We were traveling with our toddler and needed a stop over between flying in and driving to the mountains.  Having two rooms was critical for everyone's sleep, so the suite was perfect.  The adults wound up sleeping in the main room and the toddler was in the bedroom--but the foldout was actually very comfortable.  And the in-room dining was key.  All the staff was very nice and we were impressed with the facilities.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Second Review - Great Hotel with some upgrades,"Overall this is a great hotel and location near the international airport.  The location has several upgrades - parking gates that are not in operation yet and some upgrades to the social area/breakfast seating including a new pool table.  The rooms are showing their age, but still very clean and fresh and it is an overall great value.  The front desk staff are great - recognizing how busy they are and engaging.  One issue - if you are sitting in the living room portion of the suite, it is very noisy.  This noise is not from outside, but below during the nightly reception - but, good news...when you are in the bedroom of the suite, you cannot hear a thing....that is great.  One other recommendation - use the plastic bath mat for the shower.  The room is very clear, but the shower is very slick and have almost fallen a couple of times.  Just a recommendation to consider.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great experience night before early flight.  Did Stay and Park package.  Worked fine!,"We fly in and out of Denver a lot and usually pick one of the many hotels out near the airport based on price, and use a long-term parking places to leave our car during our trip.  This time we decided to try the Embassy Suites and do the Stay and Park package.The hotel was clean and updated.  The parking was plentiful, though it did fill up later that night, and well-lit.  The Manager's Reception with snacks and drinks was so nice that we abandoned our plans to find a restaurant and stayed to eat at the hotel restaurant.  There were not a lot of selections, but they were varied and we really enjoyed what we chose.  We had to leave too early to experience the breakfast others have raved about.The room was clean, quiet and very spacious.  Our experience with the shuttle both to and from the airport was good.  They were on time and polite.If I had one thing to change it would be to have breakfast available earlier.  It seems to me most travelers using and airport hotel the night before a flight are there because their flight is an early one.  Even if it has been a limited ""Grab and Go"" options, it would have been nice to have had something to take with us.Other than that, this will now be our Go To place pre-flight.  Good job, Embassy Suites!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Pleasant Stay,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights before flying home after our holiday in Colorado. We chose this hotel rather than one nearer downtown as the rate was reasonable given that full breakfast and an evening reception was included. Also, the proximity to the airport and free shuttle allowed us to catch the A-Line train from the airport to Union Station downtown. Trains run every 15 minutes, the journey takes around 35 minutes, and a day pass is only $9 per person ($4.50 for seniors aged 65+).We had a 1 bedroom corner suite which was extremely spacious, very clean, light and airy, and well equipped, including a safe. Breakfast included plenty of choices and there was an egg station for freshly cooked omelettes etc. The 2-hour evening reception included snacks, wine, beer and some spirits - a nice way to relax after a day exploring downtown. The restaurant menu was somewhat limited, but the food was pretty good.Hotel staff were helpful, friendly and cheerful. Unfortunately one of the shuttle drivers could use customer service training. Although I understand that the shuttle is not operated by Embassy Suites, the driver’s attitude could easily give a poor first impression. Fortunately the other shuttle drivers we encountered were really friendly.Overall a very pleasant stay and we would stay here again without hesitation.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not well kept,This hotel has really gone downhill. Stains everywhere and cracks in the walls. Our comforter had stains on it and was filthy. We asked for a clean one but they  said they didn’t have any. The front desk clerk was friendly and did a great job though. I don’t think we would stay at this location anymore.,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Wonderful Service,"We used the Embassy Suites before and after our vacation. They provided a handicapped shuttle for us to and from the airport. When we returned and we're too tired to drive home, it was early in the morning.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not a usual embassy suites,"It started with me not having any free water in my room, I am diamond status and still didnt get any. And worse the breakfast seemed half of what Im normally accustomed to with embassy suites, the fruit was not fresh it was frozen in a big plastic tray, and there was no bacon anywhere I had to ask the omelette chef for some. The time was 830am, so they had plenty of time to have fresh fruit and bacon. Other embassy suites have tons of fruit and bacon, very disappointing, being that I stayed here for the breakfast.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Two smoke filled rooms in a row and no ""snacks"" in our Premium Suite","We arrived on Saturday afternoon at this Embassy Suites (we typically love this particular brand of Hilton Hotels) and we had booked a ""Two Room Premium Suite"" with 56,000 Hilton Honors points. The premium suites are advertised to have an assortment of snacks and drinks. The Embassy Suites website says ""Keurig Coffee Brewer, snacks and drinks - upgraded amenities in our Premium Suites make for the best experience yet. The assortment of non-alcoholic drinks, snacks and K-Cups are replenished daily"". When we walked into this room the only things we found were the coffee maker (which are standard in every room) and a can of Coke and Diet Coke with no snacks anywhere to be found. This could have been overlooked, however the more pressing issue was that when we got into room #715 the room was hot, incredibly musty (which can usually be remedied by turning on the AC unit) and smelled heavily of smoke (which we later found out that you just can't get rid of). I called down to the front desk and they said they could not accommodate us in another Premium Suite like we had booked but that a smaller, non-premium room was available and that I'd have to come back down to the front desk and get another key. The only accommodation offered was a 10,000 point refund, which I negotiated into a 15,000 point refund (which still has not been posted to my rewards account). I went back down to the front desk, waited in line for the second time, and we went to our second room #712. This one had the exact same strong smoke smell as the first one. I asked my wife if we should go try a third time but frankly, the desk attendant seemed pretty annoyed by having to accommodate our first request to switch to a different room so we didn't have the time and/or energy to go through this entire process another time and we decided to just ""grin and bear it"" (which you shouldn't have to do when you're traveling for pleasure using points that took a long time and a lot of money to earn). In my view, the correct response by the hotel would have been to have a member of management come up and inspect our first room upon a report of an unsatisfactory odor, and have another room key ready to switch to if the first problem couldn't be easily remedied - with a sincere apology and a greater than 10,000 point refund offer. We decided to turn on the AC unit to go to dinner, hoping that the smell would have dissipated by the time we returned - when we returned a few hours later it had not gone away at all. After all was said and done, when we got back home the next day all of our clothes and luggage reeked of smoke and even my CPAP machine that I use to sleep at night smelled like smoke. I can completely understand how one room may have a problem with a smoker that didn't follow the rules, but two rooms - only a few doors away from each other? Also, I really feel like our hotel stay was much less than satisfactory and the offer from the front desk of a smaller room for an 18% point refund really makes me not want to stay at this hotel in the future. In my opinion after two attempts at getting a clean ""smoke free"" room, the management should offer to refund your entire stay. These two rooms really need attention - possibly new paint, carpet and bedding in order to get rid of the horrible smell that penetrates your guest's belongings.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent stay,"New Hotel, beautiful bar and breakfast area.  Excellent breakfast. Rooms were spacious and clean.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice place to stay with a shuttle to the airport,This was a very nice hotel. It is the closest Embassy Suites to the airport that I could find. It is in a group of hotels and restaurants that make it easy to give us travelers choices of where to stay and what to eat. There appeared to be plenty of parking.The staff was very friendly.  They room was clean and well appointed in the standard Embassy Suites configuration of a living room and a bedroom with a bathroom in between. They had Happy Hour and offered table service if you wanted to order food but it was a little pricey for us so we drove to get something to eat nearby. They have an airport shuttle that you can sign up for that we took advantage of for the next morning. Overall it was a very nice place to stay for an evening.,4

The fitness suite is good and the pool also.  The Hot-Tub perhaps needs a bit of a spruce-up.  Not much around hotel but with the Barman being that good - who cares!  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Close to airport,"The happy hour and breakfast buffet are always a plus when staying at Embassy Suites. While they were adequate, they were not as good as others. Was sort of disappointed that the only beer you could get during happy hour was a local craft beer. There were no light beers available. The business center computer was not working either. The man working the front desk didn’t know what was wrong with it. However, he did print out my boarding passes for me. Not a bad experience, just not what I’m used to with Embassy Suites.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Dated,"The location was close to airport.  Free shuttle to airport but shuttle was 15 mins late.  The room was in serious need of refurbishment—-lock was about to fall off, carpet was stained.  Gross!  The staff at check in was ok.  Restaurant staff was good.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Only ok,"Stayed here for one night before a flight back home with my family of five.  Room was only ok.  There were some things that have been updated such as countertops, but the bathroom looked tired.  The painting in the room was spotty - you could tell where there covered up areas with touch up paint.  Bedroom was light and bright, but the living area was dreary.  Beds were comfortable.  They provided two water bottles in the room, but charged for them which I think is awful, especially since anyone coming from a lower elevation knows - you need to drink twice as much water when in the higher elevations.  The breakfast left a lot to be desired.  My husband warned me not to drink the orange juice as he said it was terrible.  I have never heard of bad orange juice.  The silverware needed to be replenished as well as some of the food stations.  The bananas were some of the worst looking I have ever seen.  It was very disorganized and not well staffed.We inquired about the shuttle in the morning and were told to take the earlier one as they anticipated a full bus on the one we intended on taking.  The driver was very nice.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Before flight,"Stayed here on our way to Mexico, it was a quick trip. Rooms were great, reception was very nice. Was able to leave the vehicle there for the week we were gone. Was nice that we were able to use the shuttle to and from the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Mixed review,"In a recent stay at this hotel, I was really disappointed in the over all quality I have come to expect from Embassy Suites.  There was a long black hair in the bathroom, there was part of a plug broken off in one of the plug ins and requests made before check in were not taken care of or even noted.  I also didn't think the managers reception was up to the quality of others I have visited.  That said, the management was extremely prompt in correcting problems and discounted the price to compensate for the inconvenience.  The desk person was extremely kind, courteous and helpful.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Soccer Tourney,"Great location, awesome happy hour every night!  Clean and spacious rooms.  Only complaint is that the food in the breakfast buffet was not fantastic but that's ok.  We will definitely stay here again in the future.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Transit stay,"First night in USA....tired and looking for a good bed.The Embassy Suites were very convenient to the airport and the staff were excellent. We were tired and just looking for a nice dinner and a quiet and comfortable clean room....The Embassy did the trick.So good that we also booked on our trip out.Thank you, we will stay again.  All of the staff were really good and your pillows are the best .",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Service is slow or non exsistent.. I couldn’t check out because staff was nowhere to be found.,I had to wait 35 minutes before I could track down someone in the lobby to take a lunch order.  And a bunch of us from the meeting waited sever minutes to check out during a break and no one was at the front desk or around to check us out. We had to return to the meeting without checking out.,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Hotel messed up reservation.,When we arrived to the hotel we where given a key and room. When we got into the room and turned on the light both beds had sleeping in them. I did not stay in the room long enough to ask questions. When returning to the front desk and informed her there where no other rooms. We had to go over 30 min. away to another hotel and they only had one room left that wasn't a double. This Brand extremely disappointed us.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great location and service,"We had an excellent suite and received great service throughout out stay. Good breakfast and nice evening snacks and drinks. Convenient location to airport and car return. Quiet and clean. Dining area, lobby and bar are very well designed and pleasant to hang out in. Would stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Filthy bathroom and rude maid,"Stayed here for 2 nights in July for business. The maid came to the room wanting to know if I wanted service. I said yes please. She said she would come back. 2 1/2 hrs later I went to the room and she hadn’t been back. I tracked her down and asked for clean towels at least. She said she would bring them to me. After about an hour she brought towels. I asked for a clean glass. After huffing and eye rolling, she informed me she would have to go to the kitchen to get one. I told her don’t worry about it.  The bathroom sink faucet was cracked, the vent above the hook to hang your bath towel was covered in dust and hair and there was urine on the base of the toilet on both sides.  I would have mentioned these things when I checked out but was not asked how my stay was. Desk clerk was more concerned with what was going on in the back room.  Cody and Chris at the bar were great though!  I will not be staying here again nor would I recommend it to anyone",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A Five Star Experience at Embassy Suites,Anytime we can stay at an Embassy Suites property we always know that our stay will be an enjoyable visit.  My wife and I first stayed together at an Embassy Suites on our honeymoon evening nearly 38 years ago in Omaha.  Thank you for always delivering the best experience.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Enjoyable stay,"Enjoyable stay for the night. We were flying out of Denver the next morning and enjoyed a peaceful night, great breakfast, pool for the kids, and many restaurants nearby for dinner.  We'd choose this hotel again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good Stay,"My family was here for an annual get together with friends.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Our room was fine.  Very comfortable bed.  Our son had no problems with the sofa sleeper and even with it open there was still room in the living area.  Made to order breakfasts, although not everything was available each day.  It was a little more money than I would have liked to have spent but that is the way it is now.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Delighted,We had a very long and stressful flight from London and arrived at the hotel in the early hours of the morning so unfortunately didn't get to stay as long here as we would have liked as we were departing for our road trip the next day.  Our room was massive with two queen sized beds and an adjoining sitting and bathroom.  It was extremely clean and very comfortable.  The complimentary buffet breakfast was also very enjoyable - well cooked with plenty of choice.  An excellent start to our US holiday.  We were just disappointed we were only staying for one (half) night.  I would 100% recommend this hotel and will definitely book again if we fly to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Fine,"Our stay was fine for the most part. Stayed one night with their park and fly rate and another night after we returned. Check in was so so on our first night, took forever at 11pm because there were three people in front of us causing issues. Not hotel’s fault. Fresh omelets for breakfast is always nice. Our return night was decent, quick check in and good breakfast again. Rooms were nice both nights. The shuttle ride to the airport the first night was good, polite driver and he was right on time. The shuttle ride to the hotel for our last night was BAD. It took almost an hour for us to be picked up there were so many people. The issue is that the hotel uses the same shuttle service that several other hotels use. I think this is an absolutely ridiculous amount of time to have to wait, especially when it’s 11pm. Not sure why the hotel doesn’t use one of the 3 embassy suites vans parked in the back of the hotel. Other than the shuttle debacle it’s a fine place to stay for a couple nights to or from the airport.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Stinks,Room smelled like ashtray. Only proposed solution was for us to find somewhere else to stay.  Concerns not heard. Also found food on the floor. Lots of other options near by. Breakfast was ok. Never again!,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great one night stay,"We stayed here using award points after flying in late on a weeknight. We were headed to Fort Collins and Estes Park. Front desk was great, rooms were quiet. The bar was adequate and breakfast was better than expected. This hotel served us well.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not impressed at all,"Nice lobby area but that is about it.  Parking and entering the building can prove challenging.  If you park near the back, you basically have to walk all the way around to the front to get in.  We tried 2 doors with the key and finally walked to the front entrance.  The front desk kid acted as if he were weened on a pickle.  The carpet in the room had stains all over it.  All 4 pillows were very lumpy and needed replacement.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel and convenient to DIA,"Recommend hotel for quick access to Denver Airport.  Very nice and bed was awesome.  Beautiful facility inside with lovely atrium area. Great friendly staff. Only mark down was for the pillows which were not firm enough for my liking, but I did not ask if they had other options.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Aging property,"One night business stay.  Property, like many of this vintage ES is aging.  Upkeep is good overall, though.  Staff very helpful.  Good air port shuttle service.  Manager's reception is a plus with limited but adequate drink menu.  Restaurant serviceable.  I did not get any airport noise.  It is a bit of a trek over to the airport, takes a bit of time.  Nice view of the mountains.  Overall I would recommend.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice business hotel,"We stayed at this hotel the night before our flight.  It is very convenient to DIA and the shuttle got us there promptly.  There was some confusion about the shuttle to the Embassy Suites - it was an unmarked van instead of a shuttle that said Embassy Suites.  The driver came over and found us, though.We didn't have time for breakfast, but we enjoyed the manager's reception and the fitness center.  There are a few restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.I would definitely recommend Embassy Suites for a business trip or layover.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Brab Madisen,My stay overall was stressful at 1st due to a young girl at the front desk but overall the hotel beautiful and very clean. Most of the staff was great with the exception of that girl. Never did get her name straight dark hair. Don't let her call you ataxi. Turns out I find out later the taxi guy she called for me was not a taxi it was a friend of hers that she called and tried to charge me $40 to take me 2 block to gas station.At the airport the next day I happen to see him there arguing with a older couple so I intervene. The guy once again in white tank top cargo pants and a black Lincoln Towne Car is not even real taxi driver. When I though about it there was no meter in the car. Anyway John the general Manager took care of me and I was grasteful. I think they need to get rid of the girl at the desk though. I would stay there again but will certainly not deal with her.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Perfect rest tstop,"The hotel is newer, with nice rooms, comfortable bed, delicious omelettes for breakfast and good coffee.  As good as a preflight rest stop gets!  They didn't tell us there were free drinks and snacks until 7:30, but we bumped into them at 7:29 pm!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Awesome!,"We stayed for two nights prior to flying out so we had a great suite on the 4th floor with a view of the Rockies in the distance. We went to the bar for complementary drinks(non- alcoholic & alcoholic) with some snacks. The breakfast in the morning was made to order omelets & a huge variety of of foods include french toast, bagels, cereals, pastries, juices & of course, hot coffee! We ate dinner off site so we can't review their restaurant. There are several restaurants within a mile or so! All in all, we would stay there again. It was easy access to the airport, too!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites Denver airport,"Stayed here one night.  Room 712.  Room comfortable.  King bed.  Living room, Keurig and lots of snacks and beverages.  Evening happy hour only had minimal snacks.  Decent wine.  Room smelled like it used to be a smoking room.  I will not stay here again.  I have stayed outside of the Airport area and like the hotels better. Very expensive too.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Reasonably Satisfied,"Our expectations generally were met.  We didn't receive a wake-up call that we asked for.  Also, we would like Hilton to show the room charge and parking charge separately.  While there were a couple glitches, we probably will continue to stay at Embassy Suites, though I may check out alternative park-and-fly arrangements for our next trip.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,overall experience was great!,we chose the hotel because of the suite.  we were able to put the kids in the living room on the pull pout sofa and then us adults enjoyed a room with a door!  LOL  The overall feel of the hotel was great.  There breakfast has a good variety of choices to go with anyones needs.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great service and everything else ,"The hotel is clean, quiet and well staffed.  I arrived early and they got me a room as soon as they could.  Breakfast was great and the managers’s reception was perfect.  Snacks and beer. Local beer 😊👍",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Incompetent front end staff,My reservation was mishandled by the front end help and I was not made aware of the mistake until checkout  They couldnt resolve the issue. Trying to call accounting was a joke. A greeting saying the manager would be available on a certain date didn't mean a damn thing. Makes you wonder where that person was,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Shower in a toilet?,Jenni the accounting manager had little to empathy that my shower filled up with water and what ever else the previous room occupants chose to wash down the shower.In fairness to Jenni she had just walked through the door. Prior to that this 7 story almost full service hotel had NO management on-site. This place is far from a jewel in Hilton's crown. It's more a thorn!,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Close to airport, free parking, free full breakfast, free drinks and snacks from 5:30-7:30, free airport shuttle","Embassy Suites is great for longer stays or larger groups, as you get more room than in a traditional hotel room.  There were only 2 of us and only overnight, but it's still nice to have a separate room from the bedroom with a sofa, club chair, table (which we used as a desk as well) and extra TV.  The room was nicely appointed, but the lighting around the bathroom mirror (as opposed to the more traditional lights above the mirror) made it too dim to see well.  I found that using the mirror in the living area worked better.  From our bedroom window we could see the snow on the mountaintops in the distance - in late May.Manager's reception (free from 5:30-7:30) offered several wines and a choice of liquor, while munchies were crackers, cracker/nut/pretzel mix, and hummus.  Free breakfast in the morning featured a made-to-order omelette station, but the person preparing them got mine wrong.  Not worth waiting to have a new one made.  OJ had run out in the machine (was orange colored water coming through) and was quickly replaced when we mentioned it - but then it ran too thick.Free shuttle to the airport runs 5 and 35  minutes after the hour - plenty of room for everyone and their bags.Would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great one night stay by the airport,We spent one night at this hotel prior to our flight home from Denver. Excellent bar selection in the lobby. Excellent breakfast was included. Beds were great. No complaints from the third traveler that slept on the couch also. Very glad the hotel provides a free shuttle to the airport as well.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Consistent ,"I flew into Denver airport-the hotel was a $20 Uber ride.  The usual Embassy breakfast (good), the free wine/drink reception in the evening.  The fitness center was pretty busy at 7:30 am.  I didn’t get a chance to use the pool.  The room, service & amenities are what you would expect from Embassy Suites.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Our stY,"We had a very good stay at this embassy suites.  Except for a minor issue with breakfast with either poor planning or staff not wanting to help, we recommend this facility.  Bed was comfortable, front desk staff helpful, clean room and nice large suite.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient stay for the airport,"History: Originally built and opened in 2002. Renovated in 2016.Location: Near the airport (still over 3 miles aways) in a cluster of hotels.Interior Décor: Embassy Suites standard. Contemporary. Nice lobby and atrium area.Exterior Appearance: 7 story hotel in a commercialized service area.Outside view from the room I stayed at (218): tall grass plains.Room Description: Contemporary look. King bed. Good sets of bath amenities.Room Size: Approximately, 50 square meters. Good.Room Cleanness: Clean. Bathroom: Clean and good size. Noise Insulation: Relatively quiet. Occasional train noises.Price and Value: Reasonable point deduction from Hilton Honors.Courtesy shuttle van service to the airport: On time, friendly driver.Bed: A bit too soft. Services: Professionally trained friendly hotel staffs.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Aged but Solid,"You can tell the hotel needs a renovation. Most notably in the guestrooms, specifically the bedroom. The room is fine until you get to the bedroom. I’m sad to say it was like walking into another hotel within your own room. Odd fixtures, minimal outlets and no art. Just odd. Bar area is great, breakfast was good. Staff is very friendly. Fix up/modernize the guestrooms, add some outlets for charging devices, paint the walls and add some art.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Enjoyed our stay,"We recently stayed here before flying out of DIA.  We enjoyed the happy hour, it goes until 7:30, that was awesome.  The snacks were a nice touch too. Our room was a decent size. Comfy beds, clean.  Loved the updated furniture and two TV's not to mention the kitchenette and spacious bathroom.  We enjoyed the pool.  I used the shuttle service to the airport in the morning, it was a quick and easy ride. I didn't get ot emjoy breakfast because my flight was really early.  I've always loved staying at Embassy Suites because of the atrium.  I know this one was recently remodeled.  I didn't care for the ""new"" atrium as much as I did the other Embassy's I have stayed in. I missed the character and the plants.  We had a nice stay though and we would stay there again!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,TERRIBLE shuttle. Hotel is Ok,"It took an hour to get the shuttle from the airport to the hotel. If you’re not planning on using the shuttle, the hotel is decent.  Beds are comfortable and pool is nice for kids. However, given the price, there are much better deals to be had at other nearby hotels with fast shuttle service.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Pricey,"Not as good of breakfast as other Embassy Suites.  Very pricey.  No coffee or hot water during the day.  Good location.  Dinner reception is nice, although not much food variety for snacks.  Dinner and lunch food is nice.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Dirty shower and rude staff,"I love the embassy but this place was uncomfortable. Stale smelly rooms, issues with airport shuttles & rude front desk. Complimentary breakfast was great until i discovered green eggs and staff said it was just burnt. Ummm burnt eggs turn brown, not green. You can hear people shower. But the hotel looks nice but still treat you like a motel 6. My daughter was sick and staff pointed to a 7/11 across the street (directionally yes, distance no) to walk in the dark with no warning we’d have to walk across a dark parking lot",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great start to a great vacation.,"Very friendly staff and easy access to airport.  Worth spending extra money for the happy hour and light snacks served. We did order room service later which was expensive in my opinion, but we were hungry so it was nice they offered it. We had an 8:20am flight. We packed our car and was still able to enjoy a quick breakfast as they opened promptly at 6:00am Plenty of options to choose from to get a good start on your day. I would have been comfortable paying to park our car for an extended period and taking their shuttle. We had different parking arrangements so we didn’t use this option. Outdoor hot tub was cold on this particular night, but not a deal breaker. Will stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Shuttle SUCKS but hotel service is EXCELLENT,"The shuttle service is very poorly organized... It seems to be contracted out to “Western Shuttle”, who also picks up for many other local hotels. There are 3-4 shuttle vans that coordinate over walkie-talkies who to pick up and take to which hotel. So as instructed by the hotel, I just got on the van marked “Western Shuttle” and was taken to the wrong hotel. Instead of being taken back to the airport, I got off and took an Uber. The shuttle driver was super kind; it’s the system that’s messed up, not him. I get that this consolidation strategy appears easier but there’s got to be a better way. Maybe dedicate two of the three shuttles to people who make advance requests, and the third for everyone else? MANAGEMENT PLEASE ADDRESS THIS CRAP SYSTEM, IT’S NOT FAIR TO YOUR EMPLOYEES TO SERVE AS THE MESSENGERS OF THIS bullsh*t.But I'm still giving this hotel five stars because the hotel is gorgeous and the staff was excellent - kind, friendly, helpful. My room was great, set up like a one-bedroom apartment. Breakfast food service was fantastic. Omelettes made to order?!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,I dont do 5's,"While the hotel and my stat was very nice, There wasn't anything different that I wouldn't expect from any other Embassy.  For me to give a place a rating of 5, something has to make my stay memorable.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Exceptional hotel with great food service,"The place to stay at the Denver International Airport. Very quiet suites, excellent food service and a well trained staff. Especially good stop if you're coming from an international destination. Don't bother with anywhere else.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent service,Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. The breakfasts are awesome and the happy hour at the end of the day made for a great start and end to each day. Would definately recommend staying here. They also run a free shuttle to the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice stay,"They have made a area quite away from the airport for a load of hotels, This one being one of them. I used the airport shuttle as had hire a car, so was happy enough the shuttle. A clean hotel that is just the place for a stop before flying out. So would not use it for any other purpose as it is far out of town and areas. Plus driving there is a pain what with road works and not so good signage. Overall the hotel was great and friendly.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Customer service,I have stayed at this hotel many many times for business but has been a while since my last visit.  Brought my family of 4 here in March. I would have given this hotel at least a 4 BUT their shuttle service is horrible. They have 3 shuttles in back labeled embassy suites but have decided to outsource it to a company w unmarked vans that service many hotels.  We waited 35 mins for the shuttle after 3 unmarked came by and told us one was right behind them etc.  mark at the hotel took the brunt of my complaints and is a great guy.  I hope he passes it along. 2nd menu prices are ridiculous. 18 bucks for a salad w some grilled chkn.  You do realize we r talking some lettuce and chicken right?  After tx and tip this would have been 24 bucks.  My advice. Order from ruby tuesdays for a family of 4 for 36.00! And they deliver3rd. No extra blanket in closet like usual. Called down and they told me in closet. I said no. He said have one up in a couple mins. 25 mins later i called back down and mark brought one up in 10 minsDont mean to complain but you need to know what should be changed etc.  As i have said. I have stayed here a lot and do like it but in order to continue customer service must be improved. Just my 2 cents,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,The family was IMPRESSED!,"My family was very pleased with this hotel, and said it was the nicest hotel they have ever stayed in (wife,16 yr son, 14 yr daughter, 12 yr son).  Great location, grand lobby, overall great facility.  We look forward to our next trip to Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Serene stop on the way to the airport,"My room was large, clean and airy, with a comfortable bed. It was easy to sleep here, with little noise or light pollution from outside.The lounge was relaxed and elegantly furnished. It was well equipped with electrical outlets and an office chair, so it made working before my flight in the morning easy. Coffee and tea were provided and there was also a mini fridge and microwave.The breakfast was delicious with both cooked and continental options, and the large restaurant area meant you didn't feel rushed when finishing your morning coffee.I loved the layout of the pool and hot tub area, with the hot tub outside so you could unwind in the cool air while families played inside. It mean that it was a nice, relaxing experience and I came away from my stay feeling refreshed.The staff were friendly and helpful, and it was easy to book a space on the complimentary shuttle to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Best Denver Airport Hotel!,"I love staying at Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport.  Great location, beautiful rooms, delicious breakfast.  I come back all the time.  Staff very attentive, never any problems.  Great fitness center",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy comes through again : ),"Always an A++++++ experience!!! From the second you walk into the Embassy you begin to feel this regal feeling, a rich feel. Add the free amazing breakfast and the 2 hour Happy Hour.... really you spend pennies to sleep there once you factor in the $30 breakfast, that's free. Oh and again that open bar for 2 hours.. that's a $50 investment, the pool and fitness areas are very nice too!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,FREE DRINKS and appetizers - What a deal !!!,"This place was amazing! After a week in the mountains skiing we decided to drive here, turn in the rental car and let their shuttle take us to the airport the next morning. We got in around 5pm and were told they had a happy hour from 5-7:30 with free drinks. FREE DRINKS and appetizers? Free? We unpacked and went to restaurant/bar area and yes, free drinks. We had a mixed drink and a glass of wine. After a couple of those we noticed the guy next to use eating a BBQ slider he got off the dinner menu. There were 3 and they were not small sliders. My wife and I shared then and the free appetizers and free drinks (had several glasses of wine with the sliders). What a deal!!! What a deal !!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great location, great size suites and very helpful service team","The hotel is just 5mins from Denver Int. airport, so perfect for an overnight stay pre/post flying. The rooms are very spacious and all of them have a small dining area, good size bathroom and bedroom - the sitting rooms face onto an internal courtyard and then all the bedrooms face exterior.  The bar staff looked us very well and the happy hour nibbles are good.  The breakfast was great - served by very friendly staff.  We certainly would return.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Okay, with one serious problem.","It's an average airport hotel in a boring area. Spacious suites, keyless entry.  However, I experienced a serious problem. I returned to my room around 11:30am to make a phone call and use the bathroom. I noticed the maid cart was at the room next to mine, with its door open. My door was locked, and I went in and when I went to open the bathroom door, it was locked, and a female voice said she was using the bathroom.  Really weird, but I needed to use one too, so I took the elevator down and used the lobby one. I went back  to the room and it was now empty, but the bathroom smelled like cigarette smoke.   This is completely unacceptable. I had to make my call, and I reported it to the conference organizer but didn't have time to deal with the hotel. Nothing was missing, but a maid shouldn't smoke in a  guest restroom.   Of course, I don't know it was a maid,  I don't like anyone smoking in my bathroom.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Over night stop,"Chose this hotel based on proximity to airport, shuttle, and amenities.  Was not disappointed.  Super clean and updated rooms, great bar area.  Shuttle drivers were nice and helpful.  Will be staying here next time in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Close ....,"We have stayed here this winter several times before and after flying out of Denver. Highlight has been the bartender (shaved head guy).... probably the most efficient yet welcoming bartender we’ve seen. We arrived last night 3 minutes before the end of social hour tired from a day of 3 flights. He happily served us and the appetizers were the perfect light supper. Front desk staff friendly and airport shuttle fast and worked great. Small quibbles .... hate drinking coffee from paper cups.....  ceramic mug please at breakfast ?  Bathroom toiletries could be vastly improved. Shampoo, conditioner etc. so basic and not luxury at all.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Consistent, clean, comfortable - overall great experience!!!","I booked one night at this hotel as I had an early flight out of DIA. I choose this hotel, there are a number of selections, as I like free parking, free happy hour, free wifi, free breakfast (better then continental) and a suite with a fridge. Upon arrival I was greeted and given a room quickly and professionally. The room was clean and appeared to have been recently remodeled or updated. The bathroom was clean and the bed was very comfortable. In the morning, the breakfast was great, I loved the omelette bar and all the hot and cold selections. They really do offer a lot of extras for the cost of your nights stay. It was a little more then the other hotels around, but all of the free amenities mentioned above made it worth every penny. Checkout was automated and my bill was accurate, thanks for the great stay, when in the area again, I will be staying here!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great Location, Value, room & Service","Whenever I have an early morning flight, I try to stay close to the airport. This time for 6 am flight I decided to stay at this hotel. It was good. The room were nice, and the lobby was modern. They have shuttle to the airport which starts at 4AM every 1/2 hr. I did not have time to enjoy the breakfast this time but I will next time for sure if I do not take this early AM flight.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Location for the Air Traveler,I’ve stayed at the hotel in the past and I’m happy to report that I’ve always had good service here.  The location is very convenient with shuttle service on the half hour.  Having both an outstanding complimentary breakfast and the manager’s reception makes this a choice location.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel,"Great value, service, and cleanliness. The breakfast is over the top, not your average free breakfast. Happy hour every night includes complimentary beer, wine and mixed drinks. Would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Cobb,"Wonderful staff, I will recommend this hotel to all of my family and friends when visiting the Denver area. Like always the breakfast is outstanding and the cooks are very professional when taking your omelette orders in the morning.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great room.  Service could be a lot better,"The room was very big and clean.  I was upgraded to a suite for no charge, so in fairness I should call that out.  The shuttle in the morning to the airport was very handy and helpful.Two concerns.  First, as I reviewed my bill, they charged me $6 for a bottle of water I did not use (in the room).  I called and had it corrected.  They also charge you +$50 on your cc which comes off in 5 business days.  So the printed out bill will not match the initial charge to your card.  No mention of this by them until I called about it.Finally, I called about a shuttle from the airport to the hotel.  They assured me it came every 30 minutes (factoring in +10 min drive from airport).  This was 8:30 pm.  So I waited, and waited, an waited (until 9pm at which point I had to find a different ride).  So they shuttle is hit and miss and it definitely doesn't come every 30 min (at least it didn't for me).",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Bad breakfast service ,"I love staying at this hotel and have stayed there several times for work. The hotel itself is beautiful and newly renovated, and the staff are extremely friendly. However, the breakfast staff are beyond awful. They are rude, unfriendly, and unaccomodating to the point that I may no longer stay there. It’s a shame that just one woman could change my whole view.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Don’t plan on sleeping,"We stayed in a 2 room suite with a king bed in the bedroom and a pull out sofa bed in the living room area. The room was nice. However, we were terribly disappointed in the hotel due to the noise from the bar area. The hotel is designed with a bar in the interior courtyard/common area. The noise from this bar was out of control. We drove in from Winterpark to stay the night before our 7 am flight. My 2 kids slept on the pull out sofa. The noise was so loud that we could still hear it with bedtime music playing loudly in the room. I had to sleep on the sofa bed with them because they could not fall asleep. We were all 3 up until 1230am due to the excessive bar noise. Our shuttle to the airport was scheduled for 5 am. My kids and I got 4 hours of sleep (1230am-430am) before our day of travel. Any parent knows this is not a good scenario. I will not recommend this hotel for travelers needing a good night’s rest.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Parents 50th Wedding Anniversary,"The rooms were good, beds a little small, but they worked.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,It has changed for the worse!,"I first visited around three years ago when I think it was branded as a different Hilton property. We had a great stay and were struck at how friendly and helpful the staff were.We returned with high hopes but it has really gone downhill. We booked a King Executive suite and went to our room to find the previous guest’s empty glasses, food and rubbish outside the door of the suite: it remained there until we checked out 24 hours later!!The bed looked as if it had been slept in but the reality is they don’t press the linen so it is all creased.The room was nicely refurbished and a good size.On arrival, we asked for a late checkout and were told to phone the following morning to see if they could do it but they might charge $25 (I am Hilton Diamond) but they eventually agreed.The most disappointing aspect was the staff who seemed unhappy and were less than welcoming. I would not stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Yikes -- Wait till construction over,"To be fair -- we have stayed at this place plenty of times with satisfaction.  This time, not so much.  I didn't know there was construction.  Now, this was not a destination, it was an overnight after skiing to catch plane the next day.  The construction definitely interrupted the usual good service.  We had two rooms (one was a freebie with my points).  The fridge was not cleaned out in one of the rooms.  There were dishes laying outside in the hallways for hours.  I asked for a cot that was never sent up -- we rearranged people.  The manager reception was ok, people want the free alcohol, not the munches anyway.  But breakfast -- not so good.  They didn't have usual made to order things and the ready-made food was not great.  We will be back I am sure but not until construction is over.  I definitely expect more of Embassy Suites.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Honeymoon hotel dissatisfaction,"We will never get our honeymoon night back. 5,000 points for a ruined wedding night doesn’t seem like enough.

If you are looking for a romantic getaway then wait till construction is over.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place,"I have stayed here multiple times, and it's great.  I love the large atrium lobby (typical embassy suites) and the breakfast is better than some ES.  The breakfast furniture could be updated as it is dated and showing its age.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Visit when renovations are complete...,"Stayed at the property overnight because of an early flight.  The property is currently under necessary renovation so some of the expected amenities may not be available.  The lobby area is unavailable so understandably, the noted Embassy made to order omelet is not available, the breakfast and Manager’s Reception are in a converted conference room.I hope that following the renovations to the lobby and main floor, the rooms follow.  The décor of the room seemed a bit dated, but was comfortable as the bed and sheets met the Hilton standards.Adequate for an overnight, I will visit again after the renovations are complete and the standard made to order breakfast is available.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Stay another time,"This property is under massive reconstruction...lots of dust, debris, limited amenities and - even worse - they don’t disclose that.  Breakfast in am is impacted - there is NO cooked to order breakfast, stale donuts on folding coffee tables in what looks to be the old maintenance room.  It is not currently up to Embassy Suites standards. At all.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Horrible Stay,"Booked a suite so we could get some sleep before a long day of travel and early flight the next day.  When I complained of a room full of partying ladies next to us, Mark, the supervisor said he had not had any other complaints.  Our option would be to move to another room but it wasn’t a suite like we currently had.  Why should we have to move when the occupants next to us are the ones screaming like a bunch of drunk idiots and slamming doors.  Relocate them and inconvenience them!  I’m very upset by the response of Mark and his unwillingness to handle this situation.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Under construction=weak,"Until this hotel is back up to snuff, avoid at all costs. Embassy Suites is our brand of choice as a family and this was a poor representation of that brand. The breakfast and lounge area were under construction so that pretty much left the staff with a ""who gives a crap"" attitude. The breakfast was poor. The staff was rude. The shuttle was short drivers to the airport. And it was a full-price room, not some discount.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Eh it’s okay,"The first time we stayed at this hotel it was perfect! The staff was friendly and the room was spacious. The location the a bit far from the areas we were going but the space, food and service was worth every penny! This time around I wasn’t too impressed with the room the breakfast was horrible bothe days and no one bothered to mention they were remodeling on the website before booking. I was also bit by a spider one of the nights we were there while sleeping.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Nice hotel, great location",My wife and I stayed one night awaiting my children and grandchildren who were arriving on an early morning flight the following morning.  Hotel was being remodeled but everything was just fine.  We attended the managers reception.  Drinks and snacks were good.  We also had dinner and that was also very good.  The buffet breakfast was very good with great choices.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Under construction,There is construction going on in the lobby right now—-I didn’t know that till I arrived.  Location is close to airport.  Free shuttle to airport.  Very convenient if you are just overnight.  Nothing fancy.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,An okay Embassy Suites.,"You will get the services you expect from an Embassy Suites to a point.  Hotel under a remodel so expect some inconveniences.  Hospitality hour during this remodel is very minimal.  Staff just okay, maybe less than okay.  Seems like this hotel has stepped back from being the best hotel in the area due to competition.  They are remodeling, but we will see.  This has always been our favorite when flying somewhere.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Disgusting and disappointing.  Not worth the money.  Had 2 rooms, both dirty.  Will not recommend to anyone.",Manager’s Reception not up to standards.  Minimal offerings.  Dip had some sort of chunks in it.Breakfast sad—waffles and biscuits rock hard.  No omelettes offered.  Bathrooms dirty when we checked in.  Shower curtains mildewy in both rooms.  Construction noise started before 8:00 on a Saturday morning.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Amazing!!,I was in Denver for the weekend but wished I could stay longer! This hotel is absolutely the best. From the incredible made to order breakfast to the friendly happy hour you couldn't ask for a nicer stay. I am looking forward to going back!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,I loved this hotel,Even though they were doing upgrades I loved the quiet and good smell of the hotel I loved the rooms!!!! Amazing stay!!!! I would definitely recommend to everyone! I also loved the pricing it was not expensive for all the accommodations,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not the normal Embassy,"Heads up. There is extremely loud construction going on every day from 9-5. Also, there's no omelet bar. The room was pretty basic. The beds were comfortable. Not the usual Embassy atmosphere. Very close to the airport. But a ways away from the big name restaurants.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Thanksgiving Hideaway,"There is some renovation going on at the present time.  The lobby is being redone.  There are areas in the rooms that need attention and help.  Overall,it was an excellent weekend excursion, thanks to the Embassy Suites mindset.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Place to stay.,"Very nice rooms. great lobby bar with TV's. Bartenders are great. Staff is very helpful. But, they charge for parking outside of your nightly stay even though this is a ""Airport hotel"". internet works great all around the hotel from bar to the rooms. I always stay here when I fly out of Denver being that I am from out of town.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Below average,"Our room was barely half cleaned everyday. We had spilled something on the counter one day and used a towel to clean it up and left it on the bathroom floor. The next day housekeeping we found had picked the towel up, re folded it, and hung it back up on the rack.They did not empty out the trash daily. The glasses in the room 2 different days were not cleaned or replaced requiring myself to go to the front desk to get clean glasses.Also, we had upgraded online prior to arrival for the $8 per night snack package for our room, 3 days in a row it was never replenished which I had to go to the front desk for. After seeing the bill checking out it looks like I was not charged for the snack services at all which I appreciate. The ice machine on our floor (7th floor) did not work at all during our entire stay which requires us to go down to the 6th floor just to get ice.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Employees/ Modern Facility,"What a great place! I have learned to ask if an hotel has been recently remodeled when I make a reservation but forgot to with this Embassy Suites. It didn't matter; this place was awesome.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites DIA,Nice hotel vs the other choices nearby Denver International airport.  Spacious rooms with 2x large HD TVs.  Breakfast offerings were tasty and provided numerous choices including an omelet station.  Recently stayed at aloft and Hyatt place by the airport and they did. It compare.  Also plenty of area to get in a run or walk because the gym offerings.  Bypass the rest and go straight to the Embassy Suites.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Superficially nice, but problems underneath","I chose this hotel 1) because it was close to the airport and my family and I were flying out the next morning, and 2) because I had a great experience at the Embassy Suites in downtown Denver (near the convention center). While the room was adequate and clean, there were other issues. The staff seemed indifferent to the guests and borderline rude in some cases. Upon checking in, the desk attendant decided to take care of my check-in and two other people who were purchasing items from the convenience all at the same time. It was awkward, as I think of checking into a hotel as a somewhat private interaction. But whatever. The manager's reception was fine, but nothing special. And the staff was certainly not warm and welcoming (as they were at the conv ctr Embassy Suites). The breakfast, again, was fine, but nothing amazing (again, almost the opposite of the other Embassy Suites).The problems we had involved a requested a crib/pack n play for our baby. The one we received was so squeaky, at the slightest touch, I was not able to put my baby in it without him waking up. I tried several times, but he ended up sleeping in my bed. Also, there was a violent fight between a man and woman in the room next door to mine in the middle of the night. After I was awoken a 4th time, I called the front desk. They said they would send security. Not sure if it happened as the fighting continued. I wish I had just called the police, as I was very worried for the woman's safety. When I mentioned the incident as I checked out the next morning, the desk attendant had no knowledge of it. He also downplayed the situation and compared it to a man yelling at him in a parking lot. The comparison was ridiculous as what I heard sounded violent and scary (the whole time the woman just cried and apologized while the man screamed and banged on things). I am angry with myself for not doing more, but I was also scared that if I intervened in anyway I could be victimized as well. In the end, while the fighting was not the fault of the hotel, I don't feel confident that anyone addressed it as the serious situation it was. And that is extremely disconcerting.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Stay in Denver,Great hotel.  When it is cold outside it is great to have good food at the hotel.  Rooms are big and clean.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Just an average hotel.,"The hotel for being so new is a little run down.  Everything was just ok or average.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overall a good stay,"Overall a good stay. Having stayed at other Embassy Suites this particular hotel in the center is kind of boring. I see the 'different' decor approach, but kind of looks bare. Don't expect a nice 'happy hour' unless you consider chips and pretzels a decent one. Other Embassy Suites have better happy hour. The room was quiet and clean. The breakfast was standard.",4

Close to airport,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Poor Staff Service,Stayed at this location during a business trip The staff was less than helpful. They provided the wrong food service time twice. I had a very hectic schedule and worked well into the night so I asked the housekeeper to come back and she never did! A neighbor mentioned that he complained and faced backlash. Out of fear of backlash I kept quiet. I book travel for over 200 employees and I can't afford any hiccups when booking travel for Executives including myself.,1

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Stay Filters Need Attention,Arrived for one night stay for early flight out of DEN and upon arrival greeted by very friendly front desk attendant. Room was like many other Embassy Suites spacious with separate living room and had one of the biggest TV of any hotel room I have stayed in.  Very clean and comfortable other than the ventilation had a ridiculous amount of dirt and dust accumulated which would suggest at a minimum not something on checklist for housekeeping even though it is just above eye level next to shower.  Probably bigger issue poor filter changing.  Not a big deal for me but would be concerned if I was with anyone with asthma or respiratory issues.  Other than that very clean and friendly and less than 10 minutes to airport so very convenient.  Great rate as well.,4

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,No One Answers Phone/Hour+ to Get to Hotel,"This review is being written before even arriving to the hotel. I am currently writing this while the Embassy's phone rings and rings. I have been calling since my plane landed thirty minutes ago to ask for an airport pickup, and someone is yet to answer. It is currently five till 11, and I see on their website that the shuttle stops operating at Midnight. After about five minutes of ringing, it sounds like my call is transferred to a different line, as it's a double ring, and the sound of the ring sounds different. After five minutes of this double ring, the line just disconnects. This has happened three times already. Awesome. I thought maybe their phone lines were messed up, so I also called the Staybridge Suites, next door to the Embassy, to make sure. Within the second ring, someone answered! I asked the agent if their area has had any phone issues, and she verified that they haven't had any. My sister called the Hampton Inn Airport, and they too answered immediately. She told them our issue with Embassy, and the agent apologized. She told us to proceed to Island 3 and wait for Embassy's shuttle, assuring us that it would eventually arrive and wished us luck in getting through. If I do not get through in the next ten minutes, I am taking an Uber and will have Embassy reimburse me for this. Finally! Someone answered at Embassy on my sixth call. I told the agent that I have been calling for the past 30 minutes and asked if they were having phone issues or have been busy. Her reply? ""Oh, I don't know. I just got back to the desk."" So, she was away from the desk this entire time, which is why she had no idea that someone was calling. Nice. She told me that the shuttle is on its way and would take 10 minutes. We are finally on the shuttle, after waiting twenty five minutes. Other hotel shuttles have circled twice already, including the Embassy Stapleton. Why am I not surprised that the shuttle took more than double the time? It has been a little over an hour since we landed, and we still are not at the hotel. This has been beyond frustrating. I wanted to cancel my stay here and stay elsewhere, but I already e-checked in and would be charged a late cancellation. I will not be staying here again.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Relax,"The end of our vacation and we are relaxing. We are near the airport yet the hotel is quiet.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Spot to Start a Colorado Trip,The hotel is very convenient to the airport and a good starting point for a vacation in Colorado.  We had an afternoon flight arrival and we were ready to just relax when we arrived.  We enjoyed the cocktail hour and took drinks back to our room.  The room was very clean and the staff was helpful.  We stayed here on both ends of our trip and found the check-in on the last day to be not so helpful.  They had computer problems and people were standing around waiting to get checked in.  When you are tired after a day of driving this was not fun.  overall the place was great and we will return.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent hotel close to DOA,"Excellent location with helpful staff. Easy access to DIA.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Rude and Nasty Alert,"I should have read the reviews before booking this final day of my first time Colorado vacation. 1. Rooms were nice and good airport view and sunrise. There were couple of alive flies though in the room. 2. Breakfast was decent. 3. Fitness room is nice along with the pool. 4. Proximity to airport is a big plus. 5. The front desk was rude and short. All the three reps I dealt with were rude. (So it wasn't that one was having a bad day).6. Finally and most disgustingly: I told them that this stay was prepaid and the rep just IGNORED that fact while being rude of course and charged me for the total stay. When I went back and checked my credit card account I saw this discrepancy. When I brought it their attention rudeness only increased. I almost wanted to go to another hotel but had a 2 y/o toddler with me so I stayed. When I went back and read the reviews I was shocked. At least one more time this same thing had happened about the stay being prepaid and the hotel still putting a total new charge. By the way this isn't the incidental one which is put as a hold charge. They did admit to this error but remained rude. They wanted to calm me with 10,000 Hilton honor points but I only asked them to not be rude and short. The rudeness is right from the front desk all the way up to the general manager I talked to. Names won't be included. Also, I was civil all through out.7. FLIES were also present in the room. (They weren't killed btw). I will think twice before going to any embassy suites going forward.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Fantastic place to stay when flying out of Denver,We had one night before we were flying out of Denver and we found this suite and that worked out perfect despite that the suite was a little small. The interior of the hotel was amazingly beautiful but as a european we were bothered by the aircon in the restaurant. And one lady in the reception did not know how to smile. But all in all worth the price,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Outstanding!,"Spent two nights at this property. One at the start of our vacation and one at the end of our vacation.I would like to thank the staff, in particular, Mark at the Front Desk.

On our first night, we needed medical supplies from a local pharmacy and they provided transportation via hotel shuttle.The Happy Hour was excellent as well as the food. Morning buffet was the best out of the other four hotels we stayed.Would definitely be staying at Embassy Suites in the future.Thank you Mark and staff for a job well done!",5

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Worst hotel!!!!,"in the last week-EditWorst hotel and not worth the money.  Rooms extremely noisey from hallway and lobby noise.  We could hear our neighbors right through the walls.  The head board made a noise every time you moved.  The worst experience we had was at the bar.  We were charged for someone elses tab at the bar and when we tried to talk to the bartender he was extremely rude and refused to admit he had accidentally mischarged us.  He continued to accuse my husband of ordering all the extra drinks.  When we tried to talk to the mgr, who we ended up finding out was not the actual mgr, but acting like one (he had pink hair)  he was rude as well.  Customer service is a huge fail at this hotel!  We ended up paying an extra 50.00 dollars worth of drinks because it was not worth wasting our time to dispute with a very very rude staff who raised their voice and spoke over us as we are trying to explain the mistake.  Never had we ever been spoken so down too.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!  We thought we pay extra to stay a nicer more customer service friendly hotel!!!  We ended up leaving and staying at the Hyatt across the street.  I recommend that hotel.  This is an experience I would not wish on anyone.  If their were neqative stars I would give them.  The experience was bad enough we left that night and stayed at another hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Could have been a ""Very Good"" hotel...","Very nice decor, and suites..... however, my room was not clean. There was shave stubble in the sink and a used lint/hair roller crumbled up in the bed room and crumbs on the floor. This was such a bummer, because everything else was so great. The free breakfast in the morning was very good. They even had an omelet station! They have a free shuttle to the airport too, just make sure you sign up at the front desk the day before.I would give this hotel another try, because the TV's were big, and the living room part of the room was so cute.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A hotel I will use again.,"Room was clean and updated.  Always like their suite set up.  Managers 2 hours , limited drink list, open bar was nice.  The complimentary breakfast was excellent. The workout room was a little larger than normal. The pool was the normal small size and indoor only.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver Airport,"The amenities & facilities were great, but the noise from the hallways & large open space was constant. With the way the building is designed, everything echoes & there were a couple kids' sports teams running around. We also had some not-so-positive interactions with a couple staff members.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,BEWARE - FRAUD,"Until this year, I have been Platinum status at Hilton Honors for the past 3 years. I generally like Hilton and have had great experiences at Embassy Suites over the years.  This time, I paid in advance for my stay on Hilton.com. I incurred no additional expenses on the night of my stay as I arrived very late and checked out before dawn.   To my surprise, there was an unauthorized charge to my credit card made by the hotel. When I called to question it, there was no good explanation why the charge was on my credit card 3 days later.   I am used to holds on my account for incidentals, but this appears to be something different. However, when I called for explanation, no satisfactory explanation was given. The manager, Jim, was rather indifferent.  In short, an unapproved, unauthorized charge is sitting on my credit card three days after staying at this property. My stay was prepaid and had already cleared my credit card prior to arrival.  From all accounts, this unauthorized charge is standard operating procedure for this property. The conclusion is that they are floating hundreds or more likely $1,000+ nightly without authorization. The charge is still there after 3 days.  That is the definition of a fraudulent charge. Beware.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great deal for 2 room suite!,This was a very nice room.  Bed and pillows were amazing. It was very quiet and comfortable. Would highly recommend for comfort and proximity to airport. I had late check in and the service could have been more hospitable and welcoming otherwise excellent stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Staff was Awesome Beautiful Hotel,"From the first moment I walked through the doors till the sad moment I had to leave, this property was awesome.  The staff makes the property.  From check in and check out personnel to the maid staff cleaning up in the fitness room, nothing but smiles, greetings and a friendly atmosphere.  Oh lets not forget the breakfast cooks friendly conversations and personalities.  Awesome in every area I can think of.  If I win the Power Ball or Mega Millions, I will only be staying at Hiltons..",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Just like the good old days,"best trip yet at an Embassy Suites The service was genuine and reminded me of the days before every thing was on auto pilot and people acted like robots. I felt like I was at home,secure and content. Evening reception was not just chips and pretzels but ham.turkey cheese and crackers.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"As usual, Embassy Suites delivers","I travel for business way too much but whenever I'm close to a domestic destination with an Embassy Suites, I make it a point to stay there. Large spacious rooms, adequate and free breakfast, easy to sleep and many amenities. It's a bit more expensive than other alternatives but the quality is very high.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Efficient meeting location- great staff,We hosted a meeting of about 100 people here and the staff made everything work for us. Great location near the airport with a shuttle. All the usual Embassy Suites amenities including room service which was helpful. We have used them before and will again.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Other choices in area better bet,"Hotel was a disappointment.  Have a lot of problems with this property.  Hallways and rooms not as clean as you would expect, small garbage in corners, mold on shower walls paint chipped and pealing, air conditioner never cooled the room, was on high all night, mattress on pullout bed springs poking thru.  Breakfast was ok and they do have a cooking making fresh omlets.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not what I expected,"I was very excited to stay at the Embassy Suites for the first time but I turned out to be very disappointed at the end.  First of all, check in time was at 3pm.  I got there at 4:30pm purposely to ensure my room was ready, but it was not.  How is that possible? When it was finally ""ready"" I found a used room service platter waiting for me at the front doorstep.  Disgusting.  Wow, I couldn't believe how low the housekeeping standards were.  They must have been really  ""rushing"" to clean my room.  The comforter was literally a ""dirty white"" full of lint, the pillowcases had holes, the soapdish was chipped, and the couch smelled like vomit.  I couldn't wait to get out of there.  Happy hour wine and whiskey were cheap and tasted bad.  The only good thing that I can comment on is that they had a good selection of breakfast.Sorry, but I will probably not stay at an Embassy Suites Hotel again.  Way overpriced for such poor quality and service.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Sons graduation ,Great location for an early flight out of Denver. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. The onsite restaurant had a good selection. The staff was friendly and courteous. Shuttle to the airport runs regularly. It was a very pleasant stay and would stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay,Very nice Hotel. The staff is great and Mark was so helpful in finding my daughters special blanket and stingray which she had forgotten in the room. He worked to locate the items right away and shipped them overnight making my daughter very happy to say the least!,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver co trip,negative comments are base on reception desk and breakfast experience. The employees we encountered were not friendly at all. Breakfast would have been good had they had the items stocked. Heck there was no coffee. It was out and employees acted as though they did not need to replenish it. Hotel was beautiful and clean. The staff was not what we normally experience when staying at embassy suites.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Nice rooms, but....","I was disappointed in the service at this location.  The young man checking us in had no eye contact, and was not personable at all.  The man behind the bar was also not personable and seemed put off by having to serve drinks during happy hour.  The room itself was fantastic except for the room service plate sitting outside the door.  Interior was awesome.  Shower could use updating, but good overall.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,CO Vacation Ending,"Paid $500 for 2 rooms directly from Hilton --- stupid!!!!  The rooms on Trip advisor $120-130.  Rooms were nothing to write home about -- right by the elevator (really, for $500!!);the phones (all four of them were not plugged in!) at least 20 yr old and we could not use to order room service ---that is insane.Evening reception -- drinks were good, however the nipples were CHEAP and not renewed.  (Chex like mix; Dorritos - with black bean dip; a type of pasta salad)  I would suggest not offering the food at all if it is too expensive. Garbage cans full in the evening and morning -- outside and by the 1st floor elevators. Looked terrible......We ate dinner at the restaurant  --- it was satisfactory.  3 fish and chips; 8 drinks = $120Breakfast --- standard fareFREE PARKING",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Worst Embassy Suites I have been to,"I often stay at Embassy Suites because of the great amenities. This one did not live up to the name! The manager's reception and the bar in general were just fine. Breakfast was good quality, but kind of a mess (out of food, out of bowls, etc.). The check in process was a train wreck. Rooms weren't clean, the staff were rude, and the whole hotel was unkempt (room service dishes and dirty laundry everywhere even at 5 PM)! The complimentary WIFI would not even load my email. Although I like the brand, I would not come back to this hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Family Reunion a success,From start to finish this was the place for us to be.  They have trasfers for those flying in and plenty of parking for those driving.  The front desk staff was pleasent and helpful.  Food was good.  Gwen the SAles manager was easy to work with and provided just what we needed for a successful weekend with Family.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Traveling with a baby...,She finds everything if the room hasn't been thoroughly cleaned. We needed extra blankets and the two that we received were wet. We were told that's all they had. Unacceptable! In the past we stay here 1 night heading to Vail area. 1st time for problems. Room itself could use some TLC to go along with their new furniture.,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient to the airport with shuttle,"I always expect a good breakfast an Embassy Suites, which this one had, but the ""happy hour"" was more sad than happy.  Three bowls.  Pretzels, Chex mix, and tortilla chips with salsa.  No one serving it, just people ignoring the big spoons and putting their hands in them.  We had dinner in the restaurant and even with only one other couple there had to wait 45 minutes for our meal because ""room service was slammed.""  Rooms are sound proof and have good a/c.  There is a big flat screen in the living room and a smaller one in the bedroom with a door between the two rooms which is important is two people have different sleep schedules.  The only fault I found was frayed old towels in the bathroom.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Go elsewhere next time,"The joint did not live up to reputation.  Outrageous price, maid service, which is dictated by company policy, was lousy, getting a baggage cart was a long term experience and AFTER we used it staff showed up to return it to its location. desk staff was more interested in some clothing item than serving customers and when she could drag herself away to give us some of her time she was useless.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,New Favorite ,"This is not a five star hotel but I gave it 5 stars for meeting and exceeding  my needs.I needed room service due to late check in and 6 yo to feed. They actually had a kids menu that was decent and even had a vegan option yay!!!!!!Breakfast was vast! Included and so many options. Not you typical skimpy buffet. Hours were 6:00-9:00.So close to DIA you could see it from window. Comfy beds, everything seemed clean. Frig in room. Microwave. Rooms huge and def more space than needed but nice even for overnight only. Hotel seemed noisy but it was like someone flipped a switch and suddenly I did not hear a peep! Slept soundly. Im coming back for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Dirty and TERRIBLE,Called front desk from the airport at 10:00 PM when I got off my plane and asked for the shuttle.  The front desk person told me where to wait and I arrived at the spot at 10:05.  At 10:30 i called the desk again asking where the shuttle was and was told that it would not be there until 11:00.  I then took a taxi to the hotel so I did not have to wait until 11:00.  Hotel room had food crumbs all over the table.  The bed sheet had a hole in it and the room smelled musty.  The breakfast area was a disaster.  All the tables were dirty and the staff there was just standing around watching TV.  Food was ok but several items were not replenished.  This is NOT the quality I would expect from a Hilton property.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight for a long layover,"I had an 18 hour layover and wanted to stay near DIA, this was slightly more than I wanted to pay, but it offered free airport shuttle and a great breakfast was included.  Staff was very friendly and welcoming, including the shuttle driver.  It was happy hour when I arrived, lots of snacks and beverages.  My room was great it met and exceeded my needs: plenty of outlets, four pillows, comfy bed, full length mirror and all the usual amenities.  Breakfast was great, lots of offerings and a make to order!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel with even Greater Employees,"Whether you are in town for business or pleasure, or because of weather delays associated with the near by airport, THIS Embassy Suites will set the standard for how a guest should be treated by all hotel chains.  The entire staff was warm and welcoming, helping to take care of my wants (food after being stuck on an airplane) and a hygiene kit (since my luggage was MIA at the airport). As a Hilton Honors Member, being greeted as a Hilton Honors Member and being thanked for my continued loyalty is (sadly) something I have begun to take for granted. The staff at Embassy Suites Denver Airport reminded me of why I will be a Lifetime Hilton Honors Member. DiJuane and Edlin gave food receommendations, completely set up my return shuttle to the Airport, and overall made my Denver Layover an enjoyable evening getaway.  The Chicken Quesadilla at the Hotel Restaurant is THE BEST that I have ever eaten! The freshness of the peppers and onions, the tender chicken and the perfect amount of cheese made it PERFECT.  This Embassy Suites will set the standard for how Hilton treats their guests.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Red Rocks,Embassy Suites is a good place for comfort and convenience. We wanted to stay near the airport and this was our number one choice in hotels. We generally have no complaints with this hotel chain. Most of our stay was pleasant,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Another slow airport hotel,"After being reassured (3x) that the shuttle was ""on the way"" and then waiting for a full hour until the shuttle did arrive you can imagine how unhappy I was at not being able to check in at noon as I had been promised (after advising them I was arriving on an overnight flight during the booking). Fast forward 2 hours and a room materialized, and yes -  it was a good room - probably above average for the price, but by then who cared? An airport hotel room is an airport hotel room and so the differentiating factor for any loyalty program member is service.. and unfortunately this is not one of Hiltons' steller service sites... enough said.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Trip to Denver , July 2017",Excellent option for business and families. Received the best staff service in my life. Superior breakfast and complimentary drinks. Great locality (near the airport) and shuttle service. Not so close to downtown Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Exceptional stay at this location ,"We recently stayed at this location on our way back home.  It's conveniently located to the airport.  The front desk welcomed us nicely when we arrived.  Knowing that the Embassy Suites offers a nice breakfast (with an omelet chef), we were trying to figure out what to do with the rental car return super early the following morning.  We talked to the hotel front desk staff and when we asked if the hotel shuttle would pick us up at Budget, they said ""yes"".  We immediately headed off to Budget and then waited about 15 minutes for the hotel shuttle to pick us up.  This worked out so well for us.  It gave us time to sleep in as late as possible, enjoy the hotel breakfast and then have the hotel shuttle drop us off at the airport.  I really appreciated the way they were willing to accommodate us.  What great service!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great location near the airport and light rail,"So glad we picked this location.  Close to airport, freeway and light rail.  Stayed 2 nights and it was great.   Rooms are so nice and spacious.  In room coffee, microwave and fridge.   Restaurant at this location is very nice.  The free happy hour and breakfast will save you lots of money. Check in and out were very easy.  They offer free shuttle service to the airport but the manager on duty was nice enough to take us to the light rail which was fantastic!!!  Close to a free restaurants so you can walk if you do not have transportation.  STAY HERE!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Welcoming Place On the Way Out,"I don't expect greatness at Airport Hotels.  They are conveniences.  This place was different.  For starters, when my chosen room didn't face the mountains, and missing out during my stay in Colorado at other properties, the front desk clerk accommodated the request.  The food menu is really quite unexpected, too.  I had the Thai Curry (they added chicken onto mine at the suggestion of the wait staff) and, because I was really hungry, had a cup of the turkey chili which was also fabulous.  Now, I was hungry, but the food was very good - as were the offerings.  When I arrived, free finger food was out, but I didn't participate.  The place was jumping as I stayed here on a Saturday.The rooms are more room than I will use on a quick overnight before heading to the airport, but the place is hopping and very comfy and an unexpectedly pleasant respite.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Nice hotel, Check the shuttle service!","Nice hotel at DIA airport. I booked because of Hilton Honors program and the hotel has free shuttle service to the airport. We checked in -even a little early!  We asked about the shuttle service to the airport as we had a 6:30 am flight and were told the shuttle started at 4 am.  That was it.  We enjoyed their cocktail hour and had a wonderful dinner in the lobby restaurant.  It was my son’s birthday and I asked the waitress for a candle on the dessert.  She tried, but could not find one!  She was very apologetic and his dessert was comp’d. I appreciated that, because I didn’t expect her to look around for a candle!  After dinner my husband went by the front desk to ask again about the shuttle and was told he had to sign up for a spot!  They spots were already booked through 5:30am!! He was not happy and said so since this was not mentioned when we checked in and inquired about the service. The first Front Desk employee (a trainee) did not seem concerned and just stated that all seats were booked. Another employee overheard and came over to see what the issue was. He immediately told my husband he would call another driver to see if he could add another shuttle. It took about an hour, but the hotel employee called our room to say that he had added another shuttle and my husband went to get the “pass” that would allow us on the bus.All went well the next morning.The Embassy Suites should state that you have to reserve the shuttle or at least explain that immediately upon check-in!  The early shuttle to the airport was the main reason I booked the hotel. It is advertised on their website (Shuttle Service 4am – 12am), but NO mention of a required reservation. I applaud the employee who took positive action and just didn’t shrug his shoulders and say “too bad!”I rated the service ""Excellent"" due to the waitress at dinner who went above and beyond and the front desk clerk who realized there were a lot of families needing shuttle service to the airport and adjusted his service!!  THANK YOU!!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Wonderful stay,We stayed there for a day due to the location near the airport since we had an early flight the next morning. This area is loaded with hotels and we chose this one based on other reviews. First it is close to the airport and the rental car agencies. It was very easy to find and an abundance of free parking.Our room was large and very comfortable. The rooms surround a large central opening. There was a separate seating area with a large TV and a dining table. More than enough room for many large adults. Bathroom was sizable and well set up. Bedroom had a door to it which was nice. That way others could watch TV in the other room without keeping those trying to sleep awake. The bedroom had a separate TV which was also nice. It was very quiet and the beds were just right.Wifi was more than adequate and free. It's always amazing that some hotels charge for basic wifi. Breakfast was free and amazing. There are the standards that you can choose from plus they have soft drinks available at will via a dispenser. Plus there were 2 chefs that were making omelettes to order. I have not seen that before and was an amazing option. I was very impressed and would stay here again without a doubt. Enjoy.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Stay!,"This is a very well kept, clean, and up to date hotel.  Close to the Denver International Airport.  Saves time to get to the airport the next day.  Cut out all of the Denver traffic and stay close to the airport.  Very spacious Suites, very comfortable beds.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel and quite,"I stayed here after a conference, that was way too long, to be close to the airport to fly out the next morning. I was pleasantly surprised that you cannot here any plane noise at all. The food is great - both at the restaurant and in the morning for breakfast. Happy hour was also great. Friendly staff and other patrons.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Quality Upgrades,"Stayed at the Embassy Suites DIA on either end of a long weekend trip and was very impressed. We've stayed several times previously  but since out last visit they've completed the room renovations and we were very leased. Large wall mounted  flat screen TVs, new carpet, décor etc made the stay very nice. Join the Hilton Honors program so no charge for WiFi. They also have their own airport shuttle so no sharing with any of the other airport hotels. Nice breakfast buffet and manager's cocktail and snack hour daily as well.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay,My experience at Embassy suites Denver airport is the best hotel experience I have ever had from the helpfulness of the staff to the great room. I will most definitely bring my family back to stay again.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay in a very nice hotel!,"We made a last minute reservation and was extremely pleased with our luck in getting the last room in this nice hotel.  The bed was comfortable, room very clean and quiet.  We were on the 7th floor.  Breakfast was outstanding.  The usual expected hotel complimentary meal plus fresh omelets made to order along with freshly grilled bacon.  I was very impressed that evidently hotel management staff help serve and clean up breakfast.  Very friendly staff.  I will definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good hotel near airport,"Stayed here or one night after a long flight.  Airport shuttle was quick and efficient.   We booked it for the following morning to take us to the car rental company and that worked perfectly too.  We ate in the bar/restaurant, which while lacking in atmosphere, was perfectly adequate.   There aren't any other eating options in the immediate area.Suites are large, quiet and spotless.  Staff were helpful and pleasant.A good option for an airport stopover.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very poor evening reception,"The service was poor overall.  AC was loud. The gentleman at evening reception was not friendly. He did not smile to any of the guests from we walked in. When it comes to us seeking help for the early shuttle, he was cold and unresponsive.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay at Embassy Suites DIA,Stayed two nights at DIA.  Excellent both days.  Staff helpful.  Close to airport.  It is not close to Downtown.  It is easy to navigate.  Breakfast was very good - could use more fresh fruit.  Coffee was strong - just the way I like it!  It's funny but I didn't have any problems as others have had.  A/C was a little noisy.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great overnight at the airport,"This is nothing more than a convenient place to stay overnight en route to the Rockies - don't drive the Rockies in the dark! The suites are large and spacious with a separate sitting room and bathroom. The rooms are comfortable. Breakfast is included from 6am, but is a buffet with attendant lines. All in all, very satisfactory and a great way to start a long weekend vacation in the Rockies!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel BUT BEWARE of AIRPORT SHUTTLE,"Location, front desk staff, housekeeping, happy hour and morning breakfast are right on target for the business traveler.  We had a short stay so I cannot vouch for the other features.  Great place to escape and unwind following an intense business week.  HOWEVER, BEWARE of AIRPORT SHUTTLE service.  Scheduled a 0730 trip which boarded at 0720.  Driver did not leave the hotel till 0745 causing an overcrowding in the van.  Ride is short, but had the driver left on time, this inconvenience would have been avoided and all 12 of us would have had an extra 15 minutes to find our way to the gates at the terminal.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,EXCELLENT CHOICE!!!!,"We couldn't have selected a better option for our last night in Colorado! This hotel is beautiful and conveniently located to the airport! The enormous flat screen TV in the room was a hit with our teenagers, as were the outdoor sauna and indoor pool in a room with large windows! Other amenities were the complimentary Manager's Cocktail Welcome from 5:30-7:30 in the lovely atrium bar, and the delicious made-to-order breakfast with CRISPY bacon! We highly recommend this Embassy Suites!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites Stay,"Disappointed with our stay this time.  Room had no soap and phones didn't work.  Desk staff when we checked out were very rude.  We usually stay here and have been satisfied, but we'll probably look elsewhere next time",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Stayed two nights on business. Hotel is a nice place to stay within minutes from Denver International Airport. It has in-house restaurant, free wifi, breakfast and afternoon happy hour (with beer and wine), comfortable bed, mini-ref, microwave oven, safety box, and two flat screen TVs (in bedroom and living room). Room is clean and aircon works fine. Bedside clock time is off by about half hour and no way to set right time externally but ok to set alarm. It's good for decoration so just ignore it and use your cell. Gas station and convenience store are across the street. Staffs are friendly and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to sleep after a very long day of travel,After many delays at the airport it was so nice to arive at the Embassy suites on Tower road to get a very relaxing nights sleep.  As usual the staff is welcoming and you can count on the nice room.  It's also great to look forward to that yummy breakfeast.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Good Location, but room smelled of smoke","Many hotels in this area to choose from.  Chose this hotel based on the reviews, the free hotel shuttle to the airport and the complimentary breakfast.  Was only in room for one night before flying back home.  Shuttle is every 30 minutes in the morning, but make sure you make a reservation. Breakfast in the morning had many choices.  The only really bad part of our stay was the room smelled like smoke.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Place to Stay Before or After Flight,"My husband and I stayed here the night before our flight home.  Our room was comfortable, well appointed, and quiet. Also free wi-fi and business center to print boarding passes. The free airport shuttle picked us up at the car rental return on arrival and took us to the airport for our morning flight - so convenient.  Happy hour and breakfast were up to the usual Embassy Suites standard.  No complaints - everything we needed before heading home.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel with my spouse while we attended a friend's wedding earlier this month.  I requested a room on the fourth floor with the laundry/dryer room nearby so that we can launder clothes for our Ensenada cruise the next day.  Our room had a minor issue with dust particles noted on the bathroom vent, but this was not a deal breaker.Excellent bar service was provided by Julio during the manager's reception (other ES in Nashville and St. Louis) could take a lesson from this young man.  We ordered food at the bar and I believe Elizabeth (Liz) also was prompt with our order.  I forgot to mention that DiJuane had checked us in rather quickly with two other people in the queue.  Thank you for training your staff and keeping them focused on the customer.  I'm a Diamond Hilton Honors member so I frequent your chain quite a bit: I'm quick to address deficiencies and respond when I'm provided excellent service so I commend your three team members for this!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Park & Ride,Had a morning flight out of DIA and some Hilton Honors points so decided to stay here for the night.  Parked the car for $7 a night and rode the shuttle in and back.  Didn't have to wait long at the airport when returning.  Very nice room - quiet!  Breakfast was standard Embassy Suites cooked-to-order fare -- a nice way to start the day.  Got in too late for the evening reception.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Best Staff Ever,"We stay at Embassy Suites whenever possible because of the value of having the suite. The staff at the Denver hotel was the most helpful and friendly that we have ever had at any hotel. The continental breakfast was equal to or better that what you get at most restaurants. Our room was clean, modern and quiet. The beds and pillows were comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Business Bliss at DEN,"From the complimentary airport shuttle, to the popular manager's happy hour, to the helpful friendly staff, this Embassy Suites Hotel understands how to comfort the business traveler. No waiting breakfast and timely shuttles ensure an easy stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place,"It is my favorite place to stay. Always friendly,clean and safe. I love the cook to order breakfast, and the evening reception (happy hour) is fantastic. Overall a great experience.  I wii definitely stay here again",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Hotel not worth the money,Service and food has gone downhill. Front staff lied about entering my Hilton rewards number and caused our having problems using free internet. I will share this unfortunate experience with family and friends,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice stay,"A great stop for our family of 4 when we fly DIA.  The shuttle service is helpful, and the accommodations are fantastic.  The only downside is when we fly out early and have to take a shuttle before we are able to take advantage the breakfast service.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place,"The location is great if you need a place close to the airport.  Rooms are updated, modern and comfortable.  All the employees were nice and helpful.  They do have a shuttle bus to take you to and from the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Love these Hotels,"Excellent rooms; generally nice staff; we'll try to stay at Embassy Suites more often! I wish the shower heads offered more options or better water pressure, but that's not going to deter me from staying here again. Also, if you need a shuttle to the airport, be sure to ask questions and get a ""ticket"" for the ride.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Choice for Transiting at DIA,"After a very long trip from New Zealand to Denver, I found the Embassy Suites near Denver International Airport to be very convenient and a perfect place to rest and have a good night's rest before continuing my flight the following day. Courteous shuttle drivers and front desk receptionist. Good breakfast choices. My room was very clean, comfortable and had a million dollar view of the Front Range of Rockies to wake up to!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites Soars high in the Rockies...,Perfect location from the airport.  Spectacular view of the Rockies.  Room was very clean. Greeted by the front desk staff.  Check in went without a hitch.  Was given a room with a beautiful view of the Rocky Mountains. Excellent cocktail reception. Dinner was very good. The breakfast was OUTSTANDING!  The lady making the omlets was the BEST!!! Ride back to the airport was smooth and quick.  Would definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Well managed, efficient shuttle, quality breakfast",This airport hotel seemed to be well utilized and humming along. Staff was courteous and there was a calm atmosphere throughout. I was most impressed with the made to order breakfast complete with chef!! Will return whenever needed in Denver 😊,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient airport location.,"A very clean, classy, comfortable and restfull place to stay. One of the closest hotels to Denver Int'l Airport. Very friendly & helpful staff. You cant beat the stay included, free evening happy hour adult drinks and the very good selection free breakfast that has cooked to order eggs if one wishes. Not very many nearby restaurants, but the in-house restaurant is very tasty but a little pricey.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great service. Very friendly staff. Room was great!,"I arrived with a nice greeting. The evening happy hour was a great start. The room I was in was spacious, quiet, and clean. I was able to get a tasty dinner in the restaurant and a great night sleep. The free buffet breakfast offered may options and I had a free shuttle to the airport. Every staff member I met was helpful and friendly>",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Sleep and park package,I have stayed here before and will stay again.  We used the park and stay package.  Enjoyed the mgrs reception and took the shuttle to the airport early.  Rooms are clean and comfortable for our family of 6.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice,"Was staying here for a conference and they had picked here. I have stayed at many Embassy Suites so I was a bit let down by this place. It seems it is a smaller scale that most Embassy Suites.My room was nice, a corner room which gives you a lot of space, almost too much.The TV in the living room was big and had HD channels. The room itself was quiet.Breakfast in the morning was fine as well as the happy hour starting at 5:30.Exercise room was on the smaller side but had met my needs. My biggest complaint was the internet. It worked fine the first night but the next day it was intermittent the whole day and night.Free shuttle to and from the airport is nice.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Our stay,We try to use Embassy Suites whenever we can.  Love the suite concept  The staff was very good during our visit.  The only thing I am not happy about is the 22% service charge for the room service.  The food was delicious though,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Dirty and poorly maintained,"Room was dirty, had garbage left in it upon arrival. Complained with no solution.  Day 2 housekeeping made one of three beds and did not empty garbage.  Complained and nobody came up to fix it.  Told we would be credited for two nights but on checkout we were charged for seven nights instead of the four we stayed.  Took 30-45 minutes to fix during checkout process.  Going to watch my account closely to make sure I am charged properly.  This is a very poorly managed and maintained property.   I stay around 100 business nights per year and this is one and done.  Was there for a soccer tournament and we are required to stay at certain hotels or we would have checked out.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"spacious room, good choice for airport hotel","I stayed here one night recently before a flight the next morning. The suite I stayed in was huge and very comfortable with a living room and table area separated by a wall from the bedroom and bathroom area. The suite had 2 tvs, one in the living room area and another in the bedroom. There was a small coffee maker, a microwave, and refrigerator. Even though there was a fair amount of noise in the common areas, the room was quiet. The complimentary evening cocktails/light snacks service was nice. Breakfast was also complimentary although I ran out of time and didn't have it. I did have dinner at the bar that night and had one of the flatbreads.  The food was rather average hotel fare and there was not a great selection of wines. One annoying thing about the hotel was that only one of the two elevators was working, so it could take a long time to finally get the elevator and there was no signage that I could find as to where the stairs were. I was just staying on a 2nd floor room, so when I didn't have luggage would just prefer to use the stairs. My first attempt using a stairway took me directly outside without access to the lobby. I did eventually find the stairs to the lobby, but it would be nice if there was better signage for the stairs. I rated this hotel a 4 in spite of the elevator problem as the room was much larger than average and a very good value for the price that I found online.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,never made it to Denver,never saw the room. tried to cancel due to illness. no sympathy. had trouble even cancelling the room. had to go to american express to challenge the charges . still online service horrible. will learn to call hotel directly,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great food, drinks and bed!","This is the nicest Embassey Suites I have stayed in. Thank you staff, you all exceeded my expectations!Evening cocktails and light snacks are complementary as well as a real cooked to order breakfast. I ordered ""the special"" omelet and found it delicious.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Loved this property,"This is a great place to stay, especially if you are heading out the next morning from the airport.  Hotel was as we expected our of an Embassy Suites.  Excellent service from front desk staff, to bar, happy hour, etc.  Free airport shuttle which is awesome as well as free parking.  Same good breakfasts, clean rooms and bathrooms and location. We really loved the big screen tv in the living room, mini bar, and big tv in the separate bedroom.  Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Comfortable beds but little else,"I stayed here for three nights for a seminar.  While the rooms were clean and the beds soft I found little else to like about this hotel which is too bad since ES have been one of the consistently best places to stay.  The internet connection, which you have to buy, was terrible,  Slow and frequently would drop sites.  One elevator of two for the entire hotel was not working.  The free breakfast didn't taste as good on visits past, had a paltry choice of pastries and they don't have trays which means several trips to get your food, drinks, etc.  Having no car, I ate dinner here three nights.  The food was average and the menu limited.  All in all I don't recommend this hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Family Stay,"Great property, looks fairly new. Would definitely consider staying there again. I found it kinda pricey. Friendly staff. Enjoyed staying there better then the one in Colorado Springs on Commerece. Dr.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,My hotel of choice,"I travel to Denver every 6 weeks for business and this is my hotel of choice. I typically stay in a corner executive suite, however, I have also stayed in the regular suites. The rooms are updated, quiet, spacious, and clean. The breakfast is made to order, fantastic and included in the room price. The front desk staff is amazing. They are friendly, responsive, and very helpful. There's a free shuttle for travel to and from the airport. Love this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice stop at the Airport,"We had a premium suite on the 7th floor.  It was a large room with two double beds (queen), huge TV in both the living area and the bedroom.  Always like Embassy Suites.  Called to ask for more coffee for the a.m. and they brought it quickly and didn't stand around waiting for a tip.  Didn't take advantage of the p.m. cocktails but they are always consistent and fun.  Breakfast is always good and diversified.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Always a great stop. Quick shuttle, great staff, great eats!","I've been here a dozen plus times probably in the past year. Just what the title says! Always good eats, very nice rooms, prompt airport shuttle, easy parking, nice staff. Look forward to my return!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,great staff,outstanding hotel with lots of extras & the happy hour is great. great location near the airport. I just wish the room was older when u turn the air down. The bartender was awesome. We will defiantly stay here again for sure.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Do Not Miss This Value,"We visit the Denver area frequently but have never stayed.  What we found was that we should have been staying here for quite some time.  Nice 2 room suite for the price of a regular room.  Comparable amenities with a price that makes you feel good.  Staff knows how to provide the dervice expected in a nice hotel.  Again, don't miss it!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Close to the airport and nice ,"After exploring downtown and catching a Rockies game we stayed here due to an early flight the next morning. The hotel was nice , rooms nice , big , nice TVs , bed was really comfortable, and 5 minutes from the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Short but nice stay,Our one-night stay prior to flying from CO to TX was relaxing and quiet.  The staff in the restaurant were superb.  The staff behind the front desk were not extremely helpful.  It was convenient and we always like Embassy Suites.  We would choose this hotel again if we were flying in and out of Denver.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good stay,excellent place to stay when in Denver. Room had all the amenities and friendly wait staff and bartender. I will use this hotel often since work takes me to Denver regularly. The Hotel is by the airport but major highways are very close.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent hotel,Met all my expectations and beyond.  Very good in every way. I will come back for certain.  The van ride to the airport was perfect and got me there in plenty of time to navigate through security in plenty of time to make my flight.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Weekend getaway, great stay","Wonderful place to sleep and relax. Hotel is clean and great breakfast buffet service. Staff throughout hotel was awesome. About 4 minutes away from gas station, Walmart, ruby Tuesday, Five guys burger spot and a couple other eateries. Also close to highway 70.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,OVERPRICED AND BORING,"Was sadden by recent vist to said property as i normally go to this one over the years , it seems that as much as they charge for this property plus parking , you would think they would be A LIST but it was sad and tired the breakfast and the happy hour very boring , bland and sorry, my hotel vist was over $218 per night , I would have expected better they dont even bother putting bath robes any more for the diamond members. cheap on everything else toietlies in room , Happy Hour , Breakfast, service in the resturant. I have one word to embassy suites at DIA , the gaylord hotel is coming next year and you better step up your game as their constantly hotels being built around you, YOU need to stand out or people will go elsewhere with their money.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites (Hilton) in Denver,Super clean room and excellent service.  Staff is super friendly and helpful. Breakfast menu can be improved.  One of the two elevators was broken for three days and still was not fixed when we left the hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Hotel,I have stayed at this hotel several times.  The staff is always helpful and the evening reception is wonderful.  The breaksfast is the best one there is.  The shuttle to the airport is wonderful and the drivers are friendsly.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not the best Embassy Suite experience,"Our flight arrived in DEN late so we decided to stay near the airport for the night.  This Embassy Suite is just a few miles west of the airport and is easy to get on/off the highway.  The hotel looked fairly new and the suite was spacious and beautiful.  All amenities in the room were in good order.  The sofa bed was very comfortable.  The hotel seems to be a bit smaller than other Embassy Suites I have stayed.There are a few areas that could be improved:(1) Housekeeping:  Not all supplies were replenished.  There was small trash on the hall way carpet but no one cleaned it up for many hours.  I thought Embassy Suites are 3-3.5 star hotels. But they still have plastic cups in the rooms.(2) Breakfast:  Embassy Suites are famous for its cook-to-order breakfast.  The breakfast staff at this hotel was great. But the pre-cooked items (such as French toast, sausage, etc) were lukewarm and not very tasty.   There was no utensil placed in condiment jars (sugar, almonds, etc) near the oatmeal, so guests used their spoons to get the stuff (the good news was they were likely using new spoons).(3) There was a water shutoff at 10:00 am the next morning but I only found out only from a piece of paper inserted underneath my door – when I got up in the middle of the night.  I wish the hotel had communicated this to guests the night before.  The entire hotel would be out of water at 10:00am and it could last 6-7 hours according to the notice.  What if I slept late and woke up at 10:00?  The front desk staff was somewhat indifferent when asked about the water shutoff.  We had to check out earlier than expected; fortunately our next hotel (Marriott) allowed us to check in 5.5 hours early.Overall the experience is OK but not like other Embassy Suites I have stayed.  There were small issues here and there.  Paying more attention to details and additional staff training could be helpful.  I personally feel that Hilton hotels in general are hit-and-miss and lack the consistency of the Marriott hotels.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great place, good price.","Everything was great about our stay.  I would only have one thing to say, there were no USB charging ports to charge mobile devices.  This hotel was recently upgraded, and it is fairly decent, but I would have expected USB charging ports in the room.  Other than that, I would recommend staying there.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Relaxed.....Felt at home.,Couldn't have asked for a better experience. This hotel was in a perfect location. The amenities offered were just right. The bar was in the perfect location. The after mingle the had available would have been nice if I wasn't so exhausted. The bed was perfect and having the separate living area to watch TV and eat my dinner was just right. I totally felt at home. I used the laundry facility and it was totally free. That was definitely a plus. Great experience. Thank you Hilton.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,BEWARE LOUD AC UNITS - NO SLEEP,"Despite great stay n'fly parking and morning/evening food and drinks, our room AC unit turned on/off very loudly all night and we did not get any sleep. This was from our SECOND room, because the first room AC unit did not work at all. Pretty much ruined our first travel day of our vacation.  We stayed here due to really early flight and we figured we'd get more sleep but that backfired. Apparently the hotel was renovated in 2016 but obviously did not replace the older AC units - not smart Embassy Suites (our Loews Hotel on vacation had quiet AC unit and we slept great).  Do yourself a favor and stay at Hampton Inn or Marriott Courtyard across the street. Really disappointed with Embassy Suites, as they are usually reliable.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Ok stay,This hotel in some ways does not live up to its Hilton affiliation.  The fitness room was very good as was our room.  The appearance of the wait staff sadly was sloppy and unkempt.  Not their fault but the fault of their manager. I was shocked to request coffee at dinner and it came in a styrofoam cup.  I then requested a regular cup. The van that delivered us back to the airport was in very poor condition inside.  The  driver's seat in the van that took us to the AP  had the stuffing just coming out of the side of the seat.  Could not believe  an Embassy suites hotel would have this in their van.  The drivers were great as was the hotel staff.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great value with exceptional staff,"Almost lost amidst the jungle of hotels in the shadow of DIA (ironically, it is one of the tallest), this Embassy Suites proved to be the perfect spot for a three-day visit with our son living in nearby Green Valley Ranch).  Those staff members we interacted with were consistently solid, but the breakfast chefs and dining area staff were exceptional -- hard working, friendly, and obviously very conscious of the fact that they were important PR representatives of the hotel...I just hope they are recognized and compensated accordingly!  The ""Manager's Reception "" each evening was a nice touch, with the manager himself actually greeting and talking with guests enjoying complimentary wine, beer, and snacks, all the while bussing tables -- very impressive! The housekeeping, on the other hand, left something to be desired. Our room was skipped one day because then housekeeper said our ""do not disturb"" hanger was on the door. Yes it was, but only while we were at breakfast and was taken off upon our leaving the hotel for the day at 9:30 am.  Not a huge deal, but a bit annoying, especially when the front desk person tried to excuse housekeeping instead of believing their customer and simply apologizing. The suites are comfortable,but, as others have pointed out, could be cleaned a bit more thoroughly.  All in all, however, this property is an exceptional value for the area...we will be back!  Thank you!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent place to stay while in Denver,"My husband and I travel a lot and we were in Denver in January and stayed at a different hotel in this same area.  It was fine, but we were very glad we tried a new place this trip. We stayed at the hotel over Easter weekend and it couldn't have been better.  The room was available for early check in when we arrived, it was clean and very spacious. Of course, all Embassy Suites rooms are suites, and the extra space is wonderful! Our room was on the back side of the hotel giving us a fabulous view of the front range and downtown Denver. (we were on the sixth floor) The room was quiet and the bed very comfortable.  We had a huge TV in the living area and another very large TV in the bedroom. This hotel chain also offers a Manager's Reception in the evening with free wine and beer, and they also had snacks, which was very nice.   But the best part was breakfast; it is not unusual anymore to have a free breakfast at your hotel, but the food is almost always the same!  Not here -- they had a complete breakfast, with made to order omelets (nine different ingredients), bacon, pancakes, french toast, biscuits and gravy, crispy homestyle potatoes, and the standard scrambled eggs, and sausage. Of course they had all the other typical things as well, mini sweet rolls, mini donuts, toast, bagels, cereal, yogurt and oatmeal with a variety of toppings.  It was incredible and all included in the cost of the room.  Yes, we did pay about 10.00 more a night to stay here instead of the hotel we stayed at before, but the quality of everything was much superior to the other hotel.Finally, we found the staff at the hotel, from the front desk people, to the people manning the omelet station, the bus people and housekeeping to be friendly and helpful.  They really seemed to like working there and working with the public.All in all, a great place to stay near the Denver Airport - but without airport noise!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,poor customer service and slow response ,"the room was wonderful and spacious however the customer service and response of the staff left something to be severely wanted and then i got overcharged by an additional $50.00,that was never returned or even filed when I called to complain... do yourself a favor and go stay at a cheaper hotel that wont give you the shaft and rip you off",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Expected more, needs a deep cleaning","My kids found candy wrappers in the couch and food on the floor. The vents and floor corners were very dusty. There wasn't a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign so housekeeping was knocking by 8am. Being an open hotel I thought noise may be an issue but it was fine in the bedroom area. The AC unit in the bedroom was very loud and kept my family up both nights we stayed. Breakfast was bland and cold even though we ate early, although the made to order omelet was good. Our room was missing bar soap, a TV channel guide, and any type of hotel or restaurant info. Felt a bit unwelcoming compared the hotel we stayed in the rest of the week. Swimming pool was fine and towels were big and soft. Will try a different hotel next time, lots in the area.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great if you need to be close to the airport,"My family stayed here for one night because we had early morning flights. I like the suite format because my sister and I were able to share a separate room from my parents within the same suite (everything was neat and clean, too). I utilized the gym, which had a good variety of facilities. The staff was extremely friendly and the breakfast provided was excellent. Finally, the airport shuttle was extremely convenient, and it was a 5-10 drive to the DEN terminal.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great family experience,"This is the perfect hotel for a family, and ideal for anyone visiting Denver or heading to the mountains.  The suites are large and clean, and the location is extremely convenient to the airport and rental cars.  The complimentary breakfast was excellent and it was nice to have a restaurant with a bar available upon arrival.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Close to Airport,"Prices can get high at this facility, as with most others in Denver area (based on season or other events in the area.) Parking is limited if you arrive in the evening, so get there as soon as possible or you will have to park on the street. Good staff interactions and decent food for this facility.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very Impressed,"This was a great stay from beginning to end. I was able to Pre-book a room, and check in a day early. I arrived at the prescribed time but my room was not ready, but they gave me a comparable room. It was very clean, large and very well laid out. They hotel is impressive in layout, and cleanliness. We arrived before happy hour with complimentary drinks and cocktails. We had a very early check out and flight and needed to leave by 6:15Am.  Breakfast began at 6AM and I was incredibly impressed to see them all set up at 6AM with selection of hot eggs, bacon and all the amenities you would expect. Hot coffee was there and all delicious pastries, fruit, yogurt. The omelette station was ready for orders. I have very often had early morning flights over the past 3 years, this is the FIRST time I have ever stayed in a hotel which was actually ready to serve breakfast at the prescribe promised time!! The time to the airport was only 10"" and we express checkout. The bill was emailed to be before I even got into my car-wow!! I love the look of The lobby and the elevator and miner bar. The business center printer even worked... I can't tell you how often the business center computers don't always work!! I will definitely be staying here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,fantastic stay,"If you want good service at a good price stay at any Embassy Suites, they won't let you down.  Their service is of high quality and their amenities such as the pool, business center, and breakfast excellent.  I stayed for four months and never had a complaint.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Please Vacuum & Clean,"Please vacuum!!! In the morning after a shower while sitting bare foot at the desk I got stuck in the foot with something, when I pull it out its a Toe Nail, someone else's not mine. I wash my hands and check around and there's more. plus a purple rubber band and more small items on the floor. I now start looking around and the vent in the bath room is covered in dust. Lastly 2 body wash bottles & conditioner, but no shampoo.  I reported it the front desk at check out. I've stayed here before and not had anything this gorse!",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Short but suite,"We had an early morning flight and decided with the potential for bad weather to stay near the airport. Always have positive experiences with Embassy Suites. Rooms are nice, they offer free breakfast (unfortunately we had to leave at 4:00 am) before it was offered, but they had hot coffee, fruit, etc. for the early risers. Even though we were there less than 12 hours it was well worth it.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Room never cleaned,"My room was never cleaned. When I returned late that evening and called to ask for it to be done, I was told the staff had all gone home and that that it was too bad. They were sorry. Asked for a manager to call me the next day (not that would have cleaned my room then), but that never happened. I am a Diamond member with this chain.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,quick stay,"checked in, personable staff, dropped rental car, shuttle arrived within 20 minutes, view would have been great if not for very low clouds..., complimentary happy hour, slept well, up at 3:30 am for 4:00 shuttle to the airport. shuttle pulled out at 4:02 am. Perfect for this nervous airline traveler.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great location ,"I stay here always the night before I fly out of Denver. Great staff, clean rooms, excellent managers happy hour. Close to the airport. I always turn my rental car in the night before and the hotel picks me up at the car rental. The following morning the hotel drops me off at the airport. Good value for the money. I recommend anyone in the area to stay here.  ",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Layover Flight Stay,"My family and I stayed here on ""layover"" flight, flying back home.  The airport shuttle was there to pick us up at the hotel with minimal wait.  Was greeted by friendly clerk who checked us and in and gave us suggestions for the scheduling the airport shuttle for the next morning.  Arriving late at night, he suggested the in house bar restaraunt to get something to eat.  The service there was outstanding and in no time they had our food ready and bagged up to take upstairs.  The property itself is very clean and the staff very friendly.  These are two things that are very important to us.  The beds were very comfortable, especially after a long day of flying.  In the morning, the cooked to order breakfast at Embassy Suites is second to none and this location was no different.  The man cooking was so very friendly and willing to do whatever he could to make you happy.  There was plenty of selection on the buffet line as well.  Enjoyed our breakfast and headed to the airport shuttle for another day of flying.  Great stay!  If and when we find ourselves in Denver, we will definitely stay here again!  One suggestion.....make sure you schedule your airport shuttle time when you checkin  The times fill up fast.  Thanks to all for a great stay!!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Brother Skip Memorial,Rob - front desk has exceeded expectations! This property is magnificent. Contemporary and rustic. Rooms are appointed and comfy. Shuttle service to DIA curbside. Made to order breakfast. Happy hour morsels and refreshments. Super fare served.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay,This was a good hotel in a location very convenient to Denver International - important for our early flight out the next day.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Room was nice with two large screen TVs (Mark Madness fans).  Happy hour kept us from having to go our and find food after a tiring day hiking at Red Rocks.  Price was very competitive.  All around a good deal and pleasant stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Poor Room Service,"Two college students ordering pasta for room service, and it was so bad, that could not eat it.  Hotel after the fact was kind enough to remove the $ 70.00 charge.  Hotel has a great shuttle service and the hotel is close to the Denver International Airport.  Everything was fine except the quality of the food served, which was poor at best.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Long Term Parking isn't Free,"Since I had stayed at the hotel the last time I had an early morning flight, I decided to stay here again especially since the parking was still free according to Expedia. I booked my stay using airlines miles and cash to save some money. Upon checking in, I discovered, the hotels policy had changed and they now charge for parking and that you are apparently supposed to call to make reservations to leave your car. Per the hotel, the change happened at the end of last summer but for some reason, Expedia and American Airlines hotel sites do not tell you this.I paid the $50 to park for the week and went to my room. As I was getting ready for bed I discovered the hot water was shutoff at the sink so all I had was cold water. I also noticed the hotel room is becoming very dated. For the price of a room, $14.95 for wireless, and now parking, it is not worth the cost. There are a lot of hotels in the area just as nice if not better to choose from.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Vacation Stop,"Very nice hotel and accommodation. Love the manager social, got to meet some very interesting people.Had dinner there and the food was good but the breakfast was excellent. Was very disappointed that the shuttle back to the airport did not drop us off at curbside, instead dropped us off at the other end and we were left to walk and figure out how to bring all our luggage to check in, made it difficult.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Large hotel rooms with airport shuttle,"Hotel rooms were well appointed, nicely designed and very large suites. Bar onsite has good service but the menu is lacking. Outdoor hot tub is a nice touch and open until late. There are a couple of restaurants in walking distance to the property but other than that, you need a vehicle or can use Uber/Lyft/Taxi. Lyft is about $35 to downtown Denver. Great location for airport and free shuttle service.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight Stay,"Great location if you need to spend the night close to the hotel. We stayed at this hotel last year on our way to Breckenridge and also on our return. This year we did the same as the hotels location is convenient, the staff is friendly, rooms are comfy and clean. The breakfast buffet was good this time but not as good as last year. All said, good value for the money.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place!  Plenty of space,"We choose this hotel for convenience and the extra space it provided.  We were not disappointed.  While the boys played xbox in the room, my husband and I enjoyed the evening reception in the bar area.  It was very nice!  Great Location!  Wonderful Service!  Spacious and well equipped Hotel Suite!  We will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice Hotel - Terrible Service,"The hotel is in good proximity to the airport.  It is nicely appointed and clean.  If you just want an evening beverage, they can probably satisfy your needs.  However, if it is an actual meal you seek you will be better off going to an outside restaurant.  You will not save time by eating in the hotel restaurant and you certainly won't gain quality...in the food or service!",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice and bright suites; very good for airport transit,"I've stayed in this Hilton property for one night because of a transit.[1]  Check-in/check-outBoth are smooth and there are nothing special.   A good thing is that once my check-out is complete, I immediately receive a soft copy in my mailbox.   It is not always happened in other Hilton properties!!![2]  RoomMy room is an executive suites 601, which is a corner room.   When compared with the other Embassy Suites that I always feel that the rooms are dark, this Denver property is excellent - the room looks bright and positive, and the furniture is kind-of IKEA-like that provide a warm, not aged, feel!  The premium internet inside the room is reasonably fast and above-par.[3]  Airport shuttleThere is a complimentary airport shuttle that serves between the airport and Island 3 of Door 512 in Denver International Airport.   The frequency is about 30 minutes each in the morning till 10am, and then 40 minutes afterwards.  The ride one-way is about 10 minutes.  [4]  Fitness facilitiesThere is an indoor gym that opens daily from 5:00am to about 11pm.  There is also an indoor pool and outdoor one.  The equipment are sufficient for a short stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Adequate accommodations for overnight stay,"The suite was very basic but fine for a pre-flight stay.  The breakfast that was included was actually awesome.  We didn't expect much,  but it was very well done.  The chef, Desean was such a positive, enthusiastic man.  My daughter has a nut allergy and we are used to chefs/waitstaff treating us like we are being high maintenance.  Desean went out of his way to show us every label and had an extremely pleasant attitude towards us. The free shuttle to the airport is a major bonus as well!",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,I will return.,"The suite was nicely laid out, the bed mattress was perfect for my back issues, and the complimentry breakfast was one of the best I've  had for a freebie!  The front desk (Rob) was most helpful with a related area travel question.I have found that I can always count on a firm mattress at any Hilton.  That is why I always try and find a Hilton in the area where I am traveling.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"VERY modern, fresh, affordable airport hotel","The room seemed to have been remodeled the day before I arrived.  It was that new looking.   Furniture you would actually enjoy sitting on in the suite section.  Nice, fresh carpet.   Very large flat screen mounted on the wall in the suite (55'+).  Another large flat screen in the bedroom.  Blonde wood vs. the usual cherry was very fresh.  Really great room for the price at the airport location",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,What a great facility,"We came in to town for a quick 80th birthday party and chose this hotel for its location and proximity to DIA.  What can I say, another great Embassy Suites!  We were on the top floor and couldn't hear any airport traffic which was great.  Overall it is an awesome facility!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver Airport Hotel,"Our family of four (4) usually flys into DIA at night and drives up to the ski resorts the following day.  We have stayed at a few different hotels near DIA. This has been the best so far.  Suite had two double beds (prefer  two queens)  clean and the breakfast was very good. Can get fresh made eggs, pancakes, waffles.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.   Free Wifi.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Another Great Embassy Stay,"This was our 2nd Embassy stay in the Denver area. The Hotel is top-notch,very clean and everything was great. Big spacious rooms with a dividable bedroom/living room  (with sofa)  with separate T.V's in each room. the room had a nice kitchenette with microwave,sink and refrigerator., a room safe, and a very updated modern shower and bathroom.  The Embassy has a great breakfast in the morning do not miss it. This hotel also has a free airport shuttle.    Overall a great stay. I will be using Embassy Suites in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Colorado trip,"I'm very satisfied about our stay. The staff are very nice and courteous. We only had one problem when we used the shuttle service to airport, they had too many passengers that morning @ 5am, they ran out space in the van, probably the front desk miscounted. I left my wife and son to take the next one so we can check in our luggages. Everything went well, we made it back to Florida. Overall, it's a good stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,group of ladies,"This is a lovely property.  Evening reception and complimentary breakfast were very nice.  We enjoyed the space of the suite, very comfortable beds.  Shuttle was very timely and responsive for airport travel.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Wonderful customer service,We stayed at this Embassy Suites before an early morning flight out of the Denver Airport. Their shuttle picked us up from returning our rental car so we would not have to take it the next morning before our early flight. They fixed box breakfasts for us since we were leaving before breakfast was served. They also provided shuttle service to the airport at 4:00 AM the next morning. We were most impressed. The rooms were nice and the beds were comfortable. A very pleasant experience.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Quick stay on way to mountain skiing,"We stayed here on our way to Winter Park.  Location was close to airport and had free shuttle to and from.  Took a while for shuttle to arrive, but maybe we had just missed it when we got our bags.  Hotel is very nice, rooms were nice but our room had an incredibly loud furnace!  I think every time it kicked on, one of us woke up.  Evening cocktails and appetizers were nice.  Made-to-order breakfast was delicious as they always are at Embassy Suites!  Front desk staff was very friendly.  Overall, excellent stay minus the furnace noise level.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver Stay,"This hotel was a great. I had a 13 hour layover, the shuttle picked us up and dropped us back off at Denver Int. The room service delivered our food hot and we didn't wait very long. The complementary breakfast was delish, my child really enjoyed the fact that they had both waffles and French toast.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Choose something else,"The happy hour is all you'll be happy about. The shower was disgusting,  coffee pot broken, and the room blew cold air all night. For what they charge you would think the shower curtain would not be ripped or have mold. I'll be staying across the street  next time.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stop over.,As short as the stay was it was all enjoyable the staff were great as was the breakfast and managers evening. The hotel was convenient for the airport offering a shuttle service if required. Would use this and other Embassy Suites where possible.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good experience,The manager's reception and made to order breakfast were excellent. The quality of the food was very good. The free shuttle to airport was very convenient. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Spacious Premium Room,The ES here near the airport (5 miles) is pretty neat.Excellent free breakfast and omelet chef was really amazing. It's hard to stand out but he does.Room is nice and comfortable and although not fancy is sort of business modern and a good place to be for a few days. I'm in a premium suite on the seventh floor and don't know what other rooms are like.Overall a good choice,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Disappointed in Embassy Dia,Was looking forward to a memorable gathering with daughters. Reserved a month in advance for a large enough room to be altogether and even checked in early via the phone but they still gave our room away.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good but not that good...,"Hotel is nice, close to the Denver Airport and clean. After many visits to this hotel, I can say say that the staff isn't as hospitable and happy as most working at Embassy Suites I have stayed at before. Love the outdoor hot tub!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,get away,"As stated before, I feel that the front desk staff can be helping keep the lobby, elevators and the widows clean between guest. The floors had not been cleaned for the length of our stay neither were the elevators. We enjoyed our stay the past stays were better than this one but it was still enjoyable.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,one night stay,very close to the airport and not too far off the main airport road.  There was a convenience store across the street with a gasoline station which made it convenient to refuel the rental car the night before prior to going to the airport,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Extremely overpriced for quality of service received,"For $300 a night this hotel is definitely NOT worth it.  Its apparent that you are paying for their location and not for quality.  However, on my next trip I would stay at one of the several other hotels nearby.  This hotel was apparently ""recently updated"" however I could not tell.  The paint was splashed on the walls, literally.  Old outdated looking furniture.  No help unloading our car. Internet didn't work. Only hot tub is outside.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Expected more....,"To all of my 40,000+ readers: So we know what will happen after this posts. Some member of ""management"" will say thanks for you feedback, yada yada, we will work on improvements, etc. etc. HERE""S the TRUTH though....We expected more. Being in our early 40""s we have traveled a lot. I chose this Embassy Suites because it was only 1 of 2 with a HEATED indoor pool. Truth be told, was still pretty cold, even in 55 degrees outside. To us ES was always, higher class, more expensive, nicer of the hotels. Now, we are a multi racial family, but the people staying here are of the ""Caucasian persuasion"" . I have never seen so many rude, entitled, sneezing and coughing in your face people in my life. Happy hour looked like we pulled up to a ....NEVER MIND. Since they have a free cocktail time (5:30-7:30) it brings the worst of the worst. The bartenders are all very irritated, maybe because of the lack of people tipping on free food. The CLAIM BAR and restaurant is terrible, and expensive. Tastes like everything is microwaved. (but we still gave a TIP folks!!!) THE SAVING GRACE in the morning is Deshaun who makes omelets. Mine was pretty good, and he is very friendly. The inside of the hotel is blah. But the room we got ( I suggest the corner, away from elevator) was pretty modern, but needed detail work like dirty, dusty, vents.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great comfort for your money! ,"We stayed one night at the hotel coming back from our ski trip and to be close to the airport for our early morning flight. The 2 bedroom suite was just perfect in comfort and size for the 4 of us and our 6 pieces luggage. The kitchen space is another plus. Wifi and breakfast bufett are included, they also offer a complimentary airport shuttle, you can't ask for more. I wished we had stayed at the Embassy Suites as well the night of our arrival in Denver 8 days ago and not in another hotel with a much smaller ""suite""! The only little minus was that the central AC/heating located in the master bedroom in a small closet, is very noisy and I had to turn it off in the middle of the night.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not your usual Embassy,"Chose to stay at an embassy because of the cleanliness of the rooms and the free wonderful breakfast,breakfast was excellent,service was excellent ,room was worn out ,a little dingy Check appliances..",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Ski Vaca Kick Off,"We stayed here for two nights to start off our ski vacation. This was a great Embassy Suites, good breakfast, fantastic happy hour, and a very clean room. Highly recommended for any locals or world travelers for a great place by DIA.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,5 star treatment.,"From check in to happy hour, late dinner and late breakfast. Room cleaniness and staff friendliness, a perfect score. Stayed due to flight cancelations, will certainly return if I need an airport area suite.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great Stop, Perfect for a Family","We had four nights here waiting for family members to arrive before heading to the mountains. The Embassy Suites were all we needed and more. Plenty of room for two adults and three children to spread out. We enjoyed the breakfast and the complimentary happy hour and ate in the restaurant for dinner each night. Would prefer a little more fresh fruit perhaps for the breakfast. The kids were accommodated with kids' menus, highchairs and the staff kindly tolerated the mess kids seem to make when eating! It is great to have a complimentary laundry facility. We would definitely return. My only recommendation would be for the management to consider a Pack and Play type cot for babies, as the steel framed one provided makes a racket when the baby moves and I'm sure he thought he was being locked up in jail each night! Overall a great stay, many thanks.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Excellent Customer Service, clean large rooms.","We had reserved a room with two beds for our one night stay, but when we arrived they only had rooms with a king bed left.  For some reason when my husband used the app to process early check-in things got goofed up.  Front desk apologized for not being able to offer us a room with two beds and gave us a second room with a king bed next door at no charge.  Complimentary happy hour was great.  Not the most extraordinary array of appetizers, but free nonetheless.  Comfortable beds and pillows.  Convenient to DIA.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight stop,"We have always had good experiences with Embassy Suites. This quick stay did not disappoint! From the moment we boarded the complimentary airport shuttle, to the moment we checked out, our stay was perfect. Our suite had one king bed and a pull out queen size sofa bed. The sofa bed was by far the most comfortable we have encountered. The thick, memory foam mattress kept the kids (ages 9 & 11) comfortable all night. The shining star of every Embassy stay is the wonderful breakfast. The offering of all breakfast items you can imagine is so fulfilling and delicious. Overall, you just can't go wrong with Embassy Suites Denver Airport. Enjoy your stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Brief Stay- Close proximeity to Denver Airport,I was pleasantly surprised to find these rooms spacious and clean .  There were great restaurants in the area and it was so close to the airport.  It was better to stay here than travel a few hours from our prior stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Happy Traveler,Fitness center and staff were great.  Loved the complimentary breakfast and happy hour.  Would have liked more options of snacks during happy hour but overall experience was great.  Shuttle Service and parking of vehicle was another reason for always staying at this Embassy Suites.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Colo trip,Had a flight cacellation and spent the night at this hotel.  Everything was very good   I was very tired and it was so nice to get to this embassy suites and not have to leave the building for dinner.  This stay was just what I needed.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight stopover from airport to skiing,"We stayed at this location and after traveling for more than 10 hours with layovers and delays, we finally arrived at the Denver airport.  This location was a nice respite before we continued on our trip.It seems to have some wear and tear, but they've done a great job working on sprucing up the location.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Perfect,This is the first time I have stayed at this hotel and I am glad I did. The staff and the restaurant is just perfect and well managed. It's very clean and the beds are a very nice sleep. The airport is very close by and it is not very far from town which makes it an easy in and out without a lot of traffic problems.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Stay near DIA,Good location near Airport. Parking could be an issue. Good stay with happy hour in the evening. Morning breakfast was good as well. Shuttle back to the hotel from airport took a long time. Good staff.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver Visit,"My issue is that when I checked in and tried to pay for my reservation I was told that my card was declined. I knew this should not have been the case, so i asked the agent to try it again. Again it was declined. She kept asking for another form of payment. Since it was on the credit card that I use for travel and I knew it had the amount available I was confused. Then I checked my app on my phone and saw that she was trying to authorize my card for $50 over the reserved room amount. I asked her why and her response was that ""we just reserve a little additional for incidentals."" That would not have been a problem if I knew that was a standard procedure or if it was mentioned anywhere when I tried to make the reservation. I told her she could do it for an amount that was over the room rate, but I was dissatisfied with how that situation played out. Also when i went out for dinner that evening, I let the front desk staff know that the microwave in my room did not work. It wasn't fixed nor addressed anymore by the staff during my stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,predictably great,"We have been coming to an Embassy Suites hotel for 8 years. We do a 2-room, 1-night family stay-cation. We have never been disappointed with the price, amenities, service. Always a great experience. We usually stay at the Colorado Springs location, but this year needed to stay closer to home. We stayed at the DIA location.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent stay,Excellent stay with my family.the place is clean and the staff are friendly.it's near shopping area and airport.actually my 2nd time.i highly recommend this hotel.with the drink all you can bar it's so amazing!!what more can i asked for.see next time guys!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Nice suite, nice breakfast","Stayed here for one night before catching a plane. The room was pleasant, breakfast was very good - made to order omelets as well as a breakfast buffet - and free shuttle to the airport. All around a pleasant stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Fantastic stay, park & fly experience!","We love Embassy Suites for our stays. This one is no different. Great staff, easy park & fly experience, the shuttle drivers were on time, speedy (in a good way) , and friendly. They also do not share their shuttle so you are noy having to drop off or pick up other hotels guests. The breakfast was awesome as well and we flew out at 8 and were catching the 630 am shuttle we went down at 550 and breakfast was all but ready and the gal putting it out told us to go ahead and eat at 555! Rooms were clean, pool area was clean, and fitness room was fantastic. This is where we will be staying every time we fly out of DIA!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Stay,The staff is very helpful and courteous. Check in process was nice and simple. Bell carts were readily available. Rooms are nice and clean. Room to spread out and we all slept great. The restaurant staff was timely and helpful. Breakfast was made to order. Was a nice change to stay here. Good value for the product. We will stay again!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Park and Fly Option,"Anytime I can get a pretty good rate here night prior to a morning flight out of Denver, I will stay here (if the travel duration is long enough to justify; night stay close to or less than airport parking).  I live ~1 hr drive from the airport (longer if there is heavy traffic) so do try to look for hotel for the night prior to make the morning less stressful and possibly save on parking.  If I can get a decent rate here, this is where I will stay.  Excellent rooms, nice restaurant and bar, and much better breakfast (included) than most other places.  The shuttle service it pretty reliable (every 30 minutes).  I have stayed at many other hotels at denver airport, but this one is my go to.  The only time I don't stay here is when it sold out or very expensive.  But most of the time, I can get a reasonable rate, so I will stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Travel made easy,"Long day, Staff went out of their way to make our long day a pleasure to check in. A great hotel, clean room comfortable bed, great room service food was good. Shuttle service was great. If traveling in the Denver Airport area a must hotel to stay at. Plenty of restaurants nearby.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight to catch shuttle to airport.,We had an easy stay arrived late and left early on complimentary shuttle.  Parking free while on our trip but they did mention that policy was changing so may need to book a package with parking included in the future.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay around Denver International Airport,"My family and I stayed in 3 rooms here, just outside of Denver International Airport, one night before a flight the next day.  The price was reasonable  (around  $120/ room), the rooms were spacious & very clean, & the complementary morning breakfast was unbelievably superb as usual for Embassy Suites.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Happy with the stay,"Overall very happy with the place. It is close to Denver international airport for the early morning flight home. Two-suite room is big, bright and clean. We noticed really loud hissing sound when neighbor used the shower. We didn't bother changing the room as we were so tired from travel.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Exceptional shuttle service,"Close to airport.  Complimentary breakfast was ok - slow to refill steamer items.  Rooms ok, staff pleasant but experience not remarkable.  Hotel met our needs for transitioning from airport to next hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Nice Hotel, good Location",The hotel is clean and it is in a convenient location to the airport. The managers reception leaves a little to be desired compared to other Embassy Suites I have visited. The bar keeper appeared a little grumpy but our waitress was great.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,In spite of...,"a few things that were not perfect, my 4 day long weekend stay was quite nice.  Room 315 (corner suite with mountain view) was very nice and extra roomy.  Superior sound proofing, absolutely no airplane noise or any other outside noise.  Especially liked the two big screen TV's in the suite.  Things that could be improved = loud A/C noise in bedroom, minor dings and scrapes on the walls, breakfast selection (especially the coffee - I drove a good distance to Starbucks for my coffee as I cannot drink Embassy Suites coffee - wish they would change brands), the elevator had popcorn spilled on the floor and not cleaned for more than 24 hours.  There are not many restaurants steps away from the hotel, but there are a few - Ruby Tuesdays and an Italian restaurant that are a couple of blocks away.  Very convenient to the airport and easy access to downtown via the highway.  I give very high marks for the staff for friendliness and helpfulness.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great value,Very clean. Perfect for families. The two room suite is so nice when you have a toddler that takes naps during the day. The breakfast is a great buffet and the made to order omelettes are delicious.  Happy hour and snacks are also a great perk. Our daughter loved the pool and we loved the hot tub.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel!,We stayed here for one week for business and everything was wonderful.  I would recommend this facility for both personal and business use.  The staff were very friendly and helpful!  Rooms are large and comfortable.  The breakfast in the morning is amazing!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Almost Perfect ,"Some time ago I started using a point system to judge how much I liked my hotel room. (To help me fall asleep actually). There are three categories, with each scoring a maximum of 10 possible points. I ask myself, is this room:Comfortable?Clean?Quiet?Comfortable; Is everything in working order?  The lights, TV, outlets, AIR CONDITIONER, sink, shower, etc.  How is the bed? The pillows!  Is the room dark??Clean: Will walking bear foot give me black feet? (It's happened).  Are the linens white or gray?  Does the shower look like the one in my home, or a high school gym?Quiet:  Am I going to sleep tonight, or be the unwilling participant of some high school soccer game happening in the hallway? I give this Embassy a very solid 29 out of 30 points!Crisp clean bed bath linen. Comfortable and quiet rooms. I have to use the word clean again, the room was very clean.In the evening there is a manager's type gathering; bar snacks, chips, humus and the like. Free beer and wine. All of the rooms open out around the atrium, so I was concerned about noise. But no worries there, as the rooms are suites the beds are deep in the room and insulated from sound. I run the air conditioner year-round because a cool room is the only way to sleep. Here, it functioned perfectly. Many hotels turn the air off over the winter months.The pillows were a little flat for my liking, a personal preference I know, but come on!  Give a guy a choice!Breakfast, and it's an outstanding one is free to every guest. Omelette stand, fresh fruit, a variety of juices, and so much more. The one point I withheld?  A small annoyance... the alarm clock on the night stand was so bright that, had it been a foggy night, it would have drawn ships in.  I mean bright!Other than that, a perfect stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice Airport Hotel,"Nice hotel near the airport.  Managers reception was disappointing, not much besides a chip and carrot stick.  Overall great hotel for  good price, skip the managers reception and get the tacos at the restaurant. 😎",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,good and bad,The parking is horrible.  I get that you stay here you can leave you car but hello what about the other guests.  There should be a spot that is designated for longer parking so that everyday guest have somewhere to park.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very Nice Layover ,"Missed a connecting flight and ended up spending the night here. Embassy's are no doubt consistent. Very nice clean hotel, spacious rooms and friendly staff. The dinner was very good but a bit pricey $18 for three small fish tacos. However, the always amazing breakfast more than made up the difference.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Park and stay at DIA,"Embassy suites in general offer nice, roomy suites.  The suites have been updated which was nice to see.  However, the overall appearance of the main lobby seems outdated.  The management and help went out of their way to accommodate our requests.  The hotel's proximity to DIA is ideal for travelers who wish to park their car while vacationing or leaving the area.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent and close to airport,"Hotel is one of our favorities, always exceeds our expectations. Love the omeletes and we have had nothing but excellent food and service when using room service.  Really everything is always perfect and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not like it used to be.,Embassy Suites isn't the same. Maybe if we had kids with us. The breakfast was awful. The staff was nice although our room didn't get made up one day. Don't pay for the premium room. Snacks are pretty sad. Won't be coming back.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Open Bar!,"The room itself was beautiful with a living room area which included a microwave, coffee maker, and a sink. Having two sinks, one in the bathroom and one outside made getting ready in the morning much easier. The hotel boasts an open bar from 5-7 and the drinks were great and were accompanied by an appetizer bar. Our shuttle to the airport in the morning was convenient and right on time. However, our shuttle upon return was 40 minutes late.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Dirty water,I went to run a bath for my kids after enjoying an evening the pool and the bath water was brown. I asked someone to come up and look at it and they initially told me to just let the water run. A maintaince worker came to fix a clogged toilet so I had him look at the water and he told me it was fine. My kids weren't able to get the chlorine water off of them due to the water in the room being dirty.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Thanksgiving trip,"Hotel is great, but parking is a joke. They allow stay and park while you fly but do not consider any parking for their guests which are actually staying there. Never did get to park at the hotel. Had to park on the street and walk to the hotel each evening when we returned.The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was quite good. This hotel would have gotten excellent ratings from us except for the parking.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great experience!!!,Leaving Breckenridge needed to over night in Denver. Took the train to Union Station. Had a wonderful day in downtown Denver before our flight that  evening!! The A line was a great experience!!! Recommend everyone take it!!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"A little dated, but comfortable","Had an early flight so stayed the night to be close to airport.  Room was very nice with enough beds to accommodate all family members.  Would have been nice to have had a nicer, heavier blanket such as a down comforter on the pull out sofa as the one provided was miserably insufficient in keeping anyone warm.  I am used to the beds at Embassy Suites being extremely comfortable, but was incredibly disappointed to find the beds here rock hard and very uncomfortable.  Barely slept a wink unfortunately.  The amenities provided were great and the service received (with the exception of the grumpy bartender) was excellent, from the front desk clerk to the people serving breakfast.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Amazing Place to Stay,I highly recommend staying at this Embassy Suites as the customer service is great!  2 hour free happy hour was good as well. Pool stayed open until midnight. This was a great place to stay. Rooms were amazing as well,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,The place to stay when traveling to the airport,"We checked in and we pleasantly surprise by the quality of this Embassy Suites. Elizabeth at the front desk was so welcoming. Parking was an issue, but this is a busy travel time. Our room is clean, spacious, and comfortable. We enjoyed a burger from The Claim restaurant and it was delicious. We dined at the bar enjoying the happy hour wine. It was a relaxing evening.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very comfortable!,"Our suite was very comfortable, and the hotel layout was interesting and fun! We loved the happy hour in the evenings and it was convenient to have a restaurant in the hotel. However, the food took FOREVER to finally get to us and was incredibly expensive. We were also turned off by the main woman who appeared to be the banquet director. We had one interaction with her and unfortunately she was INCREDIBLY rude.  The one waiter who was always there, I believe his name is Travis, is amazing! He was friendly, warm and made our whole experience wonderful. Although Travis was wonderful, and overall we were very comfortable here, the interaction with that banquet lady made us re-think staying here in the future.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Quick stay to began honeymoon,We only stayed for a quick night before our flight to our honeymoon destination. Room was clean and beautiful. Had chocolates and champagne waiting in our room. Very nice hotel! Shuttle to the airport was friendly and prompt.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Family and friends,We were a group of 20.  There were three families with their kids ages 12-19.  We all had an amazing time.  Everything was perfect for us. Very impressed with the service and amenities you get for the price you pay.  The shuttle to and from the airport was great an they always had two shuttles for our large group.  Also the happy hour drinks. We will from here on out always use embassy suites for any trip in and out of Denver !!!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Hotel stay,"Excellent place with great breakfast and near the airport with a shuttle. Wifi is great, staff was accommodating, and the facility is beautiful. Only ten minutes to the airport, which was perfect for our needs.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Best stay and park,"We live 1 1/2 hours from the airport.  Having an early morning flight we spent the night before our flight at this hotel.  Our room was a suite...living room with large TV and comfortable furniture, small kitchen area,  king bed.  Everything was spotless and very nice. Staff was friendly and helpful, free breakfast had many items, shuttle to airport perfect.  Happy hour every night included some free drinks and snacks, you could order from the cafe if you wanted more than snacks.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice Hotel but Too Long of a Wait for Pickup,"This is a very clean, comfortable, and quiet (despite its location) hotel. The suite was set up very nicely for both visiting and desk work. I (and my back) always appreciate hotels that have the higher toilet seat as they do here.My major issue was that it took an hour from the airport pick-up area to get to the hotel. That's a long time to wait when it's chilly outside and one is tired after a long day with plans for a very early morning departure. Hotels near major airports, should have their shuttles circling such more frequently than once an hour. Fortunately, the early morning shuttle service was on time and quickly delivered us to the airport.Because of the early hour of our departure, I cannot report on their breakfast offering.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Skip this property,"Wow, how lucky can I be.  I found Hilton's arm pit property.  Making reservations and check-in was good.  Convenient to airport for next day flight.  Free shuttle, free parking. Front desk clerk even gave us complimentary drink passes.  The yelp reviews were pretty good, and I thought I was getting a big value for the buck, a 2 queen bed suite, evening reception including cocktails and apps., and made to order breakfast.  Skip all the perks just give me a CLEAN room.  Room was $110, with AAA Club discount.  Saved about $30.   The first room appeared someone or more than one person had been laying on the beds, plus a bath towel on it.  Front desk said sometimes people do that, they keep the key and go back to the room after check-out.  I believe it and people who do that don't realize the negative impact that has on the next guest and housekeeping.  I just call that dis-honest and moronic behavior.  I was offered to keep that room and housekeeping would clean it up, or furnish another room.  Of course I didn't want to wait and took the other room.  This room stank so bad it made me gag.  That was my first indication of a lack of good cleaning.   The cleaning crew doesn't seem to have anyone inspecting, or Hilton has given directions not to do a good job to save money, or turn over rooms fast with as little staff as possible.  Who knows.  It was gross.  Appliances and even lamp switches were greasy and sticky, floor in bathroom was sticky and dirty with crumbs of something, bathtub floor had dirt foot stains on it, clock radios not even set to proper time even in first room, and each room had a complimentary Fly.  I believe it's coming from the mini-fridge bar sink or bathroom sink.  The bar sink drain looked gnarley.  There is no venting in the living room so I sprayed everywhere with perfume.   Used a paper towel to hold the remote.  Sitting in the desk chairs gave me an uncomfortable feeling that things were biting me.  The rug and furniture was spotted (first room rug spotted too).  They choose patterned textured fabric so spots blend in, but that can't work forever. Everything is run down.  Door finish all worn off, walls all scuffed, everything looks and feels dingy and dirty. Bedroom wardrobe/closet smelled really bad inside, years of foot odor.   Not ironing the pillow cases adds to the dingy feel.  The same goes for the computer room and other interior areas of the facility.   I could have saved money by staying at a less expensive property since there are so many in that area, but thought this was a good value.  It's not a good value if you don't even want to pull the covers over you at night, which is how I slept.  I couldn't enjoy the room, didn't want to use the shower, didn't want to sit on the couch, didn't use the coffee maker, nothing. Touched as little as possible and checked out as soon as possible.  The breakfast was just so so.  Didn't bother to get dinner or drinks at the bar the first night after seeing the filthy room, didn't want to take the risk.  Not a good end to a vacation.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,In need of attention,"As a Hilton Diamond member I have stayed in many Embassy Suites properties and am usually happy with the formula. This hotel's management seems to have burned the book with the (not so) secret formula and struck out on their own. First, I know Hilton is working their way through most of their properties of this age (20ish years old) and refreshing them.Obviously the remodeling crew hasn't made it here yet. Not that anything was broken, per se, but things were just dated. Well, the thermostat had come loose from the wall and the giant holes in the drywall could no longer hold the feeble screws it had previously been attached with, so I guess one thing was broken. Otherwise everything was serviceable, however.My main issue with this property was the staff in general and how they all seemed be to overworked, a bit out of touch, or just downright indifferent to their guests. I will say the front desk staff is exempted from this criticism, since they were attentive and pleasant.Some examples... First, my wife ordered room service at about 7PM (right after we arrived). The woman who brought our order mixed up our food and some other room's order. She was in such a hurry to move on that she didn't even check to make sure everything was OK before leaving. If it hadn't been for the fact that the forgot my wife's soda and the woman had to come back we never would have been able to get things squared away. Then, when the woman returned she swapped the orders out, but everything was cold (because I assume she literally took this order to the other room and brought ours back). Also, in the middle of swapping these orders she was taking calls from other guests. The hotel can't afford to have one person running food while another takes orders down below?Second, and one of the main reasons for booking here rather than the Hampton Inn down the street, was breakfast in the morning. Remember the formula? They threw that out here too. At ANY other Embassy my wife orders cooked to order breakfast (just like the sign says here too) because she likes her french toast well done. The stuff in the warmers is usually barely cooked (her words, not mine) and only a fresh plate will do. The ""chef"" told her french toast is available in the warmers and that is cooked to order. She tried to argue with him, but gave up and ran the already cooked toast through the toaster.I though my experience would be a bit better, but alas, it wasn't. I almost always order a veggie omelette and did so here as well. The veggies were chopped so finely I couldn't tell them apart and the chef used so little egg it was like my veggies were wrapped in rice paper. The kicker was that one the egg had almost finished cooking the guy told me he needed me to get my own plate to put the finished product on. I have NEVER had this happen at ANY other Embassy Suites.One note on the room... I had specifically chosen a non-smoking room when checking in using the app. The room we received smelled as though someone had smoked in it and the staff used some of that smoke away spray to rid the room of the stink. You know that smell that is citrus mixed with day old ashtray?Finally, back to breakfast, the pastries were stale,coffee was burnt and we weren't acknowledged in the dining room at all. After staying at the Hampton Inn down the street for the outbound portion of my trip, I feel like this place was a horrible mistake for my wife and me.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Experience,"The room accommodations were wonderful, standard refrigerator and microwave was above and beyond. The Continental Breakfast was like none I've ever experienced. I'm looking forward to staying with Embassy Suites again on my next trip through Denver Colorado.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel !,"Stayed here at the end of our vacation. Early AM flight the next morning. Very clean and modern hotel. Had to leave too early for breakfast, but I am sure it is just as great as at other ES locations. We turned our rental car in the night before. It took a while for the shuttle to get to the airport to take us to the hotel for the night. The shuttle needs to run more often- especially since the hotel is so close to the airport. No problems with the shuttle in the early AM to the airport. We had made reservations for the first shuttle of the day- which I would recommend for early AM flights.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Early flight stop over!,"Perfect place to stay when you have an early flight!  Great staff and service!  Rooms are beautiful, comfy beds!  Dinner and free happy hour were awesome.  Overnight parking is a plus at no charge.  Will stay here again for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Always my first choice,"Clean, comfortable stay. Room was on the 5th floor, a little noisy during the dinner time. Comfortable bed. Everything I needed before a long day of travel. I'm usually bit of a snob when it come to lodging but I have never been disappointed at any Embassy Suite Location. The nightly reception and the free breakfast buffet and made to order omelets is such a great feature, lots to choices to choose from and the food is really good. This is a great choice when traveling.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Beautiful and Comfortable, wish there were Queen Beds","We stayed at this hotel after a vacation as our flight to Denver was getting in so late.  We didn't want to make the drive home to Colorado Springs that night.  We got a premium 2-room suite which has a Keurig in room which we really enjoyed.  The beds were comfortable but we would really have preferred 2 queen beds instead of doubles, there was plenty of room for Queens.  There was muddy water spots all over the wall just outside the bathroom and the shower caulking was not in good shape.  Other than those two maintenance items, the room was nice, the lobby was beautiful and the breakfast was fantastic.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Super location, friendly staff and great rooms & common areas","Denver's Embassy Suites is located 10 minute drive/hotel shuttle from DIA. The hotel is clean, modern with large check in desk and restaurant/bar on the ground floor. The rooms--actually 2 rooms plus bath with tub are arranged around the open first floor and are accessed by swift clear walled over looking elevators. The room them self are large, airy, clean, comfortable--the bath has a nice tub and complimentary cosmetics. Breakfast is buffet style (oat meal, cereals, rolls, toast, fresh fruit, ham, sausage, potatoes, gravy) supplemented by made to order omelettes and eggs. The food is good, we also ate at the bar one night and the food, drinks, service was great.The shuttle runs every 20 minutes plus there is ample parking; when traveling to Europe for over 4 weeks we stay here, leave the car in the lot where the parking is free for 2 weeks and after 2 weeks incur a minimum fee a day.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Wow great place to stay!,"This stay and accommodations exceed my expectations. When I opened the door to the room I was smiling ear to ear. A roomy suite area and comfortable King size bed. We stayed as long as we could and enjoyed the room. We will definitely be returning when we take other trips. We booked through ""Park Sleep Fly"" which was a great value!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very nice hotel,Everything at this hotel was wonderful. Room was large and we had a view of the mountains. All staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Food was good. First trip to Colorado was a success and we really enjoyed staying at this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice airport hotel with all the Embassy Suite Amenities,"Our check in was easy - the front desk attendant was particularly personable and got us all set with our airport shuttles -1 to return the car that evening, one to get to the airport for our flight. Our shuttles were on time (driver of one drove a bit too fast). The room was nice, clean, comfortable.We enjoyed Happy Hour and dinner but left too early for breakfast.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver IAP Embassy Suites,"This is a great hotel with very friendly people who work hard to make sure you have pleasant stay.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Busy airport hotel,"Busy airport hotel with nice rooms, very comfortable beds, and a great breakfast.  Atrium area can be a little noisy, but biggest issue was parking…I arrived late and parking lot was full; waited on someone to leave but others were parking against curbs or on the street.  Hopefully more parking can be added.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Large, tastefully decorated suite","Large suite, extremely comfortable king bed, with very tasteful furniture.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not bad considering the other hotels in the area.,"This was our second time staying here. Skipped the premium suite this time due to it not being worth the money. We had a nice stay. Our toilet clogged again for the second time but they quickly took care of it. I think the breakfast is one of the best when compared to other hotel breakfasts, and it's free. The evening snacks are always a disappointment. Its usually not much but pub mix and celery. Blah! The restaurant has decent food if you wish to pay. We have stayed at other hotels in the area and they were bad!",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice one night stay before flight,"Our check in was by James who was very efficient and friendly. We had requested a suite on the 7th Top floor during online check in and we were given that exact suite.The hotel appeared recently renovated and quite well maintained. (We did notice the edge of the carpet at the door to our suite showed signs of lifting up.)The suite was spacious and clean. My wife love the lighting in the room and bathroom. Her only suggestion for improvement for the ladies was the provision of a make-up mirror, as the mirrors in both the bathroom vanity and that small vanity table in the bedroom, were a bit far from her without leaning forward 6 to 8 inches.Everything else worked well, and we were able to sleep well.The happy hour drinks were nice, so we decided to stay in the hotel restaurant for dinner. My wife and I shared the barbecue wings and the Ribeye and Shrimp dish. The food was very good with the steak grilled exactly medium as ordered. The serving sizes were also generous. Service was excellent by our server, especially as she was tending to at least six tables at the time. She also organized our ribeye and shrimp dinner divided onto two plates.Breakfast was typical Embassy Suites, not great, and just ok.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Let your vehicle sleep over, while you travel!","Every service was excellent!  The staff cared for us like family! My vehicle was protected, I arrived at the airport, with out having to park and find my way around.  The Embassy van was waiting for us, after our return flight.  Checkout was simple.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This facility far exceeded my expectations!  The facilities were extremely well-maintained and clean.  The rooms were spacious and accommodating. The facility overall was beautiful!  Staff were friendly and supportive of guest needs.  The guest reception was fabulous with a variety of drinks, including alcoholic beverages, and snacks served to guests at no charge.  The restaurant was very good and the service was friendly.  There is an airport shuttle that promptly left as scheduled and was convenient to the airport for a busy traveler.  Internet speeds were good and there were no problems accessing needed websites.  I shall return!  Thanks for a great stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,What a stay!,"I had an amazing two night stay at this beautiful hotel.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,great experience,"Extremely good value and lovely hotel. I would have preferred some more variety in the choices of food for the evening reception but the layered dip was great. We did the sleep,fly and ride because we were going on a trip and would be departing from the airport. They were extremely timely with our transportation and even packed us a breakfast when we asked for one since we would miss breakfast, we left at 4:30 am and our driver was so cheerful !!! We would do it all again in a heartbeat.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel and close to the airport,"We periodically stay at the Embassy even though we live just an hour away.  It's a great place to stay for the convenience when we have a late flight coming in our going out.  The staff is great, the manager's reception is great and the food is especially good for a hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver Embassy,"The Embassy Suite in Denver is a nice hotel, very clean, great staff and breakfast.  We got in late and appreciated that they had shuttle service until 12:30am. When you're tired the last thing you want to arrange is a taxi or rental car.  We would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"""Almost as classy as Wooley's with certain advantages""","I've stayed at many hotels near DEN and some time ago I wrote about Wooley's nearby: "" Like Embassy Suites bur classier"".I had not stayed at Embassy Suites in a long time., and I was pleasantly surprised this time .It was very clean, had everything to offer that Wooley's had ( Happy Hour drinks and snacks, custom made breakfast) with the advantage of a suite instead of a room, and for a fraction of the price. A number of times, being three of us, we had to get 2 rooms at Wooley's, Here, we could have stayed in 1 suite with 3 beds.You can even get your own ice down the hall without having to have room service. I've also stayed at Red Lion, Country Inn and Best Western near DEN, on the way to the hills, and this time, for almost the same price, we got a much better value.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent location- Good stay,This hotel is typical of what I expect to find in an Embassy Suites. Rooms and the hotel were clean and well kept. Breakfast was excellent; plenty to choose from for me. I did like that there were plenty of extra towels in the room. Happy hour had a variety of snacks to choose from- that's better than some other Embassy Suites I've stayed in.  I loved the location- just a few minutes from the airport. There are at least 4 restaurants within walking distance. I know 2 of them are good. I'm sure I'll be back!,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Decent Hotel, But Average for the Brand","There's nothing super wrong with this hotel. But it just wasn't ""GREAT""! It's been updated in the last 5 years, the rooms are spacious as you would expect and the room was clean. But I expect a little more from this brand at this point, especially since I've stayed at several newer Embassy Suites this year - so my expectations are higher than they used to be. The lobby was super busy when I arrive and the front desk staff seemed overwhelmed. And the airport shuttle wasn't super timely, you have to be on their schedule which they don't communicate the timeline well until after you arrive at the hotel. It would have been nice if they would have told me when I called that it was on a set schedule.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay!,"Everything was great!  Starting with the remote check-in, then attending the manager's reception with complimentary drinks, then finding the suite was exceptional, then dinner, super comfortable beds, two TV's.....all great!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great staff and service,"This is a great location near the airport with comfortable beds, but be warned, it can be noisy. The shuttle driver in particular, provided great service and was very friendly. I would stay here again when flying in late or flying out early.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good value with airport shuttle,"Before booking this hotel, I checked prices in the area for hotels that offered free airport shuttle service. To my surprise, the Embassy Suites had the best AAA rates for the time I was traveling.The free breakfast is much better than the typical hotel continental breakfasts. A chef will cook a custom omelette while you wait. There are a variety of hot and cold dishes and drinks, and all were good quality.The rooms are spacious and clean, with free wi-fi and impressive large flat-screen tvs in the bedroom and living areas. I took off one star for the room service leftovers (not ours) that sat outside our door all day, and the parking lot which can fill up. Otherwise, this was a great stay for the money.",4

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Missed Opportunity,"Stayed September 11, departed Sep. 12.  Arrived to the room around 5pm and before I could sit down, my wife noticed blood stains on the comforter.  I called downstairs to inform the front desk and they offered me to have my room serviced or to change rooms, naturally I switched to a different room.  For the inconvenience, I was offered the premium vending machine service  (a $10 value) with my room switch.  However, none of the items we wanted were working or stocked (water and granola bars).  I called downstairs again informing them of this failure and asked if I could just pick up those items when we go out for dinner.  They obliged.When returning from dinner, I noticed wet mold above the bathroom door, peeling paint in the bedroom, and unplugged lamps.  These are easy things for a housekeeper to check if they're being monitored properly.  At this point, I just stayed in the room and slept since we had an early flight out in the morning.  At checkout, the attendant just asked ""checking out""?  Yep, I am...nothing about how was your stay or did we fix your recent challenge?... extremely disappointed in the service and cleanliness of this hotel.  Would have expected better from this brand.  Never spoke or offered to speak to a manager.Kudos to the front desk associate (who is a cowboys fan) who tried her best to help us out and was very friendly.  Keep up the hard work!",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Good location, clean, quiet, great rooms, cooked to order free breakfast",We like the Embassy two room suites and the Denver - International Airport Hotel is the best Embassy Suites at which we have stayed.

We stayed on a Saturday night and although the parking lot was full, we were still able to find a place to park with their overflow area and parallel parking options.  The hotel was very quiet for a Saturday night!  The breakfast is complete with a variety of hot foods, cereals, pastries, fruits and even made to order items such as pancakes and omelets!  If you are looking for a sizeable, nice and clean hotel close to the airport, this is a great choice!  Our only regret was that we didn't have more time to enjoy everything the Embassy had to offer!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Starting Point of a Great Adventure,We chose this hotel because of its closeness tot the airport.

The breakfast is fine, as is the reception in the bar.  This could be an exceptional property with a little more TLC.  I got stuck in the elevator--it went to my floor, the doors wouldn't open, and the alarm went off.  I was in there close to ten minutes, then the elevator returned to the ground floor.  I reported the problem.  The response?  ""Oh, yeah--that's happened to me a few times.  They're working on it.""",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Fly in drink soooo bad,"We stayed here and I will just have to say that it should not bear the embassy name.  My daughter had a Shirley temple At happy hour and it had a huge black fly in it, when I brought it to the bartender, he said see the manager, which I did, and she sent me off faster than the bartender.  The chairs had sagging cloth under them, the furniture came from a discount store, soooo disappointing for the price we paid.  Never again, and we have stayed at so many embassy suites, this one should be sold fast to preserve the reputation of the embassy.",1

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Close to the airport, But not really nice place","I booked one night an executive suite, it give me the impression that the hotel has executive floor and lodge, when I check in, and asked the front desk, where is the club, and he told me is located second floor between two rooms, they open from 5-7, so I thought it will be great after I clean up. First when I entering the room, there was a bad odor, smell so unpleasant. the décor is out dated.  then after 5:00, I went to look for the lodge, there was no where to be found, so I went to the front desk and they told me there is no lodge and they have open cocktail from 5:30 - 7, so I took a walk and came back, there was hardly any so called appetizer served during cocktail, since I don't drink, I just went back. By the way, since I am a diamond member, they did give me a goody bag with two can of soda, a bag of chip and a chocolate bar",2

Nice quiet location. Breakfast was fine the usual good quality fare with a cooked to order breakfast. There are a couple of restaurants on the area and 7/11. We we due to spend the day relaxing in the pool and hot tube but it was disgusting dirty, I found a clump of hair in the pool, there was already growing on the steps, it was just not being maintained correctly. Overall this is a conveniently situated airport hotel with friendly staff but it could be cleaner. They kindly offered to pick us up from the hire car lot but forgot to do so, Avis assisted with a call to the hotel or we might still be waiting, the driver did apologise. Washing and drivers are free to use and a coke from the drinks machine was only 50c.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Outstanding Clean Hotel,"Family Vacation and Anniversary.  This hotel was phenomenal in every way except one.  They had the Coke fountain drink machine in the breakfast and during cocktail hour but it only let you get ice and water from it.  The soda part only taunted us...other embassy's let us have soda any times it was open.  The hotel was clean and quiet.  Pool was nice.  The premium room was fun as we got complimentary access to the vending machines.  My kids thought that part was a dream come true.  Anyway, excellent place and we would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient and clean,Not a bad stop right off the highway.  Had a business meeting in onsite with good accommodations.  One negative was the shuttle service from the airport.  Driver laughed when I tried waving him down.  30$ cab ride.  Decent happy hour and poor food...but plenty of other options around.  Great size rooms.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Sleep and park,"Used this hotel to stay near the airport the night before we left for vacation.Room was very comfortable and clean. Loved how spacious it was.The complimentary appetizers and cocktail hour was very relaxing and the bartender was quick and efficient.The next morning we stopped in the dining area for cooked to order omelettes and our choice of breakfast foods.We used their shuttle to and from the hotel. The trip there was hot and stuffy, the ac was broken, and the dash showed numerous issues such as low tire pressure and check oil lights. The young man who dropped us off directed us a little off course to check in to our flight.When we returned we only waited about 20 minutes for our shuttle. The ride back to our vehicle was without incident.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice suite. Near airport.,"Our king bed suite was what you would expect for the price (which is on the high side of mid-range).  The lobby was nice and the staff polite.  The bed was very comfortable and my wife is picky on that.We stayed here for one night at the end of our travels before dropping off a rental car and catching a morning flight.  We left too early for breakfast and didn't use the shuttle so we don't have an opinion on that.  Quiet, clean, safe and comfortable.  The separate fee for wifi is not something I'm a fan of but it was noted so just remember that if it matters to you.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay as always,We love staying with embassy suites DIA. the staff and amenities are great. The evening reception is a great way to wind down and breakfast is always tasty and filling. The staff at this location is accommodating and friendly.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Dr.,I really enjoyed my stay here would recommend it to family and friends. The location and access to thing around you were all with in traveling distant. Easy to travel to and from the hotel to down town and the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A good choice for a location near the airport.,"The hotel was nice and a step above the average.  The entrance and lobby were impressive and the rooms were clean and spacious.  The restaurant was pricey and the food was average, fortunately there were other food choices close by.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Overpriced, but safe and friendly","We booked 3 rooms for a trip for the benefit of being able to park cars for several days and have a shuttle to the airport. All DIA hotel rooms are high, but almost three hundo is a little ridiculous. Staff was friendly, but the building and rooms really did not seem as nice or spacious as other Embassy Suites I have stayed in at a much lower price. Paid for the premium suite for free drinks and snacks, which were in a vending machine, that was obviously rarely stocked. Got a few things, but really not worth the upgrade. Pool was nice, the kids enjoyed it. Everyone else loved Happy hour, but that is standard at all Embassy Suites. Overall, I'd be happy as clam if the rooms were cheaper, but for that price next time I will look elsewhere.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Embassy Suites, Denver Airport",Our suite was a one bedroom suite with two huge flat screen TVs.  All the furniture was comfortable as was the bed.  Another couple from Denver had come to our room for a visit and we were all so much more comfortable than if we had been in a regular hotel room. The room has a very nice bar also.  The free breakfast is the best I have ever had in all the different hotel chains we have stayed in.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Outstanding accommodations, poor breakfast.","Outstanding room. Can park and ride to airport. Big plus. Great program. Breakfast was less than expected. Have had better at a Hampton. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Front desk was very friendly and helpful.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Business Meeting,"The hotel is a short distance from Denver International Airport. The shuttles cycle about every 20 minutes. The shuttle picks up from door 512 west, island three.Rooms are very well keep. It has a full service bar and dining in the atrium. There are a handful of restaurants within walking distance. Overall the staff was extremely helpful and wifi was fast.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Very nice all suite property, wasn't too impressed with restaurant or with shuttle",The property was very nice and had a lot of amenities seeing as though it was all suites.  I decided to use the free shuttle to the hotel...it was running behind so I had to wait an hour for it from the airport and then it made stops to a lot of the rental car places so I was on shuttle for an additional 30 minutes.I had dinner at the restaurant right at the hotel.  The meal was just okay.  The included breakfast the next morning was very good.  All staff members were very nice.  May or may not stay again if I am back in the area.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Embassy Suites, of course it was great!","This motel was very convenient to the airport.  The room was nice, with the bathroom located between the bedroom and the living room area.  There were 4 adults staying in the room, so it is nicer if the bathroom isn't in the bedroom.  We arrived too late in the evening to enjoy the reception, but breakfast was a nice mix of the hot and cold, along with cooked to order omelettes.    The decor in the breakfast area was different, with a mining theme.  Very nice!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great room and location but don't expect to eat here,"Great location but as it is an airport hotel and advertises a restaurant and room service from morning till night to accommodate travelers, one would expect that you wouldn't have to eat in the airport before coming to the hotel. Don't think that--service is VERY poor. Expect to wait for long periods just to be told they have no cook. Even when they have a cook you cannot get waited on. Best thing is the shuttle driver--friendliest of all staff.  If you check out in the wee hours of the morning--don't expect any recognition you were even there. Too busy on the phone with a personal call. Rooms are noisy when kids above you are running and jumping.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Just awful - 4 rooms later..... Smoking, dirty, broken rooms. ","I checked in online to a room located away from elevators and off main hallway on the 7th floor. We are staying overnight on our way to airport.  This is 100 percent non smoking hotel as most Hiltons are.  I am Hilton gold.   The smell of smoke bowled us over as we opened the first room. I mean really bad - like someone has just put out a cigarette.  We were given a second floor room but it was not mentioned that it was handicapped accessible.   Usually not a problem, but they should I from.  The curtains do not close properly in the living room and it stays very bright- not to mention privacy. With the glass to the atrium. We have s double room so we could spread out.  I told the manager that it would be OK to have a king if it's all that's left.   He moved us to the 5th floor.  The room was at the end.  It was hit when we walked in.  The the raster did not even register an light or electrical current at all.  There was urine on the toilet seat and a big hair all on the kitchenette floor.  There was also what looked like Koolaide stains all over the floor.  After going back to the lobby we were given another room on 5.  We opened the door to once again be overwhelmed by cigarette smoke.  Two of us are highly allergic and the acid in the air burned our noses.  On only choice was to go back to the ADA room with the broken curtain.  We have chairs proper but the light is still very strong. I love Hilton - but will never stay at this embassy suites again.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very Helpful Staff,The hotel was up to Embassy Suites standards. The staff at the desk were very helpful. I was in town for one night and wanted to get downtown. The light rail goes all the way to the airport now. The desk agent let me know I could take the shuttle to the airport to catch the light rail downtown and then catch the shuttle from the airport back to the hotel. He even made sure I knew what time the last shuttle picked up from the airport so I could plan my night accordingly. Worked out really well!  The next day they were equally helpful when my flight was cancelled and I needed to extend my stay. I'd definately stay here again!,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice place to sleep waiting for the plane trip tomorrow,"We needed to stay somewhere until our flight the next day. Embassy Suites has always been nice when traveling with the grandchild because she can have the front room fold-out couch to herself. Clean, very nice bed, nice furniture, convenient table in the front room, quiet. Breakfast has ""cooked to order omelets"" but access to most items is not as much random as ""line up.""",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not of Hilton Quality,"Of course, one stays here because of the proximity to the airport, and the shuttle service makes it convenient. The beds are comfortable and the fridge and microwave are a plus, but the carpet is dirty, our sink was running very slowly, and it truly was the worst quality of breakfast foods I have ever experienced at a Hilton property.  The staff at the front desk and our morning shuttle driver, however, were professional and good natured.  Not sure we would make this choice again, even as Hilton Honors members.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenience,The hotel is located right at the airport and is convenient to the freeways.  Complimentary happy hour and breakfast is very appreciated and welcomed. Staff is pleasant and ready to service your needs.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites Denver Airport,"Great hotel, excellent service, just what I expect from Embassy Suites.  The rooms were modern and very clean.  Internet service was OK, works better in the interior room of the 2 bedroom suite than the outer room which is typical of Embassy Suites.  Airport Shuttle service was on time and very convenient.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Business or Pleasure,Upper level of quality and comfort. Recommended for overall experience. The room was divided into sleeping area and had a living room. King bed but only one so not suitable for kids. Pricing was decent for the quality of service and facilities.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Consistantly Good!,"I travel to Denver for business near the airport frequently and have found the Embassy Suites off of Tower road to be consistently reliable. If you have a need to stay overnight near the airport, I would recommend this property. I have been coming to this hotel for the last few years and they just completed a nice room renovation with fresh carpet, paint and furnishings. Upon check-in, Hilton Honors members used to get a $10 coupon that could be used in the hotel restaurant, but now they only give out a 5% off your meal coupon that really doesn't amount to much so I am not sure why they bother with it? Bring back the $10 off coupons please! I wish that the room windows opened more than 4 inches so that you could get some fresh outside air. The room A/C units are very loud and ear plugs are required for sleep.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not what you pay for!,"Noisy but very clean and neat hotel, window opens 4 inches and there's no screen, so mosquitos fly right in. For people that don't like to use AC, that's a problem. Also, checkout was very slow, had to stand in line like in a cheap hotel. The worst was the breakfast. Again, same fare offered at cheap hotels, only more of it. The potatoes looked like they'd been refried and reheated 10 times, tired eggs, inedible French toast, yuck. We paid a lot of money to stay at that hotel and had to go elsewhere for breakfast. Shame on you.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Place to Stay Close to Denver Airport,"We stayed here 1 night prior to an early AM flight.  Parking was easy and free.  The check-in / check-out process was quick and friendly.  Our room was spacious, nicely decorated, clean and quiet.  The evening reception provided complimentary drinks and munchies. Dinner from the on-site restaurant was tasty.  After returning our rental car (the night before our flight) we used the airport shuttle for our 6am flight - it was on time and got us to the airport in 10 minutes.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Best in Denver,"The room was impeccable and the staff were overly helpful. The bed was comfortable with great temp control in the room. Unable to hear hall noise or road noise, so I got  agree nights sleep! The free breakfast was the best by far, with made to order omelets. Nice happy hour with snacks and drinks. The shuttle was utilized twice during our stay and they were efficient and thorough. Business center with 2 computers. Indoor pool, gym and outdoor hot tub. Complimentary laundry facilities with 2 washers and 2 dryers.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Place to Stay,"Everything was excellent.  Spotlessly clean room, helpful and friendly staff, great hospitality.  Incredible value and very comfortable.  The shuttle was waiting as I left baggage claim and the hotel is very convenient to the airport.  The complimentary breakfast is generous and skillfully prepared.  Great selection and variety.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Shuttle and appearance,"If you want to receive prompt pick up from the airport and be welcomed to a friendly atmosphere, this is not the hotel.  I did not use the shuttle going back,  I could not recommend this hotel to business professionals",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy stay,Was a really nice hotel.  Loved the free happy hour and the food was excellent.  I stayed in the premium suiite and was able to acess free candy and sodas.  The reception area was very nice and the people that worked there were exceptional.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice place and area,We enjoyed the visit. Nice location and a good area to take a morning and evening walk. Complimentary Breakfast is a favorite. I enjoy having a good Omelette in the morning. Complimentary evening drinks and snacks are very appreciated.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Clean and Courteous,First time stay at a Park & Fly.  Staff was extremely courteous and helpful.  Shuttle driver was excellent.  Accommodations were First Class (especially complementary breakfast).  Pricing was reasonable.  Would stay again in a heartbeat,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not impressed,Elevator broke during stay thank God we weren't in there.  People told the front desk that the doors were acting up and they ingored them and then it got stuck.  I would of been SO mad if my daughter or myself got stuck on there  Also had early flight hence the reason we stayed next to the airport.  It was too.early for breakfast but I couldny even get a cup of decaf bc they had 3 container of regular coffee .....SMH !  Not worth the cost honestly!  Pro.....he room WAS very nice !,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Recent stay at Embassy Suites in Denver,Beautiful facility. The service was excellent. Never disappointed with Embassy Suites. The quality and expectations are always consistent no matter where I've stayed. Enjoy the complimentary breakfasts.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,UnFriendly Staff,"Entire staff seemed like they were at work instead of there insuring your stay was relaxing.  Fridge was turned off and left a pool of water when opened, vending machine upgrade wasn't fill timely, sink didn't drain, and stool was lose.  Not good",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Quick one nite stay,"We were only there about 16 hours but in that time, it was a nice place to stay.  Got there just in time for ""happy hour"" and the food that was offered was OK.  A bit heavy - healthy options would be nice.Front desk staff and van driver very helpful.  Bartender helpful as well with ordering our dinner in.  Breakfast was OK - have had better at other Embassy Suites.  There was a wait staff person who was very surly - she did not want to be there and made sure everyone was aware that she wasn't happy.  If you asked her a question - it was a short, clipped answer.Our room(s) were an issue - our first one had a smell soooooo bad that it hit you the minute  you opened the door.  How housekeeping good possible leave the room smelling like this is beyond understanding.  Front desk was great and moved us right away.  Second room was fine until I went to take a shower and discovered that the air vent in the bathroom was LOADED with dirt and dust!!  Must have been 2 inches thick.  It was late and we didn't want to fool around with a third room so I cleaned the vent the best I could (saved the ""goodies"" for the morning).  First thing in the morning I took the dirty washcloth to the front desk - they apologized and took the cost of our dinner off the bill.  I was informed that they would be meeting with housekeeping about the matter.  Really nothing more could be done.  I was also a bit disappointed in the fact that our dinner trays were still outside our room the next morning - and still there when we left.  Housekeeping certainly needs some improvement in some areas.One last comment - our van driver in the morning was OK - but not very helpful when you get to the airport.  He asked everyone what airline they were on but was very confusing when trying to decide if it was the place to get off.  We were flying American and he had us get off at the first stop which was not really near American.Would stay again - but would be watchful",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,On point,"When traveling I prefer Embassy Suites whenever available.  The brand is consistent and reliable.  Business traveling ensures a usable workspace, wifi, restaurant and airport shuttle.  Traveling with the family is easier with Embassy for the rooms, amenities and breakfast.  This location is no exception.  Very clean and comfortable with accommodating staff at every turn.  Rooms are quiet and well appointed.  Always a good value if you make the most of what the hotels has to offer.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver,Convenient to airport. Great breakfast and room was very comfortable. Air conditioning was perfect which sometimes is not the case at some hotels. Dinner service was good though the meal was not gourmet.  Staff was very helpful and courteous. I would recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"With better service, would be 4 or 5 star","In the hotel business, people can make the experience either great or not so great.  In this case, one employee took an otherwise good stay and made it lousy.  First, the good:  location is very convenient to Denver International.  Tower Road has a number of decent restaurants, shopping is nearby, and access to Denver (outside of rush hour) is a breeze.  The hotel seems smaller than most Embassy Suites, but has the same Atrium set-up which, though good to look at, results in an awful lot of amplified noise.  The rooms are comfortable, the best feature definitely being the separate bedroom that eliminates most of the outside noise.  Bathroom is fine, bed comfortable, televisions decent.  The evening social seemed generous on the drink side, though very basic on the food. (Tip your bartender, people - they deserve it.) As for breakfast - the selection seemed pared down from most Embassy Suites, and the guy working the Omelet station was about as customer-service focused as an ant. He basically just ignored me, leaving me to wonder if I did something to piss him off or if he perhaps didn't speak English and was waiting for the ""real"" chef to come back from a break. No need to go into further detail - suffice too say that either he's in the wrong line of business or he was having a really bad day.Advice to management: pay closer attention to your front line service staff.  They are the difference between a guest coming back or not.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great room,The separate suite was awesome....The customer service was great.... The shuttle service to and from the airport was timely and efficient...the availability of the shuttle was convenient....being able to leave my car there while I traveled was a bonus,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,The Best,"We spent  7 days in Colorado at another hotel and had to leave and was blessed to get an Embassy Suite room.   By far the best experience for the short amount of time we were there.  The room was large, clean and modern.  We loved it.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Unexpected stay,"Due to a weather-related airline delay, I found myself having to spend the night in Chicago.  A call to the travel agent had me rebooked on a flight to Denver the next morning and a room at this hotel convenient to O'Hare.  The staff was welcoming (the warm cookie was a plus) and I was quickly settled in my nicely appointed room.  The shower was exquisite and I thoroughly enjoyed my brief stay at this property.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver,"Easy access to airport and highway. Accomodations were excellent, staff friendly and helpful. Spacious room to accomodate 4 adults. Business center easily accessable. Would recomend to family, friends an business associates.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Colorado wedding,Returning from a wedding in Steamboat and wanted a hotel near the Denver airport the night before our flight.  Happy to find an Embassy Suites so conveniently located.  The complimentary evening reception and breakfast are added benefits.  Half-hourly shuttle service is available to/from airport (15 min.)  Wish we could have stayed longer!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Loud HVAC,"I had a poor experience at the Embassy Suites. I arrived at 11:30 pm and all of the parking spaces were taken so I wound up having to park in a grassy lot next to the property. When i checked in to my room, the tempwerature was 86 degrees. I was not happy that the room was hot , the ac was off and I needed to go to sleep. However, when I turned on the ac, the unit rumbled with a loud noise. I immediately packed up mynstuff and went to the front desk to request a different room. ""Sorry, we are sold out and no other option at midnight! I returned to the hot and stuffy room and tried to sleep with the noise. After an hour, i had to turn it off. I did not sleep that night and cancelled my stay for the second night. Once again, the front-desk was indifferent to my situation and i was very disappointed that they were not empowered to help a diamond member get a good night's sleep. A one star review  is generous for my experience.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice stay,"I was Greeted by shuttle driver with an ice cold water, everything continued to be good!  I had an easy check in and out.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  I ate at the onsite resturant and the burger was delicious.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Barren Location, Good hotel","Get your dinner before you come here. There are very few restaurants around and none that I would call healthy. This is located in a literally hotel parking lot with at least 20 other hotels all neighbors and nothing else in sight.  It is an easy drive to the airport.Evening reception has nothing gluten-free, nothing and the bar menu is lacking choices too. Staff is nice. Rooms are clean with a giant TV in the living room area. Fairly new or updated.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Vacation ,Close to Denver airport has shuttle service . Very nice large suite rooms two tv's would be great for business meetings or a convention . Free happy hour . Food is available nice bar . Indoor pool. Meeting rooms huge atrium bar looks like a mine works . Plenty of free parking .,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Do not book the premium suites!,"The hotel is simply average. It's snacks in the evening aren't worth bothering with.  It is below average compared to other Embassy Suites. Our toilet had issues on the first day there. Our biggest complaint was that we paid for the premium suites but the snacks were always sold out. Could never get a simple bottle of water. Called the front desk but they would not restock. We asked for our money back for the remaining days we stayed but they would not work with us at all. It was a huge disappointment! With the way we were treated , we would not stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Place to stay,"This hotel offered amazing cleanliness, great location close to airport and a wonderful overall experience. My family would definitely stay at this hotel and other Embassy Suites. We have stayed at 2 other Embassy Suites in the past year and have always been extremely satisfied.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel for Denver Airport,We stayed here the night before flying out on a family vacation. We were able to park our car for the week and take the shuttle to the airport. The staff was fantastic. This will always be our DIA hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Outstanding Value,"We stayed for one night after flying into Denver.  The hotel allowed us to keep our car in their lot for 4 days prior to our stay for no charge.  The complimentary breakfast offering was one of the best I have ever enjoyed.  The room was spacious, clean and relatively inexpensive.  Staff was friendly and well trained.  I will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Late Night/Early Morning Arrival - Excellent Experince,Embassy Suites is a great chain.  This location follows suit.  We arrived at 3:00 AM exhausted. We indicated in the notes late night/ early morning arrival.  We used the app to checkin.  Our room keys were waiting at the front desk and the room was close and convenient.  They were even able to honor our late check out request.  We stay at the Embassy Suites for breakfast and room quality.   The breakfast was amazing and well worth getting up for. This location really does a good job of making the guest feel comfortable and cared for.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Amazing staff and service,"What a great place. We did not stay here, but instead used the long term parking for our trip. Eventho we were not guests, the front desk staff treated us like VIP's. The shuttle driver was also great and very helpful. Way to go reception!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,It's just okay!  ,"We stayed here for the Denver Shootout Lacrosse tournment.  There is nothing around this hotel, but the airport.  I wouldn't stay here again unless I was flying out the next day.  The room had everything you need, but the hotel is outdated.  The indoor pool was cold and they charge you $14.95 for wifi per day. We had to park in the street two nights of our stay because the lot was full.  The perks was the staff was very helpful and friendly, the breakfast was delicious, and the free drinks during happy hour.  I think it needs remodeled, valet parking, and free wifi for the rates we paid.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Happy Hour Good, Breakfast averate","Good room and staff. Excellent happy hour but breakfast experience not up to scratch. Was too long of a line and although it said it had made to order omelettes, the cook just wasn't there. Too bad as the rest of the breakfast was good but now complete",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel!,"We booked this hotel for a nights stay before our early morning fight out and were very pleased. The hotel is beautiful and close to DIA. They provided a shuttle service that was very prompt leaving to DIA. The shuttle from DIA back to the hotel  did have a little bit of a wait, but nothing to horrible (about 15 minutes). Overall we were very pleased with our stay and will definitely book here again when he need a park, stay, fly package!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good choice,"We were very pleased with our stay. Easy reservation, pleasant, competent staff, nice room...we arrived in the evening and went down to the bar for a glass of wine. We really appreciated to bartenders friendly attitude.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good,Good hotel. Very busy. Park and fly was convenient but there were hardly any spaces to park in for it!  Hilton Honors wasn't great here as there was no mention of us as a Gold Member or any benefits of being one. Good restaurant and nice staff. Just needs some tweaks,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice room with view of rockies,I was stuck overnight at denver airport and stayed at the hotel.  The room was nice and the furnishings were clean.  Hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  I had like an 80 inch tv in my room which was cool even if i didn't use it.  Restaurant was adequate breakfast was pretty good kinda a country feel.  All in all i woukd suggest this hotel if in the area.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Never again!,"Stayed for one night due to close location to airport. Restaurant was over priced, service incredibly slow and the airport shuttle never showed up to get our family after a red eye flight back home. When we called, the front desk said to catch a cab back and they'll pay us back.  Nobody really knew where the shuttle was at. We had waited an hour at that point. Will never stay again!",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight stay,"Shuttle picked us up at the airport, 10-15 minutes to the hotel, Quick check in and they signed me up for their rewards program. Pool stay open till 10pm, so I was able to enjoy the pool. Rooms were very nice. Keurig coffee machine in the room, couldn't get it to work.Free full breakfast in morning and shuttle back to DIA. One thing though is the pillow where kind of flat and two was too many. Would recommend the hotel to my clients.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight for morning flight,Nice hotel.  Did not like at food at complimentary reception. Poor choices... Thrown together .  Breakfast was okay...not especially appealing.  Wine was good!  We ordered light dinner from menu & it was okay.  Nice to not have to go anywhere after driving all day.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Didn't feel welcome attending meeting there,First let me say that I didn't actually stay in the hotel so I am not writing the hotel as a 3. From what I could see the hotel itself was a typical Embassy Suites and I'm sure the rooms were fine. My company was hosting a meeting there with about 30 people and I showed up in the morning and many of the people who had stayed at the hotel we're gathered having breakfast. I had already had breakfast at my hotel but I thought I'd grab a cup of coffee and join my colleagues. I was approached by staff and told that I would need to pay for the buffet and they didn't think that I was a guest there. Their tone was very accusatory and I was a little bit offended. However I told them I'd be happy to pay for my coffee and that I had already eaten.  They brought me a bill for the coffee which was $2.97. I put a $10 bill inside and they took the bill away and never returned. When I asked what had happened they told me that they thought that I was leaving the remainder as a tip. I had to actually tell her that I was not interested in a $10 cup of coffee and that I would appreciate my change. I left a dollar tip and went on my way. I'm not usually a complainer or bad reviewer because I'm upset but the general tone of the meeting staff and wait staff made me feel like I was not welcome and it was a little absurd to expect me to tip $7 for a $3 cup of coffee. I would suggest that the manager discuss with the staff how they would like to handle this type of thing in the future and make sure that people that are there for a meeting and aren't staying at the hotel are treated as well as they would treat their Hotel guests.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay place!,"I really like this motel, from the staff to the amenities, and would highly recommend it.  They worked with me to solve whatever I needed and I appreciated that.  The closeness to the airport and the shuttle service was quite good.  Also, they have parking for a very reasonable fee if one wants to leave their vehicle there.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Hotel From Hell!!!,We spent 4 days there as a treat to my husband who was going to start radiation for a form of cancer. I am a Gold Club member and we usually stay at Embassy Suites. We were moved to a different room everyday. The nightly reception was of very poor quality. Most guests did not know what the chef served when he served hummus. The staff had no idea where different tourist areas were.We had to send my husbands steak back 3 times because it was improperly cooked. The food in general was mediocre. Customer service was nonexistent. The only high light was a desk clerk named John who was wonderful. If you need to stay near the airport their are plenty of nice places...don't stay here.We are now in Irving Texas where my husband is under going treatment and we are staying at a Marriott.Just one more after thought. We never had to sign anything nor did they give us copies of their bills. So we are disputing charges. Normally being a seasoned accountant I would have asked but I was worried about my husband. The hotel has been calling me twice a day when I have been in the treatment center where I have no cell reception.They know where I am. This shows you how the lack of compassion and humanity this hotel has.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy suites Denver Airport,Great experience.  Very big and nice rooms.  Close to the airport and car rental return. We have stayed here before and it was the same good experience. It is nice to not have to worry about getting something to eat before you run to the airport in the morning.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver Airport Embassy Suites,"Very good choice when flying in and out of Denver. The hotel was especially good as we were returning from an overseas trip. The suite was exceptionally quiet and roomy. Restaurant on premises was also a plus for our jet lagged selves. As usual, breakfast was excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Family Vacation,I love Embassy Suites.  They know how to make people happy.  They feed you in the morning and then give you something to look forward to in the evening.  I was verey happy with my stay in Denver.  The room I was in was about due to be remodeled but other than that everything met or exceeded my expectations.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Horrible experience on second night...,"I had the same poor customer service as previous guest. Loud whistling noise woke me up and prevented sleep. Gentleman at the front desk is very unprofessional and seems totally uninterested in solving the issue. I am unable to sleep in the room, they were unable/unwilling to switch rooms for me and they told me maintenance would be right up. After waiting for 20 minutes I call down and I am put on hold. After 5 minutes of hold I hang up and call back and Im told that maintenance is doing something chemical to the pool and would be up when they were done. After 40 minutes of waiting I went downstairs to the pool are and no one was servicing the pool. I call down to the front desk to find out what is going on and someone else answers, puts me on hold to check, then tells me that maintenance has left...",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Horrid,Quick overnight stop on our way home from a wonderful family summer vacation to Vail.  Catching a Rockies game before taking a flight early in the morning.   My husband is a frequent user if Hilton properties for business and chose this hotel for convenience to airport and his experience at other embassy suite locations.  Major disappointment.   Was upgraded to a nicer room due to his status but what we found is anything but nice.  Old food still sits out in front of our door and sticks.  8 year old son went to use bathroom as soon as we walked in to find urine still in toilet.  We called housekeeping immediately.  Supervisor came up.  Told her about it and she wiped down the toilet again.  That is all.  And said anything else?   That is all within 5 minutes of us being in room.  She leaves I go into restroom to inspect again and found a massive amount of hair...massive not just a little.  Huge globs of long black hairs.  We are all blondes.  Old food under furniture.  Obviously the room was not cleaned to the standard it should be.  Housekeeping in room now re-cleaning room and if I did not tell them to do floors again too they wouldn't have probably.  Supervisor apologized but I would have been mortified and overly apologetic if I were her. Complete disappointment.  Cleanliness should be any hotels #1 priority.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Best hotel to stay at when DIA is a priority,"The best hotel in the area near DIA if you fly in late or have an early morning flight.  Staff very responsive.  Bartenders are great!  Room clean.  When I stayed there, they were in the process of renovation.  Nice to see a hotel property being proactive rather than reactive when it comes to renovations!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Our non-smoking room smelled like it was smoked in!,"We needed a comfortable room close to the airport where we could park while on vacation. Once we were in our room it smelled like a ""smoking"" room instead of a ""non-smoking"" room. We were also give a time for the shuttle the next morning and were not instructed we must arrive 10 minutes before. Since we missed our shuttle. We were told there was only one seat on the next shuttle. So, we owned that we were not both there 10 minutes early and the shuttle left without us. It just was not very encouraging how negative and demeaning the person at the front desk spoke to us. We quickly drove to a  close parking lot so we would not miss our flight",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent stay,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay. we left our car while we flew from DIA and stayed in the hotel once we returned. the staff was extremely friendly the breakfast was wonderful. our room was excellent with premium coffees, very comfortable bed,and a very large TV in the living room. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great value and quality,Great hotel experience. The suite is so much more than a mere hotel room. Creates a very comfortable feeling transitioning from home. TV's were first rate. Food was outstanding and that's got to be one of the very best complementary breakfasts I've ever had!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Why Denver International Airport Embassy Suites,"They picked us up at the Rental Car center. The room was large, clean and quiet we honestly never heard a plane all night! After a good night sleep, in a comfortable bed, the hotel shuttle took us to the airport at 4am to catch our flight. Great service!!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Too loud, not clean","Thin windows, loud guests in hall, guests in hot tub past midnight being loud, rooms not clean, premium suite upgrade perks such as 24 hour vending machine access not true, code stopped working by 10pm, could not access internet, NO parking, staff does not ensure a peaceful and quiet. THIS particular Embassy Suites is not a good one!",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Relaxing time in Denver,"At the end of our vacation in Colorado, we spent our last night at the Embassy Suites near Denver International Airport due to an early departure the next morning.  We have had wonderful experiences with Embassy Suites over my business and family travel for over 20 years.  This facility was very neat, clean and accommodating.  We thoroughly enjoyed or stay!  Great Job!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good stay,Great location for airport travel.  We used the park and fly option for one vehicle and global parking for a second.  The evening reception was nice.  The only issue we had was the pool was cold and so was the hot tub.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Premium? not really,"Disappointed in the premium upgrade. Room was dirty, floor had old dried up food. Premium ""refreshments"" was just a vending maching full of junk food. Evening reception was nice, but mostly junk food.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Upgraded since last time I stayed here...very nice!,"The hotel has been updated since last time I stayed here.  Rooms are typical Embassy Suites style, but loved the addition of the large flat-screen TV in the living area!  Breakfast is also better than last time.  I didn't get to any of the receptions, so not sure how those are now.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Place to stay,"I've stayed at this Hotel many times and they have never disappointed me. Staff is always Great, rooms are clean, bar is awesome and the food is good! If you do have any problems during your stay they are quick to correct the problem.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good Place To Stay by DIA,Can't beat the location and pricing for this hotel just 5 minutes from DIA.  Rooms are a bit Spartan in furnishing/decorating.  Bed was okay for sleep. Great staff at the breakfast bar and check in.  Friendly and genuinely glad that you are staying there.   Don't like that they only give me one bottle of water.  Diamond members usually get two bottles of water at check in.  High altitudes necessitate staying hydrated.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Spend a little more and stay downtown,"My recommendation is spend a few extra dollars and stay downtown.  When I checked in I was told the room was ready, when I went to my room I found dirty linens.  The kleenex smelled like kerosene.   The hot breakfast was cold and that was right away when they first opened in the morning.   Finally, the location was terrible you had to walk 2 miles through fields to get to the train or take the hotel shuttle to the airport and then take the train into downtown.   I will not be going back.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great finish to a long week,"We had traveled from Rawlins to Denver to wait for our flight our the next day so we decided on this hotel property for the overnight stay.  We checked in late and we greeted by a very friendly desk person (around 11:00 pm).  Rooms are very spacious and extremely nice.  What a very pleasant surprise our breakfast was.  Fresh made eggs, ham, fried potatoes.  It was just like eating in a restaurant not a free breakfast that comes with your room.  First time I stayed at an Embassy Suites while on business so I will check them out next time I travel.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very comfy lay over,"After ariving home from a late flight the last thing I wanted to do was drive an additional 2 hrs over snowy passes to our home. Smart choice, stay at embassy suites and have a sweet night. We spent the night in a spacious suite style hotel and had a great night of sleep and then a lovely complimentary breakfast in the morning.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Best airport hotel,Best airport hotel we have stayed at. Rooms are great and really quiet to sleep. The bar is inviting for a drink and breakfast was excellent with omelettes made to order. Would like a hotel like this at every airport.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"We loved our stay and Embassy Suites, Denver","The rooms were very nice and clean, the evening reception was very nice and the staff was great. We did the ""park and ride"" (witch was included with our room) to the airport and back. We will defiantly stay there again!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Quick stop on the way to the Caribbean,"Great airport hotel, convenient, very good restaurant, great staff.  The room was very quiet which helped as we had a very early flight to the airport.  The airport shuttle was right on time.  All in all a great start to our vacation.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Quick stay,My husband and I stayed at the hotel due to an early flight that required us to stay in the Denver area on our last day of vacation. The hotel is very nice and the two room suites are excellent. I would recommend it for business or pleasure.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Loosing focus?,"One of the reasons I'm a HH member is to depend on a number of things that Hilton stands for...and Embassy Suites set themselves apart years ago with a managers evening reception and morning breakfast.  The Denver Airport ES has lost it's focus.  My recent stay there included a reception with ""low-end"" cocktail choices and a bowl of chips with salsa.  I can find better at a $100 hotel anywhere in the country, including within a block or two near the Denver International Airport.  Morning breakfast?  If you want to stand in line for a custom omelette, fine, but other than that, the breakfast is more disappointing than the reception...stale, dry pastries and...oh yeah, nothing else.  For $220 per night (with outrageously high taxes), this Embassy Stuites is highly overpriced.  Want to stay within Hilton Honors? Choose the Hampton down the street.  Remember when ES was a standard that you could depend on?  They've become average, and overpriced at that.  Oh, and check-out?  Stand in line, because only one person was at the front desk...can't they drop off a folio at the room like other hotels?  Ask at check-in if the guest needs a hard copy, program it, and deliver it during the night.  Come on Embassy...I for one am over you.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Weekend in Denver,"This Hotel had the best mattress that I believe that I had ever slept on, the pillows were to flat  for my wife, the buffet breakfast was great the employees that clean up after every guests mess was slow getting the tables clean we did get there about 9:am so we were probably there after the morning rush,  I'm sorry but I am not a book writer so if this is not enough for this review don't use it but the HOTEL was great.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Adequate, but do NOT rely on the Airport Shuttle Service","Our stay was in line with other Embassy Suites...good but dated room, manager's reception, and an excellent breakfast.The problem was the dismal shuttle service to Denver International Airport (DIA).  The hotel is located approximately 10 minutes from the terminal, but for some reason they cannot figure out how to get people back and forth.  They offer free parking for 7 days if you stay at the hotel, but what they don't tell you is that you will be stranded when you return for your vehicle.We arrived at DIA after a difficult day of traveling, starting at San Diego in the morning with a drive to Los Angeles/LAX for an afternoon departure.  We were delayed on arrival at DIA, as the American Airlines crew did some hard braking on the runway when landing, overheating the brakes.  We had to be towed to the the terminal, after a 30 minute delay waiting for the brakes to cool down.  I called Embassy Suites at 7:55 PM (spoke to ""Jim"") on Saturday, April 23 to request a shuttle pick up.  I was told that it would be there in 15-20 minutes.  It arrived 30 minutes later, but the driver had already filled the vehicle and left several parties, including us, at the curb.  I told him we had called ahead and he said we had to wait another 30 minutes for the the next trip.The combined wait was to be more than 60 minutes, so we took a cab to Embassy Suites to get our car.  $32.00 ($26.25 fare, $6.00 tip) later, we finally got to start our 1 hour drive back to Colorado Springs.If ""Jim"" had just told me when I called in that the shuttle service was overloaded, we could've saved a LOT of time by taking a cab.  Instead, Embassy Suites and ""Jim"" literally kicked us to the curb.Thanks for nothing, Embassy Suites.  Don't makes promises you can't keep.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice near the airport,The hotel was very nice and close to the airport.  The shuttle service picked us up from rental car rent and brought us to the terminal for the flight the next day.  Clean hotel and friendly staff!  Breakfast was very good too.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay- particularly as overnight before flight,Great customer service. Good ammenities- evening reception and breakfast provide a great way to relax and unwind and there's something for everyone in the family. Pool and workout facilities are adequate. Toiletries are good quality. Repeat customer for sure!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Really good, as expected.","Really enjoyed the manager's reception and checking in was really quick. Breakfast was good, but there were no Belgian waffles, which was disappointing.  Also appreciate the free WiFi for HHonors members, but there should be more explanation on how to logon.  The shuttle to the airport was very convenient.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great location,We had to take our mountain shuttle back to the airport a day before our early morning flight to make it in time. We chose this hotel because of the close vicinity to the airport. Our mountain shuttle could only drop us at the airport and this hotel has a free shuttle back and forth to the airport. We had no issues getting to our hotel the night before and no issues getting to the airport the day of our flight! The rooms are clean and staff was very accommodating. They even mailed a letter for me! Great hotel and the happy hour was nice offering free food and drinks.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Everything was perfect!,From the moment I checked in until the moment I left everything was perfect.   Room service food was exceptionally well done and the staff was marvelous.  I had a few questions for the front desk staff while I was there and they were answered courteously and promptly.   Everyone was courteous and went beyond my expectations to be helpful.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,These guys have better TV's than we do at home!,"With our kids all grown up and our dog now chasing catchable squirrels in doggy heaven, do you know what we miss most in our many travels?  Our television.  Oh, those kids are back at home giving it a workout, but finding big, flat-panel HDTV's on the road is impossible.  Until now.The Embassy Suites at the Denver Airport is very nice, fitting the open-atrium mold that Embassy Suites perfected so many years ago.  Great staff and even a free laundry area, albeit with dryers that don't heat up like they did when new. Good breakfast buffet as you will find at most Embassy Suites. But those TV's!!  Walk into your suite and you are greeted by a super-thin panel TV that takes up a big chunk of the wall.  60""?  Could be!  You then walk into the bedroom and an equally nice (and slightly smaller) TV awaits you there.  Arriving late and departing early, we could only verify that the picture was superb - your house may be jealous after visiting the Embassy Suites at the Denver Airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Awesome ,It's worth the extra cash to stay here. Despite being busy hotel is in great shape. Did not go to the social but it looked great. Beds were great and room smelled fantastic. The front desk folks were very helpful as well. Despite being an airport hotel the upkeep is great.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Clean & comfortable rooms,My second time in this hotel. The rooms are comfortable and in good shape. The ventilation system is a little bit noisy. Friendly staff.Stayed here just for one night after a long flight from Oslo. If you want to have a great breakfast visit the madam who makes omelettes in the restaurant area. The food she makes is fantastic. It's worth to visit this hotel just to taste this!!,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,very happy experience,very happy with the amenities and the cleanliness of the rooms.  will use again (and already have).  would definitely recommend.  felt luxurious without the high price.   We got our money's worth.  glad we found this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Needs an update.,My wife who has walking challenges found entering the hotel difficult. There were missing slate tiles upon entering an the floor mat was buckled. We informed the front dest of this hazard and they seemed indifferent.No grab bars and very tired rooms.The food was terrible and service lacking.The only positve is the free shuttle service to the airport and its proximity to it.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Clean & comfortable room, but very noisy A/C in the bedroom","In general it is a good middle-class hotel with friendly staff and the complimentary shuttle from/to the airport is very convenient. The rooms have a separate bedroom and are equipped with 2 TV's and a kitchenette with a coffee machine.Mattresses and pillows were clean and comfortable, however the blanket could be a bit thicker in winter and spring to avoid the need to keep the A/C on during the night. Unfortunately, the noisy motor of the A/C is also situated in the bedroom and, running, it causes noise in the range of 60-65 dB(A), compared to the regular approx. 30 dB(A) when it's off (see sound analysis). Admittedly, I am not a professional sound engineer and have recorded that with my iPhone, however I do not argue on 3-5 dB(A) more or less noise. As a kind of compensation, if you wake up early in the morning due to A/C noise, you can enjoy the dawn breaking over the mountains. So, don't forget ear plugs or/and enjoy the beautiful landscape.Breakfast is good and (at least for a European) more than enough. Truly valued I have the happy hour in the late afternoon, when drinks were served for free (yes, believe it).For dinner I recommend the Italian restaurant ""DiCicco's"", in  5-7 minutes walking distance only.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great experience on business travel,I made a short stay at this hotel while I was visiting Denver on a business trip. I regularly stay at Emabassy Suites and this was a very pleasant experience. The room was very clean. The hotel was quite. The staff was very friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying near the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Just like new,Quick check in. A place with a little added cost and a nights stay a place to park your car and use their shuttle to the airport. Still has the smell of new. Clean and large room. Of course their full cook to order breakfast starts early. Free drinks on some evenings. A great place to stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Hotel and Staff !!,"We recently visited the hotel on our way to Las Vegas, using the park and fly that they offer. The room was spotless with very nice comfy beds.  The entire staff was very helpful and professional. The shuttle service was awesome, driver was very friendly and polite !  The cooked to order breakfast was very good. Hard to beat the price for a hotel that offers free drinks at the Manager's Welcome, free cooked to order breakfast and shuttle service to DIA !!  We will stay at this property again !!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,near airport; great stay for early flight,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and it never disappoints!  Easy shuttle to airport, great indoor pool, evening manager's reception, and cooked to order breakfast!  It seems to have grown in popularity as always busy but service hasn't changed.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Experience,"We needed a hotel close to the airport for a flight home in the am. This hotel was clean, spacious, and lovely. The beds were extremely comfortable and we were able to grab some water bottles in the store at check-in. The breakfast was awesome--perfect made-to-order omelettes with lots of fresh veggies, the way we like them. The hotel was located near a gas station, which made filling up our rental car tank on the way to the airport nice and easy. Would definitely stay here every time we fly into Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Tireless Staff,"We stayed for 2 nights at the Embassy Suites at the Denver Airport from March 22 until March 24 2016. On our first morning we awoke to a serious blizzard. Pena Blvd was closed, no way to get to the airport or anywhere else for the entire day. The room was spacious, clean and a great place to hunker down for the duration of the storm. While not a problem for us, a lot of guests had nowhere else to go and the staff worked tirelessly to accommodate them and lots of children due to Easter/ Spring Break going on. I observed the front desk for a time and saw that every panic call was treated very courteously. Food service was changed to make sure everybody was comfortable and overall there was an upbeat atmosphere to the hotel. Everybody did do their best and it showed. We will definitely stay here on any future visits.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Place & Location,We were unable to use the breakfast as we had to leave to get to the airport early. It is a great deal to be able to park the car for up to three weeks for only $20. more. It is very close to DIA and they provide complimentary transportation to and from the airport.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,First Class Property !!!,"Great place to stay.  Great rooms, very clean, great/friendly/helpful staff.  Worth every bit extra you might pay to stay here.  Due to construction, only single elevator available (temporarily).  Book a room on a lower floor to avoid longer waits.  You want to stay here - first class property",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Amazing housekeeping and mangement staff,"About a month ago, my husband, kids, and I stayed here for a local get-out-of-the-house winter getaway.  We all had a great time.  The room was fresh and recently redone. Mom and Dad enjoyed the cocktail hour, the kids the pool. We all loved the included breakfast. When we got home, I realized I had left my dental retainers in our room.  I had wrapped them in a Kleenex and left them beside the bed. I was really upset, knowing that they'd probably been mistaken as trash and thrown out. Well, what do you know...the wonderful housekeepers had found them and taken them to the office, which then promptly over-nighted them to me via FedEx. I was incredibly relieved. THANK YOU EMBASSY SUITES STAFF!!! You are not only professional, but also caring and thoughtful. ***Free wifi is only available if you book as an Honors member (free sign-up to join) on the Hilton site.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Snowed in!,On a recent ski trip to Denver we were snowed in for 3 days as the airport shut down and the desk clerk was very gracious on the last day to extend us a late check out allowing us to relax in the room rather than spending 6 hours in the airport as our flight out was late at night.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Terrible Internet Service,"The hotel is a typical Embassy Suites - a beautiful building with large comfortable suites.  The main flaw is with their Wi-Fi service.  The internet connections worked fine at 6am in the morning, but if you try to access the service at night, be prepared for five minute wait times for a simple web page to load.  I give this hotel five stars if you want to stay off-line, but if you want to conduct business over the supplied wi-fi, avoid this place.  Also, avoid a room close to the elevators - you will hear them running all night.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,comfortable beds and good room service,". When traveling we like to check in and just relax.      Their room service selection was excellent, tasty, and arrived steaming hot.       Their resturant downstairs has even more selections.     The beds are comfortable.     We really like the separation between the living area and sleeping area.     It's nice if one of us wants to turn in earlier.     Their soap and shampoo is wonderful...........our only complaint is the selection of tv shows is poor.     We don't watch much at home.   So we do enjoy watching it in our hotel rooms.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Blizzard March 2016,A blizzard shutdown DWI and the hotel staff really outdid themselves.  Roads in and out of the airport were closed and the hotel quickly filled.  Even full capacity +  and staff shortages did not faze them.  Front desk staff worked a full shift then waited tables for happy hour.   John was amazing fielding calls at front desk while handling customers checking In.12 hours later John was busing tables in restaurant and Jim is still on the phone trying to help stranded travelers. I want to hire these employees for my customer service team.  Great work.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel,We tend to stay here when we drive down from WYOMING to fly out on trips The is a great hotel with friendly staffThis trip we where headed out to Iceland and on to the Netherlands They let us park our car for 20 per week and once we got to the DIA and though security wy wife realized she had left her phone in our carBecause we favor Ford and had keyless entry I call the front desk and Jim answer the phone I went to our car got the phone drove it to the airport I went back out an got it,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place.  What's up with vacuuming at 8:00 p.m.???,Love this hotel.  I'm going to give it a thumbs down for cleaning when the dining room and bar has customers.  Whose idea is this???  Totally a disappointment.   So I ate my delicious pizza with a vacuum at my ear.  No Thanks!!   May be Sunday night but I expect midweek service.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great experience,"I only stayed at this hotel for one night due to change in travel plans.  The rooms were large and well furnished--and above all, CLEAN.  Very quiet, comfortable beds, ample working space for a small group to collaborate in the room.  Overall a great experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Impressive airport hotel,"What is a stranded traveler to do?A missed flight out of Denver resulted in an unexpected extra night in the city.  Spirits were low, as I had hoped to get back home in time to watch the Superbowl with my family the next day.Luckily, I was able to secure a flight early the next morning.  In the meantime, I made my way to the Embassy Suites...What a pleasant surprise it was.  Nice, large lobby with a mining themed bar located in the middle, and high ceilings with a view up to the top floors of the hotel.  I enjoyed buffalo wings and cocktails at the bar before retreating to my room for a brief night of sleep.The executive suite had a lot of space, certainly more than I really needed for just myself and that amount of time.  But, easily a great deal for the price.  The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to the airport.  Make sure you sign up for a timeslot with the front desk!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Awesome Place to Stay,"Love the Embassy Suites, great location. We leave our vehicle over the weekend and fly out of DIA, with no extra charge.  The complimentary breakfast is good and a big variety.  Enjoy the evening social hour.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good solid hotel near the airport.,This is a great hotel to stay if you have to catch an early flight out. The check-in and shuttle buses were very efficient. They picked me up at the rental car drop off which was nice. The next morning they took  me to the airport. I like the fact they take reservations for the shuttle. You don't have to go down there and wait for the next one. The room is nice and clean. The bed was comfortable. There was a nice hot tub outside. The free happy hour was appreciated. The bar food was OK.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Get rid of those pillows & duvets,"Overall this is a very nice Embassy Suite hotel and a great location to catch a flight out of Denver.  The staff was great, food was good, and the room was spacious.  Our only complaints were the linens.  The pillows were beyond useless. They were so flat both of us woke up with neck spasms the next day.  Whatever happened to foam pillows which keep their shape and do not trigger allergies like down pillows do?  Also having the only choice for a cover being a duvet meant dealing with uncomfortable bulk and way too much heat. Our choices were to sleep under the sheet only and crank the heat up, or be smothered in a bulky duvet.  It is especially bad travelling to areas such as Phoenix and Florida which are hot most of the year, and to use the duvet means setting the thermostat to the low 60's.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay!,"I spent 3 days there for a training session.  I expected the usual, room and mediocre food.  Boy was I surprised!  Great room and exceptional food.  Very attentive staff and a web connection that worked.  Nothing to complain about.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great embassy,"This is my favorite hotel in the Denver Airport/Aurora area, they have a great staff and I always enjoy my stays here.The good: - Love the lobby/atrium decor; - Unlike many other ES, I have never seen the breakfast crowded and have never waited for cooked to order items- Good manager's reception, also tends to be less croweded than other ES- Great bar staff- Quieter than other hotels in imeediate area due to being farther from Tower Rd.- Although there have been other comments about the rooms getting dated, while the decor isn't ""modern"", I don't think it is dated and the rooms are nicely appointedThe not so good:- Nothing much in the immediate area- Close to the airport, but fairly far from everything else- On occassion have experienced water pressure problems on higher floorsRoom Tip: West facing rooms have great views of the front range. Since this is in an open area and it is flat...It has also recently had the rooms renovated.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great new rooms!,Loved the remodeled rooms but Happy Hour was disorganized- no plates or napkins out etc. Breakfast would be better if you put bacon out and didn't have to ask for it. Centennial Embassy is a good example of both.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Go to place pre-vacation,We typically stay here if we have an early flight out to avoid the long drive to DIA.  We also like to take advantage of leaving the car in their lot while we travel.  Very convenient and economical.  The rooms are nice.  Beds comfy - furniture not really.   Happy hour is decent - typical ES cocktail reception.  The food offered is lousy.  They do offer discounts on their appetizers during happy hour.  Wings are good but the mexican egg rolls are blah.  We have never had their complimentary breakfast as we always leave too early.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice stay,I recently stayed one night before a morning flight from DEN.  The staff was very friendly and check in was quick.  My room was very comfortable and well maintained.  It looked like new furniture.  The breakfast was standard Embassy......I thought the fruit could have been better.  The airport shuttle was very prompt.  I'd stay again.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,very nice hotel,"We missed our flight and this was devastating for us, as we have a 1 year old baby and our car seat and all of our clothes went on the plane 3000 miles away across the country! Our next flight was scheduled for the next day at midnight and we would of had to check-out of the hotel by noon, but she helped us and gave us extra time -around a couple of hours extra to stay in the room so we wouldn't be at the airport for 12 hours!  The receptionist at the desk was so kind and genuinely nice-it was wonderful to feel just like family!  The room was very up to date and clean!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,FURNISHINGS,"Beds were very comfortable.  Living room furniture, not so much.  One chair too hard for anyone to sit on.  Sofa bed too hard to sleep on which made sleeping arrangements difficult.  Furnishings should last forever as too uncomfortable to use.  Very disappointing in comparison to virtually every other Embassy Suites we have stayed.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Very nice room, food OK, but very slow service","Friendly greeting, very nice room (well appointed), and OK food.  Service for dinner was painfully slow, though. We waited over 1 hour to receive what should have been a simple order (chicken wings, soup, and salad) with some drinks.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Middle of nowhere.. but a good hotel,"The hotel is kind of located in the middle of nowhere, but its close to the Denver International Airport. There is not much to do around in the area of the hotel and its a 40 mile odd drive into denver itself. The hotel was picked because of the location of my work for that week and it served its purpose. The rooms where very large, however my suite with a kitchen did not include any cutlery or plates? Seemed a bit odd compared to other suites I have stayed in. Also the shower worked a bit funny and had 2 cold showers before I had to get somebody to come show me how the shower handle workedHotel offers happy hour with snacks each afternoon and seemed to have a good vibe about it. The breakfast offer was good with eggs made to order.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Love this Place!,"I have been staying at this Embassy Suites when I have to be in the Denver area for work since 2008.  It is such an awesome hotel.  It is well kept; the service is amazing; the food is excellent, and the rooms are comfortable.  It has all of the typical ES amenities -- free breakfast, daily manager's reception with free drinks and snacks, two-room suite rooms, atrium hotel layout, etc., in addition to a shuttle to and from DEN.  The bartender that that works during the Manager's Reception each day is a cool guy.  (His name escapes me right now, but you'll know who it is when you see him.)  If you need to stay near DEN, this is the hotel for you!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Consistently good value,"This is our third time staying at the Embassy Suites after arriving on a late flight.  In fact, due to delays, we arrived at the hotel close to 3 AM.  I had kept in touch with the front desk before we left and they had our room keys all set for us to avoid delay.  I used the online check in service to select my room so that I'd have a mountain view in the morning.  My daughter slept on the couch in the outer room.  I noticed that there's a large gap under the door that let in noise from the hallway. It didn't bother her, but it would bother a light sleeper.  The king bed in the inner room was wonderful.  One of the most comfortable bed and pillows I've slept on at a hotel.  The breakfast buffet ended promptly at 9, but we slipped down in time to get fresh and tasty breakfast.  Full breakfast with eggs, pancakes, biscuits, made to order omelets, fruit, etc.   The price is very low for the room considering that breakfast is included.  Previously the kids have used the indoor pool and the outdoor jacuzzi but not this trip.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice hotel near the airport,"Wish I had more time to spend at this property.  The suite was really nicely appointed except for the bathroom.  Please hoteliers, put more light in the bathroom and provide a lighted make-up mirror for your female guests!  It seemed like the room was recently updated with the new carpet and new sofa.  Everything was very clean and comfortable.  There is buffet breakfast included, but I didn't have time to check it out due to an early flight.  The exercise room was somewhat limited and could have used a couple more ellipticals.  My two complaints: the internet cost another $14.95....seems like almost every hotel has free internet except for this one.  You have to be a Hilton Rewards Member to get free internet, but you can't access the internet to become a Hilton Rewards Member.  Hmmmm....not very customer friendly.  Also, the shuttle from the airport was about 20 minutes late.  Other than that...all was fine.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Really nice except,"Everything was perfect (clean, great breakfasts, wonderful manager's reception, clean) EXCEPT on the second day we didn't get refills of shampoo and conditioner.  That was weird as we are Diamond members.  We could have asked but didn't realize it until shower time!  Very close to Denver Intl.   So convenient.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Awesome hotel,"The rooms have been renovated with truly understand excellence.  We enjoy this hotel for the manager's reception in the evening, the free breakfast, free airport shuttle, and free parking while you are on vacation.  This is the best Embassy Suites in Denver.  The beds and pillows are excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent value,"Embassy Suites Denver International Airport provides excellent value for the money. The staff is very friendly, caring, and warming.  The rooms and hotel areas are always clean. The food is good and the evening reception provides good drinks and a variety of appetizers.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Had early morning flight,Very nice stay. We had an early morning flight and needed a place to stay near airport. The shuttle was there at 4am to take us to airport. The room was great. Very clean and spacious. We also called for room service and they were very quick and friendly and the food was great. We would defiantly stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Short stay for flight next day,"My wife and I stayed a night here as we had an early flight the next day.   The hotel was great, clean modern rooms, etc.  Only complaint with the room is that I noticed some hotels don't allow guests to plug in their iPad or small DVD player into the TV using an HDMI cable as their TV remotes don't have a source button (and the TV's don't have that).  Not a huge complaint by any means, but got spoiled with Hyatt and Hyatt Park Place's as they allow that optionOtherwise room was good, clean and updated.   Food downstairs was good.  Couldn't get breakfast as we left early.  Shuttle to airport was key and on time.  We did get a shuttle that picked us up from the airport but that almost an hour wait as the ""shuttle runs every 30 minutes"" is a great concept but they should have more then one van doing runs as the other hotels had shuttles zipping by ever 10 / 15 minutes.   That was the only real complaint.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great staff,we have stayed at this hotel twice in the last six months. Both times the staff was exceptional. I have already reserved a room for later this month. This hotel sets the standard by which all other Embassy Suites should be measured.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great deal for airport parking but free reception food very bad,I stayed here for a night prior to winter vacation. They allow you to park your car for up to 7 days while you are gone on your trip. The shuttle is only 10 minute ride to airport. Can say how terrible the evening reception is. The bartender intentionally stalls when serving so to not give away too many free drinks. The line for a cocktail was 6 people in front of me an I stood for 25 minutes waiting while the bartender purposefully delayed in serving people wanting free drinks serving paying customers only. The food was cold cold cold beef sliders and and pieces of pizza bread. people were throwing it away and eating goldfish crackers alternatively. Terrible food and bar service. Still worth the stay given the parking perk.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice Property-Poor Service,"Stayed here last week. The property itself is nice and clean with well appointed rooms. Unfortunately I encountered a series of small issues that made for a poor experience. When I arrived at the Airport I called the hotel to see how long it would be for a shuttle. The women that answered said the shuttle was making a drop off at the airport and would be there in 3-4 minutes. I waited 10 minutes and called again, only to be told that she was incorrect and that the shuttle wouldn't be there for another 20 minutes. Had I know this originally, I would have waited inside, instead of out in the cold and might have taken a cab or Uber to the property. Once I finally arrived at the hotel, the two employees behind the counter were bickering about some guests that had just left the counter, whom had apparently been disruptive. One of the employees was using inappropriate language during this somewhat heated discussion. As I was checking in the employee asked if I would like a shuttle back to the airport the next morning, which I accepted, but when I said I had a 5 am flight and would like a 3:30 am shuttle I was informed that the shuttles don't start until 4 and that the 4 am was full, as well the 4:30, so he asked me if the 5 am would  do. Clearly he wasn't listened to what I was saying since a 5am shuttle for a 5 am flight won't work. Thankfully Uber was there to make the quick drive in the morning - too bad I had to spend extra to get there though. Needless to say, these are minor annoyances and they were all simple to overcome, but I feel that there is some improvement that would have made this a much better experience had these two employees been better trained.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Nice property, close to airport","Very nice property.  Breakfast was very good,  Hotel was clean and nice bar area.  Has shuttle to airport, but had issue when I dropped off rental car.  Spoke with the front desk before I left, they assured I would be picked up in 10 minutes.  Dropped off car and 45 minutes later, finally picked up after a couple calls.  Was not happy, very cold night.  I am Diamond with Hilton, travel every week and did not appreciate the waste of my time.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great Hotel, Great Staff","The staff at the front desk were excellent. The bar and restaurant staff also great. The rooms are very clean, quiet and inviting. The facility is beautiful. The young woman at the front desk graciously arranged a limo for us for our very early flight the next day. Our stay both before our trip and return were most restful.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Layover,"We had to stay a night because our flight was the next day.   Got in late because of bad weather,  about 9:30 pm.   Checkin was fast but by the time we got down to the restaurant it was almost 10:00 pm.   They close at 10 but they were very nice and served us dinner.   The trout was great.   The accommodations were very well good.   Their included breakfast buffet was excellent.   I would have to rate this hotel as one I would go back too.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Breakfast. Tiny couch.,"Breakfast was a full, hot breakfast with a wonderful variety of meats, cereals, fruits, breads, etc, and a made-to-order omelet bar. Unfortunately, I booked a two-room suite, thinking it had two bedrooms, but it was one bedroom and a living area, so my 6'3"" brother ended up sleeping on a tiny couch (not pull-out) instead of in his own bed. The bathroom could have been cleaned up better, and there was a problem with the faucet, but overall it was fine. Hotel staff were all friendly and professional. Huge TV's in living area and bedroom.  Hhonors members get free wifi; that's worth signing up for.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Friendly Staff- Good Rate-Close to the Airport,An older property hence the very affordable rates.  We  had to make an unexpected hop to Denver and this was a reasonable place and very helpful. We made our reservations on line the morning of our visit and the rate was reasonable.  After some unexpected issues they willingly adjusted our rate even lower.  I saw this as positive because the staff was willing to ensure that we were satisfied with our stay.  Because of this I would stay here again in the future.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,It was nice.,"The location was convenient. Check in was easy. The room was well appointed and  everything was fresh and clean. The staff was welcoming and helpful. The food at the Manager's reception needs a makeover, I don't recall what the offering was but I do remember it was sad. The drinks were good. Overall I'd stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Close to the airport,Near the Denver  airport. We were a group of 9 people ages 4-70 and this hotel  accommodated all of us well. The rooms are large and we just loved the breakfast. Kudos to all omelet chefs. It was great to have breakfast included on the rate. We also enjoyed happy hour which is generous and a great time to gather the family. The restaurant menu is limited but enough for a short stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Accomodations,"We stayed here because of the location near the airport.  The hotel is great and the staff was friendly.  The kids used the pool - not overly big but fine.  The shuttle to the airport was a huge help to us - we were able to leave our car at the hotel for the week we were gone and the shuttle picked us up on arrival.  Great stay, very convenient, great staff (everyone we talked to was nice to the kids), great happy hour!  We missed the breakfast because of our flight time but everything else was great.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay,"Stayed here with my brothers and their families during the National Western Stock Show.  Nice hotel, friendly staff at check in and check out.  Happy hour was a little crowded and Sunday breakfast was busy.  One disappointment. Unlike other Embassy Suites we have been at, we typically for one meal order pizza and eat in the common area,  Once it arrived and we sat down, we were kicked out because of ""food safety""  issues.  Back to the rooms we went and survived.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay close to DIA,Another great stay at an Embassy Suites. Close to Dever International Airport. Shuttle service is convenient. Early check-in was easy and made the actual check-in process very efficient. Very clean hotel with great customer service. Will definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel Near the Airport,"This is a great hotel for proximity to the airport.  Unfortunately, the Denver airport is not near the city so there are better Embassy Suites if one is going to the city or surrounding areas.  The hotel is clean and well-kept. The staff is friendly.  Additionally, the airport shuttle is an added bonus and is easy to utilize.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Well Managed Hotel,"Stay one night while traveling through Denver.  Picked up by the shuttle, greeted by a very nice driver. The hotel staff had all the paperwork ready and we onto our room quickly.  We enjoyed happy hour, nice small snacks and later dinner at the hotel.  We were surprised by a good meal.  The hotel room had recently been painted and updated so it had that 'new' smell.  We had a full service breakfast before departing complete with eggs, pancakes, fruit, yogurt ettc.... The shuttle took us back to the airport. Overall, I will stay here again and recommend this hotel if you need a hotel by the Denver Airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Super convenient to DIA,"This hotel is great.  We stay here any time we are flying out of DIA.  They provide a shuttle to and from the airport with free parking of our vehicle in their lot.  The rooms are large with a cooked-to-order breakfast, which is delicious.  The price of the room may be a little high and not a value if we are only traveling for a weekend, but not paying parking at DIA is helpful.  They are always helpful and courteous.  We usually have to wait about 30 minutes for the shuttle to pick us up at the airport, but it is still pretty convenient.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Stop on the way home...,"I did not check in to this hotel until around 9:30pm so it was a little late to go out and try to get a bite to eat. The hotel restaurant was open until 10:00 and I was able to get a bite.  I went back out to the truck to get my bags a little later and as I was crossing through the parking lot a police officer stopped me and basically was checking to make sure I belonged in the parking lot.  I looked a bit scruffy but told him I was getting my things from my rental truck. When I told him I had a truck he gave me a flyer and said they had a rash of break ins on trucks because of the 2016 Stock Show in town and asked me to call them and gave me the phone number if I even saw anyone suspicious. He said the burglars would pull up in a truck, break in to the truck and in a matter of minutes steal the hood, and tailgate to sell on eBay.  After he pulled away another car pulled up and the gentleman introduced himself as the hotel security guard. He told me that there would not be any break ins on that night because he was patrolling and would be there all night.  Needless to say I felt and feel that security of the guests is a big deal to this hotel and would recommend it to all. The restaurant, staff, and room were all top notch as well.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Updated Hotel, Great Staff, Very Clean","Stayed here one night before catching a flight out of Denver.  Hotel has been updated.  Rooms are very nice with great furniture and Big TVs.  Bed was very comfortable.  Nice Bathroom.  Breakfast was very nice, well stocked, and Omelet Bar is always great.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great location, nice, clean, comfortable, fresh rooms - perfect for an early flight",This place is like new.  It is just a couple minutes from the airport and they have a shuttle to pick you up and drop you off.  From check in to check out the staff was friendly and helpful.  I will definitely stay here next time I am in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"clean and affordable, close to airport",Great hotel for yourself or if you are traveling with family. I stay here for early morning flights out of DIA and it's great.  Free wi-fi and a great hot breakfast! The hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Met all of my high expectations.,It is difficult to beat Embassy Suites for lodging value and this property was no exception.   The staff was kind and efficient.  The rooms were clean and well appointed.   The airport's proximity to the airport was perfect.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"clean, upscale","The suite was clean, upscale and the breakfast was good. We only arrived at 11pm and left at 8am, so I don't have much to say. The price was excellent. I've gotten a small room without the suite at the same price. The bedding, which was all I cared about, was comfy.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good Airport Hotel - shuttle needs improvement.,"Nice Hotel, rooms recently renovated. Typical Embassy suites layout with the separate bedroom and living room as well as the extensive breakfast included as well as free beer/wine at the evening happy hour and only a 10 min drive to DIA. Decor is nice and the restaurant area is very functional. We stayed here on a park and fly deal as we were flying out the next morning for 2 weeks. The hotel room with parking was cheaper than parking at the airport of 3rd party lots.Negatives were that we had to wait almost an hour in 20 degree temps for the shuttle when we returned to Denver. Next time I will take a taxi which I will include the cost of in my calculations to determine if staying here is cost effective – or try a different hotel with a more punctual shuttle. Second was that I was charged an additional $6.00 after I finalized my bill on my credit card. I phoned them and they advised that it was for 2 bottles of water – which I did not drink. They corrected the charge, but I have to wonder how the staff determined that I should be charged for the water when 2 bottles were sitting right there? Watch your credit card statement after you check out.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good Fast Breakfast,As usual the hotel delivered on a hot cooked to order breakfast before being shuttled to the airport.  Good location and our shuttle driver as very helpful getting us and all our luggage to the airport.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great staff,"We had a very enjoyable stay at this Embassy Suites.  Incredibly competent front desk staff who were all young and well trained.   The rooms were very nice and quiet.  The parking was very convenient and they allowed you to park and ride to the airport.  It was six bucks for parking for five days.  The shuttle came promptly to the airport to pick us up after taking us at 8 am the day we left.  Breakfast was very good.    Did the little things right.  They added another shuttle immediately when it looked like the first one was going to be full at 8am.  Also took all the people going to Southwest airlines, in the same shuttle. This is the best embassy suites we have been to. ",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Bring your own pillow,"For the most part, this hotel is great. It was undergoing renovations so there was a mess in some spots on some floors. The beds are hard and the pillows are worthless. If you don't bring your own, expect a stiff neck when you wake up. Sounds minor, but when you pay that kind of money for a room, you should expect a good night's sleep.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nicest embassy we have ever stayed at,"This is a new property and close to the airport.  We stayed here as a stop over when we were going skiing.  It's great, it is new and there is nothing there that could disappoint us.  We hope that we can stay again someday.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A very mixed experience for sure.,"We spent six nights at this ES over Christmas, 2015.  We did not fly anywhere, but were visiting my sister-in-law who just went through surgery for brain cancer. So, this wasn't a fun trip at all.  First the good: The renovated rooms are MUCH nicer than they used to be. New paint, carpet, furniture, TVs.  The rooms are much brighter than they used to be and the changes are appreciated.  The bathroom wasn't renovated though, and our toilet ran every 20 minutes or so.  Finally it was fixed after I mentioned it twice to the front desk.  The breakfast buffet was as good as ever, and if you got there early, the line wasn't too bad. Later in the morning, the lines were really bad, like 20-30 people waiting for their eggs.  Then the bad:  The parking was absolutely terrible.  We could…",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Renovations!,"We are Diamond Hilton Honors members and have stayed at this hotel several time before taking an early flight out of DIA.  We were very pleased to find out that our corner room had been recently renovated and the renovations fixed all of the problems that had been evident in past stays.  First, there is all new furniture and it is nice and comfortable.  There is also new lighting and finally the rooms aren't so dark anymore!  There is a newly added small dressing table in the bedroom with a mirror.  The televisions in the bedroom and living room are quite a bit larger and are wall mounted.  The rooms seem bigger and this is good.  Bed linens and pillows also seem to have been upgraded.I didn't find any changes in the kitchenette but it is well appointed.  My only wish is that they had added a telescoping mirror in the bathroom for those of us who are poorly sighted.  The manager's reception is still a plus.  Front desk staff was very welcoming and informative..",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Room for improvement,"Typical Embassy Suites yet was lacking with respect to the breakfast buffet and seemed like it was just not running in sync.  in the midst of a renovation, I would recommend if possible waiting until it is complete to stay there",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent and convenient,"Clean, comfortable and has everything you need to access airport quickly. You can park your car at the hotel and take their shuttle to the airport. Getting from the airport to the hotel takes more coordinating.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Excellent location for airport travelers,but not for Denver","We stayed whilst traveling home for Thanksgiving because we had an early AM flight and we wanted to be at the airport early to avoid queues.  Pros: 1.) The Embassy Suites is located 7 minutes from DIA, and provides a complementary shuttle (runs every 30 minutes).  2.) The hotel is newer, and the hotels are very clean.  Room sizes are the normal spacious suites expected for an Embassy Suites. 3.) Complementary evening Manager's reception and full cook to order breakfast are hallmarks of the Embassy Suites, and there's no exception here.  Of note, the hotel bar has a very limited tap (only Shock Top and Budweiser), free during Manager's Reception...additional lager/ale available via bottle. Cons: 1.) You are VERY far away from downtown Denver; the hotel is located within a small oasis of hotels & restaurants at the airport...but that's about it.  You can see the mountains to the west, but they are even farther away.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Really nice option close to airport,"Really nice hotel with updated everything. Free airport shuttle, free happy hour, free breakfast, friendly staff. We needed to be close to airport for an early flight. This was perfect and the room was very nice and very spacious. Free internet if you book on Hilton website, free snacks with premium suite.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Classy yet affordable,"Spacious, high quality room with separate bedroom, living room, large bathroom with handicap accommodations. My husband recently had an artificial hip replacement in New Zealand.  After traveling for 30 hours to get to Denver - we were exhausted.  The Embassy Suites were perfect - roomy, relaxing, high quality, with a restaurant which served great food.  They had a wheel chair for us to use and were very helpful.  The room price was very reasonable.  We will definitely stay here again.  Close to the Denver International Airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Wow!,"Close to the airport. In House food was fabulous!  Customer service was excellent!  Great experience! Staff extremely helpful with directions. Amenities were very nice, wish I had been there longer. Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel Brand - somewhat lacking in support,Hotel overall is a very nice hotel.  Bartender could use a Miss Manner's session or two and the late night/early morning check out person needs additional training otherwise the remainder of the staff was very pleasent.  Menu selection was very limited with waiter staff limited mainly due to the social reception in the bar.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver Embassy Suites for me,"I had no expectations but was happy to have stayed 3 nights at the embassy suites by Hilton. The 7pm arrival and the open guest service as the lounge was a surprise (5:30pm - 7:30pm) each evening was fantastic especially after two flights to Denver. Fitness facility is well equipped. The Rooms are large and clean (no smell). The meeting rooms well equipped and managed as coffee, drinks, snacks etc. all delivered on time and adequate for all persons attending. Power cords supplied for laptops and overall room acoustics good.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great time,I stayed there after a long week of traveling and it was everything I needed.  I got there in time for the cocktail hour and I really appreciate how this Embassy rewards Honors members with water and the $10 off food coupon.  I really love the wood around the doors and that you can see out the windows.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Housekeeping improved, but hotel needs an update","I reviewed this hotel in June after having some terrible experiences with housekeeping.  I visited this hotel on two different occasions last week for a total of 3 nights (again for business travel).  I did not have the housekeeping issues I had described previously, but on both of my stays I had trouble with the treadmills in the fitness room.  On my first attempt, I had to work for ~10 minutes to get one of the 3 treadmills to work.  On my 2nd visit I had similar issues.  The fitness center is nice, but the equipment is just worn out.  They are remodeling the hotel but it seems like they waited too long.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Bring a book to read while stuck in the long slow-moving breakfast line”,"We actually timed how long we were in line --  45 minutes. Yes, 45 minutes. Unlike other Embassy Suites where there is a separate line for buffet and another line for cooked-to-order eggs, this Embassy has one line. And there was just one over-worked omelet preparer. We were on the Premium Floor and our room had  a great selection of teas and coffee. There are no shops or stores within walking distance.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Bad Experence,"Carpet is wore out and stained, Furniture is wore out and stained, air conditioning is very loud in the bedroom.  Remodel is on going (even on Sunday !).  Owner waited to long to remodel.  Hotel does not meet Embassy Suites standards.  I will not return.  Good location and friendly staff.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Manager's Evening Reception,"Overall this is decent hotel, the only problem I ran into was during the manager's evening reception, staff passed by me while I sat at the table, they didn't bother to ask if I would like to have any drink. So I walked up to the bar counter, and asked for a glass of wine, when I took the wine to my room, I noticed the glass was pretty dirty, lot of stains. I didn't bother to go back for exchange.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Service Service Service ,Good hotel with nice rooms. Clean comfortable and modern  Restaurant was nice menu selections meager at best. Food was very nicely presented The outstanding service from the front desk was AMAZING. Both when we arrived and again in the morning.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel,"Stayed at the Embassy suites Denver airport. Friend staff, nice suites. The pancakes at breakfast were better than Cracker Barrel. A great way to start your day. My fiancé doesn't eat pork or eggs and they made him a delicious hash brown with veggies and turkey. He loved it and had it daily. The drinks during happy hour were very good the first night and ok the second night. I had margaritas, but there were different bar tenders. The snacks were nothing to get excited about. Cheese n salsa/ chips one day and the other day they have veggies/dressing. There wasn't a crowd or line;but it was a nice social hour.. The hotel/rooms were clean. The bed and pillows very comfortable.you need a car to get around. Nothing within walking distance. However, a mall, Walmart are within 7 min drive. FedEx close by as well. The hotel is about a 15 min drive to the airport...",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Traveling to Mexico,Nice Hotel to stay when traveling out of DIA.  Utilize the shuttle service and leave car at hotel.  Did have a few problems with this trip and the Hotel staff was there to help.  Even contacted me when out of country.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Our Favorite Denver Airport Hotel,"We live in Colorado Springs and had an early morning flight from Denver International.  So we spent the night at Embassy Suites, and left our car safely parked there.  When we returned 2 weeks later our evening flight from Boston was delayed 3 hours, and we landed at DIA at 12:35 am.  The last airport shuttle pickup was 12:30 am; however, the driver (Carlos) turned around and was waiting for us!  Such caring service!!  The hotel stay was also excellent...great bed, nice happy hour, good restaurant.  We will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Where do I start?,"Positives:- Clean Hotel Room.- Friendly Check In Staff.Negatives:- Came in on October 5th and the line to the hotel was disconnected, therefore, I had to take a cab to the hotel as opposed to the free shuttle.- NO FREE WI-FI. Get with the program. In this day and era, people want access to the internet whenever, wherever, not pay $20 a day for it.- The evening snacks weren't spectacular. The main thing that pissed me off was NO FREE WI-FI... enough to scratch not only this place off of my hotels in the future, but all Embassy Suites. OVERRATED HOTEL, I prefer Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express, at least WI-FI is free.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good Place to Stay by Aiport but little Atmosphere,This is a good place to stay if you are looking for something near the Denver airport.  It is a typical Embassy but I do recommend it.  There isn't much going on out by the airport so don't expect any night life.  Not many restaurants near by but 10 min drive there are some.  This is my go-to place when I need to catch a early flight in Denver,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Only One Night Stay,"Not that impressed!Only stayed one night after long flight from UK, before driving up into Breckenridge.Waiting a very long time for shuttle bus and just didn't seem to have enough buses operating to cope with peak-evening demand!Missed evening welcome snacks/drinks as waited so long for shuttle bus.Nothing special about the hotel.Rooms ok - seemed dark & in need of massive refurb.Evening meal menu was limited & bland!Breakfast selection again limited & bland!I have stayed in a few Embassy Suites and don't think I would now return - all have same layout & need investment!",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Airport Hotel,"Stayed here for two nights in October.  A short drive and easy find from Denver International.  Staff and service was great, complimentary breakfast in the morning was also pretty good.  Rooms are spacious, the only negative comment I have, relates to the daily $14.95 Wifi charge, however there is a business suite you can use for free downstairs.  There are a few restaurants nearby and also a nice diner just down the road, this hotel is perfect for 1 or 2 nights.  If you need to get into Denver, I'd recommend you stay closer.  Southlands is only a short 15-20min drive away.  All in all, very happy indeed.  Barman (can't remember his name - bald gentleman), great guy, very attentive to everyone's needs.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Spot to Stay for an Early Morning Flight,"Only minutes from Denver International Airport, we stayed there during a snowstorm for an early morning flight.  Parking is free while you are on your trip and they provide a shuttle to DIA every half hour.  Snacks and free wine in the evening, a nice bedroom plus a living room, TVs in both rooms, it was a good place to watch the blizzard outside.  Everything is spacious, including the bar, sitting area downstairs.  Don't forget the warm cookies when you come in from the cold.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Unhappy with Embassy Suites,"Quality is a problem.  Not a premium hotel.  No Golf Channel with Presidents Cup on all weekend except at our hotel. Local information on directions was lacking, they didn't know there was not a on ramp on the freeway.  Staff attitude was just that.  They had attitude.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"I love this hotel.  Nice rooms, free food and drinks","Most of the time I am treated so well at this hotel.  The suite is a true suite with two rooms and separation between the spaces.  The managers happy hour nightly and free food is wonderful.  The same staff have been there for many years, so it must be a good place to work.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice hotel.,The hotel was great. Beds were soft. Only draw backs were the pool was small and not heated. And no Wi-Fi. It was $14.99 a day!!! Unless you are a Hilton honors member. Which I am but since I booked through a 3rd party it wouldn't work. I. Today's world no Wi-Fi is just crazy to me.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Fine for stop over,"stayed for one night on our stop over to Hawaii.  Check in fine very helpful, polite staff. The suite was fine, but a dark room.  Had salad restaurant which was good.  Breakfast good with enough choice.  Half hourly shuttle bus to airport which we used from hotel, but couldn't find it at the airport so paid for a taxi.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Horrible DIA Shuttle process and Experience,"We were on the shuttle list the eve prior, showed up at the van 10 min before departure and it was full.  Rather than kick people off who weren't on the list we lost 20 min due to staff arguing.  The van left us at the hotel and finally we got a car to DIA and were running to catch our flight and missed breakfast due to the mess up.  No apologies or service.. it was our issue even though we were on the list!",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,hot tub,"as I said, hot tub was cool, not hot... we like relaxing in it after a long day of running ....   I would greatly appreciate any coupons or nights stay for free..  thank you and have a great day ..  we love to travel",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites Denver Airport,"Can't say anything bad about this hotel!  Loved the experience!  Great service, room was quite, big, comfortable.  Had 2 TV's so my husband and i didn't have to share.  Bed was very nice.  The only thing I can think of I would change is that the AC fan could stay on and have a consistent white noise.  The on/off of the unit bothered me a bit.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Place stay near DIA,This was a perfect hotel for me to stay in while I went away for the weekend.  Parking was free and there is a free shuttle to and from DIA.  Love the evening reception and breakfast in the morning.  Hotel staff was very friendly.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place near the airport,"This is a clean, reliable hotel near the airport.  Free happy hour drinks from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.  Was also give a $10 restaurant coupon. Rooms were a great size, with large, clean bathroom. All the staff was as courteous as could be.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Coming and Going,"Stayed on way to fly fishing vacation, and again on way back.  Well kept hotel.  Friendly staff.  Nice indoor pool and outdoor hot tub.  Excellent complimentary evening reception.  Good cooked-to-order breakfast.  Reasonably priced.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient one night stay after arriving at Denver Intl. Airport (DIA),We chose this hotel as we were arriving late at DIA from the UK and did not want to be driving straightaway. We got a taxi from the airport to the hotel for less than $30 (4 passengers). We were slightly concerned at first as we seemed to be driving to the middle of no-where but after 10 minutes a cluster of hotels appeared out of the darkness (all the usual national and international chains plus a few restaurants).The rooms were very nice and as suites had the separate lounge area with its own TV. We went down to get a bar meal (service was fine for drinks but slow for food).We booked a seat on the free shuttle bus service back to the airport the next morning and then grabbed the rental car shuttle bus (they all pull up in the same area at DIA) to get our car from Alamo (who were excellent). I would have no problem staying here again though I would have a good look at the other hotels also as they are all situated together.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight near Denver Airport,"Great location, clean and well maintained facility and friendly staff.  Convenient breakfast service with good choices, and a nice reception in the evening with drinks, snacks, etc.  Easy access to airport with shuttle service.  Good internet service.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A great place to stay near the Denver Airport,"I have stayed at this hotel twice and both times were impressed with the efficiency and friendliness of the front desk staff, as well as the attractiveness of the restaurant/atrium area.   We arrive around 6:45 p.m. and were hungry and wanting to watch the BRONCO football game.  The restaurant, located in the center of the hotel, has big screen HD televisions on multiple sides of the bar.  We comfortably ate a delicious meal in the spacious and quiet (surprisingly) open seating area while enjoying our favorite team win its game!  We chose this hotel because we were picking up family members at the airport the following morning and because the hotel is comfortable, clean, quiet, and attractively decorated.  I will definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Terrific, but pricey","Great place to enjoy a get away. About pricey, but free drinks and snacks compensates. Perfect room. Great beds. Fantastic breakfast. Made to order omelets, good choices, tons of food. Great pool.Outside hot tub that was hot! Very quiet. We tried their park and fly deal. Free parking for 12 days. Will do that again! Just don't count on the shuttles being on time and you'll be fine. Lol.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A high quality hotel by Hilton,"This hotel, like all Embassy Suites, offers many things--a manager's reception each night with drinks and hor'dourves, a delicious buffet breakfast with great omelets, a quiet and spacious room that includes a separate sitting area, and a courteous, friendly and helpful staff. Embassy Suite hotels are in my opinion top-of-the-line in all respects. Their website is denverinternationalairport.embassysuites.com.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Tucker Burnett Family Reunion,The overall review from the family that stayed there was not good. The breakfast everyday had a long wait even at 7am this was unacceptable with the price of the rooms.The rooms were not kept clean Our Sunday banquet !! Poor not enough seating for the amount of people booked and the host for the hotel were very horrible. The situation was we booked a certain amount of people but children under five were not charged. When tried to explain this to the ladies in charge of providing us service they were very rude and did not want to bring extra chairs because even if a child is under 5 they still need a seat. The food was not readily available to us because the chef was not on duty. We has used the hotel previously and it was great but this time was very poor. The sales team when having a large function should make sure that someone responsible will be on hand when a problem arise. Therefore we will not be using this location in the future for our family reunion.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not pleased with the shuttle service to DIA!,"We have stayed here multiple times. This Hotel is ok but not exceptional. It is clean and that is very very important. That said the shuttle leaves some things to be desired. We had signed up for the shuttle service the evening we checked in. The problem is the front desk staff allows people to board the shuttle who have not signed up so when we arrived in the front lobby to board our shuttle it was full. Full of people that did not sign up. So we had to wait for another shuttle to get to DIA. We made our flight ok but very frustrating. When we arrived back from our vacation I called the hotel and they said shuttle was on the way. Since we have used this multiple times we went to the island we always had gone to, to wait and wait and wait. We were not told the pick up was at a different location so we waited over an hour. Our flight landed at 4PM MDT and we still had a three hour drive home which is in CDT so that is why we were very disappointed in shuttle service.  For a clean hotel this one has always been very good.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Whereat spot to go to before or after a plane trip.,"This was very near Denver Airport and offered a shuttle service and free seven day parking as part of the add-ons. Fantastic early evening treat of free drinks and half price appetisers. Food was good and generous. Rooms were very nice, and all were accessed through a central Antrim which had the lounge and bar at its base. Clean and very well priced. Will DEFINETY be back. Thanks.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,hotel resturant,wated half hr no one came to table like i was not there the hotel was satisfactery and clean but the rest service was unaceptable for this brand of hotel i have stayed at this brand on bussiness travle many times and had good experance,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Awesome hotel,"I stayed in this property many time for business and leisure travel.  5 Gold stars across the board, easy check in, nice room, good fitness center, good business center, reasonable rates, helpful staff, great food.  I will definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Double billed,"At check out, I paid with a debit card even though I gave a credit card when I checked in so that they did not have to put such a large hold on my debit card.  The woman at check out billed my card for my room and another's room. Not good.  Called the hotel they said I needed to talk to accounting.  Left a message; still no call back.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Unbelievably quiet,"Despite its proximity to the airport, Embassy Suites is unbelievably quiet. I also appreciate the easy accessibility of sidewalks to enjoy the fresh air after a day of meetings. The area is pleasant and safe. I watched the sun set over the mountains with an unobstructed view. It was the perfect way to end a stressful day.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Best Hotel for DIA Overnights,"Just what the title says! I'm a top-tier Hilton elite guest and love this place. The location and airport shuttles are excellent. The suites are wonderful; great bathrooms, comfy beds, easy-to-use TVs, and quick elevators.One of my favorite things at an Embassy Suites is their breakfast, it's outstanding! Cooked-to-order eggs, fresh fruits & breads, juice, etc. This is a great all-around Hotel run by an excellent team. Once again, thank you, Evan D & team. Look forward to seeing you again!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Will DEF visit again!!!!,"Stayed here from Sept 11 - 14, 2015. Clean room/hotel. Comfy bed. Free made to order breakfast (yummy!!!). Close to airport. Very friendly staff. ZERO complaints!!! Grabbed a business card on our way out, so we know where to go next time we're in the area!!!*Did not visit pool or hot tub, so cannot comment. Looked as if the hot tub is OUTSIDE, which could be nice , pending the weather. Indoor pool.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great!,"Staff incredibly helpful!  After checking into hotel, the shuttle driver arrainged to pick us up at the rental car company so we could turn the car in and not worry about it in the AM. Then we were able to get shuttle to airport in AM. Evening reception was nice! Room spotless, comfy.  Included Breakfast buffet was great!  Way better than other ""breakfast"" at other hotels.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Close to the Airport,"Stayed here since I had a quick turnaround/early morning flight.  The room was nice and clean.  the front desk staff were polite and welcoming when checking in.  The atmosphere in the place was very welcoming and enjoyable.  I used the business center and had no issues with the equipment.  The manager's social was nice, but I had to keep calling the bartender to my location after ordering my drinks because he would forget to fill my order.  it happened on multiple occasions.  Definitely could improve in this area.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice Hotel,Great service...nice rooms...The couch in the suite could use an update but the rest of the room is well appointed....enjoyed the breakfast and evening reception.  Love the shuttle service to the airport...staff is very friendly!  I will be back!!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Let down by its size, poor wifi and noisy aircon","Nothing much to recommend this hotel.  Air conditioning was so loud it was like a ships engine room.  Wifi was so slow I could feel myself aging. Because the hotel is large there is in theory a big selection and an egg man.  But in practice  the staff could not keep up with the demand, various things could not be kept filled and the egg man queue was long. On the plus side the reception staff were welcoming and helpful with advice.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Stay on Labor Day Weekend,"Clean rooms, great 2 room Suites, reasonably priced and very convenient to the airport.  The service at the evening reception was top notch.  The complimentary breakfast included an omelet bar. This is my second stay at this Embassy Suites property and I will stay here again the next time I have business, or family business, at Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very clean and secure,"Quiet and prompt to the customer needs and excellent taste with the design of the hotel. Everyone enjoying the atmosphere and happy faces of the employees. Very clean and family oriented, security lights all over the properties with confidence with the shuttle driver from airport to the hotel very pleasant and efficient.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Breakfast is a disaster,"They have set up the breakfast line so it moves only as fast as the one cook can put out omelets.  This morning there were always 40 folks waiting in line.  One cook puts out the omelets, he's the same guy that will hand you a couple limp pieces of bacon if thats all you want, so the wait is the same.  The set up at Hampton is way better - the omelet station is separate from the rest of the offerings.  To be honest, there's a  Village Inn just two blocks away from the ES, within walking distance, with much better breakfasts, true, they're not free but you get what you pay for.   Most hotel chains have free coffee in the hotel lobby - not this one.   I give this hotel at least 3 stars because it has a fine fitness room.  The hot tub outside is fine but a little tempermental.  The kids love the pool.   There was a wedding with reception and dance and everyone appeared to enjoy it.   So read all the reviews, forgive the hotel manager for so much apologizing but nothing actually done to remedy all the problems.  He/she obviously never waits in her own breakfast line.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Disappointed for an Embassy suites.,One of our favorites is always been Embassy Suites and we've never had to look at TripAdvisor to look at the reviews because I've always been wonderful however. This Embassy Suites need some work. It is old. No the noise from outside was ok inside it was very noisy. The managers need to work on controlling the noise level from everybody inside till 1:30 in the morning. So the room had two phones on one worked. Soda vending machines were right outside the room you need to buy a pass in advance to use them so you have to go to the first floor to purchase any drinks or food if you didn't have the pass. Staff was very nice though and did go out of their way to extend this to a one o'clock checkout. Don't rule this place out but don't expect it to be as good as most Embassy Suites. I think in the future we will have to look at TripAdvisor reviews for Embassy Suites which we have never had to do before.,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Everything was AWESOME!,"Every Hotel staff was lovely and very helpful! The amenities this hotel offered were great and enjoyable, especially the cooked to order breakfast and complimentary drinks in the evening reception! Location is perfect with complimentary shuttle service to and from DIA. I will recommend this hotel to everyone and definitely stay here every time I am in the Denver area!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Dated- stay elsewhere ,"With so many hotels in the area, I'd suggest somewhere else. Service from staff was at a slightly rude level and rooms are dated. They were fine but given the choice wouldn't stay here again. Not the worst hotel, rooms were clean and spacious but the furniture in the extra suite room was gross.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Far too expensive for low level accommodation.,"We stayed at this hotel in the end of July and found our room tired looking with stains on the carpets and upholstery. The main areas of the hotel could Zlso do with some updating. I know airport hotels can be expensive, but compared to downtown Denver hotels of a much higher standard this seems poor value.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Hmmm good!,"After a day of enjoying the Arts District in Denver, we checked into our hotel. Beautiful building and appointments, attentive staff and a clean, comfortable suite. The managers reception was our appetizer to a delicious dinner from the restaurant, served to us in the lobby. Breakfast the next morning with the cooked to order omelet and homemade biscuits and gravy, fantastic.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great experience,"The Park and Fly availability worked great and there was no additional charge to park there for a week. The breakfast was delicious and even included omelets made to order. Room were clean and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. Shuttles to airport were on time as scheduled. Waited for about thirty minutes at the airport for the return shuttle, but other then that, a very positive experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice airport hotel,"I always enjoy staying at an Embassy Suites. And I really liked this one. The room was a basic 2-room suite, lots of space for two. My husband had plenty of privacy for morning conference calls. It was well decorated and very clean. The lobby restaurant was very nice, and we enjoyed our dinner there. The staff was very helpful and friendly... more than average. The hotel isn't quite as close to the airport as I thought it would be. But the trip, maybe 10 minutes, is to easy to navigate. And the space between the hotel and the airport is so open that, if you have a view toward the airport, you can actually see the flights come in. It's located in an area with other hotels and some mid-range priced restaurants. I would definitely stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent for our meeting,"This was a great spot for a meeting of seven colleagues from different parts of the country. The hotel was standard Embassy Suites and was very comfortable. The staff was especially helpful and friendly. The early evening refreshments were great, as was the breakfast.  Our group had a served lunch which was excellent. The meeting room suited us well. Wi-fi was free for Hilton Honors members.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A Great Experience,"This was our final stay at a hotel in Colorado before flying back home and it was, by far the best we had experienced.  The bed was comfortable and the breakfast was outstanding.  The staff was helpful.  We would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient to the airport,"In the spirit of Embassy Suites and Hilton, this is a good property. It is very convenient to the airport and handles the transient guests very well. Overall a good hotel even if it is a bit expensive relatively.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Hotel is set up to trick guest,I have stayed at many hotels and have  never heard of a hotel where they would charge you for accessing the internet.  Most hotels i have stayed at would provide me with a password if it is require to access the internet.  The staff at this hotel did not provide me with a password to access the internet and as a result i ended  up connecting to the internet using the room number along with my last name and incurred a $14.95 charge.  It is deceitful and a ploy for them to charge guests extra and unnecessarily.  Customer service is not the best.  The sheets as well as the pillow cases were not even changed.  Very disappointed and will not stay at any embassy suites in the future.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay,Spent a couple days here to be close to airport and my parents.  Hotel was clean and very comfortable.  Breakfast was outstanding.  Missed the managers reception and bought a couple drinks.  Prices high but cannot complain.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,one night enough,The room we got had a clogged sink and slow drain in bathroom tub and leaking kitchenette sink. I had to fix the shower curtain liner and I had to call service 3 times for the leaks.  Also we never got any notice of the complimentary breakfast at all and found out it was going to close about 15 min before it did because we were swimming.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,End of our Vacation,We stayed at Embassy Suites on our last night in Colorado because we are familiar with the good service provided by that hotel. We had an early morning flight and we wanted to be near the airport. The staff was very helpful and we had no problem getting an early start for our journey home.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,So quiet and clean,"The hotel room was quiet and clean.  It was the most comfortable bed ever.  Had free drinks and a wonderful meal.  So it was very busy with a bunch of soccer kids, but they handled it well and the rooms were so quiet.  We stayed there the night before our flight and it was perfect.  Enjoyed the breakfast the next morning too.  Will stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good Airport Location,Outstanding staff at this hotel with good shuttle service to the airport and bar/restaurant open late which is most helpful when traveling.  Rooms typical Embassy Suite.We have stayed here before and would go back.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Our room was worn and tired,"Stayed one night before flight home.  Marshmallow beds, stained carpeting in sitting room, very worn and faded seat cushions on sofa, cigarette burn hole in side chair cushion, dirty upholstery.  But, staff was friendly and everything else was what you'd expect from an Embassy Suites.  Place needs a good room interior update and all would be well.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Disappointment at Embassy Suites,"We choose to stay overnight at this location, so that we would be close to the airport.   We had a flight at 0600 and did not want to stress about arrival for the flight.   Were told upon arrival that the shuttle was full . . . had to arrange for our own shuttle ($40.00 fee)First time that we've ever been disappointed by a Hilton property.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Awesome Hotel and Very Convenient to DIA,"First this Embassy Suites really delivered.  We stayed for a park and fly and the shuttle service was great. They have their own shuttle, so you don't have to go to half a dozen hotels en route to DIA.  Room was peasant and spacious, though a little dark in the front.  Happy hour was wonderful as was the breakfast with made to order omelets and pancakes.  Staff was wonderful throuhgout, from the shuttle drivers to front desk as well as happy hour, breakfast and dining room staff.  We have stayed in a number of airport hotels near DIA and this has been hands down the best experience.  Our new hotel of choice for DIA travel.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great hotel, late 90's internet","The staff and service, as well as the facilities were excellent.  Everyone was efficient, kind, cheerful, and great at their jobs.  The only low marks came for the internet connection.  I've travelled a lot for business, and in my opinion, a less than 1 up/1 down connection is not acceptable in a business hotel. This property would need to upgrade its bandwidth for me to return in the future...which I would love to do, because everything else about the experience was top notch.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Perfect for our needs,"Our families were flying out early in the am and we needed a place to settle in after a long day on the road. The rate was excellent for a suite on a Sun night. Restaurant service was excellent with menu  choices all the kids could be happy with. Free full breakfast also included. Suites were clean, room was even equipped with a refrigerator, wi if extra. Only 5 miles from airport!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nasty and dated rooms,The ES at DEN is terrible. I will never stay here again. I literally laid in my bed thinking about all the surrounding nastiness in the room. The carpets are filthy. Stains all over the floor. The property looks like it has not been renovated since the property was built. I am a Hilton diamond member and I stay in hotels all over the world and this is one of the worst Hilton properties I have experienced. Stay away!,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Excellent staff, OK room","This Embassy Suites is close to the airport and the hotel provides a shuttle.  It's about a 5 minute ride between the airport and the hotel.   The hotel staff was wonderful and helpful.  Dining areas were clean and inviting.  The room itself could use a little work.  Overall, it was a good experience.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Excellent Customer Service, Great Room","We have stayed at this hotel a few times and it is consistently good.  The staff are amazingly nice and helpful.  Close to the airport and downtown.  We prefer to stay here for the free parking, rather than staying downtown.  Feels a lot safer than downtown, as well.  Great views.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient to Airport,"Stayed here on a business trip. It was convenient to the airport. Had free parking but the lot was incredibly full and had to park on the street across from the hotel. The buffet breakfast was good, but the meat choices were limited (meaning they had no bacon or sausage). Not good for a meat eater like me. The typical suite was worth the hotel fee since I was traveling with 4 of my children, the room was ample.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Room too warm, thermostat not accurate, AC contolled by ?",Stayed on the 7th floor and it was way too warm despite cranking the thermostat down to the 60s.  After a sleepless night I complained to the front desk and a maintenance tech quickly responded.  The maintenance tech advised the thermostat had an energy savings mode that would not allow the air-conditioner to go below 69 degrees regardless of the temperature the guest entered.  When we told him we could enter a lower temp and it would display as though it was meeting that temp he said there was another controller (thermostat) that actually controlled how cool it would go and that was set at 69 degrees. The maintenance tech said he could only reduce the temp setting to 67 degrees which he did and then departed.  Later that night it was obvious the room temperature was well above 67 degrees so we pulled out a camping thermometer and it displayed 76 degrees. Every person we encountered working at the hotel was extremely polite and the morning breakfast was above average with a variety of fresh berries every day.  Most everything about the stay was very good except the room temperature.  I would be reluctant to stay at this property again because of the inability to sleep due to the heat and more importantly that the thermostat temperature is actually governed by property management but my room thermostat falsely indicated I had control of the setting.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Conference Perfect,"I recently stayed at the Embassy Suites while at a Rotary Conference in Denver. I was picked up by the free shuttle at the airport and taken to hotel.  They had a lovely lobby and to my delight, a free happy hour daily with a nice bar centrally located in the lobby/dining area.  I confused my reservation some, and they were very gracious in accommodating my change request.  The room included a living room/working area complete with a mini-fridge, coffee pot and microwave.  The rooms were clean, stocked and had ample space. The WIFI worked well without connectivity issue and the food served by the hotel during the conference was nice.  During our meeting the microphone had some feedback issues, so I recommend testing all of that prior to your meeting start time, walking around the room where you plan to present from, to test it appropriately.I had to leave at 4:30 a.m. to catch my departure flight and again the shuttle was there and delivered us back to the airport free of charge.I would recommend the Embassy Suites for business travel and conference space.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Exactly what you expect from Embasy Suites.,"This is a great Embasy Suits, but I don't think I've ever stayed at one that I wasn't happy with. I'm not sure how old this property is, but it feels newish. My room was very clean and comfortable, unfortunately it was a smoking, but it only had a slight smoke smell that went away after a minute of being in the room. Room service was very good and the breakfast buffet was also. The staff was friendly and helpful, they are only a few minutes from the airport and they have parking for buses and large RV's on a dead end side street next to the hotel. There is at lest one restaurant within walking distance.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great location!,"The hotel is located approximately two miles from the rental car return, which is really convenient if you have an early flight out like we did. The hotel itself is situated near a business park with a few restaurants nearby. The hotel is really quiet and is located right next to the highway to get to/from the airport, which is nice for those that need a place to stay nearby the airport.Service was excellent and our room was bigger than others I've had at other Embassy's, very spacious (including the bathroom), and great views of downtown Denver from our room. The evening reception, as with all Embassy's, was excellent and the bar and snacks area were really nice. The reception area was really open, and made it easy for guests to find areas to sit.Would definitely stay again if landing in Denver late, or headed back home early in the morning.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel ,"We only stayed one night, but it was very comfortable.  Enjoyed the evening reception, and breakfast was fantastic!  We used the airport shuttle which was on time, and our driver was a great guy and very friendly!  When we returned to Denver, the shuttle was waiting for us.  No waiting at all!  Loved the service, and will use it again!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good experience,"Stayed 1 night after flying to Denver on the way to Estes park. There are several negative reviews online. My experience was positive. Good check in, friendly front desk, friendly bar tender for the evening reception, (but poor snack choices). Good clean room and an outstanding breakfast. My wife said the omelet was the best she had tasted. Great option for staying by the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Comfortable and Quiet,"My room was very comfortable, Embassy typically has very nice facilities, comfortable beds, and fine linens.  The room was quiet, the hotel lobby adequate, the made-to-order breakfast very good, the business facilities functional, and the hotel staff very nice.  I enjoyed and would stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Worth the money!,"Very impressed with the Embassy! Great happy hour and the breakfast is great for families. Free parking for a week if you book a room there, which is worth it!! Free drinks and breakfast along with a great room makes me always want to return to Embassy!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Nice hotel, but dine elsewhere","My first indication that I might be in for an interesting stay was the airport shuttle bus that smelled like rotten milk. Turns out there was an abandoned milk carton under one of the seats. The front desk staff were great, my suite was very nice; clean and spacious. My dining and bar experience was not so good. It was obvious the bartender wanted to be somewhere else, the kitchen was not prepared to be busy, and the short menu provided few options. When my food arrived it was cold and not good. If you are staying here after traveling or before, plan on eating at the airport, the food is much better. I stay at Hilton family hotels everywhere I go with few exceptions and have found their food choices mediocre at best, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but the Embassy Suites family of hotels is usually a little more on the high end of the spectrum, Not so at the Denver airport.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Experience,"I stayed for three nights for a work conference.  The conference rooms where very nice and set up very well.  Overall, the hotel is very clean with a nice staff.  Complimentary breakfast beats most hotels:  omelet station!  The hotel is about 20 minutes outside of Denver and about 10 minutes from the airport.  I found Uber to be the cheapest and easiest way to get to Denver from the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Okay hotel, but GREAT service","I'd say this hotel is a 3 and the service is a 5. Hence the 4! I'm happy to hear renovations are planned. That will really liven the place up! The towels are pretty rough and scratchy, but the room was clean. The service was FANTASTIC! Particularly from Mike in the bar. He went out of his way to make our stay superb. Thanks, Mike!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Restaurant Personnel Disappointment,"I love Embassy Suites; however, the food personnel were unattentive to the point of rude.  The hotel's location is awesome and the front desk/check in person was absolutely awesome.  I would stay again but not expect food staff to be pleasant!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"July 10, 2015","excellent experience overall.  Quiet room, suite setup really great.  Ability to close the door to the bedroom a real plus.  Only criticism is that the carpets showed dirt spots and stains.  I have stayed at other Embassy Suites where this is also a problem.  Not sure whether this is a cleaning / maintenance issue or just poor color / quality of carpeting.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Shabby rooms,We just stayed here for one night because we had an early flight out and wanted to be close to the airport. Our room was not what we expected.  It was clean but there were several large stains on the carpet and the room was kind of outdated and run down.  We picked the hotel because Embassy Suites usually nice really nice rooms.  We have stayed here before a few years ago and did not have this experience.  Had we been staying for longer than the one night we would definitely have checked out.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great overall Family Stay,"We needed a hotel to accomidate 5 people.  Embassy Suites was a great choice.  Nice pool, fitness area,evening reception & breakfast was awesome for a family of five. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A Cut Above,"I travel extensively for my work and stay at Embassy Suites whenever it is feasible. While they all offer great amenities (full, made-to-order breakfast, good fitness facilities, pool, Manager's Reception, etc.), I have learned that not all Embassy Suites are equal in customer service.   The Embassy Suites Airport, on Tower Rd, has all the amenities plus exceptional customer service.  I do not say this often or lightly; they are a cut above.  Friendly, helpful, professional, courteous...they are the epitome of what I expect from this brand. I consistently stay there whenever I'm in town for business. Even though it is normally 30-40 minutes where my meetings take place, it is worth the effort.  Take my word, you will not be disappointed.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Our family of 4 stays for the breakfast and convenient location to airport,"My family and I absolutely love Embassy Suites in general.  The main reason we stay is for the full buffet breakfast they offer and if the timing is right we try and hit up the managers special too.  We really like having 2 rooms to separate our 4 year old and almost 2 year old to assist with everyone sleeping as well as possible.     I appreciate the car sleep free package they offer with free shuttle to the airport.  We take a yearly trip to Hawaii and tend to need parking for a little over two weeks.  This time around we had the chance to use the pool and hot tub.  I appreciate the hot tub being located outside and the pool is a good size.  One weird thing was that we found a baby frog swimming in the pool.  It took a while for maintenance to get there (roughly 10-15 minutes and it was freaking my daughter out) and my husband just used his hand to remove it safely and placed it outside.    We plan to stay again, but do think the rooms are outdated for the price you  pay.  For almost $210 for one night, I would like to stay in a more updated room.  I read in a review they are planning to renovate.  I look forward to seeing the change.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,awesome,"loved the hotel, the restaurant and breakfast - our waiter at dinner was amazing, attentive and, while busy, still found time to answer questions and talk without us feeling like he had to. Was amazed at the selection at breakfast and it was FREE!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Breakfast,"Hotel staff were attentive, A lack of staff at breakfast made for a rather messy area in dinning room and around cereal buffet. Cook to order breakfast needs to have an expediter to keep line moving, layout of buffet is not efficient.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,corner room is the very best,"corner executive room is the best, makes it quiet being a 2 room suite but is off the atrium as well. even the 'kid' noise was dampened being off the main lobby area. Staff very good. We stayed on 6th floor for premium, but not sure it is worth the extra $20 per night. Even with a comforter pad the bed is very stiff though.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Terrible & Run Down,Restaurant is ok but hotel itself is old and dumpy. Shuttle service has to be the worst of all the airport hotels.  We waited 50 minutes for the shuttle to come and watched other hotel shuttles loop around at least twice while waiting.  And it wasn't that much cheaper. Hilton should be embarrassed to operate this hotel.,1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great hotel, airport location for park and fly","All the 5 star amenities you would expect at a Hilton. Snacks at night in the lobby are a nice touch, and staying on the premium floor was good, free soda and snacks from the vending machine. Although this is a very busy hotel the rooms are quiet. We had to get up early to catch our flight, and we're disappointed we would miss the amazing breakfast but they had put out fruit and coffee for us, which was great! The one thing I will say about the park and ride is that the timing needs to be better. We called ahead to make sure a shuttle was on the way to pick us up from DEN, was told it would be 40 minutes, and then when they got there it was already full. So we had to send one person in our party back to get our car while we waited another half hour. So, in the future I expect that if I'm paying to stay and park that my shuttle should be on time.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight prior to early morning flight,"We had stayed at this hotel many years ago, and chose it this time because of the Manager's reception and convenient shuttle to Denver Airport. During the 5:30-7:30pm reception, it was apparent that many children were there, most with their parents. I inquired of the managers on duty whether the large number of children was normal, and they said this was most unusual. I learned later that many were competing in a national baseball competition.Offered free at the reception were two beer choices: Shock Top and Bud. A house wine, Copper Ridge, was offered, and a margarita made with Shock Top beer. Snacks included cheese, crackers, crudités,and several snack mixes; also some candies. The lobby area was mostly full, so the reception is quite popular.Our suite was comfortable, and it was nice to prepare a cup of tea there. My one complaint was that the tub filled with water while I showered, since the drain did not work properly.Free parking was included in my rate, but I did not end up leaving my car there during my Alaska trip.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Perfect for Park and Fly,"We stayed here one night, and left our car for four nights. The cost of the one night stay and the parking was less than if we would've parked at the airport. It was really a lot more convenient because the hotel has a shuttle that you reserve a spot on when going to the airport, and it only takes about 10 minutes to get there. When we returned to Denver, the shuttle was waiting and the we were returned to our car quickly, and the shuttle driver even offered us a bottle of water. AWESOME service!The room was a regular suite, nice and spacious. This will now be my go-to spot for parking with an overnight stay near the airport!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,MY STAY,Embassy Suites is a great place to stay...no question. From their brunch to their manager welcome to their professional staff. It is a very clean hotel and professional staff as well. My only regret is not being able to stay longer.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Wonderful Service!,"We spent one night at this Embassy Suites hotel before flying home the next day from the Denver airport.  We were greeted by two friendly front desk staff members.  I explained my husband would like to return our rental car that evening, then take the rental car shuttle bus to the airport, and I was hoping the hotel shuttle could then pick him up from the airport and bring him back to the hotel.  The front desk informed me that would be no problem, and the hotel shuttle could even pick him up right at the car rental location!  When I asked the car rental place where to wait for the Embassy Suites shuttle, the car rental employee looked at me in surprise and said, ""Hotel shuttles never pick up customers from here!""  I told him, ""My hotel does!""  Sure enough, right on schedule, I saw the Embassy Suite shuttle with the driver.  How nice and what great extra service!  We did make a stop at the airport to pick up other guests, but it was so nice to have one less hoop to jump through in getting back to the hotel.  The hotel itself is very nice (typical Embassy Suite layout), quiet, great pillows and room layout, clean and well run.  This is definitely one of my favorite hotel chains!  Also, if you need shuttle service to the airport, remember to sign up for a reserved spot at the front desk.  The Denver Airport security check-in takes at least 40 minutes some days, so leave yourself plenty of time!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Place when Traveling from other parts of the state,Free Parking/Shuttle to Airport - Free Breakfast Free Drinks ... what else do you need. Always Clean and welcoming to add!   This is the place to stay when traveling as it is close to the airport and parking is expensive at DIA so I park here stay a night and relax,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Housekeeping is very poor here,"I stay here once in a while as a part of business travel.  On two of the last 3 visits I found hair in my shower, first time on the shower wall and the shower ceiling and the second time on the shower wall.  And I'm not talking about a little bit of hair, we're talking large wads of hair.  Also, one of these times someone had either blown their nose on the wall or wiped mucus on the wall above the refrigerator (where the coffee pot resides).  I'm not usually fussy, but these levels of uncleanliness seem unacceptable to me.  If I were travelling on my own or with my family I would not stay here after these experiences.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites DIA,Cigarette Smoke! Smoking in Rooms? Really? YUKKKK! Whole floor smelled like cigarette smoke even in our Non Smoking Room. YUUUUUUUKKKKK Stinky YUUUUUUUK Stinky disgusting!!!!!!!! Why would ANY hotel allow smoking in rooms in this modern day society?,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,This is Great for an Airport hotel,"This Embassy Suites has all of the amenities that all Embassy suites have - clean, large suites, excellent television and choice of channels. Warm welcome at the desk. Best of all the breakfast..especially if you are going to be traveling all day and not sure about the next meal. I've stayed in several hotels around the Denver airport. This is the only one that I want to use now!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Stay...Close to the Airport,"My husband and I have stayed at this Embassy Suites numerous times when visiting the Denver area.  Our most recent stay was in May of this year (2015).  Once again, we had an excellent stay.  The hotel is clean, service is good and the rooms are spacious.  The breakfast is very good and has many offerings.  The seating area for breakfast is large and accommodates many guests easily.  The location of the hotel near the airport is perfect for those early flights.  If you are renting a vehicle the rental companies are very close and if you need a ride back the hotel offers a terrific shuttle service.  I have taken the shuttle service on multiple occasions and have found it to be on time each and every time.  The drivers have been very helpful with bags as well as very friendly.  If you need a ride to the airport do not hesitate to use the shuttle!I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it if you are in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay,Hotel extremely well run and organized.  Staff was more then helpful and accommodating.  Stayed here with my family and great room and nice amenities.  Close to the airport and allowed for a late check out with us having a late day flight so the kids could enjoy the pool longer.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good Accommodations for Layover,"We stayed one night. They offer free shuttle service to and from the airport. When  you land you need to call the hotel for pick-up and when you check-in at the hotel you need to reserve a seat for the shuttle service to the airport as seating is limited.We flew in on a red eye 6 hour flight that was delayed by two hours (for a total of 8 hours in a plane) and we were exhausted to say the least, we tried to check-in early, but unfortunately because it was the day after the Memorial Day weekend the room that we reserved was not ready.  But when we inquired if there were any rooms available for early check-in, the young lady at the Front Desk was very helpful and said there was a standard room that was available and the only difference we were told between the room we reserved and this room was the layout and the standard room did not come with ""free"" wifi.  We said no problem, as we really needed to get some much needed sleep.  She even let us have the ""free"" wifi.The room was great as it was around the corner towards the end of one hallway (not in the atrium area) so it was very quiet.  The room was very spacious with a sitting area that had a sofa, sitting chair, TV, small dinette table with two chairs a wet bar, microwave and small fridge.  The bedroom was clean and spacious as was the bathroom.  The complimentary breakfast provided the standard fare of coffee, tea, juices, milk, cereals, cut fruits, breakfast meat, potatoes, scrambled eggs, toast and pastries, but the great thing was there was also an omelette station.  Ate lunch at the Claim Bar and Restaurant, the chicken club sandwich and soup of the day was delicious.  We didn't feel like venturing out for dinner and ate at the restaurant again for dinner.  The burger and sandwiches were tasty according to my son and husband but the steaks that my other son and I ordered were overcooked as were the side vegetables.  The wait help was attentive and friendly.   Overall, the accommodations were good and the staff efficient and friendly.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Exceptional Accomodations,"Beautiful rooms with breakfast and happy hour.  Shuttle to the airport and convenient to restaurants.  Restaurant in hotel.  Highly recommended for Park, Sleep, and Fly from Denver International airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay close to airport,"We stayed one night so that we would be close to the airport for our morning flight out of Denver.  We took advantage of the free drinks & snacks for happy hour, and ended up ordering supper during this time as well.  The service was wonderful, especially for a complimentary ""happy hour"".  Very attentive staff.  We ordered off the menu & happened to get half priced appetizers for supper as well, so we couldn't beat the price.  Desk staff was courteous.  It was very comfortable & easy to get to the airport the next day.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Comfortable ,"Great staff, very clean rooms, wonderful stay. Shuttle seemed to take a while to get to airport but got to airport quickly. I recommend Vinny's for grub which is in walking distance for food. Hallway was very quiet and had an amazing night sleep.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Perfect Stay!,"Everything at this property was great. Although I didn't get to stay for long and experience all the hotel offered, every employee I met was charming and helpful. I will definitely stay at this hotel each time my plans bring me to the area. Thank you all for making such a lasting impression.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Check Out,"Make it a conscious effort to check your bill before you leave the facility. I appreciate the staff wanting to use the internet for all transactions but there may be charges on your bill that were not authorized. Once you have left the premises, it is very hard to get the charges reversed.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not for Parkers,"Their shuttle takes the longest. We sat at the airport waiting for it and watched every other hotel's shuttle go by TWICE. We did not have our nice care, luckily because the lot is the sketchiest, out on the edge. I remembered that this is the hotel where my dad's car was broken in to. The hotel is nice and a great value but don't choose this one if you're leaving your car for the duration of your trip.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,nice hotel,"good customer service, smells clean(no smoking smell), staff is attentive, checkin and checkout were swift..   we did not use the breakfast this time so can't comment on that.  parking was little bit of an issue.. but great place to stay overall",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,No free wi-fi,"Handy for the airport but remote for any other purpose.  Not particularly cheap for only a twelve hour stay but the cooked breakfast was good. In this day and age, charging extra for wi-fi is simply greedy in my opinion.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place,"Close to the airport, a really good stay. Must have had a great pool because there was a lot of kids running around wrapped in towels. Open bar for guess 5-7 with appetizer 1/2 price and free snacks. Nice big rooms and great bed, of course we had camping for 3 night before. We ended up getting an appetizer and split a burger, it was plenty.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Perfect for a early flight,We had an early flight and were coming for outside Denver so we decided to stay here. Have used Embassy Suites in other places before with good experience and this was no exception. Good clean and comfortable room.(all have separate bedrooms) Staff was very helpful. We turned in a rental car and they arranged to pick us up at the rental car place. One of our group was elderly and a very helpful person at the desk helped her get her Wifi set up.We ate down the street and had a night cap at the hotel-good experience.I like the breakfast bar with individual choices. Shuttle to airport was on time and very courteous,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great pre-vacation stay with Sleep-Drive-Fly benefit,"We stayed here one night using the Sleep-Drive-Fly program before an early flight the following day.  It's a very nice hotel, charming lobby with mining motif, friendly staff, and lovely suite w/ comfortable king bed.  They offer a great breakfast too with all the usual breakfast buffet fare plus made-to-order omelettes/easy over eggs, etc.  It was a short and pleasant shuttle ride to the airport, as we left our car in the hotel lot.  (Love Sleep-Drive-Fly, it's a great alternative to airport parking and the off-airport lots we generally use.)  When we returned for our car after the vacation, everything was in order.  Would definitely do this again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Family night stay,"Nice hotel well kept, digital check-in didn't work, not that big of a deal.  Be nice to be made aware menu in the room, which had more variety wasn't available in the restaurant.  When asked it was a room service menu, but 1 kitchen in the hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Pre and post vacation stay,"Great location and quick access to the airport.  Friendly front desk staff. Had dinner on our first stay during happy hour. Sebastian (the bartender) recommended a few things on the menu and he was spot on. Delicious trout!  Rooms: I think they need a little updating. Our first night we had a friend sleep on sofa bed and she had to put the mattress on the floor.  I found the main bed to be a bit soft for me and woke up with a back ache! But that's always a rather subjective issue. Pool area nice, but crowded. Decent gym with good machines. Return trip - soccer tournament kids were running all over the place!  We stayed on ""suite level"" which is rather bogus. They refunded the extra $. I thought there would be a room for drinks and snacks, but it's just a vending machine that you get a pass code to use. Everything I wanted was empty.  Don't fall for the suite level thing. Bring your own water and a snack if you need to.Little hot tub that some kids put chairs in!  Really?? Hello, parents??  I like this hotel, but not sure if I will return or not. Depends on the price.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Elevator madness,"Stayed here for one night since it's close to Denver Airport. One of the two elevators was out of order, so we waited 5-6 minutes to get to our room. Unfortunately we were sharing with hotel staff and a couple of small kids that were playing in the elevator and pushing all the elevator floor buttons. We even went floor by floor with a ""supervisor"" that laughed at our suggestion to tell the kids to stop playing in the elevator or find out what room they were in to tell their parents. Unacceptable behavior of the staff to not take charge of the situation. The same kids were running around the top floor and throwing things over the railing down below. Perhaps the staff could have responded, but the ONE elevator would be tied up, or instruct the staff to use the service elevator or stairs.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Friendly staff ,Check in a breeze. Staff was nice and rooms were clean. Stayed for a business conference. Beds were comfortable and room was ideal stayed quiet at night.Location - a few restaurants within walking distance. And many other hotels as well.Food= we were served buffet style & it Was not hot. Breakfast and dinner was cold. That's the only reason for 4/5. Otherwise liked the hotel & staff.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A very typical Embassy Suites; good service and kind staff,"Stayed here at the end of a long business trip. Check-in was slow for our group. The lobby and front desk were consistently busy when I was there and the staff seemed outnumbered by requests. The rooms are standard Embassy style with a sort of living room area and then a separate bedroom area, which is more space than I need. The wifi costs money, as usual, which is no good. When our group needed a van to rent to go shopping and do some other things, the hotel found us a wonderful driver, which was great. The lobby area was nice and large and there was a well stocked buffet breakfast which was great. Unfortunately with the Embassy design where all the rooms face in, sounds tend to travel upwards and the noise of children yelling filters through most of the rooms. Overall a nice hotel though.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great, quiet place near airport","The Embassy Suites was a great place and surprisingly quiet while being very close to the airport.The restaurant has good food, the staff is very friendly and helpful, the fitness center is nicely sized and provisioned and the rooms are clean and well maintained.Will definitely stay here again next time.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Basic basic,This is a nice hotel that will meet your needs if you are in town for a conference or overnight to fly from DEN. The biggest issue is the heating/air conditioner which is very noisy and turns off and on all night. Otherwise the hotel is clean and the staff was pleasant. Very accessible and easy to find.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Ok hotel but nothing to do in the area,"Typical Embassy Suites hotel with nice rooms and the ""manager's reception"". But that's the only bar/restaurant on site and it's rarely open it seemed.  Don't expect to find anything else to do in the hotel area as it's in the middle of nowhere.   We received great service from the staff we dealt with but there were some maintenance issues. Only 1 elevator worked during our stay, which was probably a good thing since only 1 of the 3 treadmills worked. All in all a good place to have a 1 night business meeting. But plan to be bored if you stay any longer.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Could have been better,"Impressive building and atrium and healthy, fun evening reception. But when the driver, nice as he was, to my knowledge lost my favorite pillow Shayna at the front desk had  little interest in helping resolve the problem. Nor in hearing about a now empty towel rack in the pool area, trash in the pool and a clock an hour and ten minutes off. Jim, apparently involved in maintainence, was much more helpful. As was Hilton Honors and later, the general manager. Rooms could use updating. Breakfast was hearty but not exceptional, as is that of the ES at Loveland. Needs to add a nondairy alternative and replace items that have run out during the appointed hours.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites Denver - 5 stars!,"What an excellent stay! The room was perfectly clean and really quiet. The bed and pillows were about the most comfortable that I have slept on in years, so I was able to catch up on needed sleep. The food at breakfast is second to none, with perfect omelets and other food, served by very cheerful and helpful meal staff. The manager's happy hour was most enjoyable, and was generously and deliciously supplied. The bartender went out of his way (in a good way) to be friendly and helpful, and made his guests feel quite relaxed and at home and well taken care of! The front desk staff helped me with a few different items, and were completely at ease and amicable, as nice as could be, but totally professional at the same time. I could not have asked for a better stay than I had at the Denver Airport Embassy Suites!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Poor hotel expereince.,"I was applauded to find my sheets on my KING-SIZED bed had brown stains all over them. Not knowing if these sheets were clean or dirty, I called hotel staff and gave me a smaller room and a smaller bed. This was not accommodating due to my family and I were cramped.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,It's an Embassy Suites - comfortable and predictable,"This hotel has great proximity to the airport, but was not noisy.  It has all the good Embassy Suites amenities - 2 room suites, manager's receptions, complementary breakfast, etc.  The area around the hotel has a number of other hotels and a couple of restaurants, but is pretty removed from lots of Denver.  Still, if getting to the airport early is a necessity, then this is a good choice.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,what happened to the reservation?,"What a hilton embarrassment. Had a reservation for well over a month, yet when I arrived was told only smoking rooms were available which I could have at $159 instead of $219. Seriously? What is the point of a reservation? Had to find a different hotel at 10:00 PM since I didn't want my clothes to smell like smoke during my entire stay. Not a way to treat a loyal customer.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Late to no regular shuttle service from Airport,"I was forced to rent a car as the Airport shuttle service reportedly comes every 30-40 mins. I wanted in sub-zero a couple of months ago for 1 hour. No I;m sorry maam. No ""we will send you some soup maam."" Pretty much the airhead just blew more wind my way. If it were not for business, I would not stay here. Every one was very scripted and non nonchalant when I asked them why shuttles were not often like the others in the surrounding area, blank looks. Very inexperienced to handle serious customer service problems. I had the flu and was more sick.  First trip--room was good. Second trip--sheets smelled like someone did not wash their hair.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Old, rund down","This location is horrible. The furniture was stained and the carpets were obviously more than 20 years old.  It felt like a run down Motel 6. The staff was pleasant but the property needs a redo. The ""manager's reception"" left much to be desired as well.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Time Great Staff,"Great staff, very helpful. Very clean hotel. I loved the bar and the views from my room.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Coming to hotel for almost 5 years...,The hotel staff is always wonderful.  I stay here a lot but have noticed the cleanliness of the rooms going down hill along with the freshness of the food.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Completely adequate,"This was a last minute stay and I was happy I chose ES. The property was clean, the room was clean, nice and large, comfortable bed and bedding, free parking, free breakfast including omelette bar, etc. the only thing I would say is they should have free wi-fi at this point. $12 per day at a $200/night hotel is crazy.   I will stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Last minute stay,"We were going on vacation and had an early morning flight.  Weather did not look like it was going to cooperate for a 50+ mile drive so we decided to stay at ES by the airport.  Glad we did.  Staff was great, room was a typical ES room.  It was clean and comfy.  Plus - nice perk was we got to leave our car there all week for no charge.  Shuttle was convenient both ways.  Cost of hotel vs. cost of parking at DIA - we made out +$16 - and that doesn't count all the free drinks during happy hour!  Win win!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Stay away from this Embassy Suites,"The main reason why I choose to stay in this hotel is because of location (close to airport) and free shuttle services to airport.  When I checked in, everything went smoothly.  But when I asked about the shuttle services to airport at 4am in the next morning, the staff mentioned that I need to reserve it and there is no more space left (I traveled with my family -- my wife, and my two young boys <6yrs old and 3yrs old>).  When I make the reservation, there is no written word saying the shuttle is needed to be reserved or first come first serve.  I ended up need to pay $35 dollar to get a taxi to the airport.  When I was at the taxi, there are 3 empty shuttles sitting in the parking lot and the staff has mentioned there is no spot available.  I am totally disappointed with this embassy suite services.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not Very Nice to Us,"So first let me say that my husband travels 2-3 days per year and usually stays at Hilton properties (Embassy Suites is a Hilton property).  He visits Denver 3+ times per year.  That being said, we made a reservation here about 2 months in advance and requested an airport shuttle.  When we arrived, we were told that there was no shuttle available in our time frame - and we were willing to flex up to an hour - also we would have to pay for our own cab fare to get to the airport.  We cancelled our reservation and moved to the Hampton suites nearby who had plenty of shuttle space.  We contacted the Hilton Diamond line and expressed our disappointment with the Embassy Suites shuttle service.  The manager of the Embassy suites contacted us to say he was sorry and would give us $ to reimburse us for our cab fare and inconvenience.  A day later, this individual contacted us again to say that since we had not stayed at his hotel, he would not pay anything toward our cab.  Honestly, the cab money is not the issue here for me - the issue is that the manager reaching out and then retracting his offer did not make me feel at all like I was important to his hotel and that he wanted my business.  So it's pretty certain that we won't stay here again on our next trip(s) to Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Early morning flight needed a hotel close to the airport with shuttle service,"The hotel is clean, the staff is friendly, the shuttle runs on time. There is a nice happy hour with free appetizers and drinks. The room prices change daily - the day before I arrived when I called the price was $199 per night - when I called the day of arrival the price had dropped to $169. Plenty of hotels in the area so will do the same next time and wait until the day of arrival to reserve the room.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,We love staying here when flying in and out of Denver!,A dependable place near DIA. The shuttle service is frequent and timely.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Always count on this hotel,Overall great place to stay!  You can always count on a clean and comfortable room with great service.  This hotel was located very close to the Denver airport (easy access in and out).  An alternative location is in downtown Denver near all the action (you can't go wrong with either one).  I always stay at Hilton properties... for good and obvious reasons.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,None,Close to airport and transportation to and from the airport was provided as well as parking.  A very nice hotel with reasonable prices on the night we stayed however I learned that other nights may be much more expensive.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Extremely friendly staff and beautiful hotel made our trip!,"My husband and I had an unexpected overnight stay in Denver on our way to Albuquerque.  Our disappointment quickly vanished when we boarded the courtesy van from the Airport to the Embassy Suites Hotel.  The van driver was so gracious and friendly. He shared all the things we could see and do in the city and told us about the complimentary manager's reception every evening at the hotel.  When we arrived at the hotel location, the front desk staff were also very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.  We checked into our beautiful and perfectly climate-controlled quiet suite and settled in.  The manager's reception was fabulous.  We had a delicious dinner in the restaurant and then enjoyed a few Colorado IPAs and some wine - as well as a nice selection of complimentary snacks.  The next morning, checkout was a breeze and we hopped right on the courtesy van back to the airport.  Things we loved: - knowledgeable and friendly staff - extremely clean and quiet room with a BEAUTIFUL view of the mountains - delicious cuisine in the restaurant - expansive complimentary manager's reception in the evening and breakfast in the morning - free airport shuttle with friendly staff - fast check-in/check-out",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great experience at Embassy Suites Denver Airport,"We needed a place to park our car while out of town, a place to stay when we returned from our trip, and transportation to and back from the airport.  Reggie at Embassy Suites made sure all of the above would be taken care of - and it was.  We got a great price for a wonderful room, a comfortable bed, delicious breakfast and close to the airport. We could not have been happier with our stay.",5

The staff is nice, the décor and hotel is always neat and clean.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable and always a quiet, relaxing stay.  The amenities are always good and they offer one off the best breakfasts with many items and cooked to order omelets. Their hotel in general is a great location for business or family travelers with easy access to the area and DIA.  They provide a reliable shuttle service.  Will always do repeat business with this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent transient hotel,"During our recent ski trip to Breckenridge, we had the pleasure of spending the first and final nights of our trip at this Embassy Suites.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay!,"Flew into Denver and needed to spend night before driving to ski resort.Embassy Suites was spacious and clean. Front desk employee, Shawna, was very helpful. We asked for a rollaway which they provide free of charge. The breakfast was delicious. Great stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice place,The hotel room was spacious and had all the things I needed for a great stay. the parking was great and the fact they have free shuttle service was awesome as well. I would say the price of the food and pretty steep but if you add in the gas and the hassle of finding another place to eat it this definitely evens out.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Stayed at hotel for 7 weeks for work,"What a great experience staying at this Embassy Suites...I work at Fedex and was loaned out to work for 7 weeks...The staff was top notch from the time I checked-in to when I checked out. The hotel is clean the house staff was wonderful and accommodating. I ate most of my dinners at the hotel...it has a more extensive menu than other Embassy Suites that I have stayed at...specials most nights of the week....the best was the Tomahawk short rib with creamy polenta... always creative specials...dessert was no exception....the bar staff was also exceptional...when they would see me come in and sit down I had my ""usual"" sitting in front of me with a smile and how was your day.....while the hotel was away from downtown I found it a better place to stay then downtown worked hard all week and played on the weekends. The hotel is centrally located to go to Colorado Springs to visit the Air Force Academy and the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, the Botanical Gardens in Denver, to catch a Colorado Rockies game. I look forward to go back and visit for vacation.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good stay,Very nice room with a large comfortable bed.  Separate living area is nice for those not going to bed as early. Pool was not huge and had shallow side for younger swimmers. Breakfast was wonderful.  Lots of choices!  Would stay again.  The elevator is glass and moves quickly. My kids would have ridden it for fun had I let them. 😉,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not a bad place to be stranded during a snowstorm,"During a recent business trip to Denver, I encountered a last minute change in my travel plans due to a snowstorm cancelling my original flight home.  I ended up spending two nights at this hotel with several business colleagues. We had started our time in Denver at another Embassy Suites location but moved to this one to be nearer the airport for whenever we could get home.  We found the bathrooms at this location to be much bigger than at the other location, though the breakfast buffet did not have an many options as the other location did.  The food options at the evening reception were quite paltry, though the drinks flowed (though one night there was a lengthy wait).  The restaurant ran out of many items during our stay--we assume they just weren't as prepared for the storm as they should have been--which was disappointing.  The front desk staff was a hit or miss experience--some were quite nice while others were downright rude.  When I stopped at the desk the night before my departure to reserve my seat on the airport shuttle, the front desk clerk with whom I spoke never added my name to the list.  Thankfully when I went down to deal with our bill the next morning, the mistake was able to be corrected as my shuttle time was not yet full.  Every room stayed in by a member of our party experienced problems with their bill upon checkout--either being overcharged or being billed more than once for the same night.  Overall it wasn't a bad place to be stranded during a snowstorm, though.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very poor !,"I never expected ES to be so low quality. First impression of the room: badly wrinkled bed sheets. I was very surprised...We called the front desk, they sent a lady with exactly same wrinkled sheets. Unbelievable ........ The ""happy hour"" is so poor. The most low quality snacks such as popcorn, pretzels and mixed nuts and salsa with chips.Cocktails complimentary but only for draft beer and house wine. The line was so long , that we did not even bother. I would not stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,CCJ from Colorado,"Although I'm from Manitou Springs, CO I periodically have to go up to the Denver area for an extended period and this Embassy Suites was by far the best one I've stayed in.  I compare my stay to other Hilton Properties all over.  Both my check-in and check out were efficient, including when my plans changed and needed to extend my stay. Definitely a good hotel to lay your head down or enjoy an evening cocktail.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very Noisey,"The A/C blower was very loud, the toilet leaked and caused it to flush every 5 - 10 minutes at night.  People above us were very noisy.  Happy hour is nice but snacks were not so good.  We have stayed at many Embassy suites but this one did not measure up to the others.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,I love the welcoming atmosphere!,"Upon arrival the staff was just wonderful! The hotel is clean, the complimentary breakfast and reception was a added bonus. Although,  the double rooms were the best part.  The children loved the hotel, and the lobby was beautiful. There we were on vacation and all they wanted to do was swim all day which worked out just fine because it was quite a drive to all the Denver activities. We had a wonderful stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great airport hotel!,"I stayed one night at this hotel and was happy with my stay.  My grandchildren and stepdaughter and her husband drove me down from Wyoming and we all swam in the pool, before having dinner in the hotel restaurant.  The food was delicious and the complimentary reception was very nice.  It was a clean hotel with courteous employees.  Without my own vehicle, having the restaurant onsite, was a plus.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,mediocre review - needs improvement,"There are plenty of DIA-area hotels with a shuttle (several dozen, I've stayed at many of them). I usually love Embassy properties (I'm Hilton Gold). This one needs a regime change. Here's why; surly front desk staff, free evening appetizers were taken away early, short & ill mannered wait staff, breakfast area constantly a disaster (tables not cleaned). Housekeepers and shuttle drivers are great - those are the ones who really run hotels anyhow. I hope this hotel cleans up its act because Embassy Suites are great places. Maybe I can then return and leave an Excellent review.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very Comfortable Rooms and Accommodating Staff,"We had to leave Aspen a day earlier then planned and travel to Denver to avoid an approaching winter storm and be close to the airport.  Embassy Suites is a consistent brand and we knew what to expect.  The room was very clean and comfortable and the complimentary breakfast was very good.  Because of the storm, the hotel was at capacity and the staff worked quickly to clear tables and replenish food stations.  It's true what some reviewers said about the placement of the drink station during the breakfast buffet, but it's a minor problem and most people were understanding.  There is a complimentary shuttle to the airport and we appreciated the shuttle getting my husband from the airport when he returned the rental car and when it transported us in the morning.  The weather was bad and the driving conditions were rough, so we appreciated the careful and helpful shuttle drivers.  We were pleasantly surprised because we have an ATT subscription and were able to log into the hotel WIFI and avoid the $14.95 daily fee.  Over all, a nice place to stay close that is close to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Always a great stay,"I always stay one night at the Embassy Suites when traveling to Denver. It's a great location, convenient to the airport and the rooms are great. The dining options are a bonus! The staff is friendly and always willing to assist you in any way.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Airport Hotel!,Would stay here even if I didn't need to be near the airport.  The staff was great.  Friendly and helpful registration team and a restaurant team that gives 100%.  Overall the entire facility has a comfortable atmosphere.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,An OK Stay,"Our stay here was good overall. Clean, good food evening, but the breakfast was not what we are used to at the Embassy's. Very congested line because coffe and drinks are set up so that if you want a refill you have to step in front of people in the breakfast line. The breakfast was ok it met our needs that morning. The manager reception service was outstanding and food was good. Checkout service was very good. Our biggest disappointment was our checkin. Not very friendly or courteous and especially not the professionalism we have grown accustomed to at Embassy Suites. Our shuttle driver to the airport was very good.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Disapointed,"I would like to start off by saying that the staff who checked us in and out were extremely friendly and nice. Most of the staff we came into contact with were friendly. We were disappointed with the little things that matter.We chose this location because it had an onsite restaurant and room service, we wanted to relax for a night. We have been to many hotels, including Embassy Suites before and haven't had issues like we did here.We ordered room service for dinner, we got a sandwich and a hamburger, which said on the menu it comes with fries and a salad (for $2 more for salad),we were charged $3 for each salad. The guy taking our order never asked how we wanted our hamburger cooked, and had to double check that we wanted the salad as a side and not a meal. When we got the meal, there was no salt and pepper, there was one napkin, and the carrot cake was extremely dry and hard in places. We didn't want to create a problem, and gave the kid the benefit of a doubt, maybe he was new? So we let it go. We tried to watch some TV in the living area, but the TV didn't work. It turned on, but only sound came out, with no picture. So, later on we watched TV in the bedroom and decided to rent a movie, The Hunger Games. We could only get through half of it because the TV was SOOO dark that we couldn't see a single thing going on. And it was so hard to use the remote, as some buttons didn't work or you had to press extremely hard. We decided to try the movie again in the morning, and the services had been disabled so we couldn't even finish the movie even if we could see it! What a waste for nearly $20. We decided to order room service for breakfast hoping it would be a better experience. Again, we were disappointed. It was a different person taking the order this time. I ordered eggs over hard, and they were runny. When we asked for toast she didn't ask what type of toast, I had to then ask what types of bread there were, she said white and wheat. I ordered 2 orders of white toast and 1 wheat order (3 total orders). We got 2 orders of toast,1 wheat and 1 sourdough. There was no salt and pepper. No cream or sugar for the coffee or jam/jelly for toast. If they don't usually serve those things with meals, then they need to ask, but she didn't. Everything was bland and tasted old.My husband ended up going downstairs to see if the free breakfast was better. No one was down there (he went down before 10am and breakfast went until 10:30), he couldn't find a clean table that had been bused even though no one was eating anymore. He finally found one, but no one was manning the omelet station or any of the breakfast bars and all the silverware bins were empty. He finally asked someone for some utensils, she didn't say anything, went to the back, grabbed a bunch of forks and dumped them in the bin and left. He was stunned. - He ended up grabbing some salt and pepper off a table to bring back to the room so he could at least season his omelet we ordered, it wasn't worth eating downstairs either.On top of that, there were hairs and a stain on our bed comforter. It kind of made us feel gross sleeping on it. We paid more for a premium corner suite also, it was not worth it!We were going to do a late check-out, but by the time we ate breakfast, we just wanted to get out of there. I think we'll still with Marriott from now on, they are big on details and the ""little things"" that make a stay great.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Embassy Suite,"Great location, close to airport with free shuttle; multiple restaurants/convenience store/wine-liquor store in close walking proximity; Walmart and other shopping close drive.  We have never been disappointed in Embassy Suites - great suite/large rooms, excellent breakfast and managers reception.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Experience,This is certainly a full service hotel.  It felt like I was at home.  Although I was on business I felt like I was on a leisure vacation.  I left my phone charger at home and by the time I reached the hotel I did not have a charge.  The hotel has a store with many affordable items to accommodate the forgetful traveler and I was able to pick up a charger without breaking the bank.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Sleep and Park for Free,Great establishment. No problems and great buffalo burger in the restaurant too! Appreciate the free parking and shuttle to/from Denver International Airport!  Started our trip off right by staying here before we flew! We will be back again!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,as close as you can get to the airport in denver,picked this hotel because of its location to the Denver airport. needed to stay somewhere close because of arriving late and  possibly having  snowy and icy conditions . easy to find  (about 10 minutes away) and loved the breakfast !,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice hotel would stay again.,"One night on business.  Very comfortable.  Like the evening reception and breakfast.  Room service in the evening.  Fast and good food.  Will stay again.  The service at the evening reception just OK but can not complain too much, no cost.  compliment breakfast was good.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Hard to Believe,Hard to believe a quality brand hotel such as Embassy Suites would not keep up their hotel.  Carpet and furnishings were not updated and appeared dirty and worn. Breakfast was poor in quality and choice.,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very good hotel,"friendly staff, very good breakfast, great work out room for a hotel, rooms were clean and quiet. I have stayed in this hotel a dozen times and have never had a bad experience. The free social hour is always enjoyable.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Staff was accomodating, pool was freezing!","We have used this location multiple time, mostly when flying as it's near the airport and we shuttle over (a wonderful plus to staying here).  Just disappointed this time as our rooms were confused.  (Had requested next door rooms as we were babysitting grandkids) and this wasn't conveyed to the local staff.  Otherwise, I really like this hotel and will prob. use again.  Pool was freezing, so the kids couldn't really stay in more than 5 minutes, that was disappointing.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel,"I was very impressed by this hotel. I am a big fan of the smaller Embassy Suites. They have a greater ""welcome home"" feel to them.The rooms are nice and well kept. Internet was pretty decent and the restaurant was pretty good. the menu featured a lot of local items which was nice.This hotel has a Hilton Honors floor with a vending machine that spits out free snacks. This is the first time ive seen this and i have to say it was pretty great.My only complaint is that my credit card was compromised while i stayed there and about $550 was charged to my card by someone else. Its my belief (and my credit card company) that it was the waiter who worked the restaurant.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Missing some support on stay!,"During my visit I was not given my internet code, I had to check out and back in on a two night stay with our business. They did not have my HHONORS added to my account as a member. Our Business does spend a lot of money with our stays at the Hotel chain but yet we do not get Internet service with our stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Made a bad situation ok,My flight was delayed from Bozeman to Denver so I missed my connecting flight. My stay here was great! My driver Chuck was very friendly and gave me a bottle of water as soon as I got on their shuttle which was very much needed after sprinting to my next flight and not making it.  I got checked in by Mario who was very friendly and asked me about a shuttle the next day which I would have completely forgot to ask for. My room was very nice and clean I enjoyed it very much.Dinner was very good but unfortunately I forgot my bartenders name who served me but he did a fantastic job! And as always embassy breakfast are amazing! Thanks guys for making my trip better.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Beware of Peak Travel Dates - CROWDED Common Areas,"We stay at this property a couple of times a year on our way to our condo in Aspen. We were here the weekend after Christmas, and while everything was fine as far as the rooms and other services, the hotel was so crowded that the evening reception and breakfast were so crowded it made the stay unpleasant.This Embassy Suites is different than most when it comes to the on-property restaurant. This property has the restaurant integrated into the atrium area. It is extremely nice in that the wait staff serves from the kitchen and will provide happy hour refills at your table. They set up ""nibbles"" such as a popcorn machine and other appetizers during the happy hour. During peak travel times such as this one, the crowds waiting in line for the appetizers was overbearing. And not to mention breakfast. This property has a terrible setup for breakfast. The beverages (juice, coffee, etc.) are situated in a way that when there is a crowd in line for the food line, the line blocks the beverages and it is very inconvenient to get in just to get beverages. The lines for the breakfast line during this weekend were worse than I've ever seen at an Embassy Suites (and we stay at many).Overall, this is a good property. VERY friendly staff. Nice rooms.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Clean, Convenient Option Near Airport But Perks Hit-or-Miss","We spent a night here to be close to the airport in anticipation of a snow storm and overall it was a great place in this capacity.  The lobby is actually fairly impressive with the open atrium and decor for the level of hotel it is.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The room was clean and felt more cozy than I expected. The shower was pretty loud in that the water echoed on the walls (so don't plan on taking a quiet shower while someone else is sleeping!), but otherwise the room was great.  My main issue is with the perks/bonuses that come with your stay.  Though there is a centrally-located business center off the lobby for internet access, there is no free wifi anywhere in the hotel.  And though breakfast is included and they had some cool things like an omlette bar, the set up of the buffet line was terribly unorganized and poorly thought through.  For example, the line for the hot food (if long enough, which it usually was) blocks the coffee and juice.  So while you are waiting in line for your food, people constantly keep coming by to push you aside and fill up their drinks.  And the line moves really slowly.  If you want to do breakfast, go as early as possible to avoid the cluster.  For my money, I would have rather had the wifi than the breakfast.Also keep in mind while this hotel is among the closest to the airport, it still takes a little time to get to the terminal.  Especially if you have to drop off a rental car.  For the life of me, I still have no idea why this airport was built so far away from civilization.Anyhow, all things considered, this is a great, affordable option for a room near Denver International Airport.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Construction,"Must have been some outside construction going on, a loud motor noise most the night.  Hopefully that is temporary.   Also could hear people walking and talking in the room above us.  Guess we haven't noticed that in such nice hotels before.   So beautiful and clean and the staff was great!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Stay,"This hotel was so nice, from the staff to the hospitality receception 5:30 to 7:30 very coolNice and clean, I loved the room, checkout and shuttle very accomodating. The shuttle ran every 40 minutes to the airport and back",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Airport hotel,"This hotel is very nice and New.... Its out by DIA with a free shuttle (that will also pickup from rental car locations). In short there is nothing near it so I cannot recommend it for most use, however it is a great place to stay before a early flight. The Hotel restaurant dinner was expensive and sub par, as is most cooking at hotels. The Bartender did appear to be more experienced but I wasn't interested in a drink to try.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overnight Stay,"We checked in on a really cold Saturday evening, with lots of snow. The lobby was crowded, but the front desk staff had us checked in within ten minutes of our arrival at the hotel. The room is okay - nothing fancy. Carpets are a little worn. The extra suite area is very comfortable and nice. The manager's cocktail hour is not as good as other Embassy Suites, but this may b e due to the hotel being pretty full while we were there. The same can be said for the cook to order breakfast. Selection is not as big as other Embassy Suites we have stayed at, but considering this is an airport hotel, it was good enough for an overnight.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Pre-flight stay,"Overall our stay was very good.  We missed the evening reception, but breakfast was good.  We had an issue with our reservation which was resolved to our satisfaction by a very friendly morning staff.  I would recommend this hotel as we would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great service!,"We live in the mountains and have started staying at the embassy suites prior to flying out of DIA to eliminate the 3 hour drive before international flights. It is wonderful to have drinks and snacks upon on our arrival in the evening, made to order breakfast before our flight, free parking, and door to door shuttle service. After our trip over the holidays, we came back to a flat tire in the parking lot in -10 weather.  The staff was more than helpful in assisting my husband with changing the tire and making sure we were taken care of.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great atmosphere in the restaurant!,"We stayed there the night before we left on vacation, and were able to leave the car there while we were gone, which was great. The food and atmosphere in the restaurant was great. We sat by the water feature. It was very relaxing. The room was nice. The shuttle to the airport was right on time. Coming back was a different story! When we arrived at DIA, we called to let them know that we needed a ride back to the hotel. The phone rang & rang! When we went outside, there was a van from the hotel. We let them know that we needed a ride and were informed that they were just maintenance and there was only one other driver on that night and he was on his 2 hour break! He said he would wait for a few minutes. By the time we got our luggage, he was gone. So, we called again. Finally got through and were told that someone would be there in about 20 minutes. After waiting out in the cold, rain, snow & wind for almost an hour, we ended up hiring another car to take us back, which cost $50. Very disappointed in that!!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Warm and friendly,"Great staff, friendly place and in freezing temps outside the hotel was warm everywhere we were.  Always like the breakfasts, great way to start the day.  Parking at the DIA Embassy was not fun with all the people that leave their cars and then go to the airport.  They should be required to park in a farther out parking lot than guests staying there.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Embassy Suites Denver Airport,"Great location, nice hotel.  We always enjoy staying at Embassy Suites.  It would have been nicer if the shuttle ran all night.  We were on a delayed flight and had to make other arrangement to get to the hotel.  We are Honors members and always enjoy staying at a Hilton property.  Sometimes a bit pricey but I guess you get what you pay for.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Disappointing,"I've stayed at this hotel several times in the past and I always enjoyed those visits. Unfortunately this time was a major let down. I got in close to midnight and for whatever reason was given a handicapped, smoking room. I didn't think smoking rooms still existed. But there was an ashtray and matches waiting for me. I am a Diamond member and nowhere in my profile do I require either amenities. Still it was after midnight I just slept thru my misery. The next morning I went out a side door to warm up my car but my key didn't work to reenter the hotel, nor another customers who was standing with me in the below freezing weather trying to get it.  Only redeeming features friendly staff and good breakfast. But next layover I'm going elsewhere - Yuck",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very nice!,"Excellent made to order breakfast!  The evening reception is a great way to wind down after a day at the office.  The room was was very nice, however, it would be nice for sleeping to have an in room humidifier for folks traveling from a more humid climate.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient and quite nice!,"Stayed here one night due to a missing a flight connection. The airport shuttle was efficient.  Check-in was quick and the room lovely.  Nice view of the snow covered mountains in the distance. We arrived late and hungry and although the kitchen was about to close, they accommodated us and had tasty items on the menu. The hotel is in a remote area, just other hotels in the vicinity, but safe and easy for taking a long walk. There is a 7-11 nearby and a couple of restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Hotel is great, bar staff is extremely rude","I suggested to my boss that we stay at this hotel because of my excellent experience that I have had with other Embassy Suites across the country, only to be thoroughly embarrassed by the bartender who was the rudest associate that I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with at an Embassy or any other Holton family hotel. If you plan on having a drink at the bar, I would choose a different place to stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Another nice Embassy,"This was an easy location to get to.  Checkin was quick and easy.  The room was exactly as i'd expect in an Embassy.  Had a few appetizers at the restaurant, which weren't great, but were large portions and half priced from 5:30 to 7:30.  The breakfast was just fine and, again, as you'd expect at an Embassy.  I had no problems here and wouldn't have any problem with staying here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,WiFi Internet is a rip off,"I can't recommend any hotel that charges for WiFi Internet access. It's a complete rip off. Other lower cost hotels in the Hilton corporate family provide it free.   While the location, room quality and staff were all good, the Internet policy is a complete show stopper. In the age of constant connectivity, typically with multiple devices, it extremely short sighted and poor business not to include WiFi services in the standard room rate. Guests should expect Internet access to be provided the same as they expect clean towels and running water.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great location and great value,"You cannot beat the location of the hotel, if you are traveling out of Denver's airport.  The hotel was very clean, and the beds were super comfortable.  The staff was friendly, and they had the room ready right away.  My only (minor) complaint was that the chairs in the room were a little worn.  Otherwise, it was a great experience.  The breakfest and happy hour were great!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Just like the old days...very good.,"A decade ago we were frequent guests at an Embassy Suites in Kansas City and found it to be an outstanding value--but in the years since the quality of the property had declined, along with the service.  THIS ES property was just like the old days, very good. Now granted, we were there on a weekday, when it was not terribly busy. But the manager's reception with complimentary drinks was great--you could order a ""top shelf"" cocktail if you liked.  We had our evening meal there and found it quite reasonably priced and good. GREAT service.  While we did not need the shuttle service, it appeared to be operating very smoothly in the morning. Front desk service was great and check-in quick. NICE pool and weight room with an outdoor jacuzzi. Very nice. As usual the breakfast was outstanding--a defining Embassy Suites feature. The ONLY reason we did not award this five stars is the steep cost of Internet service, which was VERY fast (thankfully).  We got a rate under $100 on Hotwire...but of course that is a roll of the dice.  Overall, very pleased to see Embassy Suites can do it the way they used to do it!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Super great value with the wife and two kids.,"We checked in for one night and had a great stay. My wife was flying in and they picked her up at the airport,  which was great as I didn't have to. My kids used the pool,  which was fairly quiet as most people are just there to spend the night and catch a plane.  The breakfast is standard ES affair, which means made to order items, cereals,  and a variety of egg options. All in all,  a nice stay. If you need food,  there are several eating establishments about ten minutes west.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,BAD shuttle ride to airport for 6am flight,"they advertise 4am shuttle ride to airport starting at 4am, but they can change it at any time.  when we got there, the 4am shuttle was booked by 1 family!  And the Hotel would make no other arrangements!  so we paid $30 out of pocket for a cab!  Ugh!",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent Choice,"This hotel is like pretty much every other Embassy Suites, which is a good thing. The breakfast is delicious, and the happy hour/social each afternoon is a great way to unwind. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, and the hotel has a very peaceful ambiance, and plenty of parking. The proximity to the airport and Aurora is great if you are doing business on the east side of town.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Service,"My wife and I were flying out of Denver to Germany.  We wouldn't be staying at the Embassy until the following week, but they let us leave our vehicle at the hotel, no hassle, no charge.  We just missed the shuttle to the airport and we were worried that the next shuttle would be too late.  We asked the clerk to call a taxi which never showed.  The clerk called the head of maintenance for us and he took us to the airport in one of their vans.  It turned out that the Vice President was in town and all traffic out of the airport was held up.  Had it not been for the clerk making the extra effort we would have missed our flight.  Upon our return we spent the night at the hotel.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Before turning in after a long day of travel we stopped by the lounge for a drink.  The bartender was very friendly.  Next morning we had a wonderful breakfast and hit the road.  Any time we fly out of DIA we will stay at the Embassy Suites.  Great rooms and professsional service.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Excellent all the way around!,"Great service, fantastic room, top notch!  Our request was for last-minute accommodations and we were treated extremely well.  And, there was coffee waiting for us at 4 a.m. before we took the shuttle to the airport.  Great stay all the way around -- wish it could have been longer!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Poor Customer Service,"I stayed at this Embassy Suites because I was stranded at Denver International Airport due to weather.  Prior to booking my reservation, the airline representative called to confirm that the hotel shuttle was still running because it was late.  The lady working the Embassy Suites desk that night said ""Yes"" they still have a shuttle running.  I stood outside in 3 degree weather for 30 minutes...NO HOTEL SHUTTLE!  Called the hotel they said the shuttle had stopped at 12:30 a.m.  That I need to pay for a taxi to get to their hotel.  EXCUSE ME!  Most hotels that offer a shuttle service, if their shuttle is not running will provide a taxi for you at no additional cost to the customer.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,OK for last minute stay,"It's advertised for long term stays, but a lot of delayed airport passengers end up here. The same happened to us due to weather. the room went through some renovations, but it's left half updated. The bathroom was still the old cabinetry, tubs, walls. The breakfast is good. Would stay again if the price is good.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Pleasant, Convenient with Nice Breakfast","I was pleasantly surprised with how nice this hotel was.  I was only looking for an overnight for an early flight rather than driving on icy conditions on I-70.  The check-in was swift, our room was spacious and clean, and the bath products from Crabtree & Evelyn were great. Should have brought my suit for a morning swim, but instead managed a nice little workout.  Then to my surprise, the breakfast was included and it was really good:  made to order eggs and pancakes along with other things that were hot and not soggy.  The best part was that there was a nice young man who was bussing tables, friendly and actually brought my pancake to me and offered to bring me syrup or anything else.  What he did was so simple but appreciated and left him a few bucks tip on the table and hope other people did the same.   The hotel was just about 5 minutes from the rental car drop off which made is a very convenient morning.     Thanks!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel,"Very clean, welcomed with cordial greeting, nice complimentary evening reception, very nice, comfortable room and bed.  Felt safe.  Hotel shuttle to airport.   Staff very conscientious to provide good service.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great stay,"Embassy's are always a great stay, with large rooms, lots of space, great breakfasts and relaxing evening social.  Usually their work out area is bigger and better maintained, but my last stay 2 of 3 treadmills was not working.  However, they were informed and seemed to jump on getting them tagged and fixed.  I try to find an Embassy Suite whereever I go.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Average hotel room, nice hot breakfast","We actually had paid reservations for the exceptionally beautiful Hotel Jerome in Aspen on this night, but elected to drive back to Denver the day before our flight so that we would not have to make an early morning driving trip.  We stayed at the Embassy Suites due primarily because of its proximity to the airport.  Reservations were easy and payment not required for the room until we arrived (although make note that cancellations must be done by 6 PM the night before).  The architecture of the hotel was typical of Embassy Suites, with hotel rooms surrounding an empty middle courtyard.  Hotel room and bed were typical of a hotel room--comfortable, not intended to be beautiful or romantic.  The breakfast is billed as hot and made to order, in that omelets could be ordered quick service style, and there was an option for fried eggs as well.  The remainder of breakfast choices included bacon, sausage, pancakes (done to order), waffles, house potatoes, bagels and other breads, and cereal.  We were impressed by a young man who came to clear our table.  Caesar not only took our empty dishes, but offered to answer any questions that we might have about the hotel.  Given the appearance of Caesar's relative youth, it seemed unusually proactive, and supported our tentative conclusion that there might be a hospitality training program in Denver, which is turning out a lot of good work.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Stay Away,"Stay here and get your computer hacked by a very unsecure wifi that you have to pay $15/day. Outdated, old. Very poor evening reception. The rooms are very uncomfortable, The sofa was like sitting on a cement pad. The mattress was a total joke. I found it very hard to get a restful nights sleep.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Love Embassy Suites,"I always try to stay at your facilities for the space in each room, the wonderful breakfasts and the exercise facilities.  Unfortunately of the 3 treadmills available, only one was functional and was in high demand both days I stayed.  The only downfall I've experienced in all the times I've stayed.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good for airport hotel,Convienent to airport -  Good location  - gas and food nearby.  Early breakfast for an Embassy.  In good shape generally but bathroom door a bit beat up.  The rest was as you'd expect from an Embassy. Halloween Candy Too!,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Caution:  Your reservation may mean nothing,"So as a Hilton Diamond member I was given ""the last room"" but despite having made reservations well in advance, my two business colleagues were turned away.  They were told that a large party had wanted rooms and they had to be bumped to the Drury.  Keep in mind, that the Embassy did not offer a shuttle or to pay for a taxi to the Drury.  More importantly, the SMUG attitude of the front desk ""manager"" was horrible.  Hilton needs to be weary of these properties that do its name injustice.Oh, and the food was subpar and service at the bar and restaraunt terrible.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Stay away - sorry.  I'm a Hilton Diamond Member too.,The staff lied to me when I checked in.  I have been a long time Hilton Diamond Level Member.  I will continue to stay at Hilton's - just not this one.  When I checked - I had the last room - the person at the front desk told me that I requested a 'smoing room'.  I have never requested a smoking room.  I do not like being lied too.  Then he said this was the last room.  There are plently of other hotels in the area....stay away.,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,pleasant experience,"rooms were well keep, clean and comfortable. couch was worn but useable. the grandchild loved the pool area. the evening welcome was real nice with free drinks (alcohol included as well) and snacks. the hotel is at the airport so it is a 10-15 min. drive to get to town. overall I would return.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,It's Hilton so you PAY FOR WI-FI,"We really enjoy staying at Embassy Suites.  The rooms are large and comfortable and the service is great.  The buffet breakfast can not be beaten.  Our only complaint, and I voice this whenever we stay at a Hilton and call the desk to find out the wi-fi password, is that I re-learn the horrible fact that wi-fi costs a LOT.  Good grief Hilton, this is 2014.  Everyone and their dog gives free wi-fi.  Please change your inane policy so I can give you the 5 stars you would otherwise earn!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Wish I could stay longer,"After a long long weekend and weekend of work I wanted to be closer to the airport for my 5:25 flight home.  Typically I want to get out of dodge asap but I found myself wishing I could stay longer.  Hotel was clean, super friendly staff, and the lobby decor was spot on for Denver.  If you need something close to the airport this is it.....only about mins away down Pena Blvd.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,OK Stay,This hotel was clean and neat with high-quality bathroom amenities.  The in-room refrigerator was a little loud and woke me up during the night as I slept on the sofabed.  The desk person could have been more accommodating upon my arrival.  Breakfast was pretty good and the coffee was great.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient,Thsi hotel has all teh ammentities of any Embassy Suites and location relative to airport.  We had a late flight in to Denver and thsi made teh eveing much better with teh close location.  Note that the hotel shuttle stops and Midnight so you woudl need a taxi after that.  I suggest staying at the hotel and picking up your rental car teh next morning and saving a days renta.  Again free shuttle back to retnal car.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Pros and Cons,"I have a checklist for business/airport hotels, so here it goes-free quality breakfast- yescomfortable quiet room-yesrestaurant/lounge on premises-yes, prices a bit high, food fairly goodfitness center- yes with a poolbusiness center with everything working-yesfast, reliable airport shuttle-yesfree wifi- no, I think it was about $15/nite, ridiculous!I was also a bit annoyed at the charge of $3 for a bottle of water. I got it for free because I have a bit of Hilton status (but not enough for wifi), but really think hotels can offer guests a free bottle of water.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,dissapointing for an embassy suites,"We were looking for a place close to Denver airport, and the location is certainly good in that respect, rooms are comfortable and all overlook the central bar, eating area in the middle. The dissapointing part was the food ... and lack thereof ! They have an evening reception with free drinks and nibblies, but the only nibblies on offer were goldfish crackers and dried stale cornchips. We also ordered food for dinner and for some reason they were totally out of several items on the menu, including fries, pork medallions and some other things. Then at breakfast time, the fresh fruit on offer was anything but ... the watermelon was slimy, the pineapple bruised and brown, and the hot food looked like it would bounce if you dropped it ... Sorry Embassy suites, we were expecting a little higher standard from you !",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Quality,"The evening reception was spectacular with hummus and pita bread and apples with caramel to pour over them.  The restaurant is also great.  The hotel is near the airport and does not seem to be around much.  You have to drive a bit to get to the city.  However, the hotel itself is wonderful and is definitely worth a stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Check Your Bill Carefully,"Most other hotels close to DEN don't charge for wifi.  $3 for a bottle of water?  If you notice, they very seldom respond to any criticism.  Shuttle?  Be prepared to wait a long time.  Much better park and fly deals and less money grabbing hotels in the area.  Check your bill very carefully when you leave--they like to add on for everything.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient & Fun,"This Embassy Suites is in a great location close to the Denver airport.  They run complimentary shuttles to get you there on time.  While we were there they even called in an additional shuttle to be certain everyone arrived without delay.  There is a Tommy Knockers in the dining area, which is a fabulous micro brewery and bar.  Great place to watch the football games while hanging out.  The breakfast at an Embassy Suites just cannot be beat, it is always awesome.  The rooms were very clean and well decorated, and provided a great refreshing nights sleep.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Call the hotel upon arrival!,Transfers to the hotel from the airport are not smooth.  Call as soon as you have your baggage or expect to wait up to 40 minutes.  All others hotels came by for pick up 2 and 3 times in the time I waited,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Good choice for an airport hotel.,"But - rooms could use a good deep cleaning.  Dust and debris in the corners of the room, carpet worn and the living area furniture was stained and worn.  Most airport hotels are worn down somewhat, and this place was not terrible, just needs some attention.  I checked in late and the bartender stayed open for me to get a drink and a quick bite to eat.  If your plane isn't leaving too early they have made to order breakfast in the lobby.  5 minute drive to the airport and shuttle service available.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Always happy at Embassy Suites,I have never had any problems and the staff is always friendly and willing to help you as needed.  Can't beat the cooked to order breakfast anywhere else. Although this location was very close to the airport I was not disturbed at all with any noise.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Convenient DIA location but...,The location near the airport makes this location convenient for travelers but no whirlpool makes it hard to relax. Family friendly but perhaps a little too much for poorly monitored children. Breakfast is complimentary but selection is limited. Very good value for suite (microwave and refrigerator) but no dishes in room make it hard to heat up leftovers or drink from anything other than styrofoam.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very accommodating staff,"This property is your standard Embassy Suites. It could use some updating in terms of the building and rooms. The location is also not the greatest. The property is supposedly near the airport, but it is a 10 minute shuttle ride to get there. However, I had a great experience here from a staff service perspective. My travel agent accidentally cancelled my reservation here, and I wasn't informed of this until I showed up. They were fully booked, but the front desk agent was extremely courteous and understanding and was able to accommodate me anyways.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great hotel nut why charge for WiFi,"Great hotel with friendly staff....especially Chris in the lounge area.  This hotel is a primary business hotel and I find it ridiculous that they would charge $15 per day for wifi.  Even as a Grand Vacation and Hilton Honors member, I was still subject to this charge.  In today's world, WiFi should be offered....especially in a prmarily business hotel (I guess this is how they can validate the charge).  I was attending a conference in a Courtyard Marriott about 5 miles away but chose to stay at the Embassy out of my loyalty to Hilton which was a bit of an inconvenience as I had to travel each day.  The Marriott offered free Wifi for the same exact price per night.  I will likely change my future business travel arrangements and begin to stay at more Courtyards.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Two star rating at best,"At $189 per night, I guess we expected to have a hotel with a comfortable bed and average quality restaurant.  We were disappointed.  This particular Embassy Suites does not measure up to the corporate standards.We were greeted warmly at the front desk and our reservation was accurate and in order - but things went downhill quickly from there.We reserved a double queen and although the room was spacious and clean (this is why I gave them 2 stars) both beds AND the pullout sleeper sofa were very old and very badly in need of replacement - each was broken down and sagged in the middle badly (I wonder how two people could sleep in one bed)  and I think I would have had a better night's sleep on the floor.Next - my appraisal of the restaurant - we checked in just in time to take advantage of the ""Manager's Reception"" - which consisted of goldfish crackers and tortilla chips - I am not kidding - I expected maybe some salsa at least for the tortilla chips, but there was none.  Still, there was a large crowd at the bar - I assume for the free beer and wine.  We decided to stay on property and eat at the restaurant, having checked out the menu ahead of time and it looked like we could at least enjoy a burger there.  Wrong - after ordering, our server came back to tell us they were out of french fries AND onion rings AND buns for the burgers.  He said they had a very busy weekend - well, this was Wednesday - shouldn't they have restocked these items by Wednesday?  The burgers were served either sans bun OR on ciabatta bread - rather strange.  They were also completely out of fish selections and pork as well - all of this making me wonder if they are having some financial difficulties with their suppliers.  How does a hotel stay open if they can't stock their restaurant?Needless to say, we will NOT be returning - I can only hope that some of the other hotels (of which there are many to choose) around DIA are a better value for the money.Avoid this one.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,AC didn't work,I reported that my AC system was not working to the front desk.  They told me that maintenance had been in that room the previous day for a none working AC.  So I was booked into a room with them knowing the AC did not work.  I was told all other rooms were booked so I could not move.  Maintenance never came to try to fix the issue again.  I was told they would bring me a fan to help.  This was not done either.  I spent the night in the room with no AC and no fan.,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,CLEANLINESS,"The hotel was very clean, the bed was comfortable. I enjoyed being in the king suite. it feel more like being at home. not having to dring and eat in the bedroom. the reception could have had  more variety of snacks.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very average,"I overnighted here due to flight schedule. The place is clean and interesting design with all rooms looking into centre atrium of seven stories. I had ordered online food to be waiting upon my arrival. Somehow it fell through the cracks, no food, no drinks. The front desk man was very nice and apologetic, he gave me access to the gift shop. Ice cream, potato chips and a bottle of water was dinner. Was very disappointed that food order fell apart given it is right on line when you reserve. I was up and out very early for next flight so unable to sample breakfast.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Denver launch point,I try to stay at Embassy Suites when ever I can. This is one of the first Embassy Suites properties I stayed at for business travel so it has served as the standard for each new stay. The hotel is out of the city at the entrance to Denver International Airport.  The facility is always clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. Some of the room amenities are becoming dated but still better than most comparable properties. The complimentary breakfast offers a good selection. The afternoon mangers reception food offerings are limited.  The bar staff is friendly and very efficient. The meal offerings are diverse and offer a good selection.There are several restaurant alternatives within walking distance. I plan to continue using this hotel for future travel to Denver.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay close to the Airport,I had a great experience staying here 2 nights in September---  1 on the day I arrived in Denver and the 2nd one on the night before I departed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The Shuttle service is super. They picked me up at car rental place when I returned my car and then I was able to use the service the next morning of my flight and didn't have hassle of returning my car. The decor is great. Restaurant is reeeally good. It's a great place to invite friends for dinner when you're in town. They can come to you and you don't have to go into town to meet them. Fun Happy Hour and good complimentary breakfast.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,THE BEST STAY FOR YEARS,"Excellent Hotel. If you want a wonderful bed and beautiful hotel this is it.  I will look for Embassay Suites from now on when traveling. Can't say enough about the experience, it was a wonderful stayThank You !!!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great for Airport Lay-over,We had an early flight out of Denver and this was the perfect place to stay. Free shuttle service to the airport and super friendly staff. Happy hour in the evenings with free snacks and drinks. Great atmosphere in the lobby.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,EXCELLENT 5-star hotel with a low price tag!,"This is one of the nicest Embassy Suite Hotels I have ever seen!  Due to a flight delay and missed connection, I ended up staying in Denver overnight and lucked out with this hotel.  The hotel was so nice, I would seriously consider staying there for a return trip to Denver.  I don't know if all of their rooms are designed this way, but my room had a large sitting area, a bathroom and a separate bedroom.  The rooms are all oriented on the exterior walls of this square building and there is a large, open sanctuary in the middle.  Very, very nice.  Finishes were high end.  The room was immaculate.  Staff were gracious and accommodating.  I didn't stay long enough to be able to check out the dining or exercise room.  But there was a free shuttle to the airport that ran at 4 am and I was able to catch my early morning flight home.  Lovely, lovely hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Wonderful place to stay.,"I have been staying at Embassy Suite Hotels for the past 14 years.  I prefer this Hotel of many other name Hotels. The hotels are always friendly, clean and the amenities are wonderful.  Their locations are always easy to find and close to my travel needs.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A very good experience,"I found the staff to be very nice.  The rooms are very nice and clean.  They could be updated but clean is much more important.  If you have a rental car and need to return it they will pick you up at the airport car rental.  They have a managers special which includes, all the drinks you want and snacks, that starts at 5:30 pm.  I travel a lot and love to stay at Embassy Suites.  They haven't disappointed me yet.  The cook to order breakfast is also a wonderful bonus.  They offer many items if you don't want an omelet, etc.  I would recommend staying here.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"For the money, needs updating deco, but good breakfast!","I had a quick meeting in Denver and needed a room close to airport. Down side is there are no real options for dinner in this area. Hotel is ok for the price, but seemed old and dark. The good point was the breakfast. Good, hot and quick.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Very nice hotel.,"We will probably stay here again next time we are in Denver.  The caprese at dinner was almost like being in Italy.  Delicious.  Salmon was good, also.  Complimentary reception was good.  We felt very relaxed at this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Holiday at the Embassy,"My family came from three areas for a fast weekend trip on Labor Day. We made our base at the Embassy by the airport. We had lots of fun in the Denver area and spent time in the pool and laughing, there were few complaints. This family is all women now from 17-71, 3 generations, we loved it!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Middle of the Road....,"I stayed here for a one nighter on recent business trip.  Frankly I was a little dissapointed based on my experiences at other Embassy Suites.  Not bad, but in my opinion not up to the level of some of the other locations I have been to.  Obviously as an airport hotel, this location gets lots of short term traffic. I took this into account when evaluating the condition of the hotel.  Overall I felt like my room was a little ""worn out"" for lack of a better term.  Very spacious suite and everything was in working order except for sink and tub which did not drain.  Room was very clean and the bed comfortable.  I had a room service meal which was good.  I don't recall ever paying for wireless at an Embassy Suites, but the charge was $14.95 at this location and network speed was acceptable.  All of this came at a slightly higher price than I expected, thus my overall average rating.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Overall experience,I believe this location could use better management and making sure quests have everything needed. When asked for more blankets I received towels and one blanket completely out of pillows. The morning rust for breakfast waiting over an hour for food. I would say this hotel is under staffed.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,A great one!,All Embassy Suites are fantastic. The snacks at night as well as the great breakfast are outstanding. The suites make for great comfort when traveling with four people. My son and grandson enjoyed the pool. Choose an Embassy Suite whenever you can.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Hotel,The only real negative is this hotel charges non Hilton Honor members that do not have Gold Card $15.00 a day for internet service.  No Hotel that I have stayed in including Embassy Suites charges for Internet!  That is an outrage!!!,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Decent Stay near DIA.,"I have stayed at this hotel twice in the past 3 months for business and it is fairly new, clean and nice.  It is also very close to the airport.  There are also a decent variety of restuarants close by.  Fitness center was good as well as the complimentary breakfast.  Only negative I have is that they charge for internet service even for hhonnors members.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Good staff, some issues","The hotel is located very near DIA and has a shuttle to the airport.  It runs every 40 minutes.  In theory.  The day of our departure, while I was in a meeting at the Marriott Courtyard across the street, my husband returned our rental car and planned to shuttle back to the Embassy.  The shuttle never came despite multiple phone calls to the hotel. When he explained his situation to the Courtyard driver he was kind enough to let him ride back to join me after my meeting.Rooms are standard Embassy, although our first room reeked of smoke and we had to ask to be moved. Lobby decor is good, food was fine. Decent choice if you don't need airport transportation but if you do I would look elsewhere.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"There are so many great options in Denver, don't waste your time.","This property is seriously lacking and does not live up to the typical Embassy standard.  The carpet stained, the walls marked and tearing..and the worst part.. Not clean.  More than stains on the carpet, there was cereal.. Not even vacuumed before we checked in.  The sheets were dirty.   The room was not clean, and that is hard to get past.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Weekend Getaway,"Great Hotel, great atmosphere,  the complimentary evening drinks and breakfast was a great bonus. Very comfortable and clean.  If feels like home away from home. Great  for couples and families on vacation",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay,"The mountain view was spectacular!  Being my first visit to Colorado, I couldn't have picked a better place to stay (even tho I was there for work).  Close to the airport.  Great complimentary breakfast - made to order food.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Highly recommend!,"Room was large, very clean and had all required amenities.  Staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  We arrived on a late flight from Maine to Denver, just before  restaurant closed.  Staff made sure we got something to eat, allowing us to take it to our room so we could eat and relax.  Restaurant food very good.  Hotel shuttle convenient for airport and car rental facility.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"A bit disappointing, for this good name","First, the good news. Professional front end staff.  They do well to put a good face on a somewhat aging interior. Carpets and beige walls fading. Rooms were nicely done, but a few years back. The biggest drawback is that it's not a businessman's place. MOST ""yesterday"" is the ""pay for WIFI"" that's an unacceptable extra 10% house tax...based on their rates.  If you're pressed to find an overnight room, it would do ok.  The staff, including van drivers!   Got to admit, as a businessman, I have to avoid this place if I can.   It's barely a three star property.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not bad for airport hotel,"It is fine for what it is. Airport hotel. Rooms basic. Rates are inexpensive. Rooms clean. Free wifi, free breakfast. Free shuttle to the airport. Two tvs in the room. Restaurant in hotel seems fine. Nice central bar.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,FRONT DESK,\ Satisfied to check in at the front desk. Very clean rooms and restaurant all the staff are very cordial on a service. this is the third times I stayed in this hotel and I never had any problem at all.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Functional airport hotel,"We stayed at this hotel both on our arrival and departure. We chose the package which included wifi. We made use of the shuttle buses on both arrival and departure - but also to take us back to the airport so we could catch the rental car bus. The shuttle does need to be booked as busy at times but we found that the pick up and drop off were on both sides of the airport. The bedroom was clean - and it was helpful having the additional room with TV also. There was plenty of choice at breakfast including made to order omlettes. We found the chef's special for the evening meal very good value. It has a pleasant bar area and although I was travelling with my husband, I was have felt equally comfortable eating in the restaurant / bar if I was travelling on my own.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Airport hotel,"Though the hotel needs some decor updates, it was delightful. The space of the suite, the comfortable bed, and the complimentary evening drinks and breakfast was a great bonus. The free shuttle to and from the airport was also excellent.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Super Stay...Silly Shuttle,"Spent one night here before flying out of the Denver airport.  The location is lovely, the staff is friendly and the free breakfast was delicious.  The rooms were well appointed and the bed was comfortable.  I have stayed at several locations on Tower Road but this was my first stay here.The shuttle will take you to the airport on the hour and the half hour.  The problem was that they only drop off on the west side.  Since I was flying Delta,  I was unable to curb check and had to lug my suitcases all the way inside and to the other side of the terminal.  I do understand that it would make sense to stop at United first, since it is the hometown airline.  I have stayed at other locations that make stops on both sides, so I thought this was weird.  Plan ahead if you know you need to check in at the East side, it will take you a while to get over there.  Otherwise, I would recommend this as a 10!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Comfortable suite but no free Wi Fi!,We stayed at the Embassy Suites after our flight to Denver from the UK and found it very comfortable and clean. We'd chosen the Embassy suites as they offered a free shuttle to the airport and were a very reasonable £67. The room was well laid out and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast on the morning was very tasty and the choice was excellent. I particularly enjoyed the cooking station for freshly cooked eggs and omelettes. My two gripes with this hotel were; no free wifi and poorly advertised shuttle from the airport.My expectation is that hotels offer wifi free of charge. Holiday Inn Express manage it in every hotel so I feel cheated if I have to pay extra in other hotrels for it. We found out laterly that bwe could have got a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel instead of paying $30.00 for a taxi. There was nothing in the literature we received from expedia about how to get the shuttle from the airport. We successfully got the shuttle back to the airport to pick up our hire car so we did benefit from the free shuttle in the end!!,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay prior to a morning flight,"My family & I stayed at this hotel prior to a morning flight back to the East coast.  We were able to park our car at the hotel, take a free shuttle to & from the airport, enjoy a nice hot breakfast (with made to order omelet's, french toast, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, muffins, cereal, bagels, juice, coffee), and if you are into having a glass of alcohol to wind down at the end of the night the Manager's Reception is a nice touch (free cocktail from 5 - 7:30 or something like that).  The suite was HUGE & just perfect for our family of three to relax, spread out, get a good night sleep before our flight.    One tip:  talk with the front desk PRIOR to departing about the shuttle return.  I had a hell of a time to get them on the phone to schedule a pick-up.  Thankfully, the shuttle driver WAS JUST AMAZING.  He had nice cold bottled water for everyone & was just a delight.I will definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice stay pre-flight,"We stayed here prior to leaving very early the next morning for an international flight. We ate dinner in the restaurant and it was very good. The room was clean, well-kept and nice. We love having the kitchenette.One of the selling points was being able to leave our car, for no additional charge, in the hotel parking lot, for the duration of our trip. They provided a shuttle to and from the airport. The driver was safe and courteous.This was not the hotel's fault, per se, but our car was broken into while we were gone and a $500 car stereo was stolen. The hotel asks that if you are leaving your vehicle for an extended period to park on the perimeter of the parking lot. It wasn't well lit and, again, they do tell you that anything that happens to it is not their fault. It was, however, a really crappy end to a great vacation.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Won't stay again,"We have stayed at this property several times in the past few months. They always run out of USA news by 7 am, the shuttle we are waiting for now at the airport has taken over an hour to get here and they just don't seem to have a friendly welcome. The property is dingy and, for the price, disappointing",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Typical Embassy Suites,"This is a typical Embassy Suites but rather pricey for a quick stay before flying home.  Plus, you have to pay extra for in room wifi.  Biggest selling point is the restaurant which stays open very late.  Rooms large but walls thin as we could hear the couple in the next room talking and watching TV late.  Also, big breakfast is you enjoy eating a ton early in the morning - we would prefer free wifi rather than free food.Would only stay here again if we needed late night dining.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Expensive for an airport property,"We are Hilton members so we try to stay at this brand, but considering all the choices around the airport this one was a bit high considering it could use some updating.  Overall it was fine, but just seemed a bit old.  I have only 2 big complaints,  for one the housekeeping staff was slamming doors very early in the morning,maybe it was to get you up  for the number  two complaint of the early breakfast buffet.  Normally these go from 6-10,  but this hotel only ran until 9 and they really seem to push you out right a 9 by turning off the lights.  Overall I would say if you get a good price it's fine, but not so great for over 200.",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Spending our anniversary at Embassy Suites Denver International Airport,When we arrived we were greated and checked in quickly.  The suite was very clean and well organized.  The only downfall I see is the the airport shuttle only runs to 1230am and our son daughter in law and grandchildren land at 1230am.   Would be nice if the shuttle ran later.,4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Spendy, but very nice","I stayed at this hotel in July, while passing through town on business. I stay in Hilton properties most weeks, and I know there's been some discussion on review sites about some Embassy Suites being in need of a face lift. But this hotel was beautiful -- clean, up-to-date, and had the usual great staff service that the ES hotels seem to always offer. It was a bit spendy for one night, but I had limited options -- and I was treated so well that it took the sting out of the price. A wonderful place if you need to stick around the room for a while. Great pool, nice bar, extra room, wonderful bed.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Trusted Experience,"I trust my experiences with Hilton Hotels and in particular Embassy Suites.  The Denver Airport was no exception.  Great atmosphere, roomy suites, decent breakfast, happy hour.  If feels like home away from home.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,tired hotel,the hotel did not live up to expectations or previous stays at other embassy suites.  the furniture is old and tired.  the rugs are stained.  Our couch has completely different covering on seat cushions thab on back of the couch (I can only assume because of stains and so cushions were replaced).  and there isn't even free wifi in the lobby.  the place was clean and staff was nice.  Breakfast was good.,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Value,"Wonderful hotel with spacious, clean rooms, airport shuttle, fast WIFI, great breakfast and a complimentary evening reception.  Great hotel for couples and families on vacation or on business.  Parking available for RVs next to hotel parking lot.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Superb Stay near the Airport,"My wife and I recently stayed here to catch our flight out the next day. The hotel was in very good physical condition and had an excellent staff. Our room was well appointed with good furniture. It was a welcome retreat after spending seven days touring Colorado. The Manager reception had good healthy choice alternatives. The drinks were good. We met Chris, the restaurant chief. Because we had mentioned that we were leaving so early that we would miss the breakfast buffet, he offered to make us some breakfast burritos that we could microwave in our room and eat. We took him up on his offer. They were SUPER!!! Chris was fabulous with a customer focused attitude. While checking out, the hotel had coffee and fruit in the main lobby for early travelers. This is a great hotel that cares about their customers. We will be back! Thanks for a Superb Stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Slow Shuttle and dirty bed covers, no air",Fair breakfast in a dirty dining room at 6am.  What do you want for free asks the lady that was told it would only be 15 minutes for the shuttle to pick up at the airport but actually took 1.25 hrs in the hot summer sun???  Then arrive at room for dirty bed covers and no air!  But had to tough it out because running very late for a meeting (would have had time to change rooms if the shuttle would have picked up when supposed to).,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,The best I've ever seen,"For one, they let me bring my dog.  There staff was pretty cool. Loved the free drinks from 5pm till 7pm at night. Loved the fact that at 10pm they still allow adults in the hot tub but not children.. I thinks that's awesome. Sometimes adults need some alone time away from kids, and that's what this allows. I loved how there were two rooms, so when I worked my husband slept peacefully. The bed and the pillows were awesome. The people at the front desk actually greeted you. I loved the fact that they were so friendly and helpful. On Sunday they had this buffet where they grilled to order. My husband slept in since we were on vacation and he did all the driving.  He's also disabled, so it was nice for him to stay upstairs in bed. The hotel was beautiful.  Loved the Tv's in both roooms, so I could watch something else when he had something boring on.  My brothers came to visit me for the first time, and when they came there, they were upset they had gotten a room at their hotel instead of that one. i really loved it here, and if I ever come back to Denver, this is where I will stay for sure!  Did I mention the bathrooms are big and beautiful?",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Nice Quality Hotel!,"This hotel offers, a nice atmosphere, clean, friendly and top notch service!  Food is quality and was always served hot and plenty of it.  Staff in meeting room were attentive and kept it clean and restocked.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Have stayed here many times,"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times over the last 10 years. It is my hotel of choice before flying out the following day. I like that once I'm there, I don't need to leave for anything. From Happy Hour and dinner, to the complementary breakfast in the morning, it is all self contained at this location. (I am always car-less by this point of my trip). The hotel staff are polite, efficient and friendly. The rooms are very clean. And when traveling with children, there is plenty of room in the suites for all of us.",4
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Worn out!,"This Embassy is not what I expected. It is in need of a major makeover. The carpet was stained, the towels were scratchy, and the sink and tub were slow to drain.The happy hour was limited to a few liquors, but the snacks were okay.We used the shuttle to go to DIA. It was nice to not have any stops. Be sure to get into the white Embassy shuttle, though. A black one arrived on our return trip, but was for the Embassy at the Tech Center.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,very good,"nice, clean, friendly staff, free managers reception was great.  the staff were very friendly and helpful.  breakfast was good and ready by 630 am.  the managers reception was very nice to have a drink and socialize with others. not much right in the vicinity besides hotels and couple restaurants.  need to be able to drive if you want to do things.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Business stay,Great Hotel.  Very clean and the staff was very nice and professional.  The evening happy hour and the breakfast were really nice. The location was also very close to the airport which made it easy to get in and out. Very nice stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Did not overwhelm,"Had some confusion at check-in with regard to room configuration which front desk was unfortunately unable to resolve, so we had to stuff our family of 5 in a King bed room with sleeper sofa and rollaway, which was quite a bummer.We found Chris the bartender to be quite pleasant and helpful.  Our room was not impressive. Pillows not good, Kind bed not the best, pull out sofa was ""worst we've ever slept on"" according to my kids.  I noted it wasn't even close to being flat. Pillows that we requested for kids were not delivered until the 2nd phone call (and by Chris the bartender?!?), which delayed deb time.   Certainly room for improvement, Evan...",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great place to stay,"Loved pool, jacuzzi and cooked to order breakfast.   Staff was friendly and nice.   Location sites Denver airport but I believe this is the site of the former Denver airport and not the current.  Great area surrounded by other hotels and sidewalks to exercise outdoors if you don't want to use the gym.  We would definitely stay again.  We stayed 4 nights and enjoyed the late night speciality desserts from the chef.  My son felll in love with the skillet choc chip cookie with ice cream on top for dessert nightly.  ($8)",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Don't trust their DIA shuttle service.,"First let me say that I personally have not stayed at the Embassy Suites DIA, so I cannot comment on the lodging or other amenities within the building.  I have booked speakers and conference participants there and they seemed to have had a positive experience (I will however think twice before I do so again).  My experience with Embassy Suites DIA was in regards to their extended parking service that they offer.  For a reasonable rate you can park your car in their overflow parking and they offer shuttle service to and from DIA.  I called two weeks prior to our trip and spoke with a front desk worker who told me it would be $20USD for a week (this was not the correct rate, its actually $6 a day), and he did not mention that you are supposed to book it online prior (he told me to just walk up to the front desk).  Upon arrival on July 5th I went to the front desk to pay and register my vehicle and the clerk acted quite put-out that I hadn't registered online with the service that they use (global parking I believe).  I paid my $42 and handed the hard-copy of the parking registration to the frustrated clerk.We were told the shuttles run at 30min intervals (with some afternoon exceptions, 40min intervals).  Our shuttle arrived 10 min late to take us to DIA, not a big deal at all as we still made our flight.Coming back on July 12th was where things really deteriorated. I called before we boarded our plane in New Orleans (as I was instructed to do) and notified them of our arrival time so that the drive would expect us and which side of the terminal we would be waiting.  Our plane was delayed an hour, due to bad weather, so I called again and notified them.  They said it was fine, that shuttles run until 12:30am.  We arrived at DIA, got our bags and were 10 minutes early for the next shuttle pick up at 10pm.  We waited until 10:20 and I called Embassy asking where their shuttle was.  The clerk said it would be there in 15 minutes.  I called at 10:35pm and asked again (since there should have been a shuttle at 10pm and 10:30pm).  The clerk informed me (without batting an eyelash) that the van was on its way and would be there in 5 minutes, I informed him that if they did not come soon we would take a cab and deliver the bill to them.  The van never came.  The driver did finally arrive at 11pm,  (a full 1 hour and 10 minutes later).  I was literally about to grab a cab when the van arrived (which a family staying at Embassy did on their own dime, because they were tired of waiting).My wife is pregnant, and we have a 6 and 4 year old, which means we were at critical melt-down point, since we had been traveling all day (drove from Pensacola FL to New Orleans for our flight) and just wanted to get to our car so we could drive the 1:20 to get home to Ft. Collins.If you don't care about timeliness, then use the service as its cheap.  I however will never again use their parking service and most likely will not book guests to stay there, as clearly Embassy Suites management has little to no foresight.  The poor driver that picked us up was covered in sweat and clearly frantic as their one van and one driver could not handle the volume.  The management should track how many of their lodging guests and parking guests are coming and going on any given day (you put dates and times on the form) and be prepared for the volume of needed transport.  If you need reliable transport to and from DIA do not count on Embassy Suites at DIA.  I'll pay the extra $20 next time and use any of the other major parking chains (as we counted about 3 shuttles passing us PER 30 minutes from the major chains).  This could have been an isolated event, but why take the chance?",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Refreshing stop,Spent a night relaxing and unwinding - thanks to the team at Embassy Suites.  The whole experience from check in to check out met the expectations - again.  Should have planned a longer stay there.  The team at Embassy Suites really does work to make your stop enjoyable,5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,"Great location, great hotel, great service!","If you're traveling through Denver and need a hotel near the airport that delivers great service - choose the Embassy Suites.  The facilities, rooms, etc are all what you've come to expect from Hilton.  Plus, even with our flight delayed and arriving at 2:00 in the morning - they treated us with exceptional care.  The complimentary 'full' breakfast was nice - and we'll definitely come back!",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great Place to Stay,"Overall experience was nice.  Great food, fun and staff.  Quick and easy access with plenty of parking.  Nice area to walk around also. The steaks are awesome as well as the appetizers.  Not too expensive, but affordable.  I would recommend this property to anyone.  When I travel to Denver again this will definitely be my hotel destination.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not so good,"We stayed at the Embassy Suites Denver International Airport for one night to bridge us between our stay at a horse ranch and our flight home.  The hotel room itself was more or less ok in that it was large and bright.  However, we notice that the carpet was stained, and the sound insulation was poor.  We stayed on the second floor, and we could hear the sounds of people talking loudly in the atrium until the early morning hours.  The feature that really stood out in a negative way was the restaurant.  The food was meh, the service was exceptionally slow, and the prices were exorbitant.  There really isn't any place else to go, since the airport hotels are sort of all clumped together in the middle of nowhere.  They know they've got you, and they take full advantage.  I mean, $3.00 for a lukewarm teacup of water and a tea bag of Constant Comment?  You've got to be kidding me.The next time we return to Denver, we'll be staying somewhere else.",2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Awful!!!!!!,"We stayed at this motel and were told our reservation was for a smoking room, when we in fact did not book a smoking room. The carpets were filthy, the room REEKED of smoke. The drapes were yellow, there was something stuck to the tile in the bathroom and the shower curtain had toothpaste on it. The parking was a joke too. The people in the room next to us told us they had fleas in their room. We were told there were no other rooms available but they moved the other people. We asked for room spray and when we first arrived and they said housekeeping would be right up. One hour later they had not arrived yet so I went down again to ask and a housekeeper came up. She left abruptly and left her spray and a toilet bowl plunger outside our room. This is one of the worst experiences with a hotel I have had",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,NEVER AGAIN,"I have stayed at this property twice in the last month and a half and both times were terrible. I stayed last Wednesday and booked two beds and a non-smoking room. I am aware they have smoking rooms which are horrible, so I am always careful to book non-smoking. I checked in and they had my group in a king, smoking room. I went back downstairs and showed them my confirmation which was for a non-smoking two bed room. They told me tough luck, we don't have any rooms non-smoking available, I could stay in the smoking room or leave. I inquired about the total wrong bedding and they told me to just use the sofa-sleeper...which REEKED of smoke. I asked if I was the last person to check in for the night and they said no they had more check ins but still would not move me to another room even though they had non-smoking rooms not checked into yet. They could care less about customer service or making me happy. Although the lobby area, etc is nice in this hotel, the rooms are run-down and not up to par with the Embassy Suites brand standard. I stay at Hilton's all over the world and never have been treated so poorly as at this hotel. Plus, after my 20 hour flight day yesterday, the shuttle which was suppose to be a the airport in ""15"" minutes took over 40 minutes. It is important to note, most other hotels have shuttles with hotels close to them and run more frequently it seems then this embassy suites. I watched two hilton garden inn airport shuttles come and go before the embassy came once to pick me up.  I will not stay at this hotel again, there is a Hampton, Hilton Garden Inn and DoubleTree in close proximity I will stay at for now on.",1
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Great experience,Helpful courteous employees at this Embassy! Check-in was easy.

"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Not good,Air conditioner in the room did not work. Breakfast was awful.  Eggs were undercooked. Bacon was raw. Dishes were dirty. Dinner was not bad and service was good. Front desk was very friendly unfortunately he was not able to help with issues.,2
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Best hotels where we stay,"When we can find an affordable rate, we always stay at this hotel, and we got a good rate - about $130 with tax.  The staff is friendly, and the breakfast is really good.  They have a chef that makes omelets, french toast and more.  The evening ""happy hour"" is a real treat.  We stayed for dinner, and they gave us free drinks.  The shuttle to the airport was nice as well.",5
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Just OK,"We stayed overnight prior to an early morning departure. As far as convenience is concerned, the hotel was fine. The room was clean and comfortable, although pricey, in my opinion. We could easily reserve the early morning shuttle on check-in, which proved to be a good idea, as it was very crowded.  We were actually quite angry to find out that ""we offer our guests wireless internet access"" meant that we were expected to pay $14.95 a night for it! We refused to do that, but it left us with a sour taste in our mouths. Hotels like this should stop grabbing for money by charging for internet access, because all it achieves is to make people go elsewhere on their next trip. We had dinner in the restaurant. The waiter was excellent, but the food was only OK, and quite expensive too. Breakfast, included in the room rate, was a buffet, and was good, but not memorable.  We'll try somewhere else next time",3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,OK,This was hotel did the trick.  It's location is very convenient to the airport.  The room was clean and the amenities were standard.  I was suprised a hotel that caters to business travels did not have free internet in the rooms!  The food from the restaurant is pricey.,3
"Denver, CO",Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver International Airport,Do not honor reservations,"I booked a room 1.5 months in advance, but upon arrival the room I booked was no longer available.  I was forced to stay in a smoking room (who has these still) that smelled like trash.  Honor your reservations, just like you force those who reserve rooms with you.",2
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best hotel possible for a Christmas trip to Denver,"Denver holds a special place in the hearts of every techie looking to get away from SF. The charismatic hosts are undoubtedly one of the highlights. Easy going, ridiculously accommodating, lovely people. Quality time is invested in getting to know guests – they started making me cocktails before I got to my room. Staying at the Oxford felt like staying at home with the beautiful interior and the antiques reflecting its rich history that makes you never want to leave. I've stayed in many 5 stars but this is the one that left me the most memories. Apparently so. Alcohol aside, staying here really did feel like I was visiting my oldest and dearest friends.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classy without pretention,"The Oxford is a different kind of hotel than most of the mainstream hotels located in the Denver metro area. There is a sense of character to the building itself and the staff seem to channel that character. This was my second stay at the Oxford and my wife and I were treated very nicely and the hotel staff does all they can to make you feel you like your staying there matters. If there is a cooler bar than The Cruise Room, I haven't been there. It is located next to just about everything you would want to visit in the area, all within walking distance.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Blue Chip Experience ,Hatched a plan to take the train from Denver to Salt Lake and chose the Oxford because it looked interesting and it’s super close to the train station. Grabbed the tram from the airport to Union Station and The Oxford was less than a full block away. The place was absolutely charming. Stunning Christmas decorations were placed beautifully. The staff was warm and accommodating. The room was excellent on every point. Be sure and ask for city view. The location was a block away from the free shuttle going up and down the 16th Street Pedestrian Mall. Truly a luxurious stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful & Beautiful,"Had plans for an Animal Encounter & Zoo Lights at the zoo & didn't want to drive home late at night; picked the Oxford Hotel to stay and it did not disappoint.  Everyone from the Valet/Bell Hop to the Front Desk personnel were friendly, personable, helpful with suggestions and easy to approach to ask questions.  The location is next to Union Station and it was easy to walk up to downtown or take the free shuttle.  The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holidays so it would be great for a holiday get away!  And parking was included in the rate; how can you beat that?!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lovely Staycation,"The Oxford Hotel is in the perfect location downtown just steps away from Larimer Square, Union Station, and the 16th Street Mall.  The hotel is newly renovated but still feels classic.  Bed was plush, room was clean and kept, wish we could have stayed longer. Service was outstanding from all the staff we encountered.  We will be back to this Denver gem.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing Stay,"This historic hotel still lives and breathes authenticity. A true genuine sprit that is carried out from within its staff. From the moment that you walk into this hotel you are greeted with a personal touch and a reminder of a more glamour time. The décor sets you back to a classical period that is eloquently laid out to display the hotels broaden and relic features.  Its pretty amazing that this building was build in 1891 as a hotel that still operates as such today!  The hotel is right in downtown Denver, close to Union Square and walk or free courtesy vehicle to any thing nearby.  With most of the major restaurants closing or with limited capacity this hotel helped with finding reservations that were available. The Oxford spa is right next door and has beauty care, massage services, and a gym with free weights. Also check out its yoga classes as well. Highly recommended.  It was truly an honor to stay at this amazing place, thanks again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Hyperlocal iconic experience,"Traveling is a very unique and personal experience,  and now with Covid we have to be extra conscious and responsible on where we choose to spend our time and energy as travelers.The Oxford Hotel is an experience not to not pass up when visiting Denver. The combo of its history, location and authentic hospitality makes you feel taken back to a simpler, elegant point in time. The hotel staff did an excellent job communicating its COVID practices and policies, and it is clear that they truly care about keeping guests in a bubble of safe, hyperlocal awesomeness. From the complimentary champagne and Tesla rides to authentic hallway conversations, this team made my 30th birthday extra special and memorable.If you want to spend time with an exceptional hotel while getting to know the heartbeat of Denver, book here....",5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Birthday getaway ,"WoW!  We had been searching our options for a one night stay in Denver, before we headed to our final destination in Golden. I happened to find the Oxford via Expedia. I travel a lot for work, so I was only searching for major brand hotels.  This hotel and staff far exceeded our expectations!  Chris at the front desk, JD and Stewart of valet were top notch, with helpful suggestions for places to eat and go see. We got lucky w our timing too. Beautiful Christmas decorations were already in place with even more gorgeous arrangements waiting to be installed. The bourbon tasting was very fun. Though I only added mine to hot chocolate. The charcuterie board next door at the Urban Farmer was delicious!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A very pleasant stay!,"My husband and I stayed here during a weekend birthday trip. Our first since the pandemic. We were greeted by Orlando, who was very kind and set us up in a beautiful and quiet junior suite. The room was clean and had plenty of towels. The hotel staff were always masked and polite. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to use the hotel’s Tesla, but the staff arranged an Uber for us instead. We felt comfortable here. Guests were asked to use elevators with their families only, so sometimes they were tied up and it took awhile. Traveling during a pandemic can be stressful, but the key is to be patient. Oxford did a wonderful job of making this process pleasant. They allowed us to check in early, and stored our luggage after checkout since our flight wasn’t until that evening. Also, the restaurant downstairs is fantastic! We actually went for brunch AND dinner. Service is incredible. Great location, and a block from Union Station. We’d definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wedding celebration,Our daughter got married at the Red Rocks with the reception/ dinner next door at the Urban Farmer. The customer service and caring was outstanding. Great location for walking to other places. I would highly recommend to others!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Superb experience for my wedding guests!!,"We chose to have our 14 guests (and ourselves) stay at The Oxford Hotel in October for our wedding. I am so happy that we did! It can be quite daunting to book rooms for several families and to make sure they are happy, but the employees of the Oxford Hotel made the process so much smoother. All of the staff at the front desk were so accommodating and helped us with multiple room changes and requests. The rooms were beautiful and the hotel itself very unique. It is a luxury hotel but small enough that the service is very personal and has the many unique touches you would expect with a boutique hotel. The complimentary bourbon happy hour each night was a nice touch for our guests as well! Thank you to Chris and the entire staff for making our stay so wonderful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Relaxing Weekend Visit to Oxford Hotel,"Had restful visit to the Oxford historic hotel in Downtown Denver. Staff was friendly and supportive. Bed was super comfortable.

We look forward to our next visit.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Old World Charm,"When we go to Denver, it's a given that we'll spend at least one night at The Oxford Hotel.  From the moment the doorman meets you at you car to help unload your bags to the wonderful cleaning staff to the front desk staff, everyone there is looking for ways to make your stay easy, comfortable and welcoming. And not only do they treat my wife and I like old friends, they're also so kind to our dog, Henry.  It's so nice to feel like my dog is welcome too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Vacation Trip to Denver,"What an excellent hotel!  My wife and I have stayed at hotels all over the world and really appreciate a great staff and exceptional service.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming,If you love history and old world charm stay here. They've done an awesome job preserving it.   Staff is very welcoming and the hospitality is top notch.  We felt very comfortable in a deluxe room.   The street noise can be a bit much... we could clearly hear conversations at the restaurant below so might request a room in another spot if you prefer something quieter.  We would definitely stay again when in the area.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A wonderful stay!,"We absolutely loved our stay at The Oxford Hotel. The oldest hotel in Denver and the staff was absolutely wonderful. A minutes walk from breakfast at Snooze, as well as many bars and restaurants. Our room was small, but had so much character (old books stuffed in a faux fireplace). We would definitely stay here again.",5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great staff, great location, great experience!",We stayed at the Oxford for a night on 8/22 and would recommend staying there to anyone.  The staff was very friendly and made check in and check out so easy. The Oxford is located close to Union Station and there are many dining and nightlife choices close by.

Can’t wait to go back to Denver and stay here again!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,First stay in Denver,"My friend and I enjoyed our stay at the Oxford in Denver. We were immediately greeted by Steward upon arrival who provided great recommendations.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming and unique hotel,Hotel is very well located a block way from Union Station and numerous good restaurants. Hotel has ‘old world vibe’ feel and rooms are comfortable. The evening whiskey tastings were fun prelude to a night out. The ‘Cruise Room’ bar is a must !!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Cut Above,"My fiancé and I wanted to do something special to commentate buying our first house together. I booked a room at the Oxford and they took such good care of us. We got in late after celebrating with friends and family.  They upgraded us to a Deluxe Room and had a bottle of champagne on Ice for us. They really went the extra mile. We woke up the next morning and walked to Union Station to get coffee. They are in such a great location, walking distance to great bars and restaurants! If you’re looking for a hotel in Denver, for business travel, pleasure, or a staycation the Oxford is the way to go. PS they’re dog friendly too!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Like walking into a novel, we were welcomed in as main characters","After a lifetime of tent camping, cabins, and the most humble of accommodations, we were unaccustomed to the luxury The Oxford Hotel offers, but oh, what a wonderful place to try to get used to! Employees at the hotel seemed to love working there, especially the bellmen: Danny, Dave, and Yutaka. These gentlemen were quick to open the doors for us each time we returned from visiting friends and were being dropped off at the hotel. To have this kind of service was great but what was even better was the openness to conversation. My husband, who is a retired teacher, enjoyed engaging with Dave, who is also a retired teacher, about the joys of teaching high school. We also shared stories about what we remembered about Denver. In past trips we've taken, it has always been about the destination, the hiking, the camping or whatever else we had planned to do. This trip was far different. This trip was a gift our faith community had purchased for us so that we could return to Denver--the place we met, got married, and had our first child, and had not visited since 1993. The trip was of profound importance since my husband has been diagnosed with ALS and is becoming increasingly limited in mobility. To stay in such a beautiful place and to be treated with such kindness and care overwhelmed us. I loved everything from the painted ceiling to the bourbon tasting; the art deco decor and the jazz music playing in the background. I felt like we had been invited to a Great Gatsby party and for once in our lives could actually afford to go! It was the best hotel I've ever stayed in and I will not forget the experience. Thank you.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,This Hotel Spoiled Us On Our Anniversary,"The hotel is beautiful and the staff is so eager to make your stay special.  They knew it was our anniversary.  I was told maybe there would be something in our room when we arrived.  I figured that might mean champagne.  But I never expected champagne, a beautifully hand-written card with very kind sentiments, and a standing note card that read ""Welcome! Please see inside your refrigerator for more...""  When we opened the refrigerator there was a beautifully decorated plate with cut strawberries, marionberries and delicious chocolates resting on strawberry coulis and sprinkled with cocoa powder.  It was so beautiful--and scruptious.  The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was so nice, had a separate room for the toilet, and had all of the shampoo/conditioner/lotions we desired.I could go on and on but suffice it to say that this Hotel is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at.  Please go.  You will be so glad you did!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Superb Stay at Iconic Oxford ,"We had been sheltering in place for 14 weeks and had to travel to Denver for work and found a great rare at The Oxford. They were working a skeleton crew so most amenities such as housekeeping and room service were not available but the staff on hand was marvelous and our premier corner room was perfection. The bathroom was so relaxing to soak in a hot bath and people watching from the wondrous was so fun. We hopped across the street to get breakfast from Snooze each morning and can’t wait to return during normal times, if those ever happen. Pet friendly was a nice bonus. No places to take them to the bathroom other than some small patch of greenery by the Union Station but it wasn’t a big deal. Sadly our favorite bar, The Cruise Room was closed due to Covid. but had some excellent dinners on the patio at Urban Farmer. Overall an excellent “Isolation Vacation”.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,My room was very comfortable but the TV did not work .,The tv's had been updated last week but the channel guide was not.  Two engineers had to come to my room to get the news channel that I wanted.   Because of the virus the staff was very uptight and not welcoming.  The Bellmen were very charming and helpful.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect Weekend,"My daughter's March wedding was a bust-so there was a small (6 people including the bride and groom) intimate wedding at The Oxford!    The weekend could not have been better.   We had an exclusive dinner from Urban Farmer (a genius idea during the pandemic!!!) and DANIELLE and RIGGS made sure everything was perfect.  The food was fabulous and the wine list was great!  By the end of the night, DANIELLE and RIGGS were like family and had gone above and beyond to make this such a special event.   DANNY the valet was dedicated to our every need as if we were his only guest client!   The rooms, the staff, the service, were all extraordinary.   We shall be back!   Thank you Thank you to everyone!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Charming, well renovated classic building w/great people","Our one-night ""staycation"" was very pleasant.  Our room was very comfortable and the antique furniture was functional.  The bathroom is a bit cramped, and the sink was the tiniest thing we've ever seen ANYWHERE.  The staff was great...friendly and helpful... especially ""Andre the [Gentle] Giant,"" who is not only courteous and helpful, but also genuinely funny.  A real pleasure to be around.  The complimentary breakfast in the attached, but independent, restaurant was good in spite of the limited choice.  We'll review the restaurant separately.  There are three bars in the building, including a complimentary whiskey bar in the early evening.  So, no one should ever go thirsty.  When you check and the front desk representative says you're getting a room with a view, ask ""a view of what.""",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing staff,"We stayed at the Oxford hotel on Friday, May 22, 2020.  They did a magnificent job of making the most of our stay during a period when downtown Denver was still very much shut down.They had a great band, Dzray Gold, play songs on each floor as they came around with a bourbon cart so we could sample some nice bottles.  And yes, the cubes were distilled.  Just one of those little touches they do.The hotel is historic and always pretty, but the staff really made this an exceptional experience.  It was awesome to see this level of service.  Every staff member was very happy to be there and serve the guests.  We were especially enamored with Danny and Dave.In the morning, they showed up at our door exactly when we asked to have our breakfast delivered.  It was included in the reservation and it was truly gourmet.  The Urban Farmer never fails to impress.We will for sure be back.  Well done, Oxford.  The great effort was noted and appreciated!Tim and Chaundra Toussaint",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Super stylish boutique hotel in Denver ,"Super stylish hotel, good location,friendly atmosphere,nice corner room (210) with big bathroom. The noises from the streets little bit disturbing, old building and windows in bad shape!But the best thing was the attitude  of the staff!They seemed to love their job,special thanks to Andre the Giant! We had really unforgettable stay in the Oxford Hotel!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Mile Stone Birthday,"I treated my friend to a night at the Oxford Hotel in Denver to celebrate her birthday.  We were treated like queens! We had complimentary drnks in the famous Cruise Room bar and  free breakfasts in the Urban Farmer restaurant. The Oxford is very historic, built in the 1880's I think.Lots of attractions are within walking distance.  We took Lyft to the hotel. It was a pleasant way to spend Friday night.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,I expected to pay less given the price quoted on Tripadvisor and Booking.com.,"The added amenity fee was not nice. It should be included in the price of the room on all platforms because it is automatically added to your booking rate once you get there. If everyone who books a room is charged this increase then it is actually the cost of the room! The guest has no choice. And I couldn't participate in the perks this mandatory extra price point offered. But Andre the Giant was a good natured and helpful desk clerk who saved the day. I would have felt quite negative given the lack of action taken by the first desk clerk who offered to talk to the manager about the issue and never did. It was too late for Andre to do anything about it since I'd already paid for my room, yet his personable attention and generous personality made me feel better. Hope that he is there to give you a boost. I admit that the authentic old charm of the building is special so you won't feel like you're in just any hotel in anywhere, USA and that's worth a lot. (Maybe the extra $35 added to your booking...)",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming and Cordial,A charming hotel with a charming and cordial staff.  Everyone was very attentive.  The room was transitionally decorated and nice....Great little gym and Great location....definitely recommend a stay at this place on your visit to Colorado.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Incredible and classic,"Incredibly comfortable.First class service, and cleanliness, exactly what you’re looking for in a boutique hotel experience. Deep bathtubs, excellent for relaxing with a complimentary bourbon from the lobby. $10 off breakfast at the adjoining restaurant - with a fabulous build your own Bloody Mary bar on the weekends. Excellent walkability to restaurants, bars, nightlife, Union Station and Coors Field.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Unbelievable staff and perfect stay!,"HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! The Oxford is truly a luxury experience in the heart of downtown Denver. Rooms are clean and the beds are super comfortable. Nostalgic feel with decor, perfect location near tons of great bars and restaurants. But the best part was the staff: ""Andre The Giant"", Orlando, Stewart and Matt were smiley and friendly and took time to chat with us and give us recommendations, including during a Bourbon tasting at happy hour. The Cruise Room next door serves fantastic drinks, and the breakfast at Urban Farmer was wonderful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Cozy Room on My Work Trip,"The Oxford is a nice, cozy, boutique-y style hotel.  The bed was large and comfortable. Like most people, I want a good pillow... well, these pillows were super comfy. The hotel staff was really nice and helpful.My favorite part of the room was the bottle of whiskey on the desk. It was only $40, for a hotel bottle of something, I felt that was a great price. I definitely recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Welcoming from start to finish,"Even though we were booked for a midweek stay during a high occupancy week, we were greeted with a generous upgrade to a suite and extraordinary service from every employee we encountered from the valet stand to our door. The room was more like a luxury apartment and we felt the city was ours for the taking from the moment we checked in. Stewart & Dave are the tops! Thumbs up",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic charm,"I absolutely love this hotel. We chose to stay at the Oxford the first time because of its close proximity to Union Station. Taking the train in from the airport is a huge plus and eliminates the need for a car rental. It's my second time staying here and it's just as I remember. The building itself is the oldest hotel in Denver and as you walk in and look around you can still see some of the original touches. Everything from the individual keys for the room, to the beautiful staircase railings and decor, it pays tribute to its history with a modern update and twist. The staff greet you at the door with a friendly welcome. The gentleman that checked me in was very friendly and updated me with events that would take place throughout my stay. The rooms are a decent size. The bathrooms have been updated with beautiful tilework and modern appliances. I had a fireplace in my room this stay too. I doubt it's functional anymore, but it still added a nice touch to the room. I'll definitely be back when we visit again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,ONE OF A KIND!!,This Hotel has such unique charm and personality.  What really made the experience was the prompt and accommodating nature of the staff.  The Valet Jimmy was charismatic and precise when he offered suggestions on sights to see around the city. We happily took his suggestions and he was eager to hear about our experience. Our only regret was having to leave!!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Style and Class in downtown Denver,"Rooms are charming, staff is ultra professional, Bellman to front end.Elegant little charming and close to everything hotel, in the classic sense of the work, great lounge, ""The Cruise Room"" not to be missed!  nothing like it , maybe from NYC to Las Vegas, or W. Coast.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic hotel,The Oxford is a lovely classic hotel in downtown Denver offering easy access to numerous restaurants and shops in the area. Nice touches like the “real” keys instead of cards highlight the timeless feel and the daily bourbon happy hour is a nice touch.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Monets in Denver,"Great hotel, right down town. The staff were attentive and engaged. Our favorite was Andre the giant who works at the front desk. Lots of great food and attractions nearby. The rooms are comfortable and a good value.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A sleeping Giant!,"We stayed at the Oxford for a company party in January 2020.  What a great experience. We were totally unaware of the Oxford until we stayed there. Now we will not stay anywhere else but this hotel anytime we visit Denver.  The location is absolutely perfect. Close to union station and an easy Uber to anywhere downtown. The staff was warm and friendly, and “Andre the Giant” took great care of us.   The room was clean, the lobby warm and inviting, and the rate was great. Not to mention they give away bourbon in the lobby at night. Will definitely be back.   My wife loved Andre at the front desk with his big warm smile and larger than life personality. What a nice man. See you next year Oxford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,One of the greats!,This was by far the best staff I've encountered at any hotel.  Not only did they facilitate any of my requests but they went above and beyond with their hospitably and recommendations to their favourite places to eat.  We were only there for a couple of nights but I am definitely coming back to this place and have recommended as the only place to stay in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent service and location,"We live in northern Colorado and our thanksgiving plans were canceled due to the big storm that blew through. In an attempt to have some fun we booked 2 nights at the Oxford. The location is great for walking to all things fun in low-do. We didn’t use the car service but enjoyed knowing it was an option. The friendly customer service seemed warm and genuine and all staff was great. The lobby was decorated beautifully for the holidays and the real wood fire was a nice surprise in a down town location. Hubby particularly enjoyed the bourbon tasting in the lobby and it was a fun social moment that opened conversation for many hotel guests and people stopping in next to the Union Station and warming up.  I believe the elevator flooring issue has been improved as we saw nothings in the elevators. The room was a bit of a disappointment. We understood we were booking an old, historic building and often enjoy that vibe but I can’t say we really enjoyed our accommodations. The room was spacious but the floor plan was so awkward that the space wasn’t enjoyed. The windows were the original windows and were very noisy and drafty a sit kinda freaked my hubby out that we could have easily opened the window and crawled onto the meager ledge and fallen/ jumped. We called for an in room fridge and they did bring one up but it looked like it was a battle field survivor and we had no place to put it that wasn’t awkward. I’ve seen posts about the quaint faux fireplace but our opinion was that it was a cheesy waste a space. It was made as a huge room focal point but it’s... fake. If it was in a noninvasive area, it would be easy to ignore but it was a centrAl decor and it offsets actual functional pieces. We don’t wAtch much tv but it’s kinda a fun indulgence when staying in a hotel to lay in bed and view. That being said, it wasn’t a legit option in this room. The tv was small and awkwardly located to the far side of the room. In place of a closet, they provide a too small wArd robe furniture piece. It’s quaint but room size could easily allow them to provide a built in or better sized, classier piece. The actual decor in the room and hotel halls was very sparse. The bathroom was adequate but awkward, cold and sparse. I did appreciate the additional make up lighting around the mirror. This hotel is old and classic but could be improved without losing character. Staff is outstanding. We left a day early -mostly due to cold temps that make walking down town no fun but also because we couldn’t justify the bang for the buck. Pics show our banged up fridge with no place to put it and our view from the bed and view of the tv.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,We love you David at the front desk!,"David working at the front desk was absolutely amazing! My guest and I had a little bit of problem and he was the first to jump in to help us out. By far some of the best customer service I’ve ever experienced at a hotel! If you’re visiting Denver, would definitely recommend a stay at the Oxford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Amazing venue, awesome staff","We had our wedding at the Oxford in September 2019. The venue was amazing, the food was great, and the staff helped us execute our dream wedding. One of the highlights of our wedding was the doorman, Danny. He was warm, welcoming and made each of our guests feel at home. Danny stopped traffic when we were taking wedding pictures and even posed for a picture with us! He was one of the best parts of having our wedding at the Oxford! The location of the Oxford is great for out of town guests. Most of our guests took the light rail from DIA to Union Station. Guests were able to easily explore downtown Denver, RiNo, and LoDo.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great get away wedding location!,"Kudos to the Oxford Hotel and Staff who opened their doors in historic style for my daughter's wedding revelers.  Family and friends from around the USA were delighted to spend a comfortable stay and epicurean feast earlier this November.  Located in downtown Denver, the Oxford is center stage to everything that is happening; food, entertainment, public transportation and all sports venues.  A big thank you to Andre the Giant for keeping us laughing and getting us to the nuptial service on time.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best bang for the buck!,"The Oxford is ideally located walking distance from Union Station, which has fantastic, dining, coffee and snacks.  The hotel is also easily walkable to many downtown locations, and is in the heart of a vibrant and fun area. The service at The Oxford is excellent - I was greeted by Andre the Giant (his own nickname) who could not have been more delightful or helpful, and all of the front desk staff truly care about guests' experiences.  The restaurant in the hotel, Urban Farmer, is quite good, and with breakfast included, cannot be beat.  The rooms are all different - cool deco style and quite comfortable.  My one complaint is that there is no full length mirror to be found, though they did offer to bring me one when I inquired.  For the location and price in downtown Denver, you cannot be the charm, style and value of The Oxford.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Attractive and Convenient,"Classic charm located only yards from Denver’s Union Station with rapid rail service from Denver Intl Apt. In the heart of the vibrant LODO section, you can walk or take the free shuttle busses all around. Andre at the main desk was most helpful. We’ll be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"A wonderful historic hotel with a great intermingling of antique and modern, but vintage styled, furnishings.","The staff are first class and all are eager to please the guests.  We had a weekend Date Night package that was a wonderful treat and a surpising bargain. We were upgraded to a deluxe corner room which was a welcome bonus.   The rooms include wonderful robes and really comfortable beds with lots of pillows. The hotel always has great seasonal decorations which are worth a visit even if you do not have reservations.  Their lounge area is rather small and gets crowded after 6:00pm, but it is definitly worth it, especialli if you can beat the crowd.  They have a wonderful casual ""steak house"" dining room where the food and service are great.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent service!!!,My wife and I were in Denver for a wedding and to see Denver. The amenities and service were so nice at the Oxford we had no need to go outside!!! We'll be back. The evening bourbon tasting was a highlight.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Refreshed Old Beauty,"It was a treat to stay at this hotel and take in the atmosphere of the oldest hotel in Denver.  It has been nicely upgraded but there are plenty of charming hints to its age.   We stayed in a deluxe classic room that was spacious and included a faux fireplace, old fashioned style writing desk, two chairs and a big TV.  Since the hotel is so old, there were also a few quirks with the room.  There was no closet, just an armoire that was too small to hold a suitcase.  There was a step up to the bathroom which overall was pretty small especially the sink.  It was nicely tiled however.  The floor creaked a bit and you walked right into the middle of the room from the hallway so there is no buffer to give you privacy.  No big deal with any of this, just all part of the charm of the hotel.  We had breakfast each morning in the stylish Urban Farmer restaurant that is attached to the hotel.  One entrée and drink is included in your room rate (if you get and turn in your poker chip from the front desk) and our meals were very good.  The hotel has a complementary bourbon tasting gathering each late afternoon.  It takes place in the old fashioned looking lobby with a touch of art deco ambiance, but after one round, we passed on the experience the next day as these types of drinks are not to our taste.  There is also the very vibrant Cruise Room bar tucked away off the lobby.  Guests of the hotel have access to the Oxford Club, Spa & Salon which is housed in a separate building next to the hotel.  I only used the gym portion where I was able to get a full workout in a cool industrial type space with lots of exposed brick.  There are steam and sauna rooms in the locker rooms.  The hotel is located in the lower downtown area known as LoDo.  It is the cool place to stay in the city with plenty of restaurants and Coors Field nearby.  It is definitely the happening area of town.   We really enjoyed our stay here because of the uniqueness of the hotel.  Even the small elevators were fun as each day a mat greets you with the pronouncement of which day it is spelled out on the mat.   We had a parking package so I do not know the nightly rate, but the destination amenity fee is $30 per day.  Some of that money should go to improving the internet speed which ran slow during our stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Andre,"Great location. Excellent and friendly professional staff, especially Andre. Classic older building, wonderful restaurant attached next door, Urban Farmer. They offered a whiskey and bourbon tasting every afternoon.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,SVP,"The staff is very welcoming and helpful, particularly Andre, Raina, and Camille. The location is perfect. And the amenities and extras - at the property and around town, are terrific. Recommended for business or pleasure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Unbelievable Hotel,"First off this hotel is an old school gem. Hidden bar, Bourbon tastings, luxury bedding, leave your key with the front desk type hotel. The towncar can take you where you need to go within a couple miles of the hotel. Walking distance to all you need to see in Denver. Will be back soon.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Talented staff,"Our first stay at The Oxford was a unique and enjoyable stay.  The staff is as funny, smart and competent as any place we've been.  Danny at the door was a real pleasure.  Hotel is great and the staff is superior.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Exec,"Great service, especially by Andre the Giant, who could not have been more friendly and helpful at check-in.  Location terrific and the room was modern and very clean.  Prices are very reasonable and breakfast at Urban Farmer was excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Andre The Giant, helpful man!","My wife and I stayed at The Oxford for a few days before my friend’s wedding. Our initial memory was Andre coming out to greet us as our car, help load our luggage onto a cart, and offer us valet service. As we got to our room we were immediately impressed with the size, decoration, and view. My wife had requested champagne to be ready for our arrival and the staff went above and beyond prepare that request along with some local chocolates. After we freshened up for a nice dinner, Andre was quick to give my wife and I both a reaction worth remembering. His face said it all and my wife never felt more glamorous, nor I more handsome. He drove us to dinner in the company Escalade and was quick to pick us up when we were done. It was an amazing first night and we looked forward to seeing him the next night as well. By the end of our stay, we could say we had established a close friendship with Andre, and are anxiously looking forward to seeing him at our next visit. This time we hope to spend more time with him beyond his shift as well. Andre and the rest of the staff (shoutout to Robert as well) made our experience so much more than “worth it.” They made us feel at home and part of the Oxford family! One million stars!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel and excellent staff,"We just completed a 4 night stay at the Oxford hotel. What a great experience and fun place to stay. The location couldn’t have been better and the staff and their attention to detail made this hotel one of the most pleasant stays we have had in Denver. Fun bar in the hotel, delicious breakfast at urban farmer, and so much to do. I wish I had all the names of the great staff. But André the giant was pretty unforgettable. All the staff was awesome but this guy went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. If you meet him you’ll understand the name.  Definitely recommend",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Too review to write,"I had a hard time writing this review.  But I finally decided that this property just was not a good value for my money.  $570 for one night.  Room was tiny, two windows, one of which looked out at a flat black gravel roof.  The other window looked into a very narrow alley.  No closet in the room, just a stand up armoire which made an already tiny room even smaller.The shower ceiling had peeling paint.  The lavatory sink was incredibly small.  Water handles were loose.  I never could get the water to blend in the sink faucet.  It was either hot or cold, no in between.  Didn't have that problem with the shower though.AC was pretty much a joke.  I had it set on 60 but had to sleep out from under the cover most of the night.The Cruise Room, (the hotel bar), was pretty cool but when I asked for a chardonnay by the glass they had one selection.  ONE.  The bar is known for its martinis but come on!  This may sound picky but on the door leading into the Cruise Room, there was no ""M"" on room, so it was the Cruise Roo.The elevators had rugs for each day of the week but the real reason they had rugs was to cover up the bare wooden floor of the elevator.Part of the room rate was supposed to get you discounts at sister properties so we tried one for dinner.  The discount was half of the stated discount. They sell this hotel as historic, refreshed, revitalized, etc. but to me it was old, tired, overpriced, maybe could be something, but it certainly wasn't worth $500+ for a night.We stayed two nights at the Hilton Garden Inn about three blocks away.  Great room on the corner on the seventh floor, great in house restaurant, half the price, 10 minute walk to Coors Field.Sorry if this offends but this place was a waste of my time and money.  I won't go back to The Oxford Hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Pleasant experience ,"Very nice older hotel. A lot of hardwood . Very clean and rooms are kept very clean. The staff that I encountered. Where very pleasant and helpful. They always have cold bottled water at the front door for you. A Cadillac that will give you a 2 mile radius ride. The food at the restaurant was very good. Fresh in-house from scratch. ... During happy hour , they give you a treat . See foto.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Probably wouldn’t stay here again,"The room was clean and I love historic hotels. On the negative side, things in the room didn’t work. We had a broken toilet seat and it took them several times before they fixed it. When I called before the trip, there was no concierge, but someone did work part time as one. They were not helpful. Use the coupons they give you when you arrive. Really nice perk!",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great location, old world charm- great restoration.","What's not to love about this charming old historic hotel.  Room included breakfast the next day in the lovely restaurant connected to it.  Bourbon tasting in the lobby for happy hour.  Great staff- front desk was very friendly and helpful.  You can just walk there from Union Station- so convenient coming in from the airport.  Beds were great, shower good, would go back in a minute ! Lots of shops and restaurants all around- fun area.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Very convenient!,We went to a Rockies game and then stayed here. Very convenient. Included one breakfast per room which was a bonus.  Everyone loved the beds. Only complaint was front desk told us Cruise Room (bar) was open until 11. We sat down at 10:30 and were told immediately that it was last call. They literally kicked us out at 11!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nice place convenient location,"This charming old hotel is ideally located by the pedestrian mall, the ballpark and many restaurants. The staff here is wonderful and the rooms were nice. If I had to nitpick I would prefer larger bathroom sinks, the floor of the elevator needs updating and the front desk staff should receive better training on local amenities but overall I really liked this place and these minor annoyances were no big deal. They have a nice restaurant onsite and a whiskey tasting in the evening. Go and enjoy!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,This hotel is the epitome of central location. It is less than a block from Union Station...,"The location, rooms and amenities are excellent. All of the staff with whom I had contact were unquestionably professional.Everyone working at the hotel added to the happy experience. Stewart , one of the  concierges, is particularly personable and wonderfully helpful and made our stay even more memorable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great little boutique hotel with excellent staff,"I am a marriott titanium and my company booked this hotel for a meeting. I am very glad they did. Fantastic and knowledgeable staff, bourbon tasting daily (I think), and even though a little quirky I would absolutely go there again. Having physical keys was quite a throwback and the location CAN""T BE BEAT plus they'll shuttle you around within 2-3 miles",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Classy, fun, wonderful downtown Hotel!","This historic hotel has a gorgeous lobby and 2 lounges and wonderful restaurants.  Located so close to Union Station and everything downtown, just blocks from Coors field.  The staff was wonderful, so friendly and helpful, and the room was perfect.  We will definitely stay here again, in fact the experience at The Oxford and surrounding area will bring us back to Denver soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great staff,Very friendly staff. We arrived with a reservation that we mistakenly made on a bogus website so we did not have a room.  Andre was able to find us a great room and everyone was really nice.  The location is great,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Beautiful Building, Great Staff",The building is gorgeous and the staff were extremely helpful. I would definitely go back. The restaurant and bar had very good food and drinks. Their wait staff were very nice as well.Only negative is the A/C didn’t get the room as cold as I would of liked.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Beautiful, historic hotel ","The Oxford is lovely and convenient. We took the A line from the airport to Union Station ($10.50), walked through the food court area, and the Oxford was half a block down. Easy. Check-in was similarly easy, even though we arrived late due to a delayed landing. There are lots of great places to eat within walking distance, and Urban Farmer in the hotel lobby offers a great breakfast (plenty of choices, all delicious). Tours meet in front of Union Station. We didn't need a  car at all!One question that I always have when choosing a historic hotel is whether it's comfortable. The Oxford is. The elevator, though small, is larger than some historic hotel elevators, and the stairs (see photo) are very convenient and accessible, not behind a heavy fire door, no worrying that you might get locked into a stairwell that smells like urine. The bathroom in our room was also good, and the small sink vanity was supplemented by a large bureau just outside the bathroom. The toiletries in the shower are in large, refillable bottles with pumps, which makes me happy (less plastic waste), and shower pressure was good. A quirky thing about this hotel is that they use real keys, and you are supposed to turn in your key when you leave for the day. The first time we asked for our key back, we were asked for photo ID, but after that they recognized us. The rooms don't have safes, but they can put your valuables into the hotel safe. Good coffee and tea are offered in the lobby each morning; bourbon tasting in the evening. An adorable song bird lives in a cage in the lobby. He looks happy and well taken care of.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Stay-cation,We're from Denver and spent the night at the Oxford to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Beautiful hotel/hotel room with friendly and helpful staff.  Danny the bellman provided  bits of hotel history which made the stay interesting!  Great location for food and entertainment.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing Hotel,This is an amazing Hotel that should be on everyone ‘s list do places to stay! Andre and AJ at the front desk did everything to make sure we had an amazing visit from beginning to the end of our stay. Dave and his mates at the front door were so very helpful. The evening Complimentary Bourbon bar was such a nice old fashioned touch. The Cruise room was a great place to hang out and the Urban Farmer was a great restaurant which sourced much it’s food locally. Oh such good food. True the rooms were a tad small but the chance to stay in a place surrounded with the history that is contained in the wall of the Oxford out weighed the room size any day! ( but to mention the rooms you must mention that they are renovated and beautiful!)If ever in Denver you must stay here!We will definitely be returning someday!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Good place for an overnight trip but small room,"I stayed here for one night while I was travelling back home to BC.  It is close to Coors field, which is why I chose it.  The hotel is beautiful, a very boutique type hotel but the room was tiny, which was okay since I was travelling by myself, however, if my husband was with me it would have been a tad too cramped.  The staff was great and I would definitely recommend this hotel as it was right in the city close to everything!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great hotel, makes you want to come back","Though we like to try new hotels, this is our third time in Denver over the last few years and we just keep coming back to the Oxford.   Cool old building with the likely original marble and wrought iron staircase, very well maintained.   The attached bar is a cool art deco classic as well and the house restaurant is very good too.So, great central location and a nice building, but it's the staff that puts it over the top.  From the bellhops to the front desk, everyone is welcoming and engaged  -- they're on top of it and put your stay over the top.  Helps too that within the realm of the job, they express their personalities a bit and seem to enjoy their job.   Makes you want to come back as we have, and each time we've found the same great service -- consistency is essential and nailed here.   Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wedding week end at the Oxford,We all LOVED our stay at the Oxford Hotel! It is such an eclectic place to stay with the most attentive staff. Although a little pricey it was well worth our stay. The venues for the wedding & reception that we were attending were perfect! The hotel's location to many interesting places was great & we appreciated the free transportation when needed.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Service.,"My husband and I stayed at The Oxford Hotel when visiting Denver, CO.  The staff we were in contact with were very helpful, friendly and cordial. A shout our to Stewart, a member of the valet service. He was so helpful with suggestions.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The only place for me in Denver,"This hotel is a beautiful antique that is marvelously renovated.  The rooms are gorgeous, clean and comfortable, but it goes beyond the basics.  The furniture in the lobby, the halls and in the rooms is solid, real furniture that is art in itself.  The staff are all terrific.  I loved the whiskey and the song bird in the lobby.  The bar and restaurant on sight are superb (Cruise Room and Urban Farmer). I will not stay anywhere else when in Denver.  Location is superb.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,LOVED it!,"First time staying at this unique hotel...and it won't be the last! GREAT customer service! We booked one of their King-sized rooms and it was very nice. It did have a very UNIQUE shower though...so much so, that neither myself or my hubby could get it to work! We had to ask someone to come up and show us how to use it! LOLBed was nice and comfortable, and the room was quiet, even though the hotel is SO close to Union Station (you literally walk across the street). There was no fridge in the room, not sure if this is the case for all rooms or not?We stayed here primarily because it IS so close to Union Station and that area is FABULOUS for all kinds of shops, restaurants, and bars. They have a BOURBON ""Happy Hour: from 4:00 to 7:00 pm and you get to sample several types of Bourbon.Downstairs, just off the lobby, is a famous bar that has been around for years and is kinda cool to pop in for a cocktail...or two!Overall it was a very PLEASANT stay, and definitely a place we would go back to.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Highly Recommended!,"Perfect location - directly beside union station which means easy access to many restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. Wonderful, friendly staff. Rooms are standard size- not huge, but we didn’t find ourselves crammed either.  Loved the high ceilings. Cute bathrooms. Entire hotel has a very traditional feel and was very clean. We took advantage of the complimentary shuttle service (up to ~2 miles from hotel) for getting to restaurants and other local attractions. My husband loved the complimentary bourbon tasting each evening!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful building,An interesting hotel. Unique in its way. Rooms a bit small and ours did not have any views. Staff helpful and Andre Thebiant made you fell welcome and soon remembered your room number. Hotel very close to Union Station so if travelling from airport on the train it is only a short walk. Also a short walk away is 16th St.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful Hotel!,"We LOVED this hotel. The people were magnificent,  the bed was heavenly and the rooms were quiet.You cant beat the location, easy walking distance to EVERYTHING.Make sure to have a Butter Pecan Old Fashioned in the bar!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Last Minute Flight Cancellation Made Enjoyable,"We walked into The Oxford Hotel after our flight back to NYC was cancelled due to weather and we couldn't get out until the next morning. We were tired, frustrated and a little disappointed when we walked in, but right away Andre and AJ were particularly kind, helpful and welcoming. They both made us feel at home and a part of the family, immediately transforming our initial misfortune. Orlando and David were also genuinely considerate and friendly. Between the wonderful staff, beautiful spaces with sophisticated styling, and evening bourbon lounge, our cancellation was a welcome opportunity to spend time here. Thank you.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful hotel near Union Station,"Wife and I took a sleeper car from San Francisco to Denver. Got off at Union Station and our hotel was about a block away. It's in an amazingly restored section of the city, in an area I remember as a dump back in the early 90s. Our room was surprising roomy for an old (restored) hotel, but I have heard some rooms are significantly smaller. Recommend trying to get a room that ends in ?18...maybe these are identical. Clean, well-appointed, friendly. Room comes with a chip you can use at breakfast at the delicious Urban Farmer restaurant off the lobby. The funky hotel bar was the first bar to open in Denver after Prohibition. Recommended!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Always a pleasure,"We have been to the Oxford several times over the last 2 decades, each and every time it just keeps getting better and better! The hospitality from your staff is unbelievable.  The accommodations magnificent. I always felt at home, never worried about safety. The spa SUPERB! Immaculate, peaceful, great staff!We will be back!Go Oxford!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing hotel with amazing staff.,"I just spent 3 nights at The Oxford with my husband and 8 friends.  The staff is amazing, especially Andre the Giant!

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,From flop house to nice,Flop house not too long ago. Now a nice place to crash.Room was large and comfortable.Room service was tasty and reasonably priced.Close to all downtown sites and activities.A do again place for sure.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perhaps my favorite hotel room in recent memory,"As I wandered past the Oxford, (on my way to investigate the Crawford)  (I often don't reserve in advance, I like the fun of looking around) the charming Oxford doorman invited me to come take a look. I adored this historic old hotel from the moment I walked in. Architecturally it is gorgeous, with decor that is somehow both freshly modern yet also vintage. The staff is first-rate, professional yet personable. Dave was the name of the fellow who checked me in, and he gave me a very nice room rate.  My room? Fantastic! #402, very spacious, with a (non-working) fireplace, furniture that appears antique, an armoire instead of a closet. After a week of Hampton Inns, this room was utterly delightful! Very nice tiled bathroom, again recently updated yet using old style tiles and fixtures. The bed had more pillows than imaginable, two upholstered chairs, an amazing writing desk, and the floor to ceiling draperies stunning fabric.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,my new favorite hotel,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful! The staff was incredible... especially Stuart, the front door man. He gave us directions, suggestions and was incredibly knowledgeable about everything in the area. It is my new favorite hotel and I will definitely go back again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,We were treated like folks wanted to make us happy!,"Location was awesome -- 1 block from the train station, so we could get there from the Denver airport via an inexpensive train ride.  In the evenings, there were restaurants nearby and we got fantastic ice cream in the nearby train station.  The staff (Mark, etc.) was fantastic -- kind, thoughtful, and great restaurant recommendations. The hotel even provided us discount coupons for the great connected restaurant where we had wonderful breakfasts (Steel Cut Oats).  The hotel is historic -- and we loved the ""charm.""  And the hotel provided free access to a fitness club a few doors away -- a great amenity.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Date Night ,Needed a date night with hubby so we booked the Relax and Romance package for a night at The Oxford. Loved the historical aspect to the hotel and the room still had charm but modern amenities. We also had sparkling wine on ice and hose made chocolates waiting in the room. Only problem was the hot water. It was luke warm and the front desk forgot to mention this as we checked in. Bell hop/ concierge was wonderful too! I’m just sorry I didn’t catch his name. He recommended 2 restaurants and then walked us to the one we chose and got us in right away! We had an event to go to so he also made sure the hostess and our waiter knew this so that we got good quality service but also our food in time!We just wish we could have stayed another night so we could checkout the rest of the hotel. We heard the restaurants and complimentary bourbon bar are amazing!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Ms,"Exceptional & engaging staff, who welcomed and accommodated us on every detail of our stay.

From my Valet Check In with Danny to my Bourbon tasting with David, my stay was phenomenal.  It was clear and evident that the staff is very well trained and EMPOWERED to take care of the clients.  It was amazing to watch the staff work together to ensure that the clients had an EXPERIENCE, not just a night in a hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Kim,"I loved my visit at the Oxford Hotel in Denver!  Andre ""The Giant"" was amazing and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was enjoyable!

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,An unexpected treat of WOW service.,"The hotel interior was aged to perfection, well maintained and in keeping with its ""first hotel in Denver"" history.Loved the period decor in the streaming pulse beat of contemporary Denver.  The staff was a joy.  Comfortable accommodations for a laid back respite from your wild LoDo adventures.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great stay!,"The hotel is historic and well maintained. Great central location in downtown Denver. Loved the unique lobby with a sweet little bird in a birdcage and a number of Remington sculptures. Lots of little details that set this hotel apart from the rest, like an old typewriter upstairs that you can write a letter on and the staff will mail for you.  Didn’t have time to enjoy a lot of the added amenities such as bourbon happy hour or the gym or the cruise room but those all seemed very nice. Staff was genuinely kind and welcoming.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,LoDo Stay,"Always love the Oxford, great staff, good location by Union Station, the ballpark, great eateries all close by.Pretty quiet rooms for the downtown scene. The lobby has local whiskey tastings at night and we even got breakfast tokens for the Urban Farmer!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful experience at The Oxford!,"Stayed at The Oxford Hotel for five nights. Also attended a conference there. Ran the gamut of weather, from warm and sunny to wicked snow storm.The Staff are AMAZING! I can not say enough about the wonderful people and service received. Some of the fantastic folks I dealt with were Dave, Stewart P., and Andre (who was indeed) a giant. Andre treated my wife and I with extra-special attention, and it really put the whole visit over the top. Room staff were also very accommodating.The hotel itself is beautiful. It is clean. Our room (and bathroom) were top notch. The lobby area was plenty big to just hang around and enjoy the atmosphere. The conference facilities suited us well.The hotel has a courtesy vehicle (a Cadillac Escalade) to ferry you in an approximately two mile radius (maybe more). The staff were able to drive me to North Denver to see the street art, and picked me up with just a phone call. Top notch!The hotel is located just a few hundred yards from Union Station. A safe and clean location. I wasn't sure of the distance from airport, so we took a Lyft to the hotel, but took light-rail back to the airport. Simple, easy, safe, and inexpensive.There is an Urban Farmer restaurant attached to the hotel, and the breakfasts each day were delicious. The restaurant serves a variety of foods, and is an excellent steakhouse. Other restaurants were within two-minutes walking. From seafood to corner pizzeria - perfect location.The only reason I did not give the hotel five stars - and it was ""thisclose"" to getting five stars - I wanted to let potential visitors know that you can hear a bit of ""city noise"" - it's worth the trade-off of vintage windows for soundproofing. And as the weather shifted so dramatically - a couple of nights were warm for me, but I learned after the first night to crack the window during the day.I really find this to be a great hotel, in a fantastic location, with and amazing staff.Thanks you guys!Christopher Reay (attended the HomeAid conference - anniversary fell during the week)",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic hotel with old fashioned high end service!,First a big thank you to Stewart and Dave for the water for the road. :)This hotel is at an excellent location. We stayed here for a Pink concert and where close to restaurants and the venue. They offered valet parking and bell boy service. Our visit timed perfectly with whiskey tasting that was a hit. The hotel took us to the concert and for our ride home we took the bike cart rides home. Blankets were provided and we flew past the traffic. A must do!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic  hotel in downtown Denver,"I had previously toured the Oxford as part of a downtown walking tour of Denver and was struck by it's classic beauty.  My wife and I decided to stay there on our wedding night after our small civil ceremony downtown.  When we arrived we told the front desk staff it was our wedding night and they graciously upgraded us to a beautiful corner room with an amazing downtown view, huge floor space, decorative fireplace and an enormous bathroom with both a large shower and separate claw foot tub.  As you can imagine it was ideal for our special occasion.  The hotel is historic, the first hotel in Denver, but is completely updated and modern in the rooms.  The hotel's cocktail lounge, The Cruise Room, located off the lobby was already one of our favorite places to get a cocktail downtown, so we definitely made that a stop in the evening.  It features cool art deco decor and fantastic cocktails.  There is a nightly bourbon tasting in the lobby featuring some of the best from local craft distilleries.  And the hotel also features a great restaurant, Urban Farmer, that offers wonderful breakfasts and is one of Denver's premier steakhouses for dinner.  There is an adjoining gym and spa, The Oxford Club, available, although my wife and I didn't have time to enjoy that.  All in all, it's a romantic, relaxing experience that I would recommend to couples looking for an intimate stay in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic old hotel!,"Love this hotel. Classic, old, style comes out its pores! Bourbon happy hour, great staff. Only issue is the noise. Rooms are great but I could hear every noise on the rooms from each side. Not sure why, but really struggled to sleep due to the neighbors. Overall, a great hotel except for the noise.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful overnight visit,We went to a concert at the Pepsi Center and decided to stay overnight instead of dealing with traffic afterwards.  Stew and Dave were first rate friendly in helping us with all of our needs. So many restaurants in the area which was hopping! And they shuttled us over to the concert. We truly enjoyed our quick stay and will definitely be back.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Oxford ,"We needed a relaxing , quiet place to stay to enjoy  an avalanche game , great food and time with each other. The Oxford hotel is an exceptional place to stay. The room was very clean and comfortable. The car service to and from our dinner reservation was an extra bonus to our stay! Top notch staff, very professional and personable. Everyone of the staff gave us their full attention and made us feel very welcomed. Andre was amazing with his fabulous fun sense of humor and over the top fantastic customer service. We definitely made the right choice staying at this hotel, we will return very soon! Can’t wait, thank you P&P",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best place to stay in Downtown Denver!,"I have stayed at or seen just about every hotel in Downtown Denver. Have to say this is my favorite! The history and character of the building are captured and preserved while delivering on all the things you'd expect from any great hotel today. Entire staff is amazing. All that combined with tasteful and unique touches - greeted with a glass of bourbon and hand cut ice cube when we checked in, one of the few wood burning fireplaces in the Denver in the lobby, post-cards and a typewriter you can use to write a letter and have the staff mail for you - make this a place I'll plan to come back to myself and recommend to anyone traveling to Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Elegantly beautiful and superb service,"We stayed in a corner suite for a birthday present. The lobby is luxurious and welcoming. This place has great valet service and the Oxford presents you with an actual key rather than the flimsy door cards. Being downtown, you are a walk away from Union Station, great bars and restaurants. If you are flying in, you can easily take the light rail from DIA to here. Our bathroom featured a clawfoot tub and a walk-in shower. The beds are very comfortable and it's perfect for a romantic getaway.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Almost perfect!,"We stayed one night for my sweetie's birthday in early March. A big snow storm was in full force, so the free car service was a very welcome surprise! (We had been planning to stroll over to the Pepsi Center for a Nuggets game.) The decor/look/feel of the hotel is gorgeous--beautifully appointed retro room, lobby, etc. I'd gotten a package that included valet parking and in-room breakfast. I would definitely NOT do the in-room dining again: the staff seemed very confused when taking our order and especially delivering it (oops--forgot silverware, so our food got cold); even at check-in and check-out, they seemed confused about it. Instead, next time I'll do the free breakfast at Urban Farmer restaurant attached to the hotel. We loved the discounts at fun bars in the new ""Dairy Block"" area, and the bourbon bar in the lobby.  This hotel is a real treat.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great place to stay for business or pleasure!!,"Everyone was very helpful! Andre the Giant went above and beyond to make our stay memorable!! We felt like family from the time we checked in with Andre, until the time we walked out the front door with our luggage, having a wonderful chat with Stewart the bellman!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful! Would stay again!,"My girlfriends and I stayed here to spend a day in Denver before we headed out to Breckenridge. The hotel is lovely, beautiful lobby, very welcoming, room was clean and updated. Union Station is right down the street from the hotel which was very convenient since we took the Light Rail from the airport. Would also recommend that! The hotel is also close to so many cute shops, restaurants and micro brews.The day we checked out Stewart took care of us and made sure we all had waters for ourselves and our guests we were picking up that day. Thanks guys!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,André the Giant Oxford Hotel,"The Oxford is Downtown Denver. Proximity to everything cool about Denver and it’s place in history make this place the obvious go to for business or pleasure. If you are fortunate, André, the front desk man, will welcome you to this amazing hotel.  His vibrant personality and fun spirit add that extra touch to the perfect stay.  Shout outs go to everyone else for their perfect blend of Colorado hospitality. The Oxford is the place.  Enjoy",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing stay!,"David & Andre were amazing hosts! All of the staff were helpful, courteous and willing to help us navigate the city. Knowledgeable and courteous staff made the stay awesome. Thank you for making the weekend great for my friends and I !!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Awesome historic Denver hotel,We recently stayed here to attend an event near downtown.  Our room was spacious for an older hotel.  The retro tile in the bath is great.  Our room had a nice king bed & the bath had both a tub & separate shower which is rare to find especially in an older property.  The staff at the front desk are very helpful and warm.  We interacted with Andre on check out.  He was great!  The Cruise Room is a gem and so fun to have a cocktail for happy hour.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Super personable,We’ve stayed here many times and can’t say enough good things about the staff and service. Andre and Shareese consistently provide friendly and helpful service.  Andre switched our room to s bigger space learning we had our ski gear with us.  Their recommendation for a fun bar was perfect.  We love it here!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Gem in LoDo,"This hotel is truly a gem. The historic building and rooms are old but definitely not outdated. The sleeping rooms can be a little tight on space, but are very clean and well decorated. The staff are so welcoming and accommodating- it was truly a pleasure to stay and work for a few days. We loved the lobby bourbon bar and happy hour. And the Cruise Room has great cocktails. Food for our meetings was excellent- very fresh and flavorful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fantastic LoDo Experience,"Our stay at the Oxford was amazing every step of the way.  The staff made us feel welcomed, and special!  Great old world feel, and attentive service staff.  The bourbon bar was a very nice touch.  Keep up the outstanding work!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Stay,"I stayed in The Oxford Hotel about 14 years ago and at that time it was very dated and need renovation.  When I learned I would be staying here for a work trip, I was not very excited.  However, my stay was great and the recent renovation was exactly what The Oxford Hotel needed. The location is about a 2 minute walk from Union Station and so very convenient if you take the train in from the airport.  The lobby has been transformed and is a beautiful first impression of the hotel.  Check in was easy and I received the famous traditional key for my room.  My room was on the third floor and very spacious.  The furniture and bedding were all very nice and the bathroom was beautiful.  My one quibble is that the towels were a little thin compared to what you would expect from the rest of the room.  After settling in, I met my colleagues for drinks at the bar, which is so much nicer than it used to be.  It is cleaned up and a really great place to have a cocktail. The next morning, I received a poker chip for a free breakfast at the restaurant.  I chose the potted smoked salmon with a bagel from the 5 or 6 choices and it was delicious.  I would absolutely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Elton John performance,"Oxford hotel was very nice and close to the Union Station.  Best employee there was Stuart, one of the front door gentlemen.  He was helpful, knowledgeable, did not make you feel hurried and a pleasure to talk with.  A real asset to the Oxford.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Awesome Hotel,"We booked here without knowing how very cool this hotel is. It's the oldest hotel in Denver and has so much personality. From the moment we parked outside, we were greeted with charm and class. The building is spectacular; the lobby is warm and elegant, and the rooms are very comfortable. The staff is incredibly professional and friendly. We were very impressed with Pat, who was attentive and helpful, and who greeted us as if we were old friends. The hotel is located in a prime spot - right by the train station, and easily walkable from many downtown attractions. We totally want to come back to Denver just to stay at this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Terrific service,"Our daughter was just married last week at the Oxford Hotel.  During the several days that we were there (rehearsal and wedding), the staff were incredibly professional, polite, helpful, kind, and thoughtful.  A special shout out to Danny who was the first to greet us, but really, every single staff member was all of the above.  They made our experience so wonderful and memorable.  The hotel is beautiful, and it provided a perfect setting for the wedding.  The food and catering were impeccable.  Please note: for events such as weddings, the hotel might be a little challenging for the wheelchair-bound.  Ask the front desk for a key fob that allows use of the elevators; without the elevator, there can be challenges.  Having said that, the staff did come up with a key fob, so we had no problems at all.  Overall, great experience!  Thanks, Oxford Hotel and staff!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fantastic!,"From the moment I walked in, the staff was beyond accommodating. They switched rooms for me in order to get a bath. The bath isn’t a soaking tub but my back was hurt - I was happy none the less. They have a whiskey tasting at 5:30pm and then provided complimentary rides within 2 miles of the hotel. That is when I met Danny. He is so fantastic, very personable and kind. Waited while I finished my drink, opened my door, provided great conversation and then told me to call when I was done at dinner. I was picked up after dinner. Smooth first day. I would highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Another Great Stay,Not sure how this hotel can get better ot have nice people....the rooms are beautiful and the staff so warm and friendly. Great breakfasts and wonderful fitness center. I have been staying here for over 8 years and look forward to my next visit.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Best Place in Denver!,"As retired professionals from the hospitality industry, we are pretty picky travelers. When we head for an urban environment, we want authenticity, hospitality and the best location available. That's why we picked the Historic Oxford Hotel. Once the valet took our car, we never needed it again! Located right by Union Station and steps from the 16th street mall, we were in the heart of it all. The rooms in this historic gem are fabulous, the staff so friendly, we felt as though they were family. The included amenities were so plentiful we can't name them all, but how's about free shuttle service anywhere within 2 miles (no worries about that extra glass of wine with dinner), free use of a world class spa, a delicious complimentary breakfast, a nightly bourbon tasting and discounts for hotel guests everywhere! We were treated like royalty and quite frankly, this will be our home away from home when we are in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford hotel,"Oldest hotel in Denver. In the Lodi district. Room was comfortable but we couldn't get the thermostat to adjust the heat. We ended up opening the window to cool it off. We did not contact the front desk about the issue. All staff were very friendly. They have a free whiskey\bourbon tasting in the evenings. Robert was very informative , friendly and helpful each time we saw him. Valet parking only. About 1 1\2 blocks from Union station. Lots of good restaurants and local brewpubs within walking distance.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Watch your pocketbook!,"The Oxford is a beautiful property.  The service is outstanding.  That being said, I am most disappointed in a recent stay.  I booked a package that included 'free' breakfast, massages and a tour.  So much for the free breakfast, we were given 'a chip' for the restaurant next door.  Turns out free breakfast is in fact breakfast for one.  We were told that our spa package would be discounted by 10%.  That did not occur.  I contacted the property and shared with them my disappointment.  The office manager told me he would credit my Visa for the items mentioned above.  Three weeks later and that has not occurred.  This could be a top end property if they would pay attention to details and follow up on promises.  Back to the Brown Palace we go.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Hotel in LoDo - Oxford,"An old school hotel done right, classic boutique hotel in the heart of LoDo/Denver just steps away from Union Station.  My room was large and lots of space to store things, a faux fireplace but bathroom was a little tight. The lobby was well appointed and at 5:30pm they have a bourbon tasting. My rate included breakfast next store at the Urban Farmer, lots of good choices. Access to all of Denver’s hot spots and lots of trails to explore.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Fun and Festive New Year's Eve,"We spent New Year's Eve at the Oxford, and had such a pleasant experience!  The staff were friendly and approachable upon check-in, and we were stunned by the lobby/entrance area, which was beautifully-decorated for the holidays!   Staff were also very kind to our dog, who joined us at the hotel. It's a nice area of town to walk around, so we didn't have any problems taking him out for regular walks to explore the LoDo area.  Our room was warm and comfortable, complete with cushy robes and complimentary bubbly!  I was slightly disappointed that we missed out on what was  offered by the hotel that evening  - we weren't informed of the whiskey tasting in the lobby, or the complimentary shuttle to the Avalanche game, which we attended.  Overall, it's a beautiful hotel with great amenities, in a happening area of downtown!  We were very pleased with our stay, even though we missed a few minor perks.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Regal elegance,"The only place we stay when in downtown Denver.  Well dressed doormen who are quick and efficient.  Lobby old world elegance beautifully maintained, clean and polished.  Comfortable seating in the lobby.  Grand front desk with agents also dressed well and they are professionals.  Hallways large and clean.  Rooms are lovely!  Again clean and fresh...bathrooms too, clean and beautifully appointed.  Love the verbena amenities.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,not to be missed!,"the oxford hotel is a step back in time (built in the early 1900's).  the lively lobby has five seating areas, a fireplace, and whiskey tastings nighly from 5:30 - 7.  the staff makes everyone feel welcome and the service is spectacular.  it's located near union station, resteraunts and shoppiong.  it's my favorite hotel in denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,My 15th birthday getaway,"This is the 15th anniversary of the first time my husband and I spent a night at the Oxford for my birthday.  Clearly they are doing something well!  We live in suburbia and take the light rail downtown, no car needed.  I want to give thanks for the lovely upgraded room in honor of my special day this year.  Every year I look forward to seeing the decorations and feeling very welcomed.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Fantastic Stay, Close to Everything","We spent a night at The Oxford, on a whim - because we wanted something different than the usual chain restaurants.  This hotel is beautiful and historic.  We were given a physical key for the room.   The pillows are HUGE and the bed was comfortable.  We had a smaller bathroom, but it wasn't ""too small"" - just a corner shower, sink and toilet... which is plenty.  The bath towels were soft and large as well.  I loved that the shower had the shampoo/conditioner/soap in dispensers.  So much better than the small bottles that you deal with when traveling.  The Oxford is located near the Union Station and about a block from the FREE 16th St Mall Bus Ride. This made sight seeing very easy.  Each room gets 1 token for a free breakfast in their Urban Farm restaurant.  The restaurant is classy, has very flavorful foods and pleasant staff.  However - if you just want a pastry and coffee, head to the coffee shop adjacent to the hotel on the other side.  Overall, we had a very pleasant stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Love this Hotel!,"Thanks to the Oxford Hotel for taking such great care of us! thanks for driving us around, making us laugh, and treating us like queens! The staff is awesome! a special thanks to Stewart, Dave and Andre!!! I strongly recommend this Hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Historic, Unique, Good Service and Centrally Located - Thatsgood enough for me!","Was only there two days - one night but enjoyed my stay.Location - So you fly-in to Denver, 30-minute train to Union Station, short walk to hotel....very easy and no car necessary. Surrounded by good bars and eateries.Unique - 1st hotel in Denver, 1890's I think. Have always kept a canary in the lobby as an homage to the miners. Cool Victorian western décor. The Cruise Room is the adjacent hotel bar with historic art deco interior. Food - the free breakfast is handled (via a token) to be used in the adjacent Urban Market restaurant. More traditional breakfast selections free or $10 off more gourmet selections. My basic breakfast was very good. Service  - Doorman are a wealth of help and information.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel,"I was there for four nights. Excellent and unique hotel, with good rooms and friendly employees. I strongly recommend it to anyone travelling to Denver, business or leisure. I am a frequent traveller who really appreciates hotels with its own personality. Bar and restaurant also remarkable, with good atmosphere and excellent food and drinks.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Front Desk Staff is Awesome,"The Oxford has a mystique of its own and arriving has always been welcoming but this time was even better because of Andre “The Giant” greeting us at check-in.  Incredibly friendly, welcoming, accommodating and just fun, Andre was a wonderful beginning to our stay at the Oxford.  The hotel itself is traditional and stately and always very comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Gorgeous classically elegant hotel. Stewart is the best!,"The hotel is amazing.  Christmas decorations are beautiful.  From the minute you step onto the curb, you are transfixed by the elegance and the best doorman ever.  Stewart greets you immediately, remembers your name for your entire stay and takes personal care of you the entire time!  He is so attentive, charming and knowledgeable about his city.  He is a gem and The Oxford is so lucky to have him!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Where to begin?!!!,"Class, style, accommodating, very friendly service, and all with an historic, art deco charm that you seldom see elsewhere.  There are unique accents everywhere of rich, style details from the amazing hotel lobby, even the elevator, and to the amazing ladies room!  (I heard the men's room was as well defined.)  Our room was spacious, elegant, and comfortable with the biggest bath towels I've ever found in a hotel.  These things matter!  After dinner drinks in the Cruise Room was like taking a trip back in time.....such ambiance.  Thank you!  We will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Night on the Town,"My sister and I spent just one night there for our annual Christmas outing in town.   The hotel was already beautifully decorated for the Holidays.  Our room was on the inside but no matter, it was charming and the beds were so comfy!Everyone at the hotel was fantastic, I can't remember all the names, but Andre the Giant was hard to forget!   Wonderful staff, all.   Everything you could want is in walking distance; we ate and drank in the Cruise Room, and used their driver Dan (great guy!) to take us to the Bellco Theater and pick us up after. Great evening, thank you Oxford Hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Visit,"My husband and I loved our stay at The Oxford Hotel! It is in a great location, 1/2 block from Union Station, a few blocks from Pepsi Center. The hotel is beautiful! Really enjoyed learning about all of the history the hotel has to offer. We were happy to see nice, modern amenities, but there was still lots of unique historical touches left to be admired, as they should be with such a unique place as this! Our breakfast was delicious at Urban Farmers. We were sorry to have missed the bourbon tasting, as we had dinner reservations else where during that time. We will definitely plan to stay again, and this time will make sure to be there for the bourbon tasting. Thanks for the great all around customer service from all staff and for a great stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Hot Water,We had some problems with luke warm water first night but called and the Engineer who  checked the boilers and within an hour or so we were cookin'!Thanks Dusty for saving our romantic get away!Large tubs and great showers not to forget comfortable beds and great room service!

Stylish hotel with historic appeal and contemporary amenities. Nice restaurant and bar in the hotel. Great gym. Very helpful staff.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,I’ll Keep Coming Back,"My second stay at The Oxford Hotel was just as comfortable as the first.  This trip Connor & Marc made my arrival a breeze and checked me into a junior suite with room to work and a fabulous bathtub to relax.  When you travel a lot for business, it’s nice to have the comforts of home and folks who pride themselves on superior service.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Loved it with some caveats,"Historically amazing look and feel. I loved the look of this hotel and the art deco bar. The room was super cute, small but comfortable. The part of town this hotel is located is also super cool. We were however by a door that opened and slammed shut at al hours. We complained, and they made sure it was open during business hours on our last night, but it was pretty loud and impacted the work day (was there for work).",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fantastic Denver  Stay,"We had a great stay at the Oxford this past weekend.  Excellent customer service from Aneta, Robert, Andre and Megan!  Everyone was fun and so helpful! The hotel is in a fantastic spot and is so well maintained and very comfortable!",5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,10 Year Anniversary - Terrific Stay!,"My wife and I live in San Jose, CA, but I'm originally from the Denver Metro Area.  Stayed at The Oxford for 1 night to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary.  I was looking for something downtown that was ""historic"" and would not be a ""chain"".  The Oxford was excellent!  Booked the Vintage Romance Package.  Staff was great, room was great, the Cruise Room is awesome, terrific Manhattan's and martini's.  They also put a bottle of Prosecco and chocolates in our room upon check-in for our anniversary.  Definitely recommended!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Barry was the highlight of my stay!,"I stayed with my 8 month old daughter for a night before flying out of Denver the next morning, and Barry was such a gentleman by helping us early that morning. I came out of the elevator with my stroller and three bags and he immediately offered to help and asked how we were getting to the airport. We were taking the DIA train and he got me a bottle of water, and proceeded to walk us down to Union Station. Not only that, but before he went back to the hotel, he made sure we had everything in order and that we got our train ticket. I was having a rough morning and his kindness truly made my entire day! He was such a sweet man and went above and beyond to help us. I hope to see him again someday, as wonderful hearts such as his seem to be scarce these days. Thank you Barry!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,One of the best hotels ever!,"I stay here because of a race that was going to be running right in front of it.  It was so amazing!  The room was so cool and unique with a sitting room, bathroom in the middle and the bedroom.  They had cozy robes, actual keys, great, great, great mini bar.  I had a blast!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great location, amazing staff, would definitely return!","We loved our stay at The Oxford and will definitely return! The staff is incredible, friendly, and accommodating. The hotel is beautiful with lots of old charm. The location is amazing...right near Union Station and a block from the free 16th Street Mall bus stop.  There is a train that runs directly from the airport to Union Station and vice versa...I would definitely recommend this to get to and from the hotel. The train ride was only $9 per person and about 30 mins. We took an Uber when we arrived and it took as long or longer and was much more expensive. We had dinner at the restaurant located in the hotel, Urban Farmer. It was delicious. We also had drinks at the hotel bar, Cruise Room. Cool atmosphere and great cocktails. The evening bourbon hour in the lobby was perfect after a long day of touring/shopping. We used the gym once during our stay. Very well equipped and clean. They even had a Peloton bike for me to use. I also took advantage of the spa and had a massage and facial. Both were wonderful. We ordered room service for breakfast on Sunday and it was good. There is an amazing breakfast place located in Union Station called Snooze. It was so good. Long wait...but it was so close to the hotel, we went after our workout and got on the list, then went back to our room to shower and get ready. There was also a great farmers market at Union Station on Saturday.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Incredible service and amenities,We are staying at Oxfirdthus week and it has old time Denver charm and modern amenities. Andre and Mary Katherine are incredible professional whom I would hire in a hear beat if I was to open any hospitality business. You never know.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A very special place to stay in Denver!,"This amazing hotel has been around for a very long time in it's previous life, and was renovated many years ago into a beautiful and inviting place in downtown Denver. So handy to bring the A train to Union Station, where it is about 1/2 block away. Lots to see and do in this area, with Coors Field a short walk, and great places to eat.   Andre' was a highlight--you can't miss him at 6'10""! He'll have a nice welcome for you. The rest of the staff is also kind and anxious to help in any way.   Do be aware that it is $45 a night to park a car and also a $20 daily ""fee"" to added when you check out.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"classy, fun, boutique experience","This will be my go-to hotel when staying in Denver! I chose it because it's steps from Union Station and I had a lot of day trips planned. They seems to share the funky art deco speakeasy themes from Union Station. The front desk check-in attendant, Conner, was a rock star in the way he managed a dozen things swirling in the lobby at once. That first hour of my stay set a fun mood for the rest of my trip. The complimentary breakfast was delicious - with options like panna cotta and smoked salmon, it wasn't the average hotel breakfast. I didn't use the Escalade during my short stay, as all my ventures were beyond the 2 mile radius, but I liked that it was an option.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic & Equisite,What was not to love about this one of a kind hotel?! The customer service was impeccable! Almost everyone remembered me by name. Old school charm with brass keys; typewriter for letters to home; afternoon bourbon tastings and all the amenities most high end hotel chains have to offer. The rooms are decorated with classic antiques with updated furnishings. The bed was very comfortable. I can’t wait to return!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Super front staff,"Can't say enough about the front staff at Oxford. Recommendations for local eats, brews, sights were spot on. Special shout-outs to Stewart, Dave, and Megan. Steeped in history, clean, and ghost history were really entertaining.",5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great times,"Friendly early arrival. Great bellhops,  loved the room and going to the 20s bar in lobby called the cruise room. Some of the best service at a hotel we have ever had. The free car service within 2 miles of hotel is amazing in a brand new black Cadillac SUV.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Felt like staying with a very helpful family,"My husband is from Denver, but we live in San Francisco now. We booked our stay in Denver, since we both needed to be downtown-- and we were both blown away by the attentiveness of the staff and how helpful they all were. Every day, we were greeted with a smile, coffee, and some bottled water, and we even got to know Stewart and a few other helpful folks on staff because they remembered us and actually jumped to help with our luggage and give us recommendations on restaurants. It's definitely a treat when you stay downtown but still feel the intimacy and hospitality of a smaller place. Thank you, Oxford Staff!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Unsurpassed customer service ,"During our stay I accidentally spilled red wine on both the blanket and the carpet. I immediately told the staff. They personally escorted us to an upgraded room at no extra charge. At no point did they make us feel like it was our fault, although it clearly was. We thoroughly enjoyed the Bourbon bar every day. Every staff member was incredibly friendly and concerned with our well-being and comfort. Their shuttle service was extremely useful to us, we used it twice during our stay. I cannot recommend them highly enough.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Splendor with historic elements!,"We were fortunate to stay at the Oxford at the start and finish of our quick Colorado excursion this month. This gave us the chance to experience two rooms, both were unique, and equally resplendent.The amenities of having a bourbon sampler for happy hour in the comfy lobby each evening, jackrabbit postcards stocked at a writing desk on each floor that the hotel will mail for you, and our exquisite breakfast in the hotel restaurant- must order the fennel sausage!- raised the bar on our bliss! At every turn, the conscientious attention of the staff made this a memorable holiday.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,just about perfect small hotel,"Wonderful staff, excellent location, comfortable room, great vibes and fascinating historic ambiance.  I will stay here again if and when I return to Denver.  We were 100% happy with our choice to stay here for 6 nights.  The entire staff is outstanding, warm, friendly and helpful!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Vintage Boutique Hotel,"The Oxford is a fun hotel in Denver, located just steps away from Union Station. You're handed an actual key at front desk for your room, which aids in the vintage feel! It also doesn't hurt that the Cruise Room Bar is located inside the Oxford and is the oldest bar in Denver, opening at midnight after prohibition was repealed. They also have a fantastic steakhouse inside, called Urban Farmer and is highly recommended for a good brunch! We stayed in October last year and they had a pretty amazing Halloween Display in their window as well!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Hosting an Event @ The Oxford is Exceptional,"My organization recently hosted an event in all of the spaces at the Oxford Hotel. Wow! What an experience! The room was set perfectly, the food was great but above all the staff was the most accommodating out of any other event space we have used. The hardest part about being an event planner is relying on venues to provide excellent service and making sure that all of your minute details are covered. If you want a stress free, elegant, professional event; book at the Oxford!Huge shout out to Cortnie, Mike, Sean, Kat, Katie, Adam (PSAV) and all of the Oxford staff who made our event so successful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,One of the Best,"My experience at the Oxford was so great I opened a Trip Advisor account just so I could write this review.The Oxford simply gets it right in every aspect of what makes a great hotel, IMO.  The hotel itself is an impeccably maintained historic building with authentic character no chain could ever hope to replicate.  We had the most basic room and it was beautiful, well appointed, and spacious with both a shower stall and tub in the bathroom.  Almost unheard of for a basic room in an urban hotel. The hotel is centrally located in LODO near Union Station.  Between walking, scooters, lyft and the hotel's complimentary shuttle, the only time we used our car was to head outside of the city.By far the best part of our experience was the staff.  Attentive but not overbearing, friendly and able to take care of any request with a smile.  I've stayed in many hotels of similar caliber around the world and most of them have a bougie vibe that is very pretentious and put on.  On the other hand, I'd have the staff at the Oxford over for a barbeque anytime.The next time you're in Denver, do yourself a favor.  Stay at the Oxford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Cool place,"We spent four nights at the Oxford hotel. It is very conveniently situated for restauarants shopping etc. We had a bed and breakfast package which turned out to be hilarious! Each morning in the restaurant we were given a different story re the value of our tokens against the breakfast menu. Food was always great though. Generally the hotel staff were very attentive and helpful, in particular Mark on the reception desk. He was that very rare thing...a guy who was informative, helpful, attentive and knowledgeable. Even able to chat to us about Jack Kerouac! On our departure he went the extra mile and brought down our luggage from our room as the porter was busy. We say, hang onto this guy and give him a raise!A great stay...would recommend.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lovely Historic Hotel,"We arrived at the Oxford Hotel after riding the train from the airport, which I would highly recommend.  It was a short walk from the train station so a perfect location for us.  Walking into the hotel you would think you had walked into a different Era.  Everything seemed to be very historically correct for the age of the hotel.  Check in went smooth, Staff was friendly. We arrived at our room and were disappointed that we did not get a King bed like we requested, I guess we should have confirmed when we got our key, our mistake.  Room was clean but quite small.  I do believe they have different size rooms based on what you pay.  It was adequate for the amount of time we would be spending in there.  Bathroom was well done, it had a separate shower with glass doors and also a bathtub/shower combination with shower curtain. Very small closet, but again only there for a weekend so perfectly fine. Had lots of drawer space for clothes.  We heard the hotel was haunted, but we did not have any ghostly apparitions visit us. They also have a Cadillac Escalade that they use for taking you wherever you need to go.  Overall it was a great stay in a great City.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful Staff!,"We booked this hotel after a 12 day trip across Colorado and Wyoming. Everyone was so nice. The room was big and luxurious. We loved the valet department, especially Danny and Stewart. They were instrumental to our over all great experience. My husband and I can't wait to return! I",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Above and beyond,"Ah yes the Oxford, a Denver classic. My pregnant wife and I are getting some work done on our Denver home and so we checked in for a staycation. My wife was wanting a deep soaking tub to soothe her body and so I inquired with Marc at check in. As you can imagine with the Oxford having almost all unique rooms and it being the Friday afternoon of Labor Day this was not a simple request. Marc handled it in stride and got us a room he believed had a nice tub. When we arrived in our room we noticed it was just a standard tub, then the room phone rang, it was Marc, he asked about the tub and I said it was standard but no big deal, he said don't unpack and he'd call me back. Ten minutes later he moved us to an upgraded room with a beautiful deep soaking claw tub, my wife was smitten. Oh and they sourced some candles and brought those up too, Calgon take me away! This is the type of old school charm and hospitality we love about the Oxford. Marc and the whole crew greeted us with smiles every time. We ended up staying another night, the Oxford rocks!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Second Honeymoon,"From the check-in to the check-out, our visit was more than we could have hoped for! I messed up the reservation date but Marc, Emily and Connor took excellent care of us! When we arrived in our room, we had a bottle of Prosecco on ice and an assortment of specialty chocolates.  We dined in their restaurant, the Urban Farmer which was outstanding - food and service!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Return year after year to celebrate our anniversary!,"My husband and I return year after year to celebrate our anniversary! The Oxford is very comfortable, plus they surprised us with chocolates in our room! We always feel spoiled getting to spend the night here and we look forward to returning the whole year. This hotel has a lot of history in Denver, as can be seen through their upscale lobby and historical pictures in the downstairs hallway. Plus, you can't beat the location- we always have dinner at Morton's and brunch at Crepes n Crepes and also enjoy walking around the newly remodeled Union Station and 16th street mall. This is a tradition we hope to have for many years to come!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great Hotel, Great location","This is a great hotel in a great location. Staff and customer service is top of the line. Always a pleasure to stay here, that's why we keep coming back year after year. Already looking forward to the next stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel,"We loved the hotel!  It was in a perfect location, had nice rooms and a wonderful staff - especially Danny, who helped us navigate Denver.  We highly recommend staying at this fabulous and historical hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great customer service, unnecessary extra charges","The bed was incredible, and the staff at the front desk (especially André) went out of their way to make  it a better stay. I don't drink Bourbon, and I was there for work so I didn't really get anything from the extra 30$ a day surcharge. Would be nice if they made it optional.The window in my room did not close properly, and it looked out on the roof of another part of the building, where a fan was pushing out stale air from the kitchen. As a result I woke up every morning feeling a bit nauseous.I can appreciate that it's an old hotel, and the carpets in the elevator being changed every day with the day of the week was a lovely touch but they also look like they have been around since the hotel opened.The bed was INCREDIBLE though, and the dressing gowns were the softest I've ever worn!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Will cost your more than you expect but worth it - kind of,"The Oxford Hotel is located in downtown Denver and is a great choice if you're going to be spending time in and around the train station and more historic sites. The hotel is classical in its decor and is very classy. The entrance is manned by very polite and sharply dressed doormen, and once you go through the lobby, you're greeted with an old-school check in experience, complete with ginormous key for your room.  The staff explain that you get a token (a casino chip) for breakfast at the restaurant and then off you go to your room.  Room are a reasonable size but nicely appointed. The bathrooms are clean and whilst the hotel itself is old, the rooms don't feel like that. What struck me about the rooms though was that the locking mechanisms make it almost impossible to get in! The person who checked me in didn't explain the locks - there's a technique - but colleagues who were also staying at the hotel were given a briefing on how to open your doors. I'm not particularly fussy but if you have to brief your guests on your locks, then maybe the locks aren't really the best? The bed was comfortable, and the water pressure was adequate. Unfortunately, whilst I was at the hotel, the air conditioning failed for a couple of hours but staff were quick to bring up bottles of water to help cope with the sweltering heat.  There is a tremendous bar called The Cruise Room which is really the highlight of the hotel. The bar is staffed by outstanding people who will keep you entertained and supplied with excellent cocktails (try The Aviation and The Last Word). The vibe is relaxed yet chatty, and you'll happily sip away your evening in the company of your friends, new and old.  Where the Oxford loses a star is in three places: first, the restaurant that they've teamed up with (sort of within the same building). It's just not very good. Breakfast is ok but nothing stellar, and lunch can be hit and miss. We had a guest who was allergic to avocado and so we asked that there be no avocados: we received double helpings of avocado. Whilst the staff were very apologetic, I was glad that this was easy to spot and not an allergy to an ingredient that we couldn't see. The second issue isn't really the fault of the hotel as such, but that particular area. There are some really good restaurants, nearby, but they're all relatively expensive. If you are looking for breakfast, then you only really have three choices and one of them is the hotel restaurant and as mentioned, that's not great. The lines at the ""good"" places are insane, no matter what day it is, whilst the Mercantile Dining and Provision setup for breakfast makes no sense at all. Talking with locals, it seems that this is actually an issue with Denver as a whole: all of the good places for breakfast our out of downtown and in neighborhoods.  Thirdly, when I received my bill it included extras such as ""Destination Amenity Fee"". This sounds to me like a ""Resort Fee"" and whilst Denver is nice, it's not Las Vegas (where you typically get charged this). Just include this in your room rate, Oxford Hotel. I was also charged ""Historic Preservation Fees"" - twice per day and I'm not sure what that is for as it wasn't explained to me. Parking is also incredibly expensive. Again, Denver is not Vegas or Los Angeles and $45 to park is more than hotels in Beverly Hills will charge you (The Beverly Hilton, a World famous hotel, charges $42). Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Oxford but that was definitely largely in part due to the Cruise Room. I definitely felt as though I had been fleeced just a bit by the time I reviewed my bill, so be prepared for this. If you go into your stay with these charges in mind, you'll have a better time but for me, this detracted from the overall stay quite a bit.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Rockies Game and Bourbon Tasting,We stayed here when we went to a Rockies-Dodgers baseball game.  We were checked in very quickly and had our room upgraded.  The staff (Especially Emily and Conner) were incredible.  The hotel is only a 10 minute walk from the ballpark.  The hotel and the rooms were clean and very nice.  There are plenty of places to eat and drink within very easy walking distance if you don't want to use the hotel restaurant or The Cruise Bar.  The Bourbon tasting was very nice and Conner hosted it in a very friendly and professional manner.  We most definitely will be back again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Birthday stay,We stayed at the Oxford hotel to celebrate birthdays with friends.  We have stayed here before but this was the first time since they have remodeled.  They have done a great job with the remodel while still keeping their historical roots.  Would highly recommend.  The staff is wonderful.  The evening Bourbon tasting is a treat.  We will definitely be back again and will keep recommending to friends.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Unplanned Stay,"Ended up at the Oxford by complete accident after we got bumped from a Hilton property across town.  The Oxford staff took us in, got us to our room quickly at a late hour and put us into a beautiful and comfortable corner room.  The bed was outstanding and the decor and historic feel of the hotel can't be beat, we really wished we could have stayed the rest of our trip here.  A+ for the Oxford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Artful and awesome!,"My family stayed here for a weekend while traveling to Denver.  The location was convenient, especially to The Rio Grande Restaurant (my fave).  The hotel decor was brilliant art deco or art nouveau? I'm not sure, but it was awesome.  They do whiskey tastings in the evenings which my husband loved.  You will only get one free breakfast token which doesn't work for families.  The best part, however, was the attached bar.  It was like stepping back in time to a Dorthy Parker scene.  We loved it and visit, again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Iconic warmth in the heart of everything!!,"The atmosphere of this hotel is classic elegance. Warm, friendly and inviting from the bellman to the cleaning staff. Everyone makes an effort to ensure your stay is off the charts. Lovely rooms with everything you need steps away. One block from Union Station so take the A line train in from the airport. Make sure to try Urban Farmer right next door. Thank you to the all the staff. I will be back often.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect Stay!,We unexpectedly needed a room late Saturday night and the team at the front desk was able to accommodate us with a great rate for a Saturday and upgraded us to a suite.  Breakfast included also!!  Love the charm. ( it is Denver’s oldest hotel).  Room was spacious and loved the shower!Will I Go Back?  Absolutely.  I would do rather stay at a hotel like this than a big box downtown.!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Delightful experience at The Oxford Hotel,"My hubby and I came for a staycation and early birthday celebration for me while our kids are at camp, and we have had the most wonderful time here! The staff and service has been exceptional, and they have gone above and beyond to make our stay relaxing and memorable.  We had an incredible welcome basket in our room, and Megan coordinated flowers, wine and chocolates for me as a special birthday surprise when I returned yesterday from the spa (where the massage I had was incredible too!).  Have truly felt pampered since the moment Connor greeted us at the door! Thank you to everyone here for a wonderful stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful and eclectic relic,"The Oxford claims to be Denver's oldest hotel. The location a block from Union station allows for smooth connections to the airport. If you check in late afternoon/early evening a selection of bourbons await you next to the lobby. My double was spacious and comfortable, although ergonomically the desk left a bit to be desired if you have plans for more serious e-mailing or powerpoint work.Had steak minute in the Urban Farmer, which was absolutely brilliant, and the breakfast served there (choice of dishes from a menu) was also very good.On the (possible) minus side, the hotel wears its age with some dignity, but some of the fittings are starting to get a little bit worn - or, if you prefer, to start to have real character and patina.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lovely Historic Hotel,My 2 sons and I stayed at the Oxford Hotel for 2 nights and it was a wonderful experience. All of the staff was courteous and helpful especially Andre and David at the front desk...they really took good care of us! We enjoyed the bourbon tasting each evening and learned a lot about it. The hotel has a rich history that is interesting. We would definitely stay again.,5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful City Vacation,"The Oxford was recommended to us by art loving friends.   And it did not disappoint!    Every day we visited a museum or historical site using free transportation.   The location in LODO was perfect for walking, shopping, sampling different restaurants.    But staying at the Oxford was special.   This charmingly renovated historic hotel takes you back in time with service, plus a fabulous health club, great morning coffee, breakfast, bourbon hour all included.   Spa services are extra but excellent.   A visit to Denver without a stay at the Oxford would be a “shame.”",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming historic hotel located in the heart of LODO,"This is a beautiful, well appointed hotel with unique historic rooms equipped with the necessary modern features.  The rooms are spacious and clean with comfortable beds.  The hotel staff could not be nicer or more helpful.  We stayed over my birthday & they placed a basket full of birthday goodies in our room.  You are within easy walking distance of Coors Field, Union Station, and too may great restaurants to count.  The restaurant attached, The Urban Farmer is delicious with fun seasonal food & cocktails.  We travel a good bit, and we are picky about hotels, but we would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful hotel,"From the moment I checked in, I felt pampered. Mark at the front desk took great care of me when the system to check in was down. He got me a water and a glass of sparkling rose while I waited. He then came and got me when I was able to check in. Wonderful service and the rooms are luxurious and comfortable. My favorite hotel for a staycation in Denver. Awesome location with a great restaurant too. Will be back",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great experience at The Oxford ,"We recently stayed at the classic Oxford Hotel while catching a Colorado Rockies game. What a pleasant surprise!The hotel staff is very welcoming and pay attention to the details, they are most accommodating. This recently remodeled hotel is within short walking distance of Union Station and Coors Field. The rooms are very comfy & spacious.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful Stay,"We had a wonderful stay at the Oxford Hotel.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  It's historic but still has all the modern comforts and amenities.  They even do a whiskey tasting twice per evening.  The location is perfect, you can walk to the recently restored Union Station for food and ambiance any time of day.  The best part about the hotel is the impeccable staff team.  We mainly interacted with Andre who was just delightful, but every member of the staff is super helpful, welcoming and warm.  Hope we get back to stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Corner Room,"This hotel is lovely. Perfectly located in downtown, right near Union Station and so many other amenities. The room was so nice: a big corner room with enormous windows looking down from the second floor to street level. The furnishings were lovely, including the original headboard for the bed. The bath was very spacious, with the charming original claw tub, shower, and two sinks. I felt incredibly pampered being there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Best,"We spent our anniversary here this past weekend and it was amazing!  We had a bottle of champagne waiting for us and the room was so comfortable and inviting.

First of all, the staff is outstanding, so friendly and cater to your every need. They all are well informed about the history of the hotel, especially the “doormen”.Bourbon happy hour was so fun— amazing what is brewed right here in Colorado! The rooms are lovely — so spacious, very relaxing. Loved the Verbana soap & lotion in the bathroom!! Breakfast at the Urban Farmer was amazing!! We recommend the smoked salmon. The coffee was outstanding too❤️Pack your bags and GO😁😁",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful historic hotel,Hotel built in 1891 still maintains the old charm and beautiful architecture of that period. Staff was very courteous. Only complaint was the A/C could not keep up so the first night was pretty miserable. It had reached into the 90’s. During the day. The Urban Farmer restaurant was very good.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Central boutique hotel,"This is a fabulous hotel - it's so central to Denver, is nicely renovated yet keeping the old charm. The breakfast is fabulous, and the evening whiskey tasting was interesting and warming next to the fire in the lobby!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing Hotel,"We were in Colorado for a wedding last week, and extended our stay so we could do some things in Denver as well. We wanted to be near Union Station so that is why I chose the Oxford Hotel. It's a lovely and very historic building, but that's just the surface. The staff was great, our room was really nice, the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel. I loved all the little special things like the matts in the elevator that were changed daily that said the day of the week, the canary in the lobby added a cute touch, the bourbon tasting in the lobby in the evening. It all added to the experience of our stay, and made it even more special.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Stay,"My husband and I stayed at The Oxford for 4 nights and absolutely loved it. The front desk staff was wonderful and extremely friendly. Our room was spacious with two queen beds and a completely tiled bathroom. Recently updated, the room was clean and comfortable. While staying in Denver, we took day trips to the mountains for different activities and had zero issues with valet or in and out privileges with our rental. While there have been some beautiful updates, the lobby and rooms have a great vintage feel and the free glass of whiskey each night if you are a guest is a great touch.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"We spent a 2 night, 3 day getaway in Denver at the Oxford. Our favorite hotel in Denver for several reasons.","Oxford's convenience to Coors Field, LoDo, etc is all true; we also enjoyed one of best bookstores one block away (Tattered Cover), Saturday Farmers Market at Union Station, exquisite French restaurant in Larimer Sq (Bistro Vendome) with free hotel shuttle service, and scrumptious breakfast 3 blks away at Delectable Egg. Combine this with a staff (Megan was superb) that remembered me with a birthday surprise and we had the perfect weekend!  BTW, we took the very convenient RTD train from DIA to Union Station and walked a block to the Oxford; did not need a car.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Above and beyond!,An amazing hotel with amazing service.  Great location.  Very comfortable beds.  Highly recommend.  You won’t be disappointed.  Had a great FREE bourbon tasting of local distilleries in the hotel lobby lounge.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Awesome Hotel! Great Location in LoDo!,"My wife and I recently stayed here to attend a concert a Red Rocks and see some sights. Sometimes when you stay at a ""historic"" hotel, you are gambling a bit on cleanliness and quality. Not at the Oxford! We were totally blown away by this place. The pride of care and small details that have gone into restoring this hotel and maintaining it make you feel like you have gone back in time!The rooms were very spacious, clean and incredibly comfortable! Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful ans made some great recommendations on places to go and see. LOVED the complimentary daily bourbon tastings and unique little details that add that special touch. Will DEFINITELY stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Hotel,"Stayed at the Oxford for 4 days last week.  Been almost 10 years since I last visited Denver.   This is really a wonderful hotel, small, a bit kooky (a canary by the front desk!), with yesteryear charm.   The staff are incredibly helpful, the rooms small but comfortable, the exercise area amazing.  The location is near the train station so you can get to and from the hotel using the train.  You are also walking distance of the Rockies baseball park, museums and lots of excellent restaurants.  Also, do not miss the on site bourbon tasting!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Classic!,"This is a classic hotel. I believe it might have been the first hotel in Denver, and it shows. Not in the age of the place because it is well kept, but in the sense that they do their business well with some classic touches. The rooms are spacious, and were re-done not too long ago! Also it’s super central, they offer rides within a two mile radius, and the staff is super friendly. Would definitely go back!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic “Boutique” property ,"Home run! Came to watch Giants loose to Rockies! Had a great corner  room and comfortable bed!Great location for downtown and Coors Field !A bit pricey but it IS Denver, and were smack in the middle of the action! There was a cocktail lounge on property but think they were separate from the Hotel.Very cozy and intimate!No “chain” feel to this property",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent Old Hotel,"I love this wonderful old hotel. So much of the original history is preserved and the use of brass keys as opposed to key cards is a great touch. The Oxford is located in a wonderful area and walking distance to a number of great restaurants and shops. I had time to explore the halls and made my way to older/creepier wings of the hotel. While we had not paranormal encounters, I can definitely see why this hotel is a stop on the ghost tour. The staff was so kind and the rooms were incredibly comfortable. I never wanted to leave that bed! Staying in the hotel meant a free local bourbon every night in the lobby where you could then mosey into The Cruise Room and have your pick of classic cocktails that were expertly crafted.I will be returning to the Oxford for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fabulous Hotel,We recently stayed at the Oxford Hotel in Denver on our family vacation.   Upon our arrival we were greeted by the wonderful staff and just amazed at the beauty of the hotel itself.  Our entire family loves history so staying in this gem of a hotel was one of the best experiences ever.  The historical factor is still there with the decor but it is well maintained and probably the cleanest hotel in which I’ve ever stayed. The staff helped with anything that we needed and the room was fabulous.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Get the Corner Room!,"The Oxford is absolutely wonderful. Legend has it that when Buffalo Bill and the Wild West came to Denver, Bill stayed up the road at the larger and more legendary Brown, while the Indians and other players stayed at the Oxford. Another rumor is that there was a tunnel from the Brown to the Oxford, so fancy business men could secretly traverse from the B to the O to meet ""ladies of the night."" Lush fittings and bathtubs, especially in the corner rooms. The staff dresses in modified period clothing and they have a proper doorman! Straight razor shave shop across the street, McCormick's and Schmick seafood next door. Try the crab cakes. Sorry I don't have pictures, but you'll want to take some when you stay there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Absolutely Great Property,"The Oxford is a small boutique hotel, but it is just a spectacular place. It is beautifully maintained, luxurious and comfortable. The internet is fast and simple to use. The rooms are just beautiful. There is a great bar ""The Cruise Room"" that is classic art deco, great drinks exceptional service....just very, very cool. Their restaurant, ""The Urban Farmer"" is open, airy and serves farm to table fare. They also have outdoor seating, really nice spat. I've eaten several meals there over the last year or so and it has become my favorite downtown restaurant. This hotel not to be missed.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Awesome place!,"We had superior service from the hotel manager, the bellman, and the young man who carried our bags. And if you like Bourbon, all hotel guests can choose a complimentary shot while lounging in the lobby. Lots of fun.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wedding night,The Oxford was amazing!!! We were greeted by Rick who was amazing! He took great care of our car and brought all of our wedding gifts and bags up. The front desk was extremely friendly and had everything ready for me when we arrived. They knew our name and had our room ready. This hotel comes highly recommended by us newlyweds!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Consistently exceeds expectations,"We have stayed at The Oxford Hotel on a number of occasions.  The hotel is structurally gorgeous, authentic, and tastefully decorated. But that's just the basics.  The people that host the front desk, room service, back-office, and bell stand are naturally happy about their work, enthusiastic that you are visiting, and they make every effort to exceed your expectations.  I value little things like the chef's bees kept on the roof, and the inclusion of pollen in some of the prepared dishes, the local whiskey/bourbon daily tastings, and the parrot in the lobby. The lounge is fantastic and full of character.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Service Amazing ,"My wife Anne Marie and I loved this hotel!! Service beyond expectations and we just loved the entire stay!! Two Bourbon hours, Chillin in the Cruise Room, food at Urban Farmer and the front desk and front door staff amazing!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best hotel in denver,"Such a great hotel. They upgraded us to a suite and it was beautiful. The car service at the hotel is such a nice convenience. The afternoon bourbon tastings was a nice treat as well. We have stayed here many times before, but I think they have increased the customer service to the next leve. Thanks!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful Place to Stay!,"We stayed at The Oxford over the weekend of May 5th, 2018.  Couldn't have been happier.  The hotel is in great shape - nicely done while maintaining its charm.  Location can't be beat.  LoDo is where it's happening.  Lots of people watching and fun places eat / drink and just be out.Staff were friendly and beyond accommodating.  Room was really nicely done.  Beds are great!  Tip - our room faced Wazee and it was a little loud late in the evenings with cars etc.  Be aware! The hotel restaurant was awesome - Urban Farmer.  Tip - get ANYTHING with one of their homemade English Muffins.  I had one with a burger and one with a breakfast sandwich.  Cruise Bar - really a neat lil place for a drink.  No tips here other than the Vodka Gimlet was extra tasty.Tip - parking, there isn't any.  Valet at the front door.  Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect In Every Way!,"From the moment we arrived, until our departure 2 days later we were treated so well.   We took advantage of the Laws Whiskey tour package which included a driver to drop us off and pick us up when we were ready, visited the Cruise Room and restaurant next door.  The room and all the amenities were fantastic! Fun bourbon tastings in the evenings with knowledgeable people to help you decide the right choice.  Valets, front desk and everyone we interacted made us feel very special.  Location couldn’t have been better.  Highly recommended and so much better than chain options.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,In the heart of historic Denver,"Beautifully remodeled.  Spacious rooms and lots of charm throughout.  If you’re looking to experience true Denver, this is it! Kathy at the front desk was especially helpful on our stay.  Whole staff was very accommodating.",5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Excellent Accommodations, Staff, & Location","Definitely a 5 star rating.  The staff was amazing (John from booking was great as was Mark at the front desk).  Our room accommodations were phenomenal; the quality of the bedding / bath = A+ with all amenities up to date.  They have done a great job of updating hotel while maintaining it's history.  We enjoyed the 5:30 free bourbon bar for a drink and then walked to local establishments.  Location is right at Union Station, so we saved some $$ taking the A line to the airport.  Highly recommend and we will return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fantastic Vacation,"I can't say enough good things about The Oxford! My friend and I met up here for a girls weekend and we absolutely loved staying here. The room was spacious and the beds were the most comfortable hotel beds we've ever slept in. The history of this hotel is truly impressive, and all the rooms have actual keys instead of a card! The location is hard to beat! You are within walking distance of many restaurants, Union Station is ½ block away, and you can get a complimentary ride within 2 miles of the hotel. Plus, you get discounts at many places in Union Station just for staying here. You can tell this hotel truly cares about the guest experience. The hotel has coffee/tea every morning, and a bourbon hour every night for their guests. The staff learned our names, gave us great recommendations for places to eat/drink, and always had a smile for you. We were sad to leave, but will definitely be returning in the future!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Lovely hotel, best bed, great location ","Stayed for 3 nights for a conference and loved this hotel- great service, everyone seemed happy to work there & were all smiles & very helpful.  The best part was the bed- so comfortable, firm mattress, 4 huge puffy pillows & crisp white sheets/duvet.  I had room 300, which was a corner room with 2 walls of windows.  The bath is small but efficient & nice- oh and can’t forget the softest robe ever, I wish I could’ve taken it home with me. We walked to the ballpark, restaurants, shops....and it’s right across the street from Union Station & the light rail to/from airport ($9/way).  The cruise bar & restaurant were also very good.  Really enjoyed my stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Brought a group for a week long tour of Denver:  perfect home base!,"My group of 22 travelers loved the hotel:  charming historic decor, art collection, quality spa, fitness classes & gym, proximity to Union Station allowed them to have a variety of breakfast options within walking distance.  Amante Coffee right next door too.  Walked to dinner at top notch restaurants:  Urban Farmer (in the hotel), Avelina & The Kitchen across the street, Rioja on Larimer St.  Art galleries within blocks.  Free transport on 16th St bus a block away!!  Staff hit it out of the park - truly partnered with me to make my group happy.  Free use of 7 passenger Escalade in 2 mile radius.  Billing/accounting was flawless.  Every room is different.  Bourbon tasting started our Happy Hour out in an elegant fashion.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great Value, Excellent Service, the location is perfect",Everything at the Oxford was great! The location in lodo was a quick walk to breweries in Five points and close to the Highlands! The staff was super awesome and friendly. The room was spacious and clean. Nothing bad to say.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Hotel!!,This is a great hotel with a wonderful staff.  Everywhere we want to be in Denver is within walking distance.  Union Station is just a 1/2 block away and Coors field a few block more.  The bourbon bar is so much fun.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,How hotels use to be-Very charming,"I stayed here on business for a brief one night but found the hotel extremely nice, the staff very friendly and the twice a night bourbon tasting surprisingly excellent! The rooms were old but very nice (it is the oldest hotel in Denver). The location can't be beat as restaurants are plenty within walking distance and a block from Union Station and Coors field. Can't wait to get back here!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Delightful Historic Hotel,"My daughter and I stayed here while looking at Universities nearby.  We intended to stay only one night but found  the hotel so well situated and charming that we stayed another.  The location  by the station cannot be beat.  Restaurants and bars all around, this part of  town is so  revitalized and fun!  The staff was very accommodating and the rooms are clean and well appointed.   Ours was a  bit small, especially compared  to the photo  provided,  but with older hotels  that is often  the  case.  It worked for us.    We did not try  the restaurant but I treated her  to  room service breakfast which was delicious and right on  time.  Overall, a great stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Outstanding Service and Location,First trip to Denver. The Oxford offered first rate service with easy Valet and friendly staff. The location was perfect for walking to nearby sites. The Hotel had a throwback feel to a time when Crooners filled the air. An attached restaurant made breakfast an easy choice. The hotel was clean and comfortable. I will place this as a must part of the trip and I look forward to my next visit.  Steve B.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oldest hotel in Denver,"Unique hotel with lots of character in great location - right across the street from Union Station.  Wonderful staff - Megan and Jalyn were great at the front desk - also very helpful at the free bourbon tasting every evening at 5:30.  Stewart at the front door was great - helpful and friendly!  Check out the great restaurant connected to the hotel, Urban Farmer, as well as the red-light bar, The Cruise Room.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful Hotel Stay,"I had a great time staying at the Oxford Hotel in downtown Denver. The staff were overly nice and helpful. Especially, Stewart, Megan and Jalyn. The doormen went over and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed. For example, I had to return a rental car to an enterprise location about 10 minutes away. They came a picked me up after I returned the rental and brought me back to the hotel. I would highly recommend this beautiful and historic hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,An elegant grande dame brought into the 21st century,"We will never stay anywhere else in Denver. We booked the Oxford so that we could be close to Coors Field. And yes, it is within easy walking distance from the ballpark, and right in the middle of the Union Station neighborhood, but it is so much more. Right in the center of LoDo. A trip back in time to a gentler and genteel era. Lobby fireplace, bourbon tasting, attentive and enthusiastic staff, responsive valet parking (even at 615).  Comfortable rooms, and really comfortable beds.  The only regret is that we didn't get to eat at Urban Farmer (we opted for beer and hotdogs at Coors Field).",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Location,"Great location right across from Union Station, making it really easy to get to from airport. Upgraded to a slightly larger room, overlooking street, and was happy with choice, although did hear shouting outside one night. Overall great property, excellent staff. Great cocktail bar off the lobby, as well as Founding Farmers. Solid choice all around.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"A nice Stay, excellent Staff","Yes, all the obvious things make this hotel amazing; It's the oldest hotel in Denver. It has an amazing prohibition-era feel to it, with modern luxuries. Free wifi, stunning ambiance, bourbon tastings twice a day. Tufted leather, old books and paintings abound, and the Oxford's Canary (Fredrich), the hotel's ambassador who is a nod to Denver's coal mining history. But the thing that makes this hotel want me to return is it's staff; Dave, Stewart, Robert... all ready and able to attend to your every need! They are why I will return, and why I will sing the Hotel's praises to everyone!A few details; this is a hotel for solo travellers, couples and business travellers primarily. Less for kids. Also, ask for soft, flat sleep-friendly pillows as the ones on the bed are fat and firm and hurt my neck. Beds are very firm as well. The value for the room is excellent in my opinion... their prices are competitive and they give more than enough to justify spending on their rooms, because you get so much more.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great old style hotel in the heart of Denver,"Wonderful property right downtown, three blocks from Coors Field. Older hotel with modern amenities. Staff was fantastic. We got the bed and breakfast package which includes parking and a 35.00 voucher for the restaurant for each day. This place is class all the way.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful details and friendly staff","I stayed here just one night on a quick business trip but I will be back. A check-in, the staff was super friendly and welcoming. The room was spacious and well furnished. There is a driver that took me to dinner and picked me up when we were finished, the coffee was even good in the morning and there were cute little postcards the front desk would mail for you. Great stay! These little details make business travel so much better.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great place with great service,"This was my first time to Denver and I was more than pleased with my stay at the Oxford Hotel. The rooms were nice, spacious and clean. Its close to lots of great restaurants and the staff was extremely nice. I will definitely stay here again and  Stewart thanks for all your help. You rock!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful hotel & exceptional service,I really enjoyed my stay at this gem of a hotel.  Great bourbon tasting and very comfortable room.  Convenient location to walk to downtown sites.  The lobby is very inviting with games.  Cruze Room lounge is a must for cocktails.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Reliable 5 Star Experience,"The Oxford is a wonderful property with historic charm and fabulous service. Rooms are luxurious, well-appointed (but no mini fridge) and unique. You will feel special from the minute you’re greeted at the door. Relax by the wood-burning fireplace and explore the complimentary bourbon tasting. The Cruise Room bar is worth seeing but gets very crowded (we recommend Ultreia at Union Station as an alternative). On-site Urban Farmer restaurant was reasonably priced and boasts locallly sourced ingredients. With Union Station across the street, you have easy light rail transportation; or pay extra for reliable valet and enjoy downtown entertainment. You can’t go wrong with this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Elegant,"My husband and I spent eleven nights at the grand old dame.  This hotel has been renovated in great taste while retaining the beautiful woodwork, molding, claw feet tubs and lobby fireplace.  We enjoyed comfy bedding and linens, complimentary bourbon bar in lobby and fun martini bar adjacent to lobby.  The complimentary driving service was a plus and the location cannot be beat.  The staff could not be more accommodating.  We would definitely return.",5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,FUN WEEKEND,"Very pleased with the all aspects of the this hotel.  As simple as, being greeted upon entering and exiting the building.   Rooms were clean and well equipped.This hotel is in the perfect location to explore all of downtown Denver",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful!,This hotel was recommended for my business trip and I am so glad we chose it. As the oldest hotel in downtown Denver it is full of history and everything was clean and nostalgic. Would love to stay again!The rooms were Art Deco and had real actual room keys! Twice a night they had bourbon tastings in the lobby. The bed was super comfy. If you just take a stroll around the place you will encounter many gorgeous antiques. The service was exceptional as well. All conveniently jus a few minutes walk from Union Station. I would recommend it to all.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Historical, quaint, amazing service!","I was in Denver for a week on business and couldn’t think of a better place to be! Conveniently located near awesome bars & restaurants, sports venues, shopping & 16th street free bus. Historical, beautiful, oh-do-comfortable surroundings. Friendly, professional & accommodating staff. Not to mention local whiskey/ bourbon tastings & “sunshine” greetings from Ms Sherman :) (golden canary in gilded cage representative of mining lodgers decades ago)",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Outstanding Boutique hotel one block from Union Station,Loved our weekend in Denver and this hotel.  Fabulous Bed & Breakfast package with the Urban Farmer restaurant!  We were allowed to check in early to get to a show at the DCPA and they held our bags on check out so we could see the Dead Sea Scrolls at DMNS.  Just cared for us like family.  We will return !,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fabulous and unique hotel,"My husband, daughter and I stayed at the hotel for our one night in Denver. We were highly impressed by the staff members who were extremely friendly and helpful. The beds were incredibly comfortable, the rooms were decorated tastefully and I like that each room is individual. The location is fantastic; a walk to the cute shops and great restaurants on Larimer Street and a quick walk to the arena for an Avalanche game. Would be our first choice when returning to Denver which will be in a few months! See you soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Our Best Night's Sleep in Denver!,"We chose the Oxford Hotel in March 2018 due to its proximity to Union Station.  The next time we stay at this hotel, it will be because we enjoyed the best night's sleep at the Oxford, in comparison to dozens of hotels we've stayed in during the last several years.  The bed and mattress was very comfy--and so were the pillows.  The crisp white linens were wonderful.  It was a very quiet room (with no street noise).  Our only regret is that we couldn't sleep-in, having to get to the Zephyr at Union Springs early the morning of checkout.  We also enjoyed a late night cocktail at The Cruise lounge--and our cocktails were perfect.  We're looking forward to finding another reason to book a night at this great hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great staff and atmosphere,"This really is a ""hip"" hotel, and a first-class one with great character and history.  The experience is greatly enhanced by the wonderful and attractive staff -- at the desk, as well as the drivers and bellmen.  Stuart, Dave and Danny (and the Japanese driver whose name I coudn't pronounce) are to be singled out especially for their great personalities and caring for the guests.  The staff was helpful and responsive at all times, and particularly memorable were the evening bourbon-tasting in front of the roaring fire and the beautiful hotel bathrobes.There were a few snafus, such as no hairdryers in the room and no guest manual other than a room service menu.  (This led to our problems with the room being made up, as there are no clear directions as to how to signal your wishes about getting the room cleaned, or how to use the complicated phone.  The hotel more than adequately apologized and compensated for this, though.)  There also was no fridge in the room, but upon request the hotel sent up a small portable one, which was great for people who like to have a glass of white wine before dinner!The great plus is that you are half a block from the lively Union Station, with its fine restaurants and shops. In fact, the whole area is a foodie destination and in 10 days we didn't have a bad meal.  Even the burgers and deli sandwiches are fabulous. The hotel gives great recommendations as well.My husband was in Denver for medical treatment at Jewish Medical Center and also can't walk well.  Therefore, having the hotel car at your service was a godsend and a blessing, and the drivers were more than gracious in picking you up, and taking you even three blocks where you wanted to go.  We will be back in six months, and you can be sure we will stay at the Oxford.  Thank you Team Oxford for a memorable stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Always The Best,"This must have been at least my 10th stay with either The Oxford or The Crawford. Each time I say it was the best and again this time!Stuart, David, David and all the team are amazing. Housekeeping was beyond perfect. A shout out to Fela.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Cute historic hotel ,"This was a beautiful hotel to stay at. It is on of the oldest in Denver and in such a great location directly across from Union Station. You'll definitely feel as though you are stepping back in history when staying in this hotel. The staff provided impeccable service at check in and check out, also with assisting with valet parking ($35 at the hotel). We stayed in a basic room, so it was just meh. The bed however was extremely comfortable and it was very clean. The hotel has a whiskey sampling in the lobby from 5:30-6:30 and again from 8:30-9:30PM so it was great to enjoy that in the lobby. While sitting there we overheard a tour telling the ghost stories about room 320 where a woman murdered her lover and killed herself in 1898, and how guests have experienced paranormal activity in that room since. Apparently she only bothers single men and not women or couples. We also heard about the postal worker who haunts the bar around Christmas time so that was creepy. Each floor has a desk with postcards and pencils which the front desk will mail at no cost. Overall I enjoyed my quick stay here and would recommend it based on the amazing location and historic status.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Perfect Stay,"We had the pleasure of staying at the beautiful Oxford Hotel this past weekend for the first time and we WILL be back. The front of house staff are very helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable. We had tickets to the basketball game and the concierge offered to drive us there and picked us up from a bar close to the arena afterwards. This staff really goes above and beyond for its patrons- thank you so much Oxford Hotel! See you soon.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Overnight Stay,"What a fantastic hotel. We only stayed the one night before flying home, but the staff and the hotel were excellent.We booked a king room and got upgraded to a suite. It was fantastic.The room was very clean, plenty of room for us and all our luggage! The hotel even has a shuttle to take you anywhere locally in Denver with no charge.Would certainly use this hotel again without hesitation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wish I could say 5 plus ,"If I could escape yearly to distress & unwind -the OH would be my first choice!!!! From the ease to getting there via train from airport ,  the doormen & the most comfy bed ever. All staff so very kind & a spa that I indulged in several of their  services made me feel so spoiled! The Urban Farmer eatery just next door was fabulous. Both this & spa all connected. You never have to go outside! Beautiful historic restored lovely hotel. Fireplace was roaring at all times & if you forget the day (which is possible) the rugs in elevators tell you the day of the week!!! Do step outside & explore as Denver is fabulous!! The OH is directly in the center!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classical Western Charm in an ideal location downtown,"The Oxford Hotel is like stepping into a page from history.  Step into the elevator and when you get out you almost forget the year.  As one of the original hotels in Denver, the ambiance is only second to the staff.  The bourbon bar bartender shares a history lesson with every glass.  The door guys can help you find a great restaurant or watering hole. Everyone I met in the hotel was very friendly, professional and helpful.  I look forward to the next time I can pay them a visit.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"A perfect Denver staging post ; nestled between lux'y chain, and trendy  boutique.","A great place to  get over transatlantic jet lag before hitting the mountains.  Close to  Union Station, you  can get the train  from Denver Airport, then a three -unfit-minute walk from the station. (also  there; buses on to  the main ski areas)  I used to stay here a lot in the early 90s , and its still 'got it' . Refreshingly  old style but fresh, clean and stylish,with its Cruise room  a wonderful art-deco bar,  bourbon tastings , and its gotta  tell you something when  the first two  staff you meet are bright  intelligent with choices but have been at the Oxford for 20 years, management  must be doing something right. Worth chatting to the artistic Stu’  on the door,  who is full of interesting  engaging stories. As for the room it  was good, well equipped , clean and smart.  All in the centre of downtown, surrounded by good restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect place,"This hotel is quaint and beautiful.  The rooms are modern, but keep the Victorian feel.  The staff is very cheerful and helpful.  You must visit the Cruise Room.With its great location by Union Station, it is perfect for someone who wants to take the train and busses and not have to worry about a car.  There is valet parking for those who do drive.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A perfect weekend,"I met my Sister for a weekend at the Oxford Hotel.  The entire experience was lovely.  From Ms. Sherman the Canary at the front desk singing in the lobby, to the complementary Bourbon Hour by the fire each day the entire experience was enchanting.  I have a reputation among my friends and family of being a 'tough customer', but the Oxford met every expectation!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lovely Hotel,"The Oxford is a lovely hotel convenient to Union Station and the 16th Street free shuttle. We stayed there the first and last days of our stay in Denver, and they allowed us to stow our bag with clothes for the second leg of our trip. Also very helpful with tips for places to eat, ways to get somewhere, etc. And a charming canary by the front desk.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The 1891 Oxford  - a pleasant time warp back to Denver's  late Victorian years!!,"A most excellent hotel stay for anyone interested in Denver's early history and who are looking for a bit of pampering.  The Oxford opened in 1891 and  with very tasteful modern updating still keeps its Victorian charm.  It's located in a wonderful (trendy) historical area which envelops you and transports you back into Denver's early history.  The beautifully renovated Union Station  with its many restaurants and lounges is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. A five minute walk in any direction from the hotel will lead you to any number of excellent restaurants.We chose the Bed and Breakfast package with included a $35 voucher for breakfast (either in your room or at the next door Urban Farmer restaurant) as well as free Valet parking (normally priced around $40).  The hotel's no charge  limo (Cadillac Escalade) will shuttle you around town anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel.  Our large corner room (#400) was equipped with a very  comfortable  queen size bed, a desk and two lounge chairs situated perfectly for watching the large HDTV.  A Keurig coffee machine turned out cups of delicious coffee for a morning pick-me-up.  The very clean, updated bathroom was quite modern and well laid out with a glassed-in shower in the corner..  One of my pet hotel peeves is a vanity light over the bathroom sink fitted with a very dim (money saving) light that makes taking out  my contact lenses very difficult.  NOT TO WORRY!  The vanity light is bright and large without being intrusive!  One of the best features of the hotel is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff - every single one that we met.  We each truly felt as a very special guest!! Oh, and I must mention the evening whisky tasting at their Whiskey Bar.  For a bit more drink and conversation the attached Cruise Room Lounge  is wonderful.  The decor is post prohibition and literally quite awesome.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Trade shows,Stayed there for a number of Trade Shows. Just a beautifully restored Hotel. The service is impeccable. The rooms remind a little of the old west style but fully upgraded to the most modern standards. The food in the restaurants is outstanding. There is even some nightlife.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Timetravel Hotel Stay--Bourbon anyone?,"What a beautiful hotel. You are greeted at the door by well dressed hands and a yellow bird cage. Everything is metal, leather, and warm. The time I spent in the lobby alone was worth the hotel. The room has a actual key to open and the beds and robes are extremely comfortable. We came for a Bronco game and we were able to have a car drop us at the stadium. There are wonderful adult beverage hours at the hotel which we were surprised how delicious each bourbon was. There is also a great speakeasy bar inside of the restaurant that makes a true Whisky Sour (with egg white). All of the greeters and maids and hosts made us feel welcome. They recommended three delicious restaurants and helped with transportation. I cannot wait to book our next game so I can return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Quint / ecclectic,Went herer by chance for a trade show.  Turne out it was extremelly convenient to take train from airport and one street from the free mall ride bus we used daily.  Did not try the restaurant but walked through the cruise bar and doorman was a weath of information.  Enjoyed the lobby and sampled some bourbon while people watching patron enter the hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Staycation at the city’s best hotel,"I recently stayed at the Oxford after hearing about the great service and that it isn’t your typical cookie cutter hotel... I couldn’t have been more impressed!  I encourage everyone to go to the Cruise Room, but be there early as the exclusive bar fills up fast.  Also don’t forget to try Urban Farmer, the farm to table steakhouse that is accessible through the lobby... it has the potential of becoming the next big steakhouse chain in other major cities (there are 4 locations currently throughout the country).The staff was exceptional and the room was unique, large, and well-appointed.  While I didn’t get the opportunity to enjoy, they have a world class spa on site and an excellent fitness center.The neighborhood has old world charm and has become the most desired neighborhood in the city... even if your meetings are in the city center, you’ll want to take the short walk to the Lodo district and stay at the Oxford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Glory,"I love the location of the Oxford Hotel. You can take the train from the airport right into Union Station and walk over. The Cruise room located in the lobby is a very happening place for a cocktail. The Oxford is connected to Urban Farmer Steak house. Very good , but also very expensive. This is the oldest building in downtown Denver. They have tried to keep the old charm, and mix more modern design with the old. The Oxford has redone the lobby. I am not sure if I really feel it is the right design. I miss the warmth of the old lobby. I do like the Bourbon tasting in the lobby , and the games you can play while sitting around the fireplace.As far as the rooms. Old and new style mixed. The deluxe rooms are on the small side. If you can book bigger do so.This hotel is not about frills as much as location, and that old time sophisticated feel. I love staying here when I come to Denver , however, I do wish there would be a mirror in each room. Twice in the last 5 months I have had rooms without a wall, or full length mirror. Only in the bathroom. This a bit hard when sharing the room with another. At least with two mirrors one can get ready in the living area, and the other in the bathroom. I will stay again as I do love the Oxford Hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Didn't quite hit the mark,"For price paid, would have expected simple amenities such as q-tips, shower cap, and slippers.  Bathroom and sink were extremely / uncomfortably small.  (Sink was barely the size of an airplane bathroom sink - picture washing your face in that...)  Lobby was under construction so a bit awkward.  The perks from the ""resort fee"" were pretty bogus (useless).  I paid extra for a ""city view"" but we looked out to some ugly, brick, industrial building as this hotel is only 5 stories high.  On the upside - service was good and the bed, pillows and bathrobe were very comfortable and the location/proximity to Union Station was great - easy access to/from Airport by train.For all the options in the city - I wouldn't stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Heritage Property!,Great building. Has a 100+ year old history. Lot of amazing stuff to explore inside the property.Free shuttle service to nearby downtown areas. Staff & service is good too.Interiors of the room are nice. Some areas need upgrades.Location is the best if you want to walk around. Very close to business areas & offices.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Cool old hotel!,"We stayed at The Oxford Hotel for two nights over MLK weekend. We loved it!It’s the oldest hotel in Denver and it’s rumored to be haunted! Being haunted aside, room was clean and cozy! The location is perfect.. literally steps from Union Station. Many good restaurants and Coors Field are all within walking distance, but if you don’t feel like walking, take a ride in their complimentary Escalade that will take you to and pick you up at any place within a 2 mile radius, which you will probably never go further anyway, so you save a bunch of money that would otherwise be spent on Ubers.They have two separate Bourbon Hours in the afternoons, one earlier and one later so you will very likely be able to make it to one each day.Definitely recommend staying here! We had a wonderful time.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Lovely building, terrible service.  Fair warning about construction!","Love the building and the rooms.  Grateful for the upgrade to the Presidential Suite.  (Thank you.)  Love the location and the decor.  Good drapes, nice bed.However service was totally off.  Breakfast room service was awful.  When breakfast is delivered, the deliverer should review the tray, compare it to the receipt, and make sure it meets the guest’s expectations.  Not dump it and run.  We had to get two more deliveries to get the order right. And the order was NOT complicated.And why in the world does housekeeping knock on the door when the guest will be checking out that day?  Housekeeping knocked at 8:30 and WALKED IN.  Clearly, as in any other hotel, housekeeping stays away until the front desk informs housekeeping that the guest has checked out, right?  BEWARE OF CONSTRUCTION!  It started January 9 and looks like a long haul.  The entire lobby to blocked off, floor to ceiling, with large black curtains.  You have to shimmy between them and the elevator to get to the reception desk.  The entire lobby atmosphere is ruined.  And no one gave us any advance warning.   We were dismayed at the poor service, as well as the construction.  We would like to come back, but not under these circumstances.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Oxford Hotel in Denver is a very nice place to stay with creative maid service,"In town for the Holidays, we decided to stay at the Oxford Hotel at Union Station, Denver, CO and we are SO GLAD that we did.  We arrived later in the evening and at check-in we enjoyed a complimentary Whiskey Tasting, in the Lobby, and admired the beautiful Christmas Tree and decorations before heading up to our amazing corner room.  I enjoyed the huge window (overlooking I believe 17th street?) and Whiskey provided in our room.  My wife enjoyed the Huge Clawfoot. individual sinks. and pretty organic toiletries that were provided.  This was, by far, our best visit to Denver.  Every encounter from the Curbside Valet dressed in Tuxedos to the check-in attendants and restaurant staff was exceptional pleasant.  The true highlight of our stay was encountering a lovely housekeeper, Jessica.  While out and about on Christmas Eve, we came back to a fully serviced, immaculately done, room and 2 ribbon wrapped Wine Glasses filled with candy canes.  A personal note wishing us a Happy Holiday and thanking us for our choice in hotels and to please enjoy our wine properly.  Jessica noticed we had used the wine glasses provided in our room.  That simple gesture brought happy chatter from my wife.  We are now addicted to boutique hotels and expect nothing less than the dynamic treatment we received at the Oxford Hotel.  We neglected to say how delighted we were with our housekeeper, of two days, Jessica.  We would like to rectify that now.    Thank you Jessica.  Your proffesionalism, hospitality, and bright upbeat attitude made our already great Holiday Season even better.  I do not know if it is allowed but the next time I stay at the Oxford Hotel, I plan to ask for a room cleaned by Jessica.  Thank you to all we encountered during our stay and we ABSOLUTELY will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Uniquely Boutique,"This hotel is perfectly located within meters of the revamped upbeat Union Station and the 16th street Mall Ride.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Oxford to celebrate our anniversary, and it was an amazing experience! The hotel is gorgeous and our bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever experienced! We loved the free whiskey hour and had a delightful evening by the beautiful crackling fire with our whiskey each night before heading out to dinner. Without a doubt, what made our experience as not just the gorgeous hotel, but the thoughtful staff. All of them were wonderful, but Megan and Danny really went above and beyond to make our experience a special one. 5 stars!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Quick Gettaway,"We stayed at the Oxford for a last minute gettaway.  The stafff were very helpful and friendly and we enjoyed hanging out in the lobby for the Bourbon tasting, before we headed off for dinner.  Great romantic stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Quaint, historical and great location","We spent a Wednesday night in this wonderful historical hotel.  The oldest hotel on Denver was refurbished in 1983.  The staff is fantastic and rooms are large enough for a king size bed.  Clean, neat and in the best location in old part of downtown Denver. One-half block from the train station with many good restaurants within walking distance.  They have valet parking ($45) and there are several public parking garages within two blocks.  Their van can take you to places within two miles of the hotel.  Wonderful for visitors and a special night with your spouse.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Ask for Pat, son of Stewart. Two best guys in the hotel business.","These types of older hotels that are still maintained with a personal touch are hard to find anywhere these days. I have stayed at the Oxford since 1991 and it never fails to impress me with wonderful rooms and a family feeling.Case in point. I was at a photo shoot in the far North part of Denver and I had forgotten my battery charger. I was out of time to go back to the hotel to pick it up and totally out of batteries for my shoot. I called the hotel and Pat went to my room, found my battery charger and drove it to my shoot. Need I say anything more? P.S. Stewart is the eminence grise' of Denver valet/front door staff. Pat follows in his footsteps. ALL the front valets, however, are legendary and match the finest such staff in the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong (which readily comes to mind)",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Christmas at the Oxford,"Staff/service second to none, Stuart exceptional; location fantastic; we loved our room high ceilings, comfy bed, claw foot tub, beautiful floor to ceiling windows: #420. Lobby gorgeous, stunning decorations for Christmas.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Olde World Luxury,"We chose aThe Oxford mainly for its location to Union Station.  What a treasure....olde world ambience, especially the Christmas Decor .... Together with Hotel's luxury appointments made our stay a truely memorable one.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing staff!,"I just wanted to write that Pat, a valet / front door attendant with the Oxford Hotel, was a life-saver when I was staying and forgot where I had left my car when I went to dinner nearby. He took the time to draw me a map and drive me to where it seemed likely that I had left my car. He made a very stressful situation so much better simply by spending the 10 minutes helping me remember where I had parked! Thank you Pat!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,25th Anniversary ,"We came back to the Oxford Hotel in Denver, 25 years after starting our honeymoon here. We were not disappointed. When Jalyn, the clerk who helped us check in, heard we were celebrating our 25th anniversary, she upgraded our room. Shortly there after, a bottle of wine and dark chocolates were delivered to us. That is great customer service and we so appreciate the special touch. I remembered that the rooms are so nicely furnished and decorated in 1992 and in 2017, our room is terrific. We are so glad we chose to come back to the Oxford. We strongly recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent Location!  Wonderful Room!,We needed a central place to stay while we were visiting family and also going to the Eclipse event.  The room was nice and large and the location was right in the middle of a number of destinations.  We wanted to be close to the hotel that was developed around the old train station without paying the price.  :),5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Historic Hotel,"Great hotel. The moment you walk in you will feel the historic vibe.  I arrived early in the morning (6 AM) and was hoping they would store my luggage until check in...They did even better and gave me a room. The hotel is a block from train station and a block from the main street free bus service. Rooms are comfortable as is the bed. Do not expect ""luxury"" accommodations but for a hotel built in 1891, it is first class. Great staff too. If I go to Denver again, this is where I will stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Romantic getaway ,"We stayed in Denver the weekend after Thanksgiving.   The Oxford is a beautiful historic romantic hotel in the north section of LODO near the Union Station.  Best area of LODO. Just the wife and I for 2 nights.  The hotel is impeccable.  We had a large room over looking the historic area of downtown near many restaurants, bars and shops.  Best hotel in downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Comfortable base in Lodo - easy access to downtown clientele.,"There is great, friendly, almost familial, service at The Oxford.  The bellman actually remembered me by name from a previous trip a year prior.Complimentary bourbon by the fireplace in the lobby is unexpected nice touch.And...above and beyond the call of duty; When discovering I had packed a dress shirt with difficult collar buttons, not easily buttoned after having a stroke, Megan (at the front desk) generously got me all buttoned up.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great for the Holidays,"We had never stayed at the Oxford before.  From the moment we drove up and were greeted at valet parking we felt welcomed.  The lobby was decorated for Christmas and I can't say enough about the tree.  It was THE MOST BEAUTIFUL tree I have ever seen. Take a close up look and you will discover one beautiful ornament after another.Jalyn greeted us at the front desk and she was warm and welcoming- a wonderful front desk staffer!They had a bourbon happy hour with local spirits and Maria was very knowledgeable about the whiskey and guided us thorough our choices. The cruise bar is unique also so don't miss that.Our room was large, well appointed, a comfortable bed and lovely robes to use.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,SUPER IMPRESSED!,"The hotel is unique, clean, large rooms and quiet, but it really was the staff that made it an extraordinary stay. The customer service was stellar. I'd honestly recommend this hotel to anybody, especially for a special occasion.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Beautiful, classy, great location ","We stayed one night. The lobby was decorated for Christmas. It was absolutely gorgeous! The room was clean and quiet. We enjoyed the bourbon tasting in the lobby in the evening. Gorgeous setting next to the Christmas tree and fireplace! The hotel is in a great location! We walked everywhere we wanted to go! The staff was helpful and professional. The room was the quietest we’ve ever encountered in any hotel. No slamming doors, flushing toilet sounds, or fan noise. It was absolutely silent! The only unfortunate things were in the bathroom. There was a bit of mildew in the shower. The handle on the toilet was broken. We chose not to alert the front desk because we were able to lift the lid of the back of the toilet and make it work on our own. Overall, it was a great stay! We will be back!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,historic and classic style,"You will feel like you have traveled back in time in the early 1900s. The hotel has historic charm to all the detail. This is a very fun and unique experience; you do not get in any average hotel.   Cathy, checked me in she was so nice and explain the history of the hotel. Marie was helping with the bourbon hour, she was awesome explain the different option. Shout out to both! I cannot wait to have my dad stay here, he will love his stay! The rooms were stunningly update but still had the charm.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great location ,Nice room but not very quiet! Spa was under construction-only the men’s locker room had steam working..very disappointing. Wonderful shuttle service very friendly. Front desk not as helpful..felt they didn’t have customer service training. Bourbon tats ting was very nice. Good location.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A long ago-never forgotten visit!,"My parents and I spent three days at the Oxford Hotel  in 1948 when I was eleven years old. I have never forgotten it. We took the train from Chicago and the plan was to stay in Denver for three days before going on to visit relatives in Idaho Springs. My dad had planned for us to stay at the Brown Palace but I was sick on the train so he told the cab driver to take us to the nearest hotel. The Oxford Hotel was it!  I was in bed for a day and room service brought me the most wonderful chicken soup.  It obviously had healing powers because I was better the next day. When my dad's elderly aunt learned where we had stayed, she said she and her husband had spent their honeymoon there in the early 1890's. The hotel was probably new about then. I guess it's time for my husband and I to visit!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent visit,"This quaint old hotel comes with period furniture, old photographs and even its own ghost. I was there for a business meeting and enjoyed the visit greatly. The staff really cared and were prideful of their hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,SPA was horrendous,"I took my mom to use the spa at the Oxford hotel on her birthday. She lives on Wynkoop so loved the convenience and figured it must be a great spa. The layout of the spa is very odd, and the locker rooms were similar to a YMCA- with a slab of granite thrown on top. Dirty, dingy, old, gross, and used for the staff as well as the guests. Staff were in there using their phones and putting their things away while we are trying to get disrobed for our massages. Then, once you locked your things away in a locker full of trash and grime, we walked upstairs through the loud music and bright lights of the salon. I'm not opposed to either of these things while I'm in a salon- not right before a massage. Then the ""waiting room"" was a hallway where we got to see 20+ staff members walk up and down, chatting with one another, going in and out of the salon/spa. Not relaxing in the least. Upon entering the massage room, I realized the heated bed and blankets weren't necessary as the room was a balmy 82 degrees. Construction noises i.e.: loud banging [that of a hammer drill possibly???] were the music to our session. AHHH. ... If they were in the middle of a remodel, this should have been made known to us and we should have  rescheduled. This was a disaster of a spa experience. I won't be back to see the remodel.",1
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent!,We travel to Denver every month for business.  This boutique hotel is in a great location.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  Friendly staff!  This is the only place we will stay now when we are in the area.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,5-Star Staff,"The staff at the Oxford Hotel is simply fantastic.  I spend about 100 nights a year on the road and see a variety of hotels and a variety of staff. The front desk and the bell stand employees are simply fantastic. They were extremely helpful in every regard and very comforting on a number of issues.  Stewart, Rick, Danny, Meagan and Amel were polite, friendly and create a warm/friendly environment. I saw all of them working very long hours from morning till night and they just kept a positive attitude that makes for a very wonderful customer experience. The hotel is beautiful and rustic but the staff made the trip wonderful.  They all went out of their way to do something very special. The location in downtown Denver is absolutely perfect.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Delightful, Exceptional Hospitality in the heart of Denver","If you are looking for more than a hotel, chose The Oxford. A delightful location for my first time in Denver to attend an international conference.  Truly a jewel of a luxury boutique hotel moment the bellman opened the doors and Amel welcomed me to this quaint, historic hotel.  Amel, at the registration desk along with the Bellmen, Dave, Stewart and Rick demonstrated the true art of hospitality as I felt right at home. Keeping the fire in the fireplace and Bourbon tasting in the evening, it was evident they are proud of the Oxford and truly love their jobs to make for an exceptional experience I won't forget! Next time in Denver, I wouldn't stay anywhere else!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Close to so many attractions,"The location was super (and the nightly bourbon tasting was a nice touch.)  However, it was the staff made our stay so enjoyable.  The bellmen, Stewart and Dave, were extremely friendly and helpful.  The bartenders in the hotel and the restaurant, Tim, Danielle, and Andy, were funny as well as friendly.  We're looking forward to our next visit.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Heart of downtown Denver,"Absolutely beautiful historic luxury hotel. The staff are so accommodating and friendly. Everywhere you turn in the hotel, there are little treasure that make your experience rememberable. It's located right across Union Station so getting there from the airport was easy. Just take the airport train to the last stop ($9 one way-cheaper than an uber!) Also it's in the heart of downtown so you can literally walk to hundreds of restaurants and shops.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,STEWART the bell captain was very helpful and outgoing.,Great location to Union station and 16th street shopping and dining. My husband liked the bourbon tasting every evening. So much history to enjoy. Nice restaurant in hotel also with reasonable prices.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming hotel and pleasant stay,"I stayed here for a couple nights and appreciated the unique charm and personality of this hotel. Staff is friendly and attentive. My room was quiet, as requested, and my bed was comfortable. Location is great and walking distance to several eats nearby. The gym is a bit confusing to get to, but once you get there, it is nice and has everything you need.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great location with a few reservations,"First off this is one of the better locations of hotels I have stayed at in the 16th St. Mall area - I've stayed on the far south end, the middle, convention center area, etc. Since we were attending a concert at the Pepsi Center it was really close and walkable. The price was decent comparatively and I had always wanted to stay here. My main qualms would be as follows:1. The rooms are SMALL - not a huge deal for my husband and I but just a statement. The bed however was really comfortable.2. The temperature - every hotel I have stayed in has allowed me to cool off the room. The wall thermostat didn't seem to make any difference whether it was on low, medium or high the fan blew the same. Thankfully it wasn't too hot out but I do like to cool off a room before sleeping and I couldn't.3. The facility or resort fee or whatever they call it is not appreciated. I didn't need or want to utilize any of those features so why do I still have to pay it? If you need to charge more for a room then do so, don't add on the cost as this supposed great addition because it isn't. Unlimited free calls? Is that ever an issue??4. Parking fees are pretty high. Maybe they are standard down there but $45 a day is crazy.Otherwise the beds are comfy and the location is great.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Weekend visit to Lodo, Denver, CO","We love to stay at the Oxford Hotel whenever we visit Denver.  It is a beautiful, historic hotel which has been recently updated.  The location is perfect - within walking distance of Union Station, Coors Field, and numerous great restaurants and pubs.  The service is excellent.  We were especially impressed with our valet, Stuart, who was very friendly and helpful with advising us on places to visit and how to best get around in Lodo.  We highly recommend the Oxford Hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming hotel in an excellent location,"Loved my stay at this hotel. Situated just across the road from the main train station and lots of great restaurants nearby, the location couldn't be better. I adored the classically chic black and white tiled bathroom, and all the thoughtful little touches like the free evening nightcap and the chauffeur service within a certain radius. I also stayed at the Crawford Hotel during the same trip - both offer a similar level of service and gorgeousness in interior decor, but I preferred the Oxford Hotel as it's quieter and more peaceful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford @ Downtown Denver,"People are wonderful as you take a small step back in time.  This is a historic hotel with a charm reminding me of days long past.  I am very familiar with the down town area and this place puts you in the middle of the activities.  If you are seeking the loud dance/night club it is a short walk.  If you want to take in a sporting event the Rockies, Broncos, Nuggets are within walking if you take the light rail. The food venues in walking distance range from fast food to elegant dining.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Uncomfortably old,Just old and worn down. The bathroom is just dirty with very old tile and toilet had rust stains. Very uncomfortable. Also the windows are single panel and let every noise through which makes it impossible to sleep. I think their old fashioned positioning is a great excuse to do absolutely no upgrade at all. They seem to call that character. Go somewhere else if you like to sleep comfortably and feel clean after you use the bathroom.,1
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Denver Experience,"My wife and I had a wonderful 4 day experience at Oxford Hotel. We especially liked the convience to Lodo. We walked to Coors Field, easy light rail to Mile High stadium to watch the Broncos. Close to Laramie Sq and lots of restaurants. The Nightly free bourbon and free yoga was a plus. Can’t close without mentioning the Bellman Stewart who was helpful everyday.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Most charming hotel in downtown Denver.,"Love this hotel. Every room is an original. Great period architecture, beautiful lobby, cozy restaurant area, even a great urban spa next door. Union Station in walking distance, and all the fancy restaurants in LoDo and Larimer Square nearby. Greatly appreciated and recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Disappointed,The location is very convenient to Union Station.  Older hotel with very creaky floors and tight bath.  Bed was great and very comfortable. Free upgrade to a suite without requesting.  Very small lobby but great staff and service.,3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Just lovely, with great service ","After spending the previous night at a hip-but-shallow-with-practically-no-service nearby hotel, The Oxford was a welcome return to service and comfort.  They have done a good job combining lush history with modern amenities.  The bed was super comfortable, the room was well appointed, the lobby was cozy. Appreciated the morning newspaper and complimentary coffee.  Very civilized noon check out time. Really welcoming front desk staff, too.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wedding Dream,"We chose the Oxford Hotel for our wedding venue in June of this year and as our primary hotel for guests. We did a destination wedding to Denver and the Oxford was a dream to work with! The staff is impeccable and everyone had a true hospitality attitude. Chris Luersen in particular truly went above and beyond and I cannot recommend him enough. The sticker price of the hotel for both our wedding and rooms seemed like a lot, but after comparing other venues in the downtown area, you definitely get your value! Everyone there does the right thing and does not try to cut corners for you. The venue has a classic beauty that did not require much decoration or a dance floor in the ballroom (saving us $$$). I cannot wait to stay with them again on our next trip to Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful service and location ,"I love the Oxford Hotel, mi husband can't decide. I love it because every room is unique the service is fantastic, the bar is great and the location is wonderful, you can walk to 16 street mall or the train station or the wonderful tattered cover book store. Breakfast and internet is what my husband isn't too keen on but for me if in down town Denver it is the Oxford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Good choice for LoDo,"After a couple of rotten nights at chain hotels in Denver this was a pleasant change.Cheerful, friendly staff, nice decor, cool neighborhood which is great for walking.The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Great amenities. My only gripe is that the windows are painted closed and I am fresh air fiend. Otherwise all good.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Labor Day weekend,"We had a wonderful time in Denver and at this sweet clean hotel. The staff at the front desk and the bell men at the front were smiling and enjoyable. I loved the tasseled key.The location and the old decor with the modern conveniences. Take the train from Denver Airport to the Union Station and walk. Great location, Such a fun adventure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Love the location!  Love the vibe!,"My wife and I had a chance to stay at The Oxford to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary (we also stayed there on our wedding night).  Just a great place.  Wonderful people - very accommodating given this was a special event.  Hotel is very much a ""downtown experience"" right near plenty of restaurants, bars and Union Station.  So a great place if you are up for walking and experiencing the area.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Historic Hotel!,"The Oxford Hotel is in the heart of downtown LODO Denver, walking distance to Union Station, which is where the action is!  We stayed 4 nights, the hotel was very friendly & accommodating, however during our visit, the restaurant & bar was under renovation & closed.  This was disappointing, but there are so many bars & restaurants within walking distance, we were able to overcome this!Very quaint, historic hotel, with real keys/tassels to the doors.  Just remember to take the key out of the door at night....Oops!  The elevator changes the rug daily to the day of week so you always know what day it is💛",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,almost worth the price,"The Oxford Hotel is wonderfully located, just half a block from Union Station, where one can enjoy all manner of delicious food while waiting for a train or a bus. The hotel itself is charming, and offers free bourbon tasting every day at 5:30 pm. All of this is to the good. On the down side, a couple of staff members were less than responsive, failing to answer the desk phone, or to answer relatively simple questions about nearby features of the city. The hotel is rather expensive, so such lapses are less forgivable than they would be in a cheaper venue.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A lovely hotel,"We had a lovely stay at the Oxford recently. It is in a perfect location for those who like to walk and experience the local flavor.It is only a block away from the refurbished Union Station and is within easy walking distance of any downtown location you might want to visit. The hotel staff was outstanding at every turn. The Cruise Room bar is a great throwback to an earlier era.The bourbon tasting was well done and engaging.And the new restaurant, The Urban Farmer, is a perfect addition. Don't miss this, even if just for a drink or an appetizer. As a bonus, our room was perfect for people watching with a great view of Union Station.We greatly enjoyed our stay and will return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Opulent Oxford,The Oxford is a boutique beauty of luxurious accommodations and lavish architecture. A vintage typewriter awaits your letter writing enjoyment on the second floor. The lobby contains plush seating and beautiful art. The rooms are quiet and comfortable.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,History with Modern Feel,"The hotel is steeped with history that you can see all around the hotel.  It starts with the small but beautiful lobby and the Cruise Room next  door   The keys are even old style.  The rooms are well done though and feel part history and part modern.  Bathrooms are fairly small but this is acceptable in an historic hotel.  Some rooms are said to be haunted which gives an interesting feel. This is not a bargain place to stay however but it certainly a place to experience and is just down the road from a lot of activities in Union Station and plenty or restaurants, etc. in the area.  Area around here also felt safe opposed to other areas that we walked in the downtown area.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel and awesome location!,We booked this hotel on Hotwire and couldn't be happier.  The location is smack in the middle of an area full of great restaurants and bars.  The quality of the room is also excellent.  They are kind of small rooms but we aren't in the room enough to mind.  The staff is especially on point...and thanks to the valet guys nick and Stuart on great recommendations on food drinks and things To do.   This hotel is also very close to Coors Field and even closer to union station.  Looking forward to coming back!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A quick trip!,"The placement of this hotel is awesome. So close to the Union Station, breweries, and Coors Field. The service from staff was top notch. We were in room 206 which was nice, but noisy. It is right above a bar and music was heard until late at night. Parking was the downfall to this facility. It is $45 for valet and $14 in the parking garage a block and a half away. The place is old, but the rooms are clean and nicely decorated. A bit of mold in the bathroom, but not bad. We would probably go back just for the placement of the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Brilliant Hotel!,We stayed at The Oxford for our last night before travelling back to the UK from Denver airport. The hotel was brilliant. The room was beautiful and the staff were excellent. It is in a great area for restaurants and bars. It is also a two minute walk from Union station which has very regular trains directly to Denver airport for $11.  We stayed in 11 places on our trip to America and this was my favourite hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing staff,We were unexpectedly delayed in Denver.  It was impossible for us the find a room at 4 am.  We were Unable to find a hotel within 30 miles of the airport.  The gentleman who assisted us in finding a room was very kind and understanding.  The room was gorgeous.  Very old style and classic accommodations.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Loved our time here!,"We really liked this hotel. It's well run, with excellent, professional and accommodating staff. The rooms were clean, had sufficient storage, and were nicely designed. The bar in the hotel is cool, though the food wasn't great. The whiskey tasting happy hour was also a fun treat. The location is fantastic - within walking distance of a lot of great sites like Union Station, Coors Field, and lots of nice shopping and eating neighborhoods. It's nice that they offered free rides within a certain radius but we were only able to use that amenity once because you had to book about a day in advance and some of the sites we wanted rides to were out of the radius (even though just barely). They seemed to follow strict rules with the car service and wouldn't even drive us part of the way to our destination which was out of the radius. Other than that, though, we had a great time. Another perk is that the doormen hand out free water bottles generously, which was really useful for us during the hot week we visited. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It's not the cheapest place to stay, but the vintage romance package came with free valet and we found the price well worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Wonderful hotel, perfect location, delightful staff!","My friend and I stayed at the Oxford Hotel this past weekend for a ""girls getaway."" It was my first trip to Denver and I was so impressed with the location and quality of this historic hotel. I loved that they still have old-fashioned keys with corded tassels that you drop off and pick up from the front desk as you come and go. Our room was very comfortable, with two double beds and a very large bathroom. Wifi worked great and the room was quiet.This is definitely a great location, being only steps from Union Station, The Tattered Cover, Wynkoop Brewing, Larimer Square, and the baseball stadium. You can walk everywhere but if you need a ride, the hotel offers free use of a Lincoln Town Care (within a 2 mile radius) if you need a ride.I highly recommend this hotel for business travelers, tourists, families, weekend adventurers and more. We will definitely return!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Totally satisfied,"Within a block of Union Station ($9 train ticket to/from the Airport - quickest, cleanest, most reliable way to get there and back) in the heart of LoDo.  Within walking distance of any type of eatery your heart, stomach, and wallet desires, but if you prefer, they offer free shuttle within 2 miles of the hotel.  This is an historic hotel, quaint, clean, and convenient for the traveler that does not need all the glitz that a 4 Seasons offers but values a hassle free experience.  Incredibly friendly staff, even called me by name and knew my room number each time I approached the desk.  I'll stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nice Older Hotel,"After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to book a night in ""Denver's oldest hotel."" Although we were located in a room facing the inner courtyard (nothing special about it - you look into other guests' windows. I simply closed the beautiful curtains!!), the room was spacious and nicely appointed.  The bed was comfortable and we slept soundly.  The only negative was the bathroom sink - I have never seen a smaller sink! The rest of the bathroom was nice and it was clean.  You are given a key with a huge tassel when you check in; you can leave the key at the front desk when you leave and then present your ID to get it back.You have to valet your car and it is pricey, in my opinion, but you have no choice.  The nice thing is if you are visiting the area, the hotel offers a car to drive you (they have a max distance, but I forgot what it was). Other points of interest are all walkable.   Currently there is no restaurant associated with the Oxford.  There is a small coffee shop.  For a full meal, you must walk to Union Station which is about a block away - not too far.  The Oxford gives you a card with discounts for going to some of the restaurants in Union Station.  Be warned: if you want a full service breakfast at  Snooze - GET THERE EARLY.  We arrived at approximately 8:15am and there was a 1 1/2 hour wait for a table!! We left.  We grabbed a coffee at Pigtrain (free because of our Oxford card) and at ACME bagels with eggs (with a 25% discount with our Oxford card).  Worked out great!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Location and falls short after that.,"We were so excited to have a chance to stay at this historic hotel in Lodo Denver and our experience fell short. The location is the best part of our stay.  It is conveniently located near Union Station, which is marvelous, Coors Field and The Mall area. Our room was on the 5th floor, called The Superior Classic room. Small but that was okay. The bed is very nice. The bathroom is very small with only a shower and only room for one person at a time. If you're small it is an advantage. The hot water at the sink only trickled but the cold worked fine. The room is air conditioned, but the thermostat in the room didn't seem to make a difference. Always the same temperature. We stayed 4 nights with a Stay3 get one night free. Not really sure that is a bargain. Our room rate was $270 with this offer, when I checked their website during our stay, the room rate was $209. Of course you still have other fees and their destination amenity fee of $20 per night plus tax. Not as much of a savings and you would  have thought it should be. They do offer discounts at some of the restaurants in Union Station which is perfect and other amenities, read them closely. No refrigerator in our room and you actually have a key which comes with a tassel. We turned the key into the desk every time we left. Way too bulky to carry so you had to go to the desk and ask for your key. We often had to wait since the desk was busy. On our 3rd day, my husband sat on the bed and the headboard fell off the wall. They tried to fix and did offer to us move, but it was just too much of a hassle to pack-up and move. On our last day, they didn't give us a bath mat for the bathroom. The staff is nice and I would suggest they could offer more information to their customers about their amenities. We asked the conciegne about tours in Denver, he told us to google it. We expected a lot more from hotel at this price range. Again, the location is the best part.",2
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Very Nice Hotel in the Heart of Lodo,"Stayed here one night while passing through Denver. Had not been there for a number of years. It is still a very nice property. Unfortunately, The Cruze Room was closed for sprucing up. If you stay when it is open, be sure to check it out. The art deco decor is tops. As with any renovated property, there are some idiosyncrasies. Probably the smallest sink in the bathroom I have ever seen. Valet parking is expensive, but necessary. All of the Lodo attractions are within walking distance, as is the light rail.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nice getaway,Stayed at the oxford hotel which was nice....room is small but hey indidnt go to vaca in a room....staff was great! Public transportation is cheaper and more reliable than in my...where I'm from..stoke out to the Rockies...mount Evans..garden of the gods...visited a gold mine...landscape out there is absolutely breath taking.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Classic, old, interesting","This is a very old, and historic hotel.  The decor is interesting, in the rooms and in the lobby.  The bed was very comfortable.  The shower pressure was good.  Towels were nice.  Somehow I was expecting more, considering the price.  The carpet in the elevator was dirty, and there was something about the rooms that felt a little run down, instead of old school class and charm.  I did like this hotel, just not sure I'd choose it again for my next trip.  I will say that the location is wonderful, and I had NO problems with noise.  Didn't hear a peep and slept really well.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,History oozes from the walls,"This hotel was part of our ghost tour so we got a lot of history about this hotel including a large painting in the lobby.  The decor is art deco with lots of original pieces, including the unique way keys are kept.  Just like in the old movies, keys are kept at the front desk with tassels to note the ""do not disturb"" status.  There is a small bar just off the lobby with more interesting things to see on the walls.  Fresh flowers were everywhere and smelled wonderful!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excrement included in Oxford Hotel bathroom!,"The Oxford Hotel Denver is basically a good, semi-high end hotel in a good location in LoDo.  My room was spacious and clean.  Other reviews will laud its attributes, a majority of which I am sure I would agree with.  But I ran into some issues, a few minor and one big one, at my stay of 2 nights on 4th of July weekend 2017 (Sunday through Tuesday stay).The first problem was connecting to wifi.  Supposedly it is free at the slow 1.5 Mbps speed, or $10 for 24 hrs at the somewhat better 5 Mbps rate.  Luckily, I suppose, neither of those standard methods worked at all, so I called down and they gave me the special code for free 30 Mbps access.  Why they need to play selfish games around internet connection for guests is beyond me.  With all the streaming of video etc. all hotels, especially nicer ones, should provide robust internet no questions asked.Also around tech, the flat-panel TV has no HD channels (see photo).  I don’t travel to watch TV in the hotel room, but in 2017 it’s become standard — in much less expensive chain hotels.  Again, this is simply the Oxford Hotel being cheap.Then I ran into the biggest issue: POOP on the toilet!  The toilet seat had brown smears on it, which I can only guess was fecal material that had not been cleaned (see photo).  I was absolutely aghast when I saw this, so I called the desk and explained the situation and its urgency, and was assured someone would be right up.After about 5 minutes, I called down again, as no one had shown up yet.  I expressed my increasing dissatisfaction with the situation.Another couple minutes went by, and I called again, as there was still no one at my room.  Finally, a man who identified himself as “the manager” came in, immediately recognized that there was in fact POOP on the toilet seat, grabbed some cleaning supplies from the hotel cleaning cart, and himself went to work to clean the toilet.After that was done, I examined the cleaning job, and though I was hesitant, I didn’t want to bother changing rooms (which was offered), so I stayed in my room.After cleaning the toilet, the “manager” offered a free breakfast and a waiver of some sort of tax, which I did not quite understand.  With such a horrible situation regarding POOP on the toilet, I would have assumed a free night.Upon checkout, a second person identifying himself as “the hotel manager” was not aware of the bathroom situation, and no discounts were offered or applied; nor did I ask for any.I’ll mention a couple other nagging issues:It was HOT and humid when I was in Denver, and wanted a little ice water after walking back from the other side of downtown late at night.  That was all.  But ice only through room service.  If it’s late, no ice.  Yet another man identifying himself as “the manager” promised to get some ice sent up to me, but it never appeared.  This was at approximately 11:00 PM, hardly that late.  I know hotels pretending to be high-end don’t like to offer vending or ice to guests, but they need to make sure room service covers that in that case.Besides the aforementioned toilet seat fecal material, the bathroom had a couple small problems.  The shower sprays all over bathroom floor if you want to get hot water running before stepping in.  And the toiletries are nice, but if you want shampoo in the bath tub, good luck.  Also, there’s no soap dish for the bathtub.  I don’t think they understand how bathtubs work.  One last issue that did not result in any problems for me, but which poses a serious concern.  The room key is a physical key attached to a large tassel.  The hotel recommends checking your key when you leave and retrieving it upon your return.  This is how that went: 1st night, I just said, “Key for Room 212, please”  — and was promptly handed the key by someone whom I had never seen before.  I must have looked trustworthy, for that was lax security.The next morning, I said “Key for Room 212, please” and was then asked for my last name.  My name was enough to obtain the key, which I felt was good enough security-wise.The 2nd night, I said “Key for Room 212, please” and was asked to show ID. At that point, I informed the staff woman asking for my ID about the variety of methods used to establish guest identity and obtain the room the key, and was informed that I was to show my ID every time — which clearly wasn’t being done.  And having to pull out my ID every time I walk back into the lobby is not the correct approach either — if you had to do that every time that would be very unprofessional.  It levies inconvenience on patrons, the opposite of what good hotels should be doing.  The key situation is not good — there is a reason that almost all hotels in the US use electronic keys.  The Oxford argues that it’s for historical reasons; I say poppycock.  There is an elegant way to implement electronic keys which would not disturb the authenticity of room doors.When I was in Paris, I had a similar key-with-tassel situation.  There, the staff simply recognized me — and that is the way it is supposed to work.This security issue speaks to the overall lack of management in the hotel, which also explains the other smaller issues.  If the Oxford Hotel could get its act together, it would be a consistently good place to stay in LoDo.",2
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Quaint and lovely,"Arriving to the Oxford was such a pleasure as Danny welcomed us like we were a part of his family!  He went above and beyond. The accommodations were very comfortable and Sherman the lobby bird was a big hit with our little boy.  Didn't love the extra daily fee they tack on but overall the Oxford is a wonderful, quaint hotel that has tons of charm. Awesome location in downtown Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic Hotel - A perfect experience,"Downtown Denver, 2 block walk from the train station. Hotel has  kept the authenticity of olden times. Complimentary one drink each at Bourbon Bar and Cordial Bar. Complimentary  WiFi, and fitness center. From housekeeping to front desk, service was flawless.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Hair at the spa,Fantastic visit to the Oxford Hotel in Denver.  Visit the hair salon if you are in town and ask for Emily.  She did a fantastic color on my hair and pampered me in an upbeat newly renovated space.  The people who handled valet parking were very pleasant and friendly.  Overall a great day.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Must,"I came to Denver to visit my best friend and to attend Denver Comic Con. I was recommended to stay at the Oxford. I absolutely love the history of this hotel. I had a drink at the Cruise Room with my friends and I felt like I was sitting in the 1920's. Everyone was so friendly and the Front Desk Supervisor, Nate, was extremely helpful.I would highly recommend staying at the Oxford and will definitely be returning when I find myself back in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great location and charm, but ultimately disappointing for the price.","The Oxford bills itself as Denver's oldest hotel, and for that you get historic charm with some of the negatives that come with an older facility. The hotel is just steps from Union Station, which now has a very convenient rail connection to Denver International Airport. Desk staff were friendly, but I got off on the wrong foot when I asked upon checking in if I could pay upfront, as I would be checking out on June 30, the end of my company's fiscal year, and I was hoping to get my charges in for the current budget cycle. (It takes a couple days to process.) The woman who checked me in said, no; it was against their policy. I had never heard of such a thing; in fact many other hotels of that caliber give a discount for payment in advance. The next night I found a gentleman who helped me get around the ""policy,"" but only because I had reserved under a ""fourth night free"" summer sale, which meant that I could pay on the evening before my free night. How crazy is that?My room had a very comfortable king bed, which the room could barely accommodate. I needed to do some work in my room, and the heavy desk chair needed to be dragged out of the way in order to walk around the bed. The nicked up furniture looked like it was from the 40s or 50s, not the period of the hotel. The bathroom was small but adequate with abundant hot water in the tub/shower; I just wish there had been a hand shower as well.Most disappointing was the single narrow window that faced a brick wall and the lack of sound-proofing in this old building.  I was awakened by both the squeaky floor in the room above me, and the loud conversations by other guests in the hallway as late as 1 and 2 a.m. And all that for $340 a night plus $67.36 in taxes and fees. Most annoying is a $20 per night ""Destination Amenity Fee"" that covers such things as 2 bottles of water, courtesy transportation within 2 miles, a drink at the Bourbon Bar, etc. -- all things that neither I nor my colleagues staying there had any occasion to use. One colleague who had stayed at the Oxford in the past didn't recall this ""shake-down"" during previous visits. Other colleagues chose to stay at other hotels in the area that were as convenient and comfortable for a lot less.When I got home and saw my e-mailed receipt, I also noticed that I was charged a $45 ""Parking-Guest Overnight"" fee, even though I arrived by train and did not use a car the whole time.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fun denver weekend,I loved this old school hotel. Location is perfect. Super close to union station & the Rockies' stadium. I also used the onsite spa. You feel like you're stepping back in time but you still have modern conveniences. Hotel's Escalade brought me to the art museum and staff were always helpful. Highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lovely historic hotel with great service ,"I'm a history nerd so I stay in a lot of historic hotels and this may be one of the nicest I've stayed in. It's been beautifully restored so it still has its old charm but doesn't look worn down or beaten up like some other historic hotels do. Everyone who worked there is super nice and helpful. The location is within Denver is excellent, lots of stuff within walking distance. The rooms are well sized, comfortable, and nicely decorated. Comfy bed. Definitely would recommend this place and will probably stay here again when I'm in Denver next.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Cool hotel, short walk to Union Station","This is a super cool old hotel in downtown Denver.  If I remember correctly, it's actually the oldest hotel in Denver, from the late 1800s.  We stayed there on our last night in Colorado in March 2017 before flying out the next day.  It is extremely convenient to Union Station and the very good restaurants and bars there (literally a five-minute walk away or less).  Union Station is also where you can catch the shuttle train to the Denver airport, so walking with your luggage over to Union Station from the hotel is very easy.  (A tip for drinkers:  Go to Union Station, get yourself a beer or cocktail from the bar -- which used to be the old train ticket window back in the day -- then settle into one of the comfortable chairs and do some people watching.  Super relaxing!)We booked the Deluxe Classic room, which was quite large for two people. The bathroom also had tons of room.  I find most hotel beds to be far too firm for my back, but this bed was very comfortable.  The room also had a large desk, a separate clothes cabinet and flat-screen TV.  The windows looked out over the street, but for whatever reason, we heard very little street noise.  We always suspect that old hotels were built far better than new ones, so maybe the walls in the Oxford are thicker than in newer chain hotels.  Or maybe there just weren't many people out partying that night.  The hotel staff was very attentive.  The men at the front door greeted us immediately upon pulling up next to the sidewalk to drop off our luggage.  And when I realized late at night that I had lost my toothbrush, the desk staff was happy to give me a travel toothbrush for no extra charge.The next time we visit Denver, we will definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,OK but additional night time charges,"Its a week since we left and I still havent had my bill, so I cant tell you how much those charges were. I think it was 15$ plus tax per night.That said there is an hour long Bourbon bar, where you get one free bourbon from a selectionThere is also a cordial bar, but we never made it.I just dont know why they can be honest and add the nightly charge onto the booking charge so that you know the full cost of your stay.The hotel is well placed, just across the road from the Union Station and near a lot of good bars and restaurants I wasnt that impressed with the staff, but maybe thats just me.Our room was nice, in a quadrangle overlooking other rooms. Note it is not the sort of room you see on he website, but it was good enough.No fridge, but there was a safe, coffee machine and a second chair!Loads of storage space, huge bathroom and very clean,for the most partTo be fair, we arrived about 9.30 in the morning, and expected to have to ask them to store our luggage, but they were happy to give us a room.One quirky little thing. The carpet in the lift had the day of the week woven in it and it was changed daily.The Cruise Bar attached to the hotel is apparently iconic. Not sure why other than it has very classical songs on the juke box.Also odd that there is no facitly to charge drinks in said bar to your roomThe lobby has tea and coffee and newspapers available each morning.One thing that saddened me was that the  doors leading off the lobby were glass, and not very well cleaned. Also the 'public' loos downstairs were a bit unhappy. One door had no lock at all and the second one I tried had a lock that didnt fastenAll in all a bit of a mix.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Disappointing arrival but good visit overall,"After calling a few months ahead to make sure we had booked an ADA room for my disabled friend, we were given a room that wasn't accessible. I called to complain.  I was told that the one ADA approved room had been rented.  I was livid asked that get get compensated for that night by not paying the hotel rate. No can do was the response.  They did provide a walker and a bellman helped us move to the accessible room which was much farther from the elevator.  We had to rely on room service which was not good.   Positive things:   Everyone was super pleasant.  Nearly all of the doormen were excellent.   The hotel provided a driver to take us all over town and pick us up.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent service and perfect location,"I stayed at this same hotel about 15 years ago and found it to be an even better experience this time around.  They work hard to keep true to the historic feel of the building.  Great location for us.  Walked to Coors Field, up to the capital via 16th street, and proximity to great food.  Everyone was helpful.  The room and bed were large and comfortable.  Only 2 issues with the room.  I am 5' 2"" tall and it was a chore to get into the bath/shower.  The sides were so high, it was kind of ridiculous.  Also, they'd updated the room with nice blinds, but they weren't long enough for the window, so it you wanted to block the light, you had to stuff pillows in the bottom of the window.  I'm pretty easy going, so not a deal killer, but I'm sure this could be for someone else.  Pretty quiet with typical city noise in the morning. All in all, glad we stayed there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,evening getaway,"My first time staying at the Oxford and it was lovely. The location is perfectly situated in downtown Denver. Bars, restaurants, eateries all within walking distance. I recommend the Cruise room which is adjacent to the hotel lobby. Our room was quite spacious will comfortable beds and linen. The hotel is historically decorated with various antiques. The hotel is clean and quiet with accommodating staff. My only complaint is upon check out we were charged $18.00 for amenities. When we checked in, the front desk clerk neglected to mention the amenities that we would be paying for.  We missed out. Other than that, I quite enjoyed The Oxford and would recommend the hotel to visitors or if you just want a night on the town.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Well-appointed, classy, historic hotel with a welcoming, friendly staff!!","Last week, my husband and I enjoyed 3 nights at the wonderful Oxford Hotel. Prior to our getaway from Ohio to Denver, we did a lot of research about hotels in the lower downtown (LoDo) area and settled on The Oxford due to its location, historic nature and reputation for comfort and quality. We were not disappointed in our choice! We had a fantastic time!! The entire Oxford staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and at home. Each day, they greeted us with smiles both at the front desk and at the front door. We enjoyed the complimentary bourbon tastings in the late afternoon and with the Denver altitude, we appreciated the water bottles offered daily at the front desk. Jalyn took especially good care of us. She was friendly, helpful and thanks to her, we now know more about bourbon! Speaking of libation, I discovered my new favorite drink, the Brandy Alexander, in their cool martini bar called the Cruise Room. (Great way to end a busy day of sightseeing!) The Oxford is updating their rooms and ours was lovely! The bed, linens and pillows were so comfy and the bathroom was squeaky clean and classic. We also took advantage of their workout facilities and I even enjoyed an excellent (complimentary) yoga class on Sunday morning! We loved being just steps away from the Union Station where we enjoyed ice cream, coffee and the comfortable lounge area there! We also had to-die-for breakfasts at Snooze in Union Station! Do not leave without trying their OMG French Toast!! It is heavenly and I am determined to recreate it at home! The doormen at the Oxford also deserve a shout-out! Deandre efficiently delivered us to the door of our chosen restaurant on trendy Larimer St. in the Oxford's Cadillac Escalade. (We felt like celebrities!!) And Stewart and Dave, in addition to always providing a warm welcome at the door, were also full of knowledge and helpful tips about seeing the city!! The hotel lobby is inviting, historic and begs you to sit down, read the paper and relax for a bit. We are already planning a return trip to Denver and the Oxford Hotel and this time we will bring our daughters and their husbands along!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Didn't work out for us,The Oxford was a short walk from Union Station as advertised.  Walking distance to Coors field.  I can't really rate the hotel as we just booked at the wrong time so my three stars rating equals I am not sure.  The hotel was having some construction done on the 4th floor and the rooms around us on the fifth floor.  We didn't get to experience much but construction noise and paint fumes. There were some other issues that I think were construction related.  Management people did apologize although I really wish they had warned us at time of booking or afterwards that they had this big project going on.  It will probably look great when they finish.  I see people really love it and it looks really funky and fun so I imagine on any other week it is probably all that.  Denver is a wonderful place to visit.,3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best hotel experience of my life!,"You can tell when you walk into this hotel that it is something special. The lobby is stunning and the beautiful decor continues throughout the hotel. We were in town to celebrate our 12 year anniversary, and The Oxford went out of their way to make us feel special. When we checked into the room we found a chilled bottle of sparkling wine & a gift with a personalized note! I've never experienced service like that and we travel a lot! The staff at the desk was super friendly and always remembered us even though we were only there for 2 days. Special shout out to Cathy who was always so friendly and helpful! We also loved getting cocktails in the historic Cruise Room. It really feels like you've gone back in time! We really can't wait to come back!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Elegant, perfect location!","Loved every minute of our stay. Walked through Union Station and nearby river walk, ate in a Sports Pub and watched the Broncos with fans, shopped at REI and sampled local whiskey at the hotel! Can't wait to go back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel with great location,"My wife and I recently stayed here and we loved it. Not one of the huge cookie cutter hotels (only 5 stories) and it does have some minor issues but those were outweighed by the positives.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nice and Old,"The oldest hotel in Denver, but very clean, comfortable and quite.  A little quirky ( like no alarm clocks and old furniture but no dresser in the room).

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Tons of history and charm!,Planned a trip to Denver for a few baseball games and absolutely loved staying in this hotel. There was a ton of history which my wife and I are definitely a fan of including plenty of folklore involving ghosts and hauntings. Very interesting! There was also a complimentary whiskey tasting in the common area which never sounds like a bad idea. The location was very convenient and all of the service was incredible. Definitely looking forward to staying at this hotel again!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Unique ,"I got in to the Oxford really late due to some delayed flights. Even at 2 am, the staff was friendly and explained everything I needed to know about the hotel. They give you beautiful old keys to use to reinforce the ""oldest hotel in Denver"" thing. The room was small and simple, but the bed was the most comfortable I've slept in while traveling. I enjoyed the complimentary Bourbon Hour with the knowledgeable bartender. I also visited the bar that had a fantastic speakeasy vibe and had a good cocktail while enjoying the music. The staff will happily keep your key while you go out, so you don't lose it. Oh, and go say hi to the canary in the lobby!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Running water not included!,"My children and I planned a getaway to Denver in late March. The Oxford Hotel was close to the train station, making it easy to arrive from the airport. The room with two double beds was great and we enjoyed our stay UNTIL we got a notice the last night at 10pm (under our door and after we had gone to sleep) that there would be no running water in the morning. NO use of the shower or the toilet. The notice said we could use the restroom in the basement. I'm not kidding. When I questioned the hotel staff, they said that we should have been told earlier because they had known even when we checked in days earlier. REALLY?!! It wasn't an emergency or water leak. Apparently running water isn't a policy of this hotel. My request for a one night refund was denied.  Don't put yourself through it. Stay somewhere else.",2
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A relaxing and a pecial hotel experience,"This is the place you want to stay for grand, special events or anniversaries. Everything is very unique from the decor to the furniture which is beautiful. It is definitely pricey and you have to be willing to spend a pretty penny. The spa is amazing and well worth the expense for a massage but maybe not worth for a manicure or pedicure that you can get for cheaper with the same quality.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful stay at the Oxford in Denver's LoDo district,"Had a great trip to Denver,CO and especially good because of my stay in the Oxford Hotel, the oldest Hotel in Denver. Such a great location, just a short train ride from the airport and such a beautiful train station just across the street from the hotel. Great proximity to the restaurant and bar district not to mention walking distance from Coors Field. The old hotel has so much ambiance and such a great vibe. The people are so friendly and we enjoyed so much the time we spent in the Cruise Bar in the hotel lobby which I called the ""Red Room"", you will understand why when you visit.",5

Canary in lobby is a throwback to mining days. Very comfortable bed. Shower does not have great water pressure. Rooms semi dated with not a lot of storage .

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Grand Hotel in a Great Location,"The historic Oxford Hotel is always our first choice when we visit Denver.  That is because it is a stone's throw from Union Station and the 16th Street pedestrian mall.  The neighborhood feels safe and pleasant to walk around in, even at night.  But the hotel has a courtesy car available for people who have appointments within a 2 mile radius of the hotel.  We usually rely on Uber -- which is inexpensive and convenient.  The staff is friendly and helpful. Our room was 223, a room very much in need of brightening.  Nonetheless, the room was spacious and quiet and we liked it for our 2 night stay.  It had almost no storage so we lived out of our suitcases.  For a longer stay, that would be inconvenient.  Also, that room has no bath tub -- a big disappointment for me because I love to take baths. Still -- we will be back!",4

We also used the shuttle service to travel to nearby restaurants and found the drivers and doormen to be on a par with Chris.  The same fine courtesy was extended to us by the check-in staff.  The location couldn't be better, with convenient light rail access from the airport to Union Station.  Marv H.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Near Amtrak, Union Station now housing fine pub and breakfast, and Denver Museum of Contemporary Art","Whenever we arrive in Denver by Amtrak (the California Zephyr now endangered by DT's infrastructure-slashing budget--no NEA the infrastructure of art), we find the Oxford amenities necessary in winter--the 16' Christmas tree, wood fire and complimentary sherry or boubon.

I do miss McCormick's pub, which will be replaced by a new national Steak House; this will include a butchr shop in part of the Oxford--not necessarily a big improvement.

The bathroom was very large, the towels plush and the rose scented toiletries were lovely. Each room has a Keurig and plenty of outlets.

It is located within walking distance of many attractions and we spent most of our time around the 16th St Mall and Union Station.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Want a sweet hotel built around 1902? Look no further.,"Hotel is amazing to look at, all the fineries from the early 1900's but updated. The furniture is in excellent condition and from the time period. Fantastic wrought iron work, classic doors, subway tiling in the bathroom. Quiet and rest full, the bar looks to be from the 1930's.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nice place to stay downtown,As a surprise birthday getaway I made reservations for my husband and me at the Oxford Hotel. We took light rail downtown from our home in Aurora and the Oxford is just steps away from Union Station. Convenience was the primary goal and it couldn't have been better.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Old fashioned downtown hotel,"Great location.  Super friendly staff.  Oldest hotel in Denver, but rennovated.   Very near Union Station in downtown Denver.  Running trail along Cherry Creek is nearby.  Great shopping and restaurants within walking distance.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Quaint ,Lovely old hotel near Union Station and LoDo. Historical atmosphere but nicely remodeled. Great access to shopping and dining. I believe that it's the oldest operating hotel in Denver. Close to Coors Field and the Pepsi Center.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Classic Old style hotel with CLASS (thanks to excellent staff,"Some folks like the full-on ultra modern hotel experience...I on the other hand like hotels that are historical and have character...The oxford hotel in Denver fits this description...It has quite a history going back to the 1970's when Willie Nelson and other burgeoning stars of the 60's era worked and performed here...built in 1891 This old girl has aged well, and even the roos have classic traditional old style furniture...(Being a western dude with Boots and Cowoy hat, I enjoyed having my hats on 20 of the four poster high bed, that was so charmingly high, it had a small two step stool to get up to it? (GRIN)  But what really makes this experience GREAT is the efforts of the individual staff...From Lupe, a long time employee who keeps everything sparkling clean around here, while cheerfully greeting guests everyday...Also the desk staff and the front bell staff have been great...including Otaca, (one of several who took me where I wanted to go within a couple of miles around here, whether I wanted to go to a museum or dinner, they always were available to drive me and pick me up when I was done...an old style touch you cannot get from most hotels...They were all great, but I do remember Danny, Otaca, Dave and Stuart as all being very friendly and attentive every day...I have had a better experience here than in the last two Hiltons I stated at...Also, their location is GREAT, about a half block from the old Union Train Station which has been turned into a multitude of food and shop businesses, and cofortabled desk and lounging areas for guests...So if you like your hotels a little older and run-in, with a staff that makes you feel right at home everyday...I would strongly encourage you to select the Oxford when in Denver...You and your family will have a wonderful experience, mainly due to the attentive and cheerful staff here.  I rest my case for a stay at the classic old Oxford...(As comfortable as the old shoes by that name? (LOL)",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming Historic Hotel,This is a historic property with lots of personality. My room was comfortable and surprisingly quiet. I was on the backside of the hotel. There wasn't much of a view but I had little outside noise. The mattress and bedding were very comfortable. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. I was traveling alone for business and felt very safe. VERY convenient location less than one block from Union Station and the light rail to the airport. It's just one block to the 16th Street Pedestrian Mall with it's free shuttle. Lots to do in this area with easy access due to the hotel's location.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel with Very Nice Staff,The hotel is in a great location and walking distance of many restaurants and stores.   The staff was exceptionally nice and even provided me with a driver who brought me to business meetings nearby - great conversations on the way there and back with the driver.  In the evening the hotel offers whiskey for sipping and socializing with other guests - fun time. It is also a short distance to Union Station where we caught a Front Range bus up to the ski slopes for the day -can't ask for better than that.  Got a kick out of the elevator rugs changing daily with the name of the weekday.  Can't remember all the staff names but Dave and Tom were like friends to us during our stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fun in Denver,"Romance package was so great that we booked a second night.  The price was the best of any we tried to book.  2 drinks at the bar with an appetizer, free valet parking and use of limousine!  Oldest hotel in Denver.. right near Union Station..",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Good hotel in the city centre,"I stayed here with my partner for two nights, during my first trip to Denver. The hotel is very close to Union station, and within walking distance of 16th Street mall, the Capitol building, and other downtown sights.The hotel itself is very pleasant, both inside and out, with friendly staff who were quick to offer assistance throughout our stay. The parking situation isn't ideal - we couldn't find easy overnight parking close to the hotel, and the valet service is expensive. You're paying luxury hotel rates, so rooms are also expensive. We stayed in a double room on the second floor, and it was lovely - very spacious, with charming furniture, a nice hot shower, a very comfortable bed, and other amenities such as a coffee maker and dressing gowns. The room was quiet, with no noise from the road despite being directly over it, though I still struggled to sleep due to the dry air and temperature in the room (changing the settings didn't seem to make much difference).Overall, I thought the hotel was beautiful, and we enjoyed our time there. It's great for exploring the surrounding area, and would be ideal for a weekend city break.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great place to stay by Union Square!,Loved this place! We had an early flight the next day but got there early (noon) and they were able to check us right in. It was so perfect as we were able to enjoy the afternoon and evening in Denver and pick up the lite rail to the airport the next morning.

If you want a nice, quaint downtown Denver hotel, The Oxford most certainly fits the bill and we can't wait to go back again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Charming, renovated historic Denver hotel","I was fortunate to get a good weekend rate since I prefer hotels with character. Its proximity to Union Station couldn't be beat! Plus you're within walking distance to so many other downtown venues.They offer complimentary shoe shines, nightly bourbon tastings, rides on downtown shuttle, to name a few. The lobby is the perfect spot to meet up with friends or get to know other hotel customers since it has a lovely wood burning fireplace.Only thing lacking for me was a shower cap and makeup mirror.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oldest Hotel In Denver ,Usually an old hotel is drafty and have that old basement smell.The Oxford was a Romantic and comfortable.  My only regret was not booking more timeFun part of town Oh oh oh. I almost forgot Love the detailed architecture,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fun on the other end of the Hospitality Industry,I work for the company that runs the hotel we had an amazing and fun stay for our holiday party and it was nice to enjoy as the guest.

Its fun with it being haunted to it was my first time staying over night and was fun! One thing I will tell you if you are a single male don't stay in room 320 by yourself based off of some videos I saw first hand but don't let that stop you from staying there because its truly an amazing hotel!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Relaxing, enjoyable","This hotel was a last minute booking after we changed our flight due to inclement weather pending. Read the reviews, knew the hotel was an antique so expected charm with a draft and limited amenities.  Pleasantly, we were surprised to find a quaint room with nice deep bathtub, comfortable bed with breathable high quality linens and relaxing, quiet ambiance. The room service is a work in progress but we were not staying one night and there are restaurants everywhere around it.Great location, half a block from Union Station and beautiful comfy lobby.I got a good rate through Expedia and would stay here again for a discounted rate again but would not pay more than $200/night.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Hotel with character,The Oxford hotel is in an excellent location in LoDo Denver. Most rooms are different some a little more spacious than others but they all have character as the hotel is in a old building and uses furniture and deccor that take you back to the late XIX century. The Cruise Room bar is lively and serves excellent cocktails. Breakfast is also nice but a little on the slow side. Service is warm and friendly.,5

This hotel is within walking distance of many of Denver's finest attractions, plus the complimentary 16th Street bus is a block away. Very convenient location. The train from the airport to Union Station a half block away makes renting a car obsolete.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Stayed here with family celebrating Christmas for three nights.,"Staff were very responsive, main lobby and common areas beautifully decorated for Christmas and very festive.  Rooms were small but very comfortable and quiet. (Finally, figured out how to manage the heat @ night, open the window a crack.)  Valet parking was steep but the hotel is in an ideal downtown location.....walking distance to dinner every night and to breakfast @ Union Station in the morning.  Nice old fashioned vibe for the Oxford Hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Loved This Historic Hotel,"Right in the heart of Denver.  We walked everywhere and could not imagine a better location.  Our room was upgraded to a corner suite with envious views.  The biggest claw foot tub I have ever seen waited in the sparkling clean bathroom.  Hotel staff was courteous and after advising us on area restaurants, they even made our reservations.  Beautiful, original artwork by some of the nation's finest artists can be found around the hotel.  This is history well preserved and cherished.  We will definitely return to the Oxford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Hotel,"The hotel has a historic charm and feel sending you back to the 1800's and early 1900's with lots of woodwork and and inviting front lounging area. The front end staff was pleasant. The restaurant and lounges attached to the hotel were great with good food and excellent service. The Oxford is situated in the LoDo area of Denver, half a block from vibrant Union Station and close to many, many restaurants, bars and shopping which was one of the main reasons we chose to stay here.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Victorian gem in the heart of LODO,"My husband and I stayed at the Oxford for three nights of R & R in mid-December 2016. Vibe and service: The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holiday, and looked romantic and festive. We really enjoyed the bourbon tasting in the lobby, and happy hour in the bar. Service was responsive, even when we had to check out at 4am to begin our journey home. Room: Our room faced the street but we never noticed any street noise. It had lots of light, lovely Victorian furnishings and window coverings, and plenty of space for luggage and moving around. Bed comfortable, bathroom roomy.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,THE ONLY PLACE to stay!,"If you are in Denver, this place is a must to either stay in or at least have a drink in their Art Deco bar. I stayed here one night with my wife and we loved it.  Wish we could have stayed longer! Everything from the black and white classic bathrooms to the original keys still being used, this place is a must for people who love anything retro or vintage.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Romantic ,"Stayed here with my husband for our anniversary. We loved the charm and history of the hotel. Great staff and nice comfortable rooms. Walked everywhere in the city. Would definitely stay here again. The small bar downstairs was nice and quaint, good drinks and service. Had to park in the street the night we rented a car.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Not your ordinary Hotel,"This is a fantastic restoration of a fine old property.  I stayed there over fifty years ago when it was was ""a respectable hotel adjacent to Skid Row"" but now it is in the much renewed Denver lower down town and the work that has been done ie excellent.  The room was spacious with all the necessary upgrades, TV, good shower, great bed etc.  The major feature however was the hotel staff, beginning with the charming doormen and through to the house staff. People couldn't have been nicer.The courtesy Bourbon bar was a nice touch.  As a Canadian Bourbon isn't my go to beverage so it was nice to have someone knowledgeable guide my choice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Expectations exceeded every-time.,"My wife and I have stayed multiple times (2-3 times a year) for everything from a short weekend away, birthdays to our anniversary.  Every time seems to be more enjoyable than the last. The claw foot tubs are well worth the expense.  The staff is probably the best hotel staff I've ever encountered from the Valets to the Front Desk to House Keeping. Always spot on and professional.  Coming from someone who travels for a living I continue to spend my downtown Denver time at the Oxford. conveniently located downtown, Union Station, Coors Field, Pepsi Center, restaurants, shopping, everything is within walking distance. As always we will be back again, and again, and, you get the point.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Thumbs up!,The location is perfect - near lots of shopping and restaurants. The hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. The employees were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming and convenient,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights. The hotel is said to be the oldest in Denver and it certainly has olde worlde charm. We visited in December and there was a roaring open fire in the lobby, plus lovely Christmas decorations. Our room was very clean and comfortable and very spacious. It was a little cold, probably because there were Windows on two sides that were a little draughty. Had we been staying longer we would probably have asked for an extra heater. Apparently it was much colder than usual when we were visiting. The hotel is situated across the street from the train station, which was very convenient for us as we were catching the California Zephyr train to San Francisco. The hotel staff took our luggage across the road to the Amtrak baggage check in which was very helpful. The hotel is also close to the city centre and it provides a courtesy car for any journeys up to 2 miles from the hotel. We had dinner at the restaurant and were very impressed with the food. All the hotel and restaurant staff were courteous and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Denver or the surrounding area.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed here for 4 nights for work.  Let me first say that I prefer B&B's and this hotel is reminiscent of my favorite B&B in Pennsylvania.  Quaint room, older furniture, lots of antique pieces.  So if you're looking for modern or eclectic this is not the hotel for you.  I found the hotel to be quiet and charming.  The staff handled all requests that I had with a smile and they were eager to please.  I requested 3 extra lotions (because it is Denver afterall) and they delivered three extra lotions.  When I asked about recommendations they were happy to give me recommendations and coupled that with a bit of information about the area and hotel itself.  A stone's throw from Union Station and in the heart of everything.  When I return to Denver for work I will be staying here.  And if I return to the area for ""fun"", I will stay here.  Great hotel, great staff.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Holiday Party,"We stayed here for a company Christmas party at a close restaurant.  Awesome old hotel.   Hotel staff was excellent upon checking us in and telling us about the amenities.It is an older hotel so be prepared the rooms are a bit chillier in the winter!   Right by Union Station, enjoyed being downtown.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Bad hotel practices.,"Beautiful hotel, employees very nice. Hotel practices bad. When checking in we were told since it was slow we would be upgraded to a room with a view, I guess if you like looking at another building. The room smelled horrible, curtains were falling off the wall. If this was an upgrade, I would not want to see our regular room. Second room better, maid service questionable. Brought to mind all the horror stories you hear about. TV system poor, it was Sunday and wanted to check up on the scores of the games missed traveling. Remote wouldn’t work and channel selection lacking. Bed comfortable but of the ten or so pillows on the bed, none were much bigger than a small couch pillow.THE BIG SURPRISE. Checking e-mail and bank statements when we got home the hotel charge my account $100. Of course I called, Valet parking, high for the area, $36, then a charge for what they called a destination charge. Their town car( 2 mile radius), Wi-Fi, and several other services  we didn’t use. When asked I was told it was include in the price, when I called I was told it is not included if you use a hotel.com type of reservation system. If it was not for most of the employees we encountered I would have given the hotel a 1 star at most.",2
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,20th Anniversary ,"My husband and I have had the most fantastic stay here at the Oxford. The staff has been amazing!! The service here is second to none. If you're in Denver, this is THE place to stay. It's beautiful, welcoming, and nostalgic. We love everything about the Oxford, especially the staff. Room service was great, the complimentary rides in the Escalade were very nice in this chilly weather, and the location is wonderful. Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best. Anniversary. Ever.,"We love this beautiful historic hotel!  Our room was immaculate, the bed was comfy, and the fluffy white robes were an extra special touch of luxury. The hotel staff upgraded our room and surprised us with delicious chocolates to celebrate our anniversary. They also gave us poker chips for 2 free drinks which we didn't use because the poker chips were so cool. We kept them as souvenirs of our wonderful stay. We went to the Buckhorn Exchange for dinner, and Dave drove us in the complimentary Escalade. He was very nice, and he gave us tips on where to go in the city. The hotel is within walking distance to Union Station and the shopping district. We will definitely return to the Oxford Hotel. It made our anniversary the best ever!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Concert just around the street,"Decided last minute to stay here while attending a concert down the street. We didn't have to worry about losing our room key because they hold them at the front desk. The valet was great and the room was super affordable and nice. Very nostalgic while still having everything you could ever need. Right in the middle of downtown so no need to take an Uber anywhere, we walked.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing Service & Excellent Location,"Stayed here for two nights in the Premier Corner room, and savored every moment of it.  From the moment we arrived, the level of service was evident.  From the concierge remembering our names and giving excellent recomendations, to the desk attendants giving us out tassled key without having to say out room number, the service was truly memorable.The room itself was fantastic.  It had an amazing view over the street corner, and the bathroom was spacious and historic.  The charm of the hotel was kept, and the memories of being there stay with you.Do not miss the Cruise Room bar and of course the free whiskey tasting in the lobby.The hotel is wonderfully located in LODO and is convienient to excellent restaurants, and a easy stroll to Coors field.  If i am in Denver again, i will stay there without question.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Elegance in Denver,"From the moment you walk through the front doors you are greated by elegant surroundings. Beautiful heavy draperies, lovely antiques and furnishings.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed in a premium corner room and it was nicely furnished. The sheets and towels were high quality. We love coming into Denver and trying the nicer hotels, we highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Superior Service!,"What a great surprise! Our stay was booked in the Presidential Suite for one night and we had wonderful service from everyone! The antique furnishings were sprinkled throughout the hotel. The hotel was having their 100th birthday, so we were treated to a glass of wine and cupcakes. The canary, Sherman, added a special touch when you you hear about his story!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent stay in Lodo,"Stayed at the Oxfod hotel for one night for a business trip. The service is excellent! Everyone from valet team to front desk. The hotel itself is beautiful and decorated for Christmas. There was a super cool bar in the hotel, but I was under the weather so didn't have any drinks.The location was perfect, in the heart of Lodo, and close to restaurants, shops, yoga studios, bars, etc. I could walk everywhere or quickly get an uber.I loved the classic look of the room and bathroom. Only things are the room wasn't the largest and didn't have the best lighting. I also thought it was weird that I had to pay for good internet, and the ""free"" internet was very slow. Overall, can't wait to come back and spend a weekend here.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Really interesting hotel with history,Loved this hotel from the giant key ring tassels to the modern mixed with antique décor. This place has serious history. It was a speak easy and still has hidden tunnels behind the bar panels. Service was excellent and Nate the manager was very kind and helpful. There is valet parking if you drive-just drive up to the front door and they will take care of you.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming but efficient,"""Old school"" hotels called ""charming"" are often also inefficient -- charm seems to cover for a multitude of glitches and errors.  That is not the case here: checkin and checkout was fast and efficient, room service was blindingly fast, internet was trouble-free, etc.  If you'd like close proximity to Union Station, good comfort, and old-school charm (doors with actual knobs, cedar-lined closets!) without giving up professionalism, this is your place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Another Great Stay,A trip to Denver always states off with a night at The Oxford. Great staff and a warm welcome greets everyone there every time. The location is ideal with Union Station across the street. Close to the Cherry Creek path for a run. And convenient to the art museums.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Absolutely Charming,"I want to go back to Denver just to stay in this hotel again.  Walking distance to Union Station. You can take a train from the airport for $9 and literally walk across the street to the hotel- very convenient.   This is the oldest hotel in Denver - tassel keys and all. Fantastic lobby with beautiful architecture and a ""cabin-y"" feel. The hotel offers bourbon tastings every night, night cap port wine when you come back for the night, free hotel car service within 2 miles (which is PERFECT - no Uber or Taxis) and the rooms have gorgeous antique furniture but still offer the modern necessities.   Shout out to Dave, who drove us all around town (without complaint) & recommended fantastic places to grab a drink.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Terrible Bed,"I've waited over a week to think about our experience to be sure I wasn't being unfair. First let me say that the hotel is beautiful and historic. The valet and bell staff were very nice and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. But I can't overlook the amenities in our room and wonder why we were given it. We are an older couple, not in great shape and my husband has an obvious limp. The antique bed in our third floor room was so high off the floor that I could not get in it without dragging a chair over to climb up on. Even my six foot plus husband used a chair to get up into bed. The tub/shower combo was equally high. I won't go into the gymnastics it took to get in and out. If I had booked at the last minute or the hotel was fully booked I would have been happy to get any room, but neither was the case. The front desk staff was not friendly to us at check in, in fact I asked my husband if he had offended them in some way. That's the only explanation I saw for being put in that room. We had two terrible nights sleep but overall a fun time in Denver. I would recommend The Oxford, but specify that you want a regular height bed. I looked in several rooms as they were being cleaned and none had the crazy high bed like ours.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Charming, boutique hotel--great central location!","Rooms are large with antique furniture.  Comfy and welcoming.  Small, lovely property.  Staff is very responsive and helpful.Close to tons of restaurants, a block from the 16th Street shopping area, and a block from Union Station.  I cannot recommend it enough--we loved our stay there!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great family time,Family enjoyed our stay. Pet friendly and wonderful location next to Union Station and Larimer Square.  Bourbon hour was great!  They had a wonderful valet staff and a courtesy car available if necessary. Thank you.,5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A luxurious step back into time,"My sister and I spent three nights in the Presidential Suite of this gorgeous hotel, after which I never wanted to leave!

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel with excellent staff,"My wife and I had an excellent experience staying at this hotel. We really enjoyed hearing the history behind the hotel. Our room was unique and clean. Staff was excellent, especially Nate with the bourbon tasting! We will definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lovely Historic Hotel,We stayed at The Oxford Hotel to and from our visit to Glenwood Hot Springs by way of Amtrak's California Zephyr.  We found this hotel to be totally authentic but with lovely and comforting updates. The staff was super friendly and I loved going to the library for coffee and newspaper in the morning. We will definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,An old lock and key Hotel,"We stayed at the Oxford for a weekend wedding. We really liked the proximity of the hotel, it was pretty much right across the street from the train to the airport which took about 40 minutes and is by far the cheapest and easiest way to travel. It also was in walking distance of all the bars and restaurants. It is only a couple of blocks from 16th street mall which has anything you could want to do. If you can not walk small distances there is a free shuttle that rides up and down the mall with frequent stops.One thing I did find nice when I booked the room, it was one price and then I was checking the website a couple of weeks before our trip and found the price had gone down. I called the hotel and asked for the lower price and they told me they actually had an even lower price. I really thought that was nice! But back to the Oxford, the lobby has a sophisticated feeling to it, while he check in desk has a Twilight zone feeling to it. The keys to the rooms are on large tassels, but they are meant to be left at the front desk when you leave. We chose to take it off an put the key in our pocket. The room was nice, but old as you would probably expect from the Oxford being the oldest hotel in Denver. It had high ceilings and really no frills to it. There was no view from our window and I am not sure if any of the rooms would provide a view judging by the hotels location.The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was a good size. Our room was next to the stairs, but it was not noisy. We never saw anyone on our floor, except for staff, so it was felt like we had it to ourselves. They give you free newspapers in the lobby. In the evening they have a small cart in the lobby for one free whiskey drink per guest. The free wifi was pretty spotty in the room, so I did not use it. They had a computer on the 2nd floor that you could print boarding passes from, or any other internet needs. It is password protected so check with the front desk before going there.  There is a free car that you can reserve to be dropped off within 2 miles. We looked into it to go for dinner at Beatrice and Woodsley (see my review on this restaurant, highly recommend), but the said it was not within the 2 miles for the record it is 3 miles, so they are pretty strict on this policy. We asked the bellhop for a cab and he actually ran across the street to Union Station to get us one.  So I would have to say they are very accommodating. He had suggested we take an Uber, but we felt more comfortable taking a cab. This was a mistake, it was quite expensive compared to the Uber we took home.  The wedding we went to there was held in the old carriage house, which is found by exiting the hotel and going around the corner to the art gallery. It was very romantic. The reception was held upstairs and it was very classic.   We probably would not have chosen to stay at the Oxford if the wedding was not being held there. But we are glad we did, it was a very nice stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Beautiful, Old Historic Hotel","The Oxford is a wonderfully historic property a block from the 16th Street Mall in Denver.  Room was spacious, and bed was a large four-poster which was very comfortable.  The bathroom was very nicely tiled, and the tub was super deep.Parking is valet.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Denver Classic!,"My wife and I loved the Oxford! Such a elegant and sophisticated hotel. Their location is superb. It's just a stones throw away from Denver's gorgeous Grand Central Train Station and a host of nice restaurants. The neighborhood is clean and safe. From the stately lobby to our spacious room, the Oxford impressed. We prefer charming and historic hotels with all the modern amenities and that's what you get with the Oxford. Service was excellent. They also have a very cool bar in the lobby called the Cruise Room. We loved the martinis and fried oysters! Overall, the Oxford has that classic, old-school ambiance that is increasingly hard to come by. And it's authentic! If and when I make it back to Denver, I'd stay again at the Oxford without hesitation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Stay!,"Really nice hotel, staying true to its original architecture and design. And you can't beat the location!  The staff was very friendly, and in particular, the two bellmen that gave us rides during our stay.  Dave and Yutaki were engaging conversationalists and very proud of working for such a great hotel.  Highly enjoyed the stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel!,"I love the Oxford Hotel! The decor is warm, welcoming and traditional. The leather furniture is comfortable, the artwork is lovely. A step back in time... Sitting by the lobby fireplace with wine or bourbon is delightful. The rooms are nice and comfortable with a flair for old fashioned. I wish they had more shelve or counter space for personal items in the bath like makeup bags etc, however - that is hard to find. Centrally located near the train station is wonderful. Their lounge/restaurant is very nice and our dinner very good. Other restaurants nearby are very nice as well. This is my fourth year staying there and we will again. The price is not for the faint of heart, but you will enjoy it...the staff is very helpful and friendly and the rooms very clean and quiet...",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Hotel.,This hotel was great. I can't think of anything negative to say. The only thing I could have wished for would be a bathtub in the room. The decor was very nice and location is the best you can ask for in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Wildly Central, Friendly Staff","In Denver to see friends, I wanted to be in the downtown area of Denver and near Union Station for a gathering. I'd attended wedding receptions at The Oxford and my family had stayed there years ago to be near the train to Glenwood Springs and I was so happy to be back! The staff was friendly and helpful. The location is very convenient and the rooms are quiet and well appointed with great linens and a really comfortable bed. I arrived at The Oxford much earlier than I originally planned and was generously upgraded so that I could be checked in right away...at 10 in the morning. That's pretty rare...and remarkable...and I can't say that it's ever happened to me before. That one generosity made my morning so much easier. Checking out was a breeze and Valet and Bellman Services were delightful, as well. Start to finish...The Oxford made the weekend delightful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Unique business event ,This is my second time at the Oxford. Very cool and unique hotel. My room this trip wasn't nearly as cool as the last. It was a little creepy too but that's part of the experience. Great bourbon tasting in the lobby.  Also a haunted tour came in and that was interesting to listen too. Drinks in their bar were also pretty fun. I recommend if you are looking for a little history.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"We used the Oxford for a company meeting, with 40 rooms.","This is the most iconic and historic hotel in Denver.  It is magnificently preserved and appointed, and the staff made us feel completely at home.  We will use this hotel for our business travel in Denver from now on!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic and Charming,"Steeped in history; the lobby and front desk is a place to hang out and feel like you've stepped back in time. Friendly staff hand you a key with a giant sash; no electronic keys here. From the lighting to the hardware to the comfortable surroundings, it's a stress free experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Step back in time,"The Oxford doesn't have the most modern amenities, the rooms aren't the biggest or elevators the fastest... all that aside it is my favorite place to stay in Denver. Upgrade to a room with a claw foot tub as the other rooms seem to have claustrophobic bathrooms. The Cruise Room downstairs is a low key gem of a. At that's been around since the 50's.The location is central with no need for a rental car.The staff is warm and friendly and bends over backwards to make things happen the right way for the guests.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fall Adventures  in Colorado.,"It's a great place to stay on the road. Its right on downtown of Denver. We enjoyed our stay. Yes I would recommend this place. Just a heads up , they don't have free parking so you get extra charges for valet parking.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Superb service historic glory,This is my second stay at the Oxford. The location is excellent conveniently located in Lodo. The team is professional and courteous and a little quirky on a very good way. The public areas and rooms have antique furniture and really capture a nostalgic feel. Amenities like bourbon tasting and complimentary WiFi have a nice mix of old and new. Some furnishings are a little worn and could use attention but overall a great place to hang your hat for a short stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great historical hotel located right in the middle of town,"My husband and I spent 2 nights at Oxford hotel and we had the best time. The entire staff was very professional and friendly. We explored to city by foot and rented city bikes and the hotel was in the prime location. We did make use of the complimentary car service when we wandered a little far and we're too tired to make it back. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a high class hotel with great service in the best part of town.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful historic property,"This hotel is located right next to the newly refurbished Union Station in Denver.  The Oxford Hotel has old world charm, filled with beautiful antiques, and interior architectural details.  The staff is wonderful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fantastic experience all around,"We stayed here for our 21st anniversary, and it was perfect. Friendly, attentive staff, excellent service, comfortable (and authentic) rooms. Dinner at McCormick's next door was just as good. Can't say enough about this place... it's well worth a stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic Hotel,"If you are looking for a stuffy, dark, traditional ballroom to hold your corporate event, then this is NOT the place for you. However, if your looking for a historic boutique hotel conveniently located from public transit that's within walking distance to many restaurants and bars, while provides modern amenities and amazing customer service, then this is the place for you! I highly recommend the Oxford Hotel in Denver, CO to anyone who wants to experience the city of Denver, for  business or personal leisure. It is a beautiful historic hotel with all the modern amenities that you would expect from a 4-star hotel. All of the staff was friendly and provided amazing customer service - the handwritten note upon check-in and luggage tag were superb! The crisp white linens and abundance of pillows makes for a very luxurious bed - so much so that my roommate for the conference opted to sleep in the Oxford's bed instead of her personal air mattress, sheets and pillow that she brings with her everywhere, so that is a huge compliment to the Oxford Hotel! The reason for my stay was to attend a work conference. The size of this boutique hotel was perfect for our size conference. The Oxford Hotel is conveniently located across the street from Union Station which allowed us to take a train directly to and from the Denver Airport. The hotel is also located in the heart of LoDo which is within walking distance to many restaurants and bars.There are many small things that the Oxford Hotel did that made a big difference. As I previously mentioned, upon check-in we were presented with a luggage tag and a handwritten note. Daily the rug in the elevator is changed to show the day of the week. The keys used at the hotel are not your standard magnetized plastic key cards, they use a traditional metal keys adorned with a historic tassel - a very nice touch. A courtesy vehicle use is available for guests to use within two miles of the hotel - this was very helpful as we hosted a happy hour event down the street and needed to transport a couple of large boxes. They also provide you with bottles of water in your room at no additional charge. I know that there are more, but those are just a few of the amenities that immediately come to mind when I think about the Oxford Hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Outstanding,"What a great experience. My wife and I have wanted to stay at the Oxford ever since we read about the history and took a short tour, we were not disappointed. The staff was outstanding, room was just cool and comfortable, and the cruise room is a blast.Honestly there wasn't a thing wrong with our stay and we can't wait to stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Perfectly Convenient to Union Station, LODO and dining","Helpful and friendly staff. Steps to Union Station, dining and shops. Older style rooms with a lovely lobby and bar. Cool and quiet hotel with smallish rooms. All things considered a much better $$ value than the Crawford Hotel above Union Station and across the street.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Clean and Courteous with a a Sense of History,"We have just spent 4 nights and loved every minute of it. You can't beat the Oxford not only for what it is but for its proximity to everything you need or want. LODO is a great place to visit, shop and enjoy with all entertainment venues nearby.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great property in Lodo,"Took Colorado trip primarily to see the mountains and so spent only our first night in Denver; splurged on staying at the venerable Oxford--and wished we'd had another night or two. Accommodations are first rate and location could not be better: easy walk to fine restaurants, Coors Field, Union Station. Perfect place for seeing very cool downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Picturesque but Pricey,"This is a cool historic hotel with an attached bar, restaurant, and spa. Room service is available in the nicely appointed rooms that include a comfy bed and private bathroom.  The furniture has been well loved and upholstery visibly soiled in some areas which was unexpected considering the nightly rate.  Staff was overall helpful, once they know you are a guest at the hotel - dress in your best and you shouldn't have any problems.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing service!,"The staff at the oxford are simply top shelf!  TOM is an asset to any team.  Although short staffed, he went the extra mile at getting me registered at 2 am when a previous reservation was inputted incorrectly with another hotel. He was so helpful,  I wanted to hug him after the call.Upon Check in, SETH  with the awesome hair helped me upgrade my room with minimal fuss and expense.  I've been traveling a lot lately and really wanted to soak my weary bones in one of their amazing claw foot tubs I saw on line. Just a moment of peace and comfort.  I got exactly what I was seeking.   The front desk staff were just all around immensely helpful with every request and truly made my stay memorable.  Honorable mention goes to the valet as well.  When you travel by yourself, having someone take care of minor details count!  (Thx NATE!) The oxford will definitely be on my list for travel to Denver.As for the room itself...gorgeous!  I wanted to take the bathroom home LoL.  Clean, comfortable, centrally located and aesthetically pleasing.Absolutely a 5 star stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lovely,"This is an excellent hotel, and only a couple of hundred yards from Union Station. So easy to find, and great location. Stayed here on last night of our vacation, and it was so gorgeous.  Rooms are elegant, modern, but still have the old world  charm. You can not go wrong staying here. Staff all great, and front desk really charming and accommodating.  Loved the free bourbon also. Can recommend this hotel to anyone,",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Lovely, historical hotel in Denver","What a delightful hotel. It's the oldest in Denver and beautifully decorated but has all the comforts of an updated hotel...nice bathrooms, spacious rooms, comfortable beds and linens and great amenities.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Denver Jewel,"My friend and I enjoyed a girl's shopping trip to Denver recently. We expected great stores and we're delighted to find a great hotel. Located in LoDo the historic downtown just steps away from Union Station, a must visit landmark filled with food shops and memorable restaurants. The Oxford combines the elegance of classic English hotels with the modern conveniences of today. The staff is eager, friendly and knowledgeable. Treat yourself to a delicious cocktail in the hip and gorgeous Cruise Bar.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Truly outstanding,"All the character and charm of an old classic, but with all the modern amenities. Extremely friendly and generous - and with an incredible fitness center. Pretty much the perfect hotel! Just a short walk from Union Station - to and from the Airport is a breeze. I'll stay there every time I'm in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Vintage cool!,Location greatEasy walk to Union CentralKeys with old world tasselsRooms comfyIf you rent a car they will valet for you and a driver can take you within so many miles when available (ask)Hotel website has good dealsBest of all ...super kind people,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Character costs,"The Oxford has character - lots of quirky elements about a hotel that retains an old world ambience. It's smack in the centre of the city so it's easy to get around. And the room we had (for three adults) was great. Everything clean and functional. And everyone was friendly and responsive to our needs. But the character costs. If you are new to Denver, check out Union Central for food and especially Mercantile dining and provision. And visit the Tattered Cover bookshop - one of the world's best.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Vintage Hotel,"Rooms are furnished with antiques and individual lamps, no overheads. Even pieces in the halls were vintage. Elevators small as opposed to expansive modern elevators. Good location for getting around and they even have a car which will shuttle you within a 2-mile radius. The bar is styled post-prohibition. Good drinks and food, but temperature was always a little too cold.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,rooms,very obliging personnel but room was tiny as was the double bed. old fashioned but not many modern amenities. well placed . next to the railwaystation.parking valet efficient but cost of parking very high.,3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming great location,"First time to Denver and we found the location of the Oxford to be perfect for exploring the city.  Close to the ball park and stadium, 16th street mall, union station, Larimer Square and Platte street.  The hotel was beautifully kept and the staff were courteous and helpful.  Thank you Alexa for helping us with our requests. The room was lovely and very comfortable.  I would absolutely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nice Old Hotel,"This place was remodeled but still has the character of an old hotel.  It has small rooms and a very small shower but was very clean and the staff was outstanding with helpfulness and friendliness.  The parking is a bit much at $42 but finding it in LODO is tough to do.  There is some issue with street noise but that is beyond the hotel's control.  The nature of LODO is apparently loud drunks roaming the streets in the middle of the night.  It has a perfect location as the train station, also remodeled, is a short walk and there are a lot of nice restaurants nearby.  One perk is the free drinks at 4:30 to 5:30 and again at 8;30 to 9:30.  The first slot has whiskeys and bourbons and the second has cordials and we had port each night.  The parakeet sings in the lobby in the early times of the day and adds some brightness to things.  There is also coffee in the morning on the second floor and this is nice as well.  It was a good stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,I love this hotel,"Old but super sharp. Very clean, classy top to bottom. Excellent service and staff. Great location - two blocks to the restaurant friends had picked without knowing where I was staying. Big rooms, wide hallways, great details - can't say enough. This is my hotel in Denver, period. Trying to find a nit to pick to make this rave seem more credible, but I really can't think of one. Best hotel experience in quite a while. Bravo, Oxford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Cool for being historic, overpriced","Parking is terrible, hotel could be refreshed even though it's old, it doesn't ALL have to look old. Spa/ salon is decent, but very expensive. For spending more it falls short for prices. Get up to 2016.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Glad my other hotel moved me here,"Arrived in Denver very late thanks to United. The hotel I was supposed to stay at had a water problem, so they moved me here. I'm glad they did. I would never have chosen to stay at a historic hotel. The Oxford was great. From the front desk, to the historic room. Everything is kept up well. Extremely comfortable room and bed. Modern TV (not a black & white with rabbit ears). Near Union Station and Coors Field. Packed with Cubs fans. Next time I'm in denver, my wife and I will stay here. Her being with me this trip would've been the only thing that could've made it better. Well, maybe a Cubs sweep would've helped.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent service by front desk and doormen.,Phoned front desk to change to a larger room. No problem and they brought up a rollaway bed that was quite comfortable. Great service and doormen offered rain ponchos for us to wear to the Cubs/Rockies game.  Parking is $42.00 a day which is quite high,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great stay at The Oxford,Totally amazed by the staff at The Oxford.  They were very warm and welcoming.  The doormen gave great tips about the city.  The historic hotel was beautiful and perfectly located in downtown Denver.  Love The Oxford!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Hotel stay,Great boutique hotel!  Close walking Distance to the Lodo /downtown areas and union station is less than a block.     Many great restaurants nearby.    Staff was wonderful and very accommodating.  Would stay here again. Not really a kid hotel xxxxxxxxxcxxxxxx,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Location, location, location","Recently spent 5 nights in this boutique property with tons of character (and possibly a ghost or two). Staff is super responsive and extremely friendly. I was a bit sorry the courtesy car was out of commission, but between Uber, the free Mallride and the new light rail, I had no problems getting around downtown. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The bed was wonderfully comfortable. The room was a bit dark (old hotel, no over head light) but if you're in a romantic mood-no problems! Also the free internet could be a tad slow unless you sprang for the faster mode. Very good coffee in the mornings and newspapers! Stay during the holiday season and they decorate the lobby to the hilt. It's gorgeous and gets you in the mood.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Needs a dusting,"I would have given this resort a 5 for it's exceptional staff, great location, comfy beds, and historic feel.  However, I don't need the historic dust bunnies to remind me it's an old hotel.  The curtails, blinds, and furniture had not been dusted in a very long time.  We moved the alarm clock and had to clean the counter underneath.  The floors, bathroom, and bedding seemed cleaned, but the room itself was in need of a deep clean.  For this price, I expected more.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Nice hotel/location, terrible noise on street facing room on a Sat night","Enjoyed the hotel for a ""classic"" kind of place.  Seems fairly clean and up to date.   We stayed for baseball games and proximity which were outstanding.   Unfortunately the area is heavy in bars, and the noise level on Fri/Sat nights for a room on the street was really bad.   Even with ear plugs and a pillow over my head, there seemed to be a Harley or V8 engine convention going on in town till around 2AM...   Not the hotel's fault at all but something to be aware of.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Major Mess-up On Check Out,"Decided to give this hotel an average rating of 3 out of 5. The room was comfortable, and the amenities were great. Also used the gym which was quite good. However the good stuff stops there.I used the hotel's safety deposit box, and signed for it. My box number was logged and paperwork filled out. Now I get that part of it is my fault, but on check out I forgot to return the key - there was a lot going on, I had an early morning meeting and tried  to hurry back to the hotel before check-out time. On check out, no one reminded me or asked me back for the key and I accidentally took it away. It was only 1 hour on the road I realised and had to turn back.Again, I agree it was partially my fault, but at the same time, if you log someone's usage of a safety deposit box and it's registered on the system, then there should be a reminder at check-out to return the key and have items given back.Overall as well, the rooms are quite expensive for Denver. I would recommend guests to stay at the Crowne Plaza Denver! Way way better, and you don't have to worry because each room has an individual safe!",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Regional Meeting,This is an awesome Hotel to stay while in Denver. It is just across the street from Union Station and walking distance to Coors Field! It is full of Old World Charm and a sometimes forgotten way of treating guest like Royalty!  Stewart the Doorman is a wealth of Knowlege to help you make the most of your trip! You can walk to 5 Star dinning or a quiet little Coffee shop. It is an experience to remember for a life time! You can take the train straight to Union Station from the airport at a modest cost of $9 and walk out the front to the Oxford Hotel!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Not worth the price,"For $305/night this is what our room looked like when we arrived. Dirty stained carpet, bathroom not cleaned with a ""little yellow pill"" on the bathroom floor, pubic hair on the bathroom wall and dusty light fixtures. Very run down. We've stayed in many boutique historic hotels on different cities but this was by far the worst.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming and friendly well-located hotel,"Our family had 24 hours in Denver.  We went to a Rockies game and stayed at The Oxford Hotel.   The hotel is charming and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  A few doors may have slammed down the hall and our bed may have been a little squeaky --- part of staying at a hotel with character and history.  There were many restaurant, coffee and breakfast options within a block or two.   We loved our stay at the Oxford.  The Valets could not have been more helpful or nice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Exactly What We Were Looking For,"My wife and I just completed a two night stay in Denver at the Oxford Hotel before we took off for Vail, and we had a wonderful experience at the Oxford. The hotel is in an awesome location in Denver and is walking distance to lots of great restaurants, a lot of good bars, couple breweries, and even Coors Field. Our room was very solid - clean, big, and quiet - pretty much everything we needed. No frills but that's just fine with me given the reasonable cost of our room. The best part of the hotel was the people - the people behind the front desk and the people at the door helping with valet and with bags, etc. all could not have been nicer or more helpful. They always steered us in the right direction and provided great suggestions, and seemed really excited to share their favorite places with us. All in all, this hotel is a great value and is perfect for checking out Denver for a couple nights.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming and Convenient,"Overall pretty good experience at The Oxford.  As the oldest hotel in Denver, the hotel boasts great ambience and charm, but not without its drawbacks. Because of historical preservation restrictions, certain things like double pained windows are forbidden. If you're a light sleeper like me, even sleeping on the 5th floor of an alleyway can be problematic when the garbage trucks show up at 5am.  Also, heads up that parking costs $42/night. The upside to parking at the hotel is certainly the bellhops/valets (free waters!) Dave and Leo are the two who standout for their courteousness and helpfulness.  Locationwise, you can't beat The Oxford which is walking distance to both Coors' Field & Union Station.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Last minute,"I was in a jam at 4am and Sean was kind enough to allow us to check in. He was incredibly helpful and the hotel is gorgeous. A little different than your typical Marriott or Hilton, but the bed was incredibly comfortable and the people were extremely helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Unique Hotel,"Stayed here for a week on business. Really enjoyed my hotel. The staff were so helpful and made my staff very enjoyable. The rooms are real cool, I had one of the rooms with a high bed which was great. The bars were nice and the food was lovely. It is also great location for touring the city.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,One night in Denver,The history and charm of the hotel are great. The rims were a bit dated. The location was fantastic. I'm now just filling up space because TripAdvisor requires 200 characters. The weather in Denver was charming.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing bed and beautiful antiques,"We stayed in a junior suite for two nights with our 2 small children as we were moving across the country to Northern Colorado. We were so exhausted the first night and the bed in that room was amazing, even with a toddler kicking me in the kidney. The hallways and public spaces of the hotel are absolutely beautiful and very interesting to see all the antique paintings, furniture, and architecture. The bathroom was kind of a let down, didn't seem very clean. The living area part of the suite was not very comfortable and had a cheap couch with a slip cover that looked like something from an old dorm room. We were on the third floor and noise wasn't an issue.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel for Amtrak passengers,"The Oxford is a great place to stay when arriving in Denver via Amtrak. The hotel is about 1 block from Denver Union Station, and a great place to have a reservation when traveling from California or other points West. The California Zephyr is scheduled to arrive at 6:30 pm, but as Amtrak can sometimes be later, you will have no worries about your accommodations at the Oxford waiting for you, no matter your arrival time. The hotel itself is contains a huge collection of antiques in really nice rooms. Top notch, first class service. They even have a complimentary limo for drops at rental cars or other spots within a 2 mile radius. This is a classic building in the heart of downtown Denver, 4 blocks from Coors Field and 1 block from the downtown 16th street mall. Surrounded by taverns and restaurants, hotel amenities also include a couple of drinks at their excellent bars.This hotel is a must do experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Incredible Service, Prime Location","From the moment you walk through the doors at the Oxford, located a convenient half block from Denver's Union Station, you feel like you have stepped back in time. The low lighting, dark wood, bird in a cage (!) and western theme in the art and sculpture all serve to set the tone. The hotel staff is where the Oxford really shines. They are universally helpful, attentive, and knowledgeable. And they remember you from one encounter to the next. Comfortable beds, antique furnishings and other memorable touches round out the experience. Definitely worth a visit (or a return trip).",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect LoDo Hotel ,"So convenient to be able to take the train from DIA, walk across the street and step back in to history in this lovely hotel. We knew we were in for a treat when we noticed they change the rugs in the elevators daily with the name of week. Our room was spacious and light. Excellent location - one block to free electric shuttle on 16th Street Mall. Lots of restaurants close by and Union Station always fun for people watching.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A step into the past,"Stayed here for one night earlier this week.  It is centrally located downtown near a lot of restaurants and entertainment and only one block from Union Station, which is nice for those flying in and out of town.  The staff is extremely friendly and courteous.  When I checked in I was told this is the oldest hotel in Denver.  They have done a really nice job of preserving the antique features but still providing modern upgrades.  There is really cool antique typewriter on the second floor where you can key a letter and then emboss it with the hotel's stamp.  Also they have a bourbon bar in the lobby in the evening.  Very nicely done.  When I return to Denver I will definitely be staying here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Grand Dame and Elegant Hotel,"My husband and I recently took my elderly mother for her birthday treat for a night's stay at the Oxford Hotel in Downtown Denver, Colorado. What a beautiful place with vintage antique accommodations!  We were all treated so kindly and professionally by each of the staff members we encountered.  Since we were catching an Amtrak train the next day, this was the perfect place to stay for us all. The room was large, clean, and comfortable. We were able to access everything we needed from our hotel. The staff drove us to a local ice cream shop, and provided us with complimentary ice cold water each time we requested it. Someone was always readily available to assist us no matter how small the request. Once our train arrived late, the staff graciously allowed us to store our luggage for a second time so that we we could walk to a local restaurant for breakfast unencumbered without having to lug them around with us...the best part about this is that we had already checked out...Now, that's what I call compassionate and classy! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to be close to Union Station and downtown, but at the same time seeking solitude and genuine relaxation. From the moment I booked the hotel to our retrieval of our bags, this place offered first class and flawless service. I don't impress easily, but the Oxford Hotel gets outstanding praise from my family and I...We'll be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Historic and charming, if not peaceful","Beautiful historic building with five-star service.  Rooms are charming, comfortable and large.  It was difficult to sleep, however, with the old walls and lack of noise insulation.  I'm sure the neighbors next door were excited to - uhhh - make their marriage official - but I wasn't excited to listen.     Staff is extremely helpful and the free shuttle made it easy when in a bind to get somewhere downtown.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Stylish and relaxing,"Charming hotel with character.Good sized rooms and excellent facilities. The staff are excellent and made our stay even more enjoyable. Special mention to Leo the concierge who was fantastic.Still having to adjust to hotel prices in the USA, this was not cheap!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Won't Stay Any Other Place,"You can't beat the Oxford for service, ambiance, value, and location. The lower downtown area of Denver is the place to be.  The Oxford is figuratively the epicenter of it all. You're within walking distance to most places you'd want to go. And if you're not, they offer a car service -- free within downtown Denver -- to take you where you want to go. The Oxford is a higher-end hotel, but if you snoop around on its website frequently, you'll find a deal that offers solid value for your budget.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel. Great service. Great location.,"This is a great historic property, but well updated. Walkable to Coors Field, Union Station, Tattered Cover bookstore, Larimer Square and all the cool spots. The bourbon bar every evening is nice touch too. I loved The Cruise Room, the historic art deco style bar.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford is the best hotel in Colorado .,When traveling to Denver for any reason I would definitely stay at the Oxford . It is the definition of elegance and class. With an amazing staff that makes you feel at home.  Not to mention so much history and the cruise Room is place one must visit.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A dandy,Designed by the same architect as the Brown Palace this is a true gem -- on the negative side the rooms vary greatly in size and quality even in the same price category.  Very helpful staff and one of the nicest bars anywhere.  Has a great location,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent Stay in Heart of Denver,"Fine vintage hotel filled with friendly and helpful staff.  They attended promptly to any requests we made and often visited with us and shared facts about the hotel and the surrounding area.  We loved this place.  The location is perfect for accessing downtown Denver, with easy access to train transportation to outlying areas.  We stayed here for a week and really got to know this hotel.  We loved the high ceilings, large rooms and wide hallways.  The restaurants in the adjacent Union Station are high quality and varied.  The restaurant in the building (McCormick and Schmick's) provided us with quality and reasonable breakfasts every day.  One of the best features of the Oxford is the Spa and what is basically an athletic club for the use of guests.  Most hotels that have ""fitness centers"" leave much to be desired.  The Oxford fitness center is nearly as nice as the athletic club we work out at when we are at home.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Relaxing stay in Denver,Just spent a weekend at the Oxford visiting family. With the train from the airport it is so convenient Room was clean and the night was quiet. Would stay again.  Front desk was friendly as were the gentleman at the front door.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,my Denver stay,"Historical rooms , very friendly staff , you can feel and breath the great history.Gym , you feel like you are part of an old Rocky movie , very well equipped.WiFi excellent , would definitely consider coming back during my next business trip",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Good and Bad,"I love historic hotels and this one is one and is decorated in vintage style.  The hotel staff was very nice and tried hard including making amends for the issues we encountered.  This hotel is ground zero for downtown Denver which included Union Station and the end of the 16th street mall.  If you know Denver this area includes street performers, panhandlers and homeless people.  I selected this hotel based on great internet reviews but I would not stay there again.  First we paid extra for a large corner room and upon entering the room, it smelled old, musty and moldy.  In appearance it was clean.  I ordered a bottle of wine from the room service menus which they did not have, they recommended a substitute which never happened so I walked a few blocks to the liquor store and brought home a bottle of white wine.  Since I had no luck with room service, I decided instead of trying to get an ice bucket, I requested the complementary mini refrigerator.  It came eventually and was plugged in so I tipped the staff that delivered it.  When I opened it, to put the wine in it, it was full of moldy food.  This hotel is owned by McCormick and Schmick's (Landry's) which occupies part of the ground floor.  They provide the room service, the fridge and were the source of most of my issues.  There are good things about the hotel.  I stay in a number of historic hotels that are five star, this is not one of them.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Classic,"The Oxford is an elegant hotel in the calmly understated City of Denver.  The building is full of architectural features and lovely art deco features.  There is a lovely comfortable warm and welcoming feel about it.  The staff were helpful and very friendly, but not in an over the top kind of way.If you arrive by train its just a block away.The only down side for us was that we only stayed for a night!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Interesting old hotel,"This is a really interesting hotel in a city otherwise packed with boring bed factories and conference hotels.Has some good bars and restaurants and the overall ambience is very good indeed.Very close to Union Station which is useful given that there is now a rail link from there to Denver Airport, which otherwise can be a drag through dense traffic.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Elegant and romantic. A real gem.,"I'll start with the conclusion:  between work and fun, I stay at a lot of hotels at all points n the spectrum.  Normally, I consider even high end hotels simply places to sleep and I evaluate them based strictly on practical considerations.  This is one of the rare cases where the charm of the hotel itself enhanced the enjoyment of my visit, and I will would definitely stay there again if I'm back in Denver.  Now for the details...I was on business in Ft. Collins for a couple of weeks, and my wife came out for the weekend.  We made a last minute decision to spend Saturday night in Denver.  As I searched hotels, all the major chains came up, but this place caught my eye because it was a little cheaper and got really fantastic reviews.  She was skeptical, because frankly my record is not good in this area, but this time I got it right.The place is absolutely gorgeous. It's of course decorated with an antique theme, but manages to avoid looking either run down or kitschy.  The rooms have the charm of a (tasteful!) bed and breakfast, but with all the modern conveniences.  The beds and pillows are as good as I've found anywhere at any price.  It's within walking distance of everything downtown.Unusual amenities include:  - a complimentary glass of bourbon at 5:30 (even on weekends)  - a complimentary glass of port from 8:30-9:30  - if you type a letter on their antique mechanical typewriter, they will mail it for you.  The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful.  An all around excellent stay with no complaints.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Birthday celebration ,"Was nervous about staying in a hotel 125 years old.  So glad that I was pleasantly pleased with our stay.  From being greeted from the bellman to our welcome upon check in my nervousness was put to ease.  The hotel has an old world charm, architectural beauty, historical nuggets throughout the property. Our room key was a traditional key, not the modern day key fobs of today. No, no.  And the key was on a beautiful tassel that had a matching ""Don't not disturb"" tassel we can hang outside our room for that additional sleep in time.  Out bathroom has modern plumbing, single pedestal sink, white subway tile and a tub deep enough for 2.  Oh, we took advantage of that. When we adventured downtown Denver, our key was left in the key box waiting for our return. Union Station was just outside our door within walking diatance.  We enjoyed a late happy hour lunch and vegan ice cream in the nearby creamery. The train and railway station was a back drop to the Terminal, a trendy place to have the local brews, or coffees of Denver.  We enjoyed the complimentary evening Bourbon bar prior to heading out for a late dinner and a view of the fireworks near Market St.For this being our first time to Denver, The Oxford will definitely be a place to come to again.  If you like history, a place that takes you back in time and traditional service, The Oxford will be your choice to.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great location, awesome hotel","This hotel has so much character! It's the oldest hotel in Denver, yet doesn't feel ""old"" in the outdated rundown sense.  My fiancé and I LOVED this hotel.  Great location.  There was a resort fee but it included a bunch of stuff that made it worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Elegant historical hotel,This beautiful hotel is right in the middle of so many restaurants and interesting things to. The staff were especially friendly and helpful. The free bourbon and port tastings and free shuttle were added bonuses!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best in the West!,"Always a great hotel and experience, beginning with a friendly greeting by Stewart and the excellent and professional staff. The rooms are comfortable, clean and fun. Skip the McCormack's Restaurant. Even though it is onsite, it is not part of the hotel and the poor service there is not reflective of The Oxford. Instead, have dinner st Jax's across the street or at one of the many other great restaurants in LoDo.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,style & friendliness,"I chose the hotel for its historical style, and the art historian in me was amply rewarded! But equally enjoyable, if not more so, were the friendliness of the staff, the location - and really *considerate* arrangements such as the driving service, the special offerings in the lobby and the rebate arrangements with neighboring breakfast places. This is not one of your anonymous convention hotels, this is a hotel with class and style. One of our best hotel experiences ever!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Very convenient to Denver Union Station; comfortable but expensive,"I needed to catch a 8AM train to California, so I wanted to be close. The Oxford is just a couple of hundred yards from the station. Nothing wrong with my room, and it did have excellent linens and a good bed, but neither was there anything extra special. Surprisingly, the hotel has no dining room, though room service is available and restaurants are nearby.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Lovely, interesting, great staff","Perfect location next to Union Station. Oldest hotel in Denver made for an interesting place with character. Excellent staff. Wonderful spa - make sure you get a massage with Michael Livesay - excellent fitness studio. The bourbon bar, Cruise, served yummy drinks. The house car took us to Root Down for dinner (the concierge had made reservations 8 days in advance) and we had the best meal. Highly recommend the kale/bacon salad and the rack of lamb. Make sure you try Snooze in Union Station for breakfast .... You will have a wait, but so worth it.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Awesome Location - Old School Cool Boutique Hotel,"Hipster old school cool (in a good way :) No key cards here, real keys with huge tassels. You can leave your giant key at the front desk so you don't have to take it out with you. Hotel is full of history and beautiful architecture. Hallways are huge, standard rooms are small (much smaller than a normal, modern room) but furniture fits well. Take advantage of the free drink at the Bourbon Bar they set up in the lobby from 5:30-6:30 pm and the Free drink at the Cordial Hour at 8:30 pm. Location can not be beat in Lodo (Lower Downton)! The brand new light rail train takes you from the airport to Union Station which is across the street from the hotel. Tons of restaurants and bars with fun beer gardens (have a Peanut Butter Porter at Tap Fourteen), the ballpark and a place to buy weed (LoDo Wellness Center) all in walking distance.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great location, but filthy","Visited for a family wedding and LOVED the location! Very close to Union Station, great restaurants and bars! Unfortunately, our room was filthy. When we checked in, we were in a hurry to meet family or we should have rushed right down the the desk to request another room. There were someone's bottom prints on the bed, so someone else checked in, looked at the filth and requested another room.  There was blood on the tile next to the sink in the restroom, white ""stuff"" on the bedskirt, a dusty and water spotted coffee maker, filthy baseboards and spider webs.  I have attached pictures, but when I first submitted this review, some of the my attached pictures were replaced with ""Oxford Hotel"" promotional pics. If you see these on this review, I didn't post them.  We complained upon checkout and were comped one night stay,but felt that housekeeping was lacking terribly. Ask for a room with a view as we had one of a brick wall.  So disappointed as read great reviews prior to our stay.",1
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent One night Visit,"My wife and I spent one night here while traveling through Denver.  It is an amazing historic sight!  The room was very nice with a comfortable bed.  It is located in a area with plenty of restaurants and coffee shops.  Union station is also within sight of the front door.  Stewart and Leo were two of the best and nicest door men I have ever dealt with, always willing to help and put a smile on your face. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Location,Very close to Union Station and Coors Field.  Lots of restaurant options nearby and within the hotel is a fantastic bar.  We even took advantage of their free Cadillac Escalade service to a nearby restaurant.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Class with sense of history,"If you travel regularly and are tired of the sameness of corporate hotels, and you are in Denver then the Oxford Hotrl might be a great choice for you.The Oxford is the.oldest hotel in Denver and has a real sense of history about it.The hotel is comfortable, you use okd time key locks for entry to rooms, which gives a  great sense of a time gone by but the free wifi is very good.Service is consistently excellent and staff take the time to attebd to your needs. One really great feature of the hotel is the free whisky and bourbon tasting each night at 5.30pm.  This hives you a chance to try some really good quality exclusive and old bourbons.and.whiskeys, which is great.A definite must  for the traveller looking for something different.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Weekend getaway to the city,"I met my Mom for Memorial Day weekend downtown Denver. I live 5 hours away in a rural community, so it's always fun to visit the city. The Oxford Hotel was a unique experience. The staff was friendly and the hotel itself was authentic and very accommodating. I would most definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great experience ,"The beautiful, historic Hotel is in a great location in Lodo across the street from Union Station.  Very close to great shopping and restaurants.   The staff is very knowledgable about The whole Denver area.   Love the daily rug swap in the elevators.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Convenient and classy historical hotel,"The Oxford Hotel in Denver is a classy historic hotel and a unique place to stay.  The rooms are decorated in a historic motif reflecting the glory days in the 1800s when Colorado was a booming Western town.  The area around the hotel is known as LoDo, or Lower Downtown, which is going through a revival as the old brick buildings are updated into bars, shops, and offices.  It is only a block to the main railway station for easy transport options from the airport on the new light rail, or anywhere in the Denver area via train or bus, or further afield on Amtrak.  The ball park and main downtown sights are only a few blocks away, and the hotel operates a free shuttle to anywhere nearby.  So for a convenient and classy stay in Denver's history, this is the real deal.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Quaint boutique hotel in great location, with killer cocktails.","I stayed 3 nights on business in Denver. The location is perfect, step out of the station after getting the train  from the airport and you're there. Rooms are nice and clean, and the doors have keys which is quaint. Food in McCormicks and breakfast are good. Staff are friendly and respectful. The waitress in the cocktail bar is fantastic at figuring out the perfect cocktail to round out your evening. All in all one of the best boutiques I've stayed in in the US.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic showing it's age,"Beautiful old hotel with first rate service.  The rooms were well decorated with expensive draperies, bedding, and furniture.  The bathroom was also attractively decorated.  Unfortunately, the bath and shower were substandard with knobs falling off and difficult temperature control.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Different but rooms not for me or the service overall,"I have never stayed at a hotel quite like this. The bar and restaurant are connected to the hotel but are separate owners. Hotel was very unique. Took you back to like the 40s. Real keys with a gold tassle for your room were provided. You had to turn them in when you left for the day. Even though it was nice to not stay at a chain and the lobby was homey and special I didn’t like the rooms. You can tell this isn’t owned by a chain. There are errors in the room service book and other things that you can tell it isn’t owned by a corporate entity with consistent standards. The bathroom was so small and there was absolutely no room to put any toiletries. It was a juggling act to try to put on make-up and contacts, etc. There was also a step to get into the bathroom which for someone who gets up a lot at night made me very afraid as I thought I might forget and hurt myself. The bed was very comfortable and lovely but very high for me. I had to almost jump in to get into it. Again not fun when you get in and out a lot. Though for most people this won’t be an issue. Room service was typical. We had drinks in the bar and they were delicious and the bar was stunning. Had I think a 40s theme as well and the servers were dressed oh so cute. We had an event that was held at this hotel. The room that we used (Sage) functioned ok but not your usual hotel conference room. It sits at the front of the hotel and the room is kind of not really suited to hold a presentation. Plus the room faces the street which is very odd when you are presenting. The service which is provided by the restaurant was not very good. I felt like we were a real bother to the servers. One in fact ignored me when I asked a question. I had to also chase them to get them to pick up the food from our clients. The food was fine. The service at front desk was ok. One young lady was lovely but the rest were average. I didn’t feel like an invited guest or important to them. They did what they had to. I wish I could remember the lovely lady’s name – she was working around noon at the front desk on May 25th. Next time I would try another hotel. It would be ok if I had to stay there but it wasn’t great. I would go to the bar though for drinks. Great menu and good service by the ladies in red.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel,"We stayed here for two nites on our recent trip to Denver.  Excellent location. After taking the 30-40 RTD ride from airport (the easiest thing ever), we walked thru Union Station and one block down was Oxford Hotel.  It is one block away from the 16th St mile and three short blocks from Coors Field.  We didn't need a car.  The staff was kind and helpful...thank you Oscar for helping us on our first day there. The bed was wonderfully comfortable after a long day of walking.  Very clean and quiet place.  It is an older building so shower was small and our door lock was hard to use at times but that is the charm of this hotel. We never did see the evening turn down service...maybe they have done away with that?  I was looking forward to that. The canary was charming and the changing of the elevator rugs to the current day was a nice touch.  We will recommend this hotel to all our family and friends when visiting Denver",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Just back from a wonderful trip to Denver. The Oxford Hotel is a top notch place to stay.,"My husband and I spent three nights at the Oxford Hotel.  It was my Christmas gift from him and I got to pick the hotel.  The Oxford was one that he suggested.  I did some research, checked TripAdvisor reviews, and selected it.  I am so glad I did!  Everything was perfect.The Oxford is an old hotel, the oldest in Denver.  The rooms are large, the furnishings fit the style and age of the hotel.  There are no key cards, no digital entry, there is a real key on a tassel.  Very easy to keep track of.The service is outstanding.  From the bellhop/doormen to the front desk we couldn't have asked for more.  They were always willing to help, provide restaurant suggestions and were on the spot when we needed our car, or anything else.We had one problem with our room.  The second day we were there we noticed a loud popping sound when the air conditioner went on.  We called the front desk and the manager came up.  He explained there was no one on site to look at it, but he would gladly move us to another room.  We moved to a lovely corner room.  The room itself was a bit smaller, but the bathroom was much larger, with a claw foot tub, enclosed shower (the previous room just had a small shower with a shower curtain) and two sinks.We did not use most of the amenities provided.  They have coffee and tea available daily until 11:00 a.m., complementary limo service within a 2 mile radius, free wifi, 2 bottles of water daily, a drink at their bourbon bar (5:30 - 6:30), a business center and access to the Oxford Club fitness center and classes.  Of those listed we only used the wifi in the room.They also provided discounts at several  restaurants.We enjoyed the Denver Botanical Garden, the Denver Art Museum and the Denver Museum of Art & Science.  Favorite meal was dinner at Fruition, and other meals we enjoyed were dinner at Humboldt: Farm, Fish, Wine, breakfast at Delectable Egg and lunch at the Kitchen.We would definitely stay at the Oxford Hotel again.  We loved the location, near the Union station, which is a very happening place.  The whole city just seemed alive and vibrant.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A wonderful blast from the past,"This hotel is just amazing. Everything has a sense of history, is super clean, with an extremely friendly staff. I found myself calling them by name just like they called me by name. You can't beat the location or the free nightly bourbon tasting. The bed is one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,What More Do You Want from A Hotel?,"I drove up and very nice valet whisked my car away.  As I walked in, a young man was setting up a free whiskey and rum tasting.  Then, I moseyed over  to the counter enjoying beautiful art, comfortable looking leather couches and all the design touches of the oldest hotel in Denver.  The counter is backed by actual hotel room keys on fobs that hang their awaiting your return.  Aaaaah... the good old days are alive!!If you love the idiosyncratic touches of history embellished with the modern touches of smooth sheets and wifi...where else would you stay in Denver.  Did I mention how engaging and attentive all the people who work there are?  They are great!See ya again soon.Matt",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful hotel with character charm and great service,My best friend and her daughter (my god daughter) met in Denver for her other daughters graduation from law school and stayed at the Oxford.  Our room was perfect for 3 females - larger than a normal hotel room and just lovely.  The bath was also larger and had kept the old world charm but pristine.  Highly recommend!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Old world charm! New world amenities! Exceptional Staff,We loved The Oxford. It has so much character and old world charm. Rooms are beautifully appointed and the hallways just drip with nostalgia. The location can't be beat. Right across from Union Station you can jump on the train from the airport and be there in a flash for not much $. Very close to 16th st mall and all it has to offer. Less than 2 miles away from the Art Museum and state capitol buildings. Walking distance to Coors Field. Outstanding amenities and an exceptional staff are what  make The Oxford really stand out to me. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to stay here again and am planning to the next time I'm in Denver. My only suggestion would be for them to upgrade and add HBO to their channel list which is standard in most 4 star hotels.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Good but not perfect,"The hotel is very close to Union Station, which is nice if you take the train in from the airport. Service is very good (even though we had to ask for lotion three times before it was finally brought to the room). Included in the ""resort fee"" is a car that will take you within a 2 mile radius, and pick you up, which was very useful. Also close by is the pedestrian 16th Street mall, but most of the ""action"" on the mall is about seven blocks away, so don't be fooled by this.  The room is sort of small, and we had a suite. In addition the curtains look nice but do not block out the sun, which was an annoying surprise first thing in the morning. Also the windows are ancient, not double pained and don't even close all the way. The room was extremely quiet except for the noise from a wedding downstairs. These are minor items, though, but not expected from a ""luxury"" hotel. We will stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Comfortable and convenient,"We booked this hotel as it was within close proximity to Coors Field. Glad we did. It's a 10minute, maximum walk from Coors field. It's also within close proximity to the free Mall shuttle bus, and walking distance to many restaurants. The rooms were comfortable, not huge, but nice. The concierge is helpful, as is the front desk staff. One quirky point, is that the carpet in the elevators is changed daily. How do I know this?  The carpet has the day written on it!  It's kinda cute.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"History, service, amenities & location, location, location","Denver's oldest hotel (since 1891) located in the heart of Lower Downtown (LoDo), which is where you want to be. The staff told us each room has different decor - our 5th floor corner room had antique table & king bed, dresser, desk and armchairs. The hotel offers neat complimentary perks like bourbon on arrival, cordials daily, use of the Oxford Health Club next door and limo rides to any destination within 2 miles, paid train fare for two round trip to the airport from Union Station 1/2 block away (I'll leave my car home next time. One can rent Smart Cars parked all over LoDo, ... or bicycles, ... or Uber). Did I mention simply tons of quirky charm?- great, friendly, knowledgable and helpful staff.- real fire in the lobby fireplace with plush seating, almost like you're expected to relax and converse- the canary in an antique cage to greet you at the front desk as you come and go- a writing station on the mezzanine with oversized desk, functioning Remington typewriter, Oxford Hotel seal and complimentary stationary and post, so you can type a letter to your friends back home- clean and well maintained, right down to the elevator rugs with the correct day of the weekNo complaints. We loved it and will come again if ever we're in Denver.",5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Bed bugs beware,"Beware hotel has bed bugs! I told the housekeeper the following morning and nothing was done. Ended up buying our own blankets and sleeping on the floor. Called hotel after I returned home and went to Dr and confirmed it was bed bug bites and was told there was nothing they could do about it except give me a free night stay the next time I returned. Now what makes you think I would return after spending $790.00 for three nights and getting bit up. Oh I forgot the extra $210.00 extra fees,they charge at the end of your stay!! Beware!!",1
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Feel the heritage,"amazing history with this location and as soon as you step in you feel like you are in some historical mansion, Staff is amazing. They offered free Cadillac ride in two miles distance, Very nice locations surrounding with food and bars.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful stay for a 4 day work trip,"I was traveling to Denver for the second time from NY for a work trip and this hotel was recommended by co-workers. I was very happy since the hotel is only 2 blocks away from the train station and 2 blocks away from the office, but i was not expecting it to be so great. The staff is super friendly and helpful, they will direct you to anything you need and recommend any restaurant or bar you are looking for. The hotel itself has a ton of character and charm. The rooms are very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. I was also really impressed by the gym on the first floor. IT not only had a nice selection of machines, but also weights and even classes like spin and yoga. The first floor also connects to an amazing coffee shop. Both, the bar and the restaurants in the hotel are great. The restaurant had really great seafood and was very quick and friendly service wise. The bar had great cocktails!Will definitely stay here from now on when I travel back to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,History and class makes this truly place special,"Form the moment you step into the Oxford Hotel you are going to feel the history of this property. The historic speakeasy - ""Cruise Room"" - located off the lobby will take you back to the Jazz era. Step inside and enjoy a true authentic throw back cocktail. The lobby is well appointed, comfortable and nods to this property's long history. The rooms are large and furnished with period furnishings. Comfortable robes and luxurious bedding. Located in the center of downtown Denver and across the street from the new Union Station it is walking distance to everything you need. The customer service was impeccable and the real room keys will remind you that you are someplace truly special.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Wedding weekend at The Oxford!,"Our wedding was picture perfect! Despite the one flaw with regard to room blocking, which did take significant effort and frustration to resolve, we wouldn't have done it differently.... From the onset of the arrival where Leo Krizan (Bell Captain), and his crew were helpful, conscientious, and accommodating... To the Front desk who anticipated and met every request or need. Ashley was perfection in orchestrating the events through the weekend, and the remaining crew who treated us like friends and family were a delight! After all was said and done, I think we made them feel as welcome as they made us feel. I can't thank everyone - sans the party responsible for the block booking - enough for their diligence, professionalism, conscientiousness, and perfection from start to finish! Once in a lifetime experience! See you next year for the anniversary!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great visit,This was our first stay at The Oxford hotel and it was a great visit.

Great stay and would highly recommend.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"The Oxford:  More Than a Hotel, an Experience","Enter The Oxford and step back in time to a previous era. The lobby, rooms, and general décor all remind me of the furnishings we had when I was a child many years ago.  The staff is there to please. Tom, Bree, and Patrick couldn’t have been better in reception providing exceptional service such as offering water whenever we went out or came in, listening to our stories, or telling us theirs. And of course, during the day there was the sherbet-colored canary Sherman waiting in his cage outside the counter to brighten your day with his song.The Oxford also has a number of special features. For a little over $15 a day service charge you get a special card. With it there is each afternoon a pre-dinner hour bourbon pour in the lobby followed several hours later by a similar offering of sherry or port.  These 2 pours were ably staffed by Alyssa and Nate. The card also provides you with entrance to the Oxford Club next door which you can access by elevator from the second floor. There you will find a locker room and a gym with an array of machines as well as a weight room. There are even free scheduled classes to be had. For example, we attended a yoga session early one morning before breakfast. And the card will get you 25% discounts at several Union Station food venues.The Oxford is also well situated. If you take the newly-opened train from the airport which runs every 15 minutes during the day, you can be to the downtown station in around 35 minutes and the hotel in about a 5 minute walk more. There you are at the center of an array of fine restaurants and also just a short walk to the Rockies ball park if baseball is your thing.I found 2 small shortcomings. Although there is a coffee maker and bottled water provided in the room, a mini-fridge might have been welcome as well to store possible leftovers from dinner (we had pizza). And maybe my biggest complaint, in an effort to be eco-friendly the floor lamps with the modern fluorescent light bulbs were less than adequate in providing the light needed to read in the chairs provided at least for my old tired eyes. Still, all in all, if you take advantage of all that is offered, the location, the service, and the special features the Oxford really is a fair value.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fantastic Service,"My boyfriend recently got a new job and Denver and we stayed at the Oxford to get a feel for the neighborhood. The staff here was incredible! We especially loved Leo the doorman. He was so helpful to us every day and had answers to all of our questions as we were brand new to the city. He went above and beyond to accommodate our every need. From giving us restaurant recommendations, to the little details like making sure we had a bottle of water for the road, he was always one step ahead.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great Old Downtown Hotel, but a bit Worn","We recently stayed here before catching Amtrak the next day.  Along with the Crawford (which is actually in Union Station), this is one of the best options if you are catching Amtrak.  It is easy walking distance and if you have rolling luggage (who doesn't these days), you do not even need a porter.This is a great old historical hotel.  The staff is friendly and effective and the rooms are large.  Most of the rooms have been updated and have adequate electronic support.  There are several bars and restaurants, and the Downtown Mall is just outside.The major drawback is that the place does show a fair amount of wear and tear.  If you are not bothered by a few frayed edges, you will like this place.  But, if you want the same historic hotel experience with a newer, more modern feel, I recommend the Crawford Hotel.  In my opinion, its remodeling was more thorough and better done that that at the Oxford.  Both are great, prices are comparable, but in my opinion, the Crawford is a bit better.  In any event, this hotel is recommended!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,First Time Stay,A very nice historic feel and first rate.  Great location that met our needs and plans well.  Will be back in the future when need to stay again.  The staff really goes out of their way to accommodate.  Many specials and perks come with the stay.....pleasantly surprised by this feature.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fantastic downtown experience!,"Dating from the 19th century this unique hotel is in a great location. Perfect for union station and Coors Field as well as most of downtown Denver being in easy walking/taxi distance. Each room is unique and they look stunning - and with a lot of space too. The front desk and door staff were really helpful to me - advising on places to visit, where to run, and getting taxis. If you want to stay in a beautiful place in Denver then I'd recommend this - especially if Union station figures in your plans as it is under half a block from the Amtrak.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great staff and foody/beer galore!!,"First I would like to thank the Bell Captain from Sunday morning (4/26) so sorry I forgot his name. He was very helpful and eager to please. Gave us great advice and directions. And all the rest of the staff was awesome. Made this trip better than expected. The lobby was a nice place to hang out and have a cup of coffee in the morning. Which by the way was the best coffee in Denver. Seriously it was. If there was one bad thing about this trip was the coffee at some really nice places we went to. Awful.  Anyway.  The lobby, corridors and overall decor was really nice.  I understand that this is the oldest hotel in Denver but the room furniture doesn't have to be the oldest either.  Bed and pillow were very comfy. The room was clean.  The hotel is located near all the trendy touristy spots, Union Station, Coors Field, 16th Street Mall, Larimer square.  If you are a foody and love beer, this is the place to be. No parking, no vending/ice machines, no pay-per-view. Kind of a bummer considering how much the rates are.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford in snow,"We stayed from Wed - Mon over which turned out to be a very heavy Sat - Sun snowstorm.  Fortunately, the LoDo area was spared the worst but it kept us close by.  Excellent, excellent location.  The staff very accommodating (remember your name, good suggestions on places to go, prompt with requests, etc.)  A wonderful moment spent having tea directly in front of the lobby fire with snow falling outside.  The hotel bar is worth a visit but a bit dark for my tastes, the adjoining (p/o McCormick's) bar much nicer with very good natural light.  Adjoining restaurant, McCormick's is ok, but local area has fantastic dining.  Beginning late-April 2016, the direct rail link from the airport opens and will connect the the wonderful Union Station one block away.  Easy to roll your bag to the front desk - even in snow....Would I stay there again - you bet!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful Hotel Experience!,"What a fabulous hotel experience! If you are looking for a unique, high quality, sophisticated hotel and not the same cookie cutter hotel chain experience , book here! The hotel is from 1891 and the ambiance of the 80 room hotel brings back all the charm and nostalgia of the elegance of yesteryear! We had a huge room with the most comfortable beds I have ever experienced! The rooms are all furnished with beautiful antiques and the bathroom was tiled in the black and white tiles from the period. The staff couldn't be nicer and go out of their way to make sure all your needs are satisfied. They offer a complimentary bourbon tasting in the lobby at 5:30 and a port or sherry nightcap at 8:30. The lobby is gorgeous and you feel as if you had stepped back into another era. The complimentary car service is a real treat to deliver you or pick you up within a 2 and 1/2 mile radius! Overall, I couldn't recommend a better hotel in the Lodo area and it is only 1/2 block from Union Station, which has many restaurants all with outdoor patios for enjoying sunny warm days.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful nostalgia hotel,"What a beautiful historic hotel in a perfect location to discover Denver!!   The staff was excellent and eager to please, the rooms very comfortable and well appointed, and the proximity to Union Station, Coors Field, Larimer square and wonderful restaurants could not be beat.    Thank you for a wonderfully relaxing weekend of discovering Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Understated elegance in a cozy and sophisticated hotel,"Lovely staff, location and accomadations. They were very helpful in spite of my last minute reservation. I left my phone charger and they were able to sell me one for $10 that they brought to my room. They saved the day.This hotel is also located in a great corner close to food and bars. And bonus - they have an amazing restaurant and bar - The Cruise Room. Again - beautifully appointed and staffed.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Rooms are charming. Location is terrific. Staff is even better.,"We were at the Oxford during last week's 3-day snow event. It was a cabin-fever-inducing situation. But we weren't unhappy. The hotel has lots of historic charm. The lobby has great proportions, some really nice artwork, lovely fireplace, coffee service, and, of course, Sherman the exceptionally pretty, friendly, and tuneful canary. (approach Sherman quietly and calmly and he'll reward you with a sweet call or two). The rooms are pretty and spacious. The gym has nice equipment. Free group yoga class was excellent. Nearby restaurants and diversions abound. We particularly liked the seafood and coral-reef themed aquarium at Jax across the street and breakfasts at Union Station -- which is just half a block away.The desk staff, valet staff, and even the gym staff were all really smart, helpful, and attentive.  They seemed happy there. When the staff seem to like their jobs, that usually seems to us to be a good indicator that we'll like the place as well. We really liked the Oxford, even on a trip where we had to hate the weather.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The staff made my day!,"Headed to Colorado for my first time ever and didn't know where to stay.  A colleague recommended The Oxford Hotel, so I booked.  I have never stayed anywhere that I felt so welcomed and at home.  The staff tended to my every need with graciousness but took it a step further.  Dave and Stewart treated as a long lost friend, shuttled me to my meetings when near by and just went the extra mile throughout my stay.  The hotel is nice, it's older, but these guys are why I'll return to The Oxford Hotel next month.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Possibly the best hotel experience I've had to date,"The Oxford is staffed by true professional hotel staff, most of whom are dressed up with white shirts and bow ties. Every question, request or comment had a friendly, helpful response, and sometimes help was offered before we even asked. The location is convenient to many restaurants and city sites. The hotel offers free shuttle service upon request within 2 miles of the hotel. That covers a lot of sites in Denver! We only used it once, to get to church past the Capitol  on time. Other than that one trip, we walked to restaurants, the Capitol / Art Museum area, the convention center—occasionally taking the free 16th Street Mall Bus. Whether you're a guest of the hotel, or not, the Oxford Hotel is a Denver destination you don't want to miss. The beautiful wood-paneled lobby, the historic ""Queen Mary"" Cruise Lounge, famous artwork, old bathrooms - ladies, ask your man to let you in to see the famous urinals in the men's room, and men, see if your lady will escort you to the ladies room, which used to be a barber shop. Ask any of the staff what there is to see here. The stained glass wall in McCormick's and the stained glass ceiling in what used to be the speakeasy private room are beautiful! I have to mention that the carpet in the two elevators is changed every night to remind you what day of the week it is every day! Did I mention complimentary (to hotel guests) Colorado whisky tastings and port tastings later in the evening?",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Oxford is the place for breakfast,"The Oxford Hotel is one of those properties that flourished in the days of the Union Station in downtown Denver when rail travel was king. It was built in 1891. When rail travel waned, that portion of downtown fell into disrepair. The Oxford was a run down flop house. Then, some 35 years ago, new owners moved in and began renovations. At that time the entire Lodo area was experiencing a resurgence. Today the Oxford is the reincarnation of what it was over 100 years ago. What we enjoy about the Oxford is the way they do breakfast in McCormick's. Whether you arrive at 6:30 AM when the doors open for service, or roll in just before 10:30 AM (when breakfast service transitions to lunch service) you can be assured you will receive excellent service by the staff and amazing food from the kitchen. We like to take the lite rail into downtown and walk past the historic buildings to the Oxford. If you are driving you can let the valet park your car or use the public parking just around the corner of the same block (just across the street from Union Station). The dining room is elegant with rich dark woods, simple chandeliers and perimeter lighting. You feel like you have gone back to an earlier time. The staff is very attentive and will get you started with juices and water as well as dropping off menus and describing any specials or offering recommendations upon request. We particularly enjoy the omelettes and benedicts (they will poach your egg to your preference). But the menu is extensive and has something for everyone's tastes. The coffee if full flavored and robust, served in large coffee cups. The servers do a good job keeping it warm for you. The cost is a little higher than some breakfast places, but you can have a great meal for between $11 and $17. We think this is a bargain. We typically get there after the breakfast rush and have the room to ourselves with few other guests. The service is great and we can just relax and take our time with no rush to turn the table. Of course the restaurant is also a five star dinner option in the evening, but that is another story. Make sure you try breakfast at the Oxford when the opportunity arises. You will not go wrong.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic hotel with fantastic people,"This hotel has to have so many stories.  It's been a hotel for over a century, and has all the charm you'd expect.  Every part of this property has been designed to make you comfortable.  The people opening the doors for you are very nice and have tons of good suggestions on what to do in Denver.  The people at the desk remember you and I was surprised how quickly they knew which room I was in when I dropped off the key as I headed out for the night.  They did a whiskey tasting in the evening, and knew all about the Colorado whiskey they poured. When I asked a question they didn't know, they went and found out so they could tell me before we left for dinner.  Impressive.  Add to that the great drivers who took us to dinner and gave us great advice on other places to eat, and I can't think of any way at all the staff needs to improve, they have this complete nailed.The hotel has a cocktail bar that opened the day after Prohibition, and it's a great place to meet people in the evening to have well-mixed drinks.  The newly renovated Union Station with all of its great restaurants and pubs is half a block away, making it easy to grab lunch  while walking around LoDo.  There's a good espresso spot on the same block.  Everything is really convenient and walkable from here.The location and the history make this hotel a good place to stay, but it's really the people here that will make me come back.  I don't think I remember staying anywhere before that I left thinking how nice everyone was, and how much good advice I got from them, and how much better that made the entire trip.  Thanks Hotel Oxford!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Location With Lots Of Charm,"This Oxford is like you've stepped back in time 50+ years.  If you're into vintage hotels, this is a great one. The location to many restaurants, Coors Field, etc. is awesome!  If you're looking for modern, this hotel is not for you.  The rooms are clean and modest but do not have some of the more luxurious features you may be accustomed to in this price-point.  We would definitely stay again. A+!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Make this hotel your place to stay while in Denver,"The Hotel Oxford is an historical hotel located in the LoDo section of Denver. The rooms are larger than chain hotels, the lobby is a wonderful place to relax or meet with friends. However, it is the staff that make this a great hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Not good,"The bar, lobby, and staff are fine but the rooms are horrible. No temperature control in your room. There is a thermostat but it's just a prop. Everything in the rooms are tired and dated. Rooms aren't that clean either. It's an old place so it's like staying at your grandmas but worse.",1
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Wonderful Stay, Beautifully Furnished, Terrific Staff.","Wonderful 3 night stay at The Oxford. Neat history, beautifully furnished, incredible lobby, literally spent hours there visiting with friends. Room was neat, clean, and comfortable. Close to Union Station and all the great places near Coors Field. Staff was terrific, very helpful, valet parking was convenient, and the complimentary shuttle was awesome. We really liked this place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Beauty of Place and A Fine Visit,"The staff was wonderful and friendly.  Bed was incredibly comfortable. Nice touch, offering robes and bourbon tasting each nitght.   Great vibe to the  entire place.  And the lobby bar is the coolest ever!  Only down side was that the shower was a little weird and didnt seem to work quite right.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Spot on historic charm,"I love how the Oxford has maintained its historic identity. From the real door keys to lovely fireplace in the lobby. The hotel staff were warm, welcoming and helpful. Our experience was dreamy and we can't wait to get the chance to go again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Nice place, well located","Stayed just a night but really enjoyed it, right in the center of Denver, shortly before the Superbowl so everyone was in a good mood. Nice bar, comfortable clean room, very helpful staff, valet parking.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Pleasure,"The staff from the Valet service to the front desk are awesome.  The rooms are verycomfortable, clean & unique. I would highly recommend this hotel and the spa services.There is plenty of restaurant options within walking distance. Check out Union Stationwhile you are there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Time in Denver,"We enjoyed staying in the LoDo district and walking to my conference.The staff was super friendly and enjoyable. We appreciated the bourban hour. The restaurant and bar in the hotel were excellent and convenient.  Nearby coffee shops, breweries and Union Station were all nearby and an enjoyable walk. We thought the room was very charming and certainly fit the classic old Denver feel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Ideal stay in every way!,The Oxford Hotel is the absolute perfect choice for a trip to Denver. The location was perfect! The hotel itself has maintained its historic integrity and the staff was so helpful and made us feel very welcome! Will be where I stay from now on...,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent Staycation!,"We spent three nights at The Oxford to celebrate a birthday, and it was fabulous!  Staying here is like going back in time, in terms of the historic nature of the hotel and antique furnishings as well as the customer service experience with the staff.  Turning the tasseled key into the front desk when headed out made for making brief personal connections with the staff who'd remember details about you when you returned (""how was the symphony?"") that made you feel valued as a guest.  The bourbon and cordial hours in the evenings were a highlight, plus the food and beverage available from the attached McCormick's and Cruise Room.  Only downside to our stay was completely out of the hands of the hotel: it was St. Patrick's Day weekend, which was a bit crazy with the parade outside on Saturday and the Running of the Green on Sunday.  We're not late risers so was actually kind of fun to watch the activity out our window, but those hoping for a relaxing sleep-in on a weekend would have been out of luck.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lovely old hotel in great location with a wonderful staff,Stayed here for Kenny Chesney concert at mile high stadium. Enjoyed the shuttle service around town. The valets (Stuart) were very helpful in directing us where to get tailgating supplies. Enjoyed the nightly Bourbon tasting. We would definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best service and staff anywhere I've ever stayed,"Classic restored older hotel with excellent and friendly staff who will bend over backward to fill any request you may have. Rooms are large, high ceilings, and well-appointed in the old traditional style. Spa and gym in hotel, and great restaurant attached. Cadillac Escalade service within 2 miles is an added bonus if you arrive without a car at Union Station across the street, or use the valet parking. Great variety of local attractions and eateries within walking distance. I cannot think of anything I would change about this place, and will be returning in late April for another stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Very cool hotel,We have stayed at the Oxford Hotel in Denver many times and have always had a fabulous time. Attentive staff and valets; antique style furniture throughout the property; the Cruze Room all add up to cool urban getaway.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic Hotel,Definitely one of my favorite hotels in Denver. The service is great. I LOVE the old world charm. The Cruise Room ( bar off the lobby) is also one of my favorites. The cocktails are unique and I love the atmosphere- It does get pretty crowded during peek times.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,High Class in Mile High City,"This hotel was absolutely amazing. Very old school glam, with keys you leave behind the desk and beautiful big rooms with nice furniture and a sitting area. The bathrooms are huge and very clean - towels are soft and fresh. The staff was 5-star - its clear they value customer service. The bellmen were really helpful - driving us around the city as a courtesy and helping us with airport transportation, etc. They have a bourbon hour, and a port hour. The restaurant is connected to McCormicks and therefore the room service is delicious - I ordered the Denver omelet and it could have easily fed 3 people.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,I am the captain! ,"I am writing this review based solely on the bell captain Leo, he was simply awesome.. Don't get me wrong the hotel itself is beautiful,the service is impeccable, and the location is perfect, getting around gets a little tricky with the one ways, but it's downtown, it's expected. Anyways back to Leo, he was one of those people you instantly felt at ease with, he was knowledgeable, and who needs Google maps with Leo around,he told you exactly how to get to wherever you headed to. Awesome stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Overall a great hotel!,"We had a great stay at The Oxford Hotel. The staff was very welcoming and attentive to our needs. The hotel is in the perfect location by Union Station, Coors Field and 16th street mall. The Oxford has a great historic feel with updated amenities and very comfortable beds. We would definitely recommend staying at The Oxford Hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Great Experience,"Our daughter got married last weekend and after doing a search for a good venue she decided that the Oxford would be a great location for the family event.  We reserved rooms there for family and friends and a large room at the hotel was used as the venue for the marriage event, The old and beautiful hotel is located in an interesting and vibrant part of Denver.  The hotel rooms were very nice and the large room where the marriage took place was very interesting.  (The hotel was built in the late 1800s and long ago the large room was apparently utilized for horse stables.  It doesn't look like that now!)  The staff of the hotel was consistently wonderful -- from the folks at the front desk to the bell staff to the people who cleaned the rooms. Everyone in our party (approximately 45 people) had a magnificent time.  We highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Downtown Retreat,"We have stayed at The Oxford several times. Prices have increased since Union Station has been refurbished but it is still worth the price. This historic hotel with updated amenities is in the heart of the city. Walking distance to Coors Field, Pepsi Center, Larimer Square, 16th Street Shopping District. They also have a complimentary car for transportation.  Very comfortable beds and lobby. Delicious coffee in the halls in the mornings. The only negative is that the streets can be noisy outside. No different than any downtown hotels. The hotel itself is very quiet but with the many bars and restaurants in the area it can be loud outside between 2 and 3 a.m. The Oxford is one of my favorite places to stay in downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Stay!,"We had a great stay at the Oxford and they accommodated our large group very well. We also found the Bell Captain, Leo, to be very knowledgeable of Denver and gave us plenty of good info on what to do with our time. Enjoyed our time and will be revisiting the Oxford on our next trip to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,So happy we chose the Oxford,"There are many hotels in Denver- many very cool hotels. But we booked just one night at the Oxford hotel and we are so happy we did! It is an extremely historic hotel right in the heart of the LoDo and so is walking distance to just about everything. The bellhop Leo was extremely helpful with our bags, parking and recommendations for good eats- of which there are many options.  The room was spacious and old but really nicely updated and classic feeling.  No doubt we will stay there again when we are again in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lots of charm,"I stayed 1 night at the Oxford Hotel while traveling on business. It is a great-looking hotel in downtown Denver, and bills itself as the oldest hotel in the city. The lobby was beautiful and when you check in at the front desk, they give you an actual key with a long tassel attached. You have the ability to leave the key at the front desk as you come/go since it won't fit in your pocket, and can retrieve it from the front desk when you return with a picture ID. The elevator was small so if you had more than 2-3 people in your party with luggage you might have to take separate elevators to get to your rooms. The room was decorated tastefully and included windows that looked down onto the street. The wood floors beneath the carpet squeaked every time anyone walked across the room, so I imagine that couldn't have been pleasant for anyone staying in a room adjacent either. The bathroom was quite small, and the only toiletries provided were either bolted to the wall in the shower (shampoo, conditioner, & body wash in pump bottles) or provided in travel size in a box for a $29 fee. The room included a Keurig with limited condiments and also an ""honor bar"" which included a couple bottles of water (for ""free"") and various snacks for an inflated charge each. Room service was also available, with an additional service charge and delivery fee. For the nightly rates charged by the hotel (including a $15 ""services and amenities"" fee per night) for a ""classic"" room, it would be nice not to be charged for every other little thing that is normally included at other hotels at no additional charge.The thermostat in the room did nothing to help bring the temperature down; since it's only February I imagine only the heater was actually functioning. The ""fan"" would turn on/off but did little to make the room more comfortable. Also the door to the room did not seal tightly, so the lights from the outside hallway were visible all the way around the door frame the entire night--a problem if you like to have a dark room when sleeping.For the rates charged for rooms here, I would prefer to stay at another downtown hotel with better amenities. For the experience of staying in Denver's oldest hotel, I appreciate the opportunity but I feel like I would have been more comfortable somewhere else.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Service,"We had a lovely stay at the historic Oxford Hotel in downtown Denver, near the Union Station.  The hotel was very nice, and they have an Escalade to deliver you, or pick you up within a 2.5 mile radius.  That came in very handy for our party of 7 people.  We really enjoyed the wood-burning fireplace in the lobby each evening.  Kuddos to staff member, Leo Krizan, who made sure the we had a pleasant stay. He is a great asset to the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Vacation with friends ,"Lovely hotel!!!! Great amenities, love the decor and the service was top notch!!! We went to Trivoli Brewery and the hotel service dropped us off and picked us up which made it extremely easy for us to explore the great City of Denver! We would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Step Back in Time,"Located just two blocks away from the newly revitalized Union Station, our stay at The Oxford was a refreshing step back in time. The Oxford employees were professional, polite and friendly from the valet and doormen, reception, even through to the maintenance staff – always a smile and every guest is treated like a VIP. Our room was immaculate and modernized just enough to provide the expected amenities, without losing the sense of the location’s history, and the hotel itself is a lovely holiday in the Golden Age of Denver.  Made our stop at The Cruise Bar (loud, but the drinks are oh-so-good) and McCormick’s Fish House and Bar and it was all just perfect. There is no “but” to this review; we’re just working on planning out our next trip to The Oxford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic Old Hotel with an Amazing Staff,"From my greeting upon arrival at the hotel, to my check-in at the front desk, to my visit to the spa, everyone made it clear that I was staying at the oldest hotel in Denver.  Unfortunately, the dated and worn furniture and decorations also made it clear that I was in an old hotel.  However, any complaints about worn furniture are quickly forgotten when faced with the friendliest and most helpful hotel staff in Denver.  Everyone was fantastic! The complimentary car service to anywhere in downtown Denver is most helpful.  And the spa and fitness room are terrific.  The hotel's location also adds to the warm experience.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Lovely decor and friendly service, but","If you have the double deluxe room we did you need a ladder to reach the shower on lever.  If you like tea, then don't be surprised if they send you to the restaurant next door to fetch your own milk (they have creamer only:)). Great location for a family on an enforced detour with the luggage lugging dad with a broken arm it was a dream to see the hotel on exit from the station.  Canary in the birdcage at reception looks a bit in need of a mate.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Simply magnificent,"While on a 3 week road trip around the mountain states - we decided to spend the Christmas period in Denver - at The Oxford Hotel. It was quite simply a flawless experience. The hotel is beautiful - with great history, great location and top class hotel staff. A special mention must go to Bell Captain - Leo. Never have we had such a warm welcome and friendly advice/hints and tips about the area. He's a top pro at his job. If you are planning a trip to Denver - The Oxford Hotel is a must for your itinerary (not least for stunning Art Deco Cruise Room bar).To everyone at The Oxford - we'll see you again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Beautiful hotel , wonderful people!","The Oxford is such a charming hotel but it was the staff, especially Patrick, Bree and Thomas who made it such a nice visit for me.  My room was lovely and quiet, the location, a stone's  through from Union Station, is ideal & the amenities are plentiful.  Yutaka and Leo, the doormen, were also so friendly and welcoming,  I cannot find a fault with this hotel. I loved the antiques and art but it really was the people who made it such a great stay.  The Oxford will always be my first choice in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic Hotel with Wonderful Amenities,"We wanted to do a staycation in Denver so we could spend some time enjoying the downtown area and the Oxford Hotel was a perfect place to call home for the weekend.Starting off, the room rate was very reasonable considering the quality of hotel you are receiving. On top of that, by staying at the Oxford you can receive a discount massage next door (you don't even have to leave the building, they are connected).The rooms themselves are very classy and spacious. There was no problem with noise from anywhere, except maybe the street as we were on the second floor... But hey, that is part of the fun of staying downtown!Every night we would enjoy our complementary whiskey before going out. Also, there is nothing like walking home from a play at the Denver Performance Center only to see the Oxford Hotel sign with Union Station in the background.The staff is amazing and will do whatever is needed to make your stay as perfect as it can be. Can't wait to stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing!! ,This hotel is just wonderful! From the moment you walk in the service is outstanding. I have to give a shout out to Leo who fabulous!! The atmosphere is perfect for a weekend getaway and the uniqueness really makes it stand out. Highly recommend!,5

The location is superbly located across from the railway station and is right in the middle of dozens of restaurants, etc.  Every staff experience was friendly and professional.  I can't wait to stay there again when I'm in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Classic, Classy Hotel in Happening part of Denver","Step back in time, to the era of classic architecture and service in a downtown hotel, then step out in to the fun arts and fun district of Denver.  Train from airport will start in April, right to the Hotel, and steps from Coors field.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great visit. A lesson for hotel operators! ,These guys got it right. Take something historic and treat it like it should be. We didn't get to try the restaurants but Leo was great out front when you pull up and the great service continued. Room was very clean and comfortable. It was on the smaller side but it's what you expect in an old Hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A step back in time...,Have you ever wondered what it was like to stay in an elegant residential hotel at the turn of the century? Well the Oxford Hotel can take you there. Wonderful restored historic landmark with all the modern conveniences and old world hospitality. Great location. Exceptional experience. Wonderful service. Am going there for second trip now. See you there.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful!,I was in a room with a comfy four poster bed with an amazing feather filled comforter. The robe was extra thick and warm. We had no issues when we asked for extra pillows. The martinis in the Cruise Room were fantastic! We had a great meal at McCormick's too.This is an old building so don't expect the same type of stay you would get at a modern hotel. This is a great place for Denver history seekers too. The location is convenient for traveling with the train station across the street and the shuttle buses close by for 16th Street. The antiques and decorations are fantastic! I believe each room is unique so there isn't a way to recommend a specific type of room. There is a ton of restaurants to choose from downtown from expensive to cheap. I highly recommend the restaurants near and in Larimer Square.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Last minute getaway,"The valet parking was simple, the bell captain Leo was a huge help with information on restaurants and the hotel is in a perfect location for Lodo. The beds are so comfortable you almost don't want to get out. This is going to be our go to hotel ever time we go to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel with an even better price!,I was recently in Denver and booked my trip with Hoprocket.com. A friend of mine referred me to this site and I'm glad she did! I saved $67 a night by booking through their site. My boyfriend and I were also able to save 25% off of our ski passes and gear rental through their HopShop! Great way to see Denver and save some extra cash for a nice night on the town!,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great Staff, Classic Hotel","We enjoyed our trip to the Oxford Hotel.  The hotel is located in downtown Denver and is within walking distance to many attractions of the city and great restaurants.  The bellman and front desk staff were always helpful, providing suggestions and information about the surrounding area.  The room was nice, but small.  The TV's are much older - not up to date.  The bathroom was nice, but only has one sink and had both a shower and a tub, which could have been redesigned for larger and better amenities.  It's a little odd having an old-time key but was fun none the less (and they look great at check-in!).  One major plus, they offered a free bourbon bar from 5:30-6:30pm with a small pour of a local Colorado bourbon/whiskey - so much fun!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Historical Richness, Extraordinary Staff","When compared with it's sister hotel, The Crawford, the Oxford hotel seems quaint at first.  While the lobby has a stunning elegance to it - the yellow canary in the cage by the front desk gives it a magical, back-in-time feeling, there are touches that seem...outdated, even in this historical place.  Our room had been minimally updated and left us wanting, though it was fun to feel like we were back in the early 1900's.  The bathroom, on the other hand, was classic in all the right ways - my husband and I were able to take a bath together in the claw-footed tub, probably the most magical memory of the whole night.  The beds were comfy and clean, and check-in - with old fashion tassel keys - was easy perfection.  I was lucky enough to have a spa treatment - the Almond Joy - and loved every minute of my treatment, which took place in a delightful, robin's egg blue room that felt like a tiny little cave of enchantment.  My therapist rubbed me raw with coconut scrub, painted me with chocolate and then wrapped me up like a burrito, all while keeping a professional and chipper attitude.  While it is strange to walk out of your treatment and down a flight of stairs where shoppers could perhaps glance your -ahem, ancient goodies - the jazzy, nostalgic locker rooms were worth the walk.  Updating historical rooms can be difficult, especially when you are speaking about the oldest hotel in Denver. The Oxford, however, has found it's sweet spot; they excel in making a flawless experience through their extraordinary staff. From Leo, the bellman, who remembered our name, suggested restaurants and chatted casually with us every time left to our front desk check-out, eveyr interaction was friendly and bright. I ordered a cheeseburger at 10:30 at night, not realizing that it wasnt' even on the menu. Within 20 minutes it was delivered to my door, and I swear to you now - it was the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life.   They might not be modern, but the staff at the Oxford made our experience positively timeless.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Quaint,"Very nostalgic, in the heart of lower downtown of Denver.  Within walking distance to many good restaurants and night life!  Rooms are clean, but small!  A nice bar and spa are attached to the hotel!  Good value for the money!  A nice gathering place for families!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming Hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the helpful employees really made the difference. Highest compliments go to Leo, Bell Captain, and the car service driver, Yutaka.  They were so helpful with suggestions of restaurants etc. and always so cheerful.  Offering a free car service within a couple miles of hotel was a great plus. Rooms were charming. One minor issue we booked thru Hotels.com and they said the request for a king size bed did not go thru ??? Never a problem before. But the staff made up for it. Definitely recommend!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing Hotel,"We come out to Denver once a year for a trade show. It's a must for us to stay at the Historic Oxford Hotel. The staff is amazing, especially Leo who is always full of suggestions for places to eat and things to do in town. Tom who works the late night shift at the front desk is always a pleasure as well.Can't wait for next years stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Comfy,"This vintages boutique property is very elegant and warm. Service is excellent, great history. My favorite thing is their courtesy transportation, very prompt, friendly and professional. Second, loved the Sanitas SPA adjunct to the property. Rooms always cleaned, water and snacks provided. Made my stay very enjoyable.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Location, Location, Location","This hotel is perfect for a quick stop in town for the big game or a nice long relaxing vacation. Located in the heart of the LoDo District, this hotel is half block away from the union station and located right in the mist of about 20 different dining locations. With a full bar downstairs how could you possibly go wrong.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great accomodations - amazing staff!,"The staff here truly make your stay memorable. Stuart, Andy and Dave at the front door, Zach at the front desk and Ashley, Paris and the other ladies in the spa really made us feel special.  Our stay exceeded our expectations because of the individuals in the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Like Living in an Earlier Luxurious Era,"If you like modern, cookie-cutter hotels, stop reading and go somewhere else! This hotel is for true travelers who love experiencing something different. Everything has been renovated and restored to 1890-1930s elegance. Much of the furniture and art is original to the hotel's past glory days. The character is incredible! The beds are comfortable, there are tons of pillows, and the bathrooms are just plain cool! People who say this place has seen better days don't understand the glory of a true restoration!The friendly, attentive staff complete the luxurious experience. Free bourbon,a town car to drive you around LoDo, wonderful room service, a wood burning fireplace in the lobby! I'm coming back! Soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Always a treat,"I can't say enough good things about the Oxford. This is THE place to stay in Denver. The rooms are fantastic, the staff is friendly, the amenities are world-class. Free bourbon tasting in the lobby in the evening, great coffee in the morning, close to everything you want to see in LoDo",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Lobby Fireplace Says It All,"It's not big enough to park a Volkswagen in, but the fact that it's there, and that it functions perfectly, is a major factor to the guest (such as myself, recently) who enters the Oxford for a two-night stay in January. (It's the only fireplace legally allowable in any downtown Denver hotel.)  This was a family reunion of sorts, so we were in the Presidential Suite plus an adjoining bedroom, but I'm pretty sure you don't have to stay on their high end to experience the Oxford's marvellous hospitality in full. Even a breakfast for six didn't bother the room service staff, and the hotel's Cadillac Escalade definitely came in handy on more than one occasion.  The Cruise Room is an art déco masterpiece, and even though some might consider it to be at aesthetic odds with the look and feel of the rest of the hotel, it only intensified my longing for those days when details mattered. To close on a possibly sexist-piggish note, it must be said that the Oxford doormen (Leo, Stu, Nick & Andy) are as hot as the Oxford lobby is warm. And that's a lot!ROBIN SUTHERLAND  Principal Pianist  San Francisco Symphony",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Night in the City,"Gorgeous property, antique feel but excellently maintained.  1/2 block from Union Station, easy walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants.  For slightly longer distances (within 2 miles), the hotel provides a courtesy shuttle.  All-around great experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Awesome stay!,"At 20 years old, this was my first look at a real luxury historical hotel. The room was great, could've used a bigger TV but we weren't in the room much anyways. The valet drivers Daniel & Nick were more than great. They have room service and will pretty much take care of anything you possibly need. Also, they were pretty intelligible about all of the things to do in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Over rated and Over priced,"Wife and I spent New Year's eve here recently, and brought our small dog as it is advertised as pet friendly.  They promise bowls for food and water along with dog treats upon arrival.  It took their staff 2 hours, after several phone calls, to finally accommodate our dog. The hotel room itself had issues.  First, a dinosaur of a Phillips flat screen T.V. was set on a piece of furniture blocking one of the beautiful windows so that the view of Union Station was obscured.  The bathroom had inadequate room to place toiletries.  As for the shower, good luck if you are bigger than me at 5' 11'' and 195 lbs. in moving around inside of it.  There are nicer hotels for less money in the Denver downtown area.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fourth anniversary + we loved the proximity to Union Station,"Oxford's proximity to Union Station is wonderful. We came for an overnight and enjoyed our room upgrade but especially eating a late dinner at Mercantile (and coffee the next morning) and then strolled half a block back to bed.We ordered room service for breakfast, first time ever, and thought it was yummy and charming. Our encounters with the staff in the lobby were very pleasant, they clearly have a customer focus, and the lobby had just been decorated in a grand style for Christmas (on November 5th). My husband sat by the roaring fire for an hour while reading a newspaper and he loved that.The reason I've left off a star is because the rooms are a bit tired (or old fashioned or grand - very heavy crimson and gold drapery and yellow walls). I'm not down on the Oxford for this, it's an old building and I realize a multimillion dollar reno is not necessarily feasible. But having dry lukewarm air blow on us all night in lieu of heating did make me thankful for my radiant heat at home. The shower curtain was too small. Not things that ruined the visit - we had a special time and I would recommend to anyone - but something that keeps it from being top notch. The new Crawford might have a few of those details shored up, but you'll pay for them.I shopped long and hard for downtown hotels and thought this is the best value.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Step Back in Time,"Travel back to a time when things were much simpler.  No digital key cards or big lobbies with dozens of elevators.  A time when staff were knowledgeable, personable and caring for their guests.  These are just some of the special quirks that encompass a stay at The Oxford Hotel in LoDo.  This is the oldest hotel in Denver and it absolutely maintains its charm.  From Leo and the rest of his team always ensuring the door is held open or the fire has been stoked to the charm of the subway tile in the bathrooms, The Oxford Hotel is an absolute treasure.  If you want creature comforts and just another hotel then don’t stay here. Go to the Ritz Carlton or a Marriott somewhere away from it all.  If you want a truly memorable experience in one of the best locations in Denver then The Oxford Hotel is for you.  Bonus: Steps from Union Station and The 16th Street Mall!",5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Top of the line service,"This place is amazing. The whole staff is trained extremely well and truly go the extra mile to ensure you have a great stay. I felt at home during my stay, and I can't wait to go back! To top it all off, the hotel is in a great location!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great location and beautiful hotel!,"My husband and I chose this hotel for a New Years Eve trip and really enjoyed it! The biggest plus is the location. We were walking distance from so many great restaurants and downtown attractions (awesome little coffee shop next door, very close to Union Station, etc). The room was very charming and comfortable. I loved the unique details in our room and the hotel as a whole. Plus a great bar in the lobby! Everyone working at the hotel was friendly and welcoming. The only drawback is the lack of vanity space/mirrors. We only had 1 small mirror in the bathroom and no vanity space. Other than that, we loved this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful charming hotel full of character - but loud squeaking floors!,"I decided to go for a more boutiquey hotel in Denver and the Oxford ticks all the boxes when it comes to charms and character.  Beautifully decorated lobby with a huge Christmas tree.  Check out the mezzanine level where there is an old ""office"" equipped with a desk and a typewriter that you can use to type up letters (and the hotel will post them).  A really nice touch of how we used to communicate with each other before modern technology sets in!I would love to provide a higher rating but with ""charms"" and ""character"" comes the squeaking floors and if you are unfortunate enough to have an upstairs neighbour who appears to enjoy walking in their room late at night and early in the morning, then you are not going to get a good night sleep.  The walls are also thin and you can hear the conversation that people are having along the corridor.  Also, the shower in my bathroom wasn't working - so I had to take a bath (which would have been nice anyway but for the fact that the hair from the previous occupants were still stuck against the bath tub).  I mentioned this to the manager and he very quickly rectified the situation.  By the time I got back to the room later that day, the said shower was working but my view is they should have checked, prior to the guests arrival, that everything is working properly (and really there is no excuse for not cleaning the bath tub properly).The hotel also charges a standard $10 fee every day which includes wifi and the use of the gym etc.  So it is not really free wifi.So this is a very charming boutique hotel full of character.  Will I stay there again?  In all likelihood no.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Awesome and historic location, average(ish) room","Loved the location--close to Union Station and other historic Denver locations. On a cold New Year's night, it was nice to go back to a quaint room with a really nice bed. I loved laying and bed and thinking about the history of this hotel and this very room. We also loved the bourbon tasting from 5:30-6:30. A first for us! What brought it down to average was the lack of ability to control room temperature over night. There was a ""thermostat"" in the room but it had no affect on either the fan or the room temp. It stayed hot and stuffy the whole night (and the outside temp got down to about 10 degrees). Also the TVs need to be upgraded. To change the channel we got out of bed and held the remote a few inches from the TV. That seemed to work (I know, life is tough, isn't it?).",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Colorado Trail Thru-Hike Basecamp,"Wanna Thru-Hike the Colorado Trail? Relying on public transportation? Arriving by AMTRAC or air? Is your Day One trail objective, mission critical? The Oxford Doormen are your problem solvers!   Maybe it is 35 plus miles to the trailhead. Fact: there are lodging accommodations within four (4) miles of the trailhead.  The Oxford doormen will hire you a car, for the exact departure time you request, at a reasonable fare. The hotels closest to the Trailhead..... well they have trouble even calling you a cab or solving your schedule issue.  Lucky for me, I came to Denver two months prior to sort out and qualify the required supply chain. Reservations at other hotels were canceled. A personal visit to the Oxford demonstrated confidence in their ability to meet special needs.What makes the Oxford different is that they have authentic customer service, not some marketing department standard obsequious eagerness phrase. The Oxford doormen solve problems. As far the normal details, The Oxford is an authentic 1880's hotel with great everything.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nice but with the New Year's Eve premium?,"We live in the burbs, stayed here to enjoy Denver's New Year's Eve offerings. We've stayed at other Denver luxury hotels for the same occasion.The things we liked:- Location! A block from Union Station and a few from 16th street mall to watch the fireworks. This was extra lovely given the night's sub-zero temperatures.- Standard room was adequately spacious, the bed was comfy and firm.- Holiday decor: Classic and cozy with cheerful warmth,wood-burning fireplace in lobby.- Good breakfast (not included) at on-site restaurant.- Unique feel, nooks for sitting and reading. Not your standard hotel chain fare.- Large, well-fitted work-out gym (they add required $10 daily facilities fee).- Free Wi-Fi .The things we didn't care for:- Our room was on the same floor as conference rooms, business center, access to the spa and fitness center, and next to the stairs. It felt like we were getting the bottom- of-the-barrel room.-  Single paned windows--noisy and challenging to manage the room's temperature.-  Bathroom tiny--small shower with wimpy stream, small vanity--no room for a couple's sundries.- Lackluster service -- desk staff seemed apathetic.- $40 for parking.- Hard to get to the gym and then back to the room (elevator locked for going up). Could always go outdoors and around, but an unwelcome option at 10 degrees Fahrenheit.Was it worth the $450.00 we paid (incl. taxes & parking)?No.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic and a great escape,"I'm so good about reviewing all of my out-of-town hotels and I totally forgot that my husband and I spend a night at the Oxford every year for my birthday.  So clearly I enjoy the hotel and the experience.  At Christmas, when the lobby is decorated to the nines, it's especially beautiful.  It's only a block from the newly-revamped Union Station, and we take the light rail from suburbia for our one-night getaway.  I adore this place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,How To Be Killed With Kindness in Denver,"Our entire experience from arrival to departure was amazing. The hotel staff was exceptionally kind and attentive to all of our needs. Did I mention how kind they were? The facilities were top notch, very  beautiful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Our favorite hotel in Denver,"The Oxford is a European style boutique hotel with every modern convenience. The rooms are lovely. The bathrooms are modern yet in keeping with the decor. The staff at the Oxford is extrodinarily helpful, knowledgable and pleasant. A sherry in front of a roaring fire on a chilly December day is hard to beat!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect Wedding,"We choose the Oxford for our Wedding this last June, and could not have been happier with how professional the staff were during the planning phase. Every detail was carefully taken care of on the day of our wedding. Leading up to our wedding we stopped in from time to time to show our family and friends the venue. Each and every time we came to the hotel the front desk and bell staff were more than accommodating. Each time we asked to see the space (months and weeks before our wedding) one of the staff members would graciously take 15-20 minutes out of their day to show us around the hotel, and each of them offered a unique history of the hotel. It was like a guided tour each time we brought someone in to see the hotel. The wedding itself was exactly what we had pictured it would be, including the amazing food served the night of our wedding. We will be back to celebrate for years to come!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Oxford Hotel,"Excellent time together! Christmas time was a perfect time to go, beautiful Victorian decorations! Wonderful staff. Comfy, clean, beautiful room. It was near union station, ice rink, many great restaurants, walked everywhere!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming Denver Hotel,"I booked this hotel as an anniversary night out for my husband and I who are locals based on reviews and location (near Union Station). The hotel is small, quaint, and has some cool history. The lobby and Christmas decor are the highlights. I really loved the real keys to the rooms and the typewriter on the second floor where you can write yourself a letter to be mailed to you as a keepsake of the trip. The staff was friendly and we were promptly checked in. Based on photos I saw online I had expected more from the room. I was disappointed in the size and the fact that our window looked directly at another very close building. No way of knowing which way you were even looking. Reminded me of a friend's apartment in NYC. There was no reason to keep the blinds open to just look at brick. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were awful. Way too soft and essentially served no point. We chose the hotel because it reminded us of the one we stayed at in London on our Honeymoon. It did help us feel like we went back in time to that which was nice but overall I was disappointed. We were most disappointed in the result of an item we left in our room after checkout. It was a simple item but something that should have been an easy fix to get back. There is no question we left it there. At this point, it has still not been located which I find hard to believe. The staff has tried to be helpful and responsive but bottom line is that the item (a vest) has still not been located. Just leaves me wondering and questioning which is unfortunate. Not the way I wanted to end the experience. Overall, its a great hotel for people visiting Denver but if you want a view of the city or at least something to look at, you need to express that (or you'll get a brick wall), and if you are going for the lowest rate, which will still be pricey, expect a super small room and no motivation for really spending time in it. You're better off hanging out somewhere else. For us that defeats the point of a night out away from home just 30 minutes away. I don't think we would plan on going back. It was a step above Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs (cool history and general feel) but nowhere near the quality of the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs (no comparison on any front). Overall, we were underwhelmed.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,History and Luxury,Be sure to explore the different areas of the hotel. Especially the Cruise Room. It's a real special bar with great drinks and service. Leo and the valet crew can be helpful and take advantage of the free CADILLAC Escalade service within two miles of the hotel. The Oxford is situated in the heart of downtown and the front desk can give you tips on must see sites.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great location/ disappointing rooms,We reserved 2 rooms.  One a junior suite and the other a superior.  The hotel itself was great but the furniture in the junior suite was worn and cheap.  I liked the square footage but overall it was very dreary. There was no view and I was told all the junior suites faced inward The worn cheap decor made it almost seedy. Overall we enjoyed our stay even with the dull room but I will definitely try another hotel next time as it wasn't worth the cost.,3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Super Stay,"We stayed one night for an extended date night.  I was very pleased with this hotel.  Service was friendly and top notch.  The room was comfortable and cozy.  They are going for an old school hotel experience from early last century and it's quite nice.  Definitely recommend.  The only issue I had was the temperature control in the room wasn't very responsive, but for a 100+ year old building, I suppose that's expected.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing Experience in a Classic Property,"Booked a room for our anniversary and had a wonderful experience.  I called to request an early check in since we had also booked massages that afternoon and they let me know they had upgraded our room and they would have it ready for us.  Our upgraded room was a Premium Classic which had an ultra comfortable king bed, tons of pillows, two side chairs, two chests and side tables plus an upgraded tiled bathroom with a deep claw foot tub and a separate shower.   It also had a view of some buildings, lights, and the relatively quiet street below.  The hotel is a classic building that has been well maintained.  Loved the doorman who had a great story about Harrison Ford as we were picking up our car from valet.  Front desk staff very friendly and helpful.  Lobby was warm with a fire and a floor to ceiling tree decorated for the holidays, and beautiful red and teal accents on the wreaths.   Fun touch is the rug in the elevators which are changed daily to reflect the day of the week.  It's an classic hotel from the late 1800s so if you are looking for a brand new everything, look elsewhere.   Ultimately I loved the character of the place.  I also prefer this hotel in LoDo vs. another similar property which is also downtown but not in LoDo.  The Oxford is one block away from the Tattered Cover bookstore and the re-done Union Station as well as the ballpark, tons of great restaurants, and the shuttle to the 16th St. Mall if you want to head to the other end of downtown.  And the friendliness of the staff is definitely different than the other hotel uptown.  While I live in Colorado, I would definitely stay at The Oxford again for a special occasion.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Location!,"We have stayed at The Oxford several times - usually around the holidays.  The location is perfect for us - close to shopping, restaurants and friends.  The decor during the holidays is beautiful and I love the fireplace in the lobby.  A perfect place to sit and have a cup of coffee in the morning or a drink before retiring. The staff is always very friendly and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,great for a staycation,"even though i live in denver, sleeping in an historic and snazzy hotel in town is a decadent treat i cannot pass up. the hotel is done up for the holidays and maintained at a very high level. from the valets when you arrive, through the front desk people and all staff at all levels, a top notch experience. good restaurants and an ideal location to enjoy lower downtown denver.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Loved it!,"Went for business, took my better half, loved the location, loved the style, loved the service, loved the people.  Excellent stay,  usually stay in large chain hotels, not now, will definitely  stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The BEST hotel in the Denver area!,"My husband and I spent the weekend here, and we could not say enough great things about the hotel, the staff and the location.  We were treated like royalty.  The staff went out of their way to make our stay more than memorable. Our room was a junior suite and was absolutely beautiful.  We enjoyed evening drinks in the lobby, and were driven both nights to our dinner locations without fail.  We wanted for nothing and I could not imagine staying anywhere else when we return to Denver again.  The Oxford is by far the BEST hotel not only in the Denver area, but in the US by far!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Never felt more at home - the Oxford,"My husband and I have traveled all over the world and The Oxford is our favorite hotel. The staff is absolutely amazing and goes to all lengths to please their patrons. It starts with top notch valet service and help with bags, which brings you to the lobby - so cozy and the holiday decorations were out of this world! We always take advantage of the shuttle service in the downtown area (especially when it's snowing!) Rooms are clean and comfy - elegant but not over the top. We had a mix up with a dinner reservation at the restaurant in the hotel and the front desk manager Bree totally turned our night around and got us an even better reservation and comped us for the inconvenience. This was our third stay at the Oxford and I love it more each time. We will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Top Notch Spa Staff,My husband and I treated ourselves to facials and massages. The facials with Michelle were amazing!! She has a wonderful touch because she is also a massage therapist there  We also had Carolina for massage  she too was very good. Beautiful quaint historic hotel,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great place - lives up to reputation ,I had a strange feeling - then I thought ok- hotel from 1890's - could be hauntedI did not read up on that part of the hotel when I decided to book.Sometime in the middle of the night I woke up to the sound of boots - clonking on the ceiling above me- thought it was a dream But at 5:00am I woke up and heard it again-Then I wondered - I am on the 5 th and top floor what was going on?It turns out I am exactly 2 floors up from infamous room 320 in room 520Totally awesome!Bed was great Clean and comfortable and very helpful staff especially doorman,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Historic, comfortable and great location","If you are looking for a true Denver experience...this is the place for you! The staff at this hotel are courteous and very professional.  We stayed in the Superior Classic room 208.  The rooms are generous in size, with high ceilings and some antique interior still intact.  The bed I am happy to say is very comfortable (upgraded beds since our last stay several years ago).  In this room the bathroom is basic...stall shower and single sink.  It looks like they have kept the original tile and an updated vanity.  Everything was very clean.  I like that the decor was kept in the style of the hotel.  Has a feel of antique but more comfortable.  Free WiFi that was pretty fast.  Desk in the room had convenient plugs and adapters for the business professional.  Coffee in the room was a keurig.  One thing that was really nice (at least at our floor), near the elevators there was a coffee stand if you wanted to grab another cup for your room or to go.  Our visit was during December, the decor in the lobby is lovely.  Big tree, covered in ornaments.  Garland everywhere, life-sized toy soldiers and twinkle lights no matter where you looked.  The location of this hotel is very convenient to everything in the city.  They have a car that will take you about town if needed and pick you up (this is not available at all hotels in Denver).  They also have a full spa which I took advantage of previously, great staff there too.  We had a very good experience at the Oxford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Doll's Tea Party,"For the past 5 years I have enjoyed taking our my granddaughters to the Doll's Tea Party.  It is usually scheduled on the first Sunday in December.  The adults sit at large tables for 8, while the children sit at child size tables by themselves, waiters with white gloves attentively see that their tea cups are filled with hot chocolate, and the kids have marshmellow's, candy canes, fruit, vegetables, banana bread, cupcakes, etc set at each table for them to enjoy.  After the tea, the Arvada ballerina's who are dancing in the Nutcracker come and entertain the girls for a few dances (not too long... just the perfect amount of time), and the girls are entranced.The first year that we went, the adults were offered champagne, gone are those days.  This year we were offered tea.  The canapés, however, were delicious and we had a good time.For the price that is paid (note expensive, and it is NOT brunch food), it would be nice to be offered a glass of champagne.... This celebration does kick off the holiday season, and the children attending have the experience of practicing manners.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Good location, over priced. ","Stayed here with my family to catch the morning train.  Great location for that.  Great staff as well.  You pay for the experience and the history though, not so much the accommodations.  Everything is loud.   Got woke up around midnight by a noisy group returning.  Not the hotels fault but old walls let a lot of noise through.",4

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Outstanding classic hotel and location,"Staying at the Oxford is more of an experience than just lodging, and the staff is the icing on the cake.  Located in what today is the very best part of Denver, you are walking distance from dozens of outstanding restaurants, shops, and of course the jewel in the crown... Union Station.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Cozy stay in the heart of LoDo,"We had a large room on the 5th floor. The beds were very comfortable and the room was kept clean by an excellent housekeeping staff. If we needed anything, the entire staff bent over backwards. They always greeted us coming and going. The valet/doormen were fabulous. And having access to that ""Kardashian"" Escalade was a bonus. But you really can walk almost anywhere in downtown. They had just decorated the lobby for Christmas and it was beautiful and tastefully done. Coffee and newspapers in front of a real fireplace was appreciated on cold mornings. Location near so many eating and drinking establishments made it for us. And the front desk manager, Tiffany, runs a well oiled machine.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great location - Enchanting and relaxing - Fantastic for personal or business travel,"I would highly recommend this hotel to both business and pleasure travelers. The location was perfect, allowing me to take the bus (soon to be the railway) directly to the hip and trendy Union Station, which is less than a block from the hotel.  From there, the bellman took me to where I needed to be with no delays or hesitation.  Although I was there on business, I often forgot this because the hotel's atmosphere is so pleasant and relaxing, from the fireplace in the reception area, to the high ceilings and amazing Holiday decorations.  The staff is so attentive and helpful, and the location is perfect for shopping, restaurants and business.",5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Friendly staff and Loaded with charactor,"Our first stay at the historical Oxford Hotel was so delightful that it will be our hotel for our future stays in Denver. You have to visit the Cruise room for a coctail. But the best part of the stay is how the staff makes you feel very special.My favorite story is how a customer was talking to the receptionist and complaining about everything. It was too dark in her room, the receptionist told her we will bring up another lamp, her room was too cold, so they will bring up more blankets and the engineer will look at the temperature etc. Finally the receptionist said that if this doesnt work we will be glad to move you but you know this will be the third time we have moved you!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Hotel NEVER Disapponts!,"My husband & I have stayed at The Oxford for holidays, Thanksgiving & Christmas.  It is our Art Deco getaway and historic experience.  The staff is always helpful, warm and fun.  They are a big part of why we return to The Oxford.  Always accommodating.  A stay at The Oxford is a luxurious trip back in time, with all amenities of the present!  1 could spend their entire stay on the property alone.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Exceptional in all ways,"Simply a gorgeous, historic hotel in the heart of the LoDo district.  Reasonably priced, a wonderful and attentive staff, quiet and spacious rooms.  They even provide transportation to and from events and restaurants within a 2 mile radius.  Located one block from the beautifully refurbished Union Station that has excellent restaurants, bars and cafés.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Stay Here,"Stayed here one night before heading out on Amtrak's California Zephyr from Union Station which is about one-half block away.  Wonderfully attentive staff in a beautifully restored hotel.  Rooms are large and of course immaculate. Enjoyed the tasting of two local (Colorado) whiskeys and one rum imported by a Coloradian. We were served by a knowledgeable person (wish I knew her name; she had even toured one of the local producers - maybe Stranahans). Very pleasant fire going in the lobby with comfortable seating area.  Many good restaurants within walking distance, but hotel will provide transportation as well if you ask. Could easily picture myself coming back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Loved the Oxford!,"Charming hotel, very attentive staff. Walking distance to many things, courtesy car available for other trips.

Restaurants on site offer great happy hour, after hours and dining.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A lovely boutique hotel in downtown Denver,"I stayed here one night last week with my wife, while we were in Denver for work. She had picked out this hotel without my assistance. We both enjoyed our stay very much, especially the wonderful staff service at the desk and door, and the Victorian feel of the interior common areas. The whole place has a retro feel, with a warm wood library vibe to the lobby and mezzanine areas. Our room was very comfortable, with a large bathroom complete with large tub and standing shower. The central location is great for visitors, since it's a block from Union Station, Wynkoop Brewery and other quality restaurants. There is valet parking available, but if you want to save a few bucks there are parking garages within a block or so.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford stay,What a wonderful hotel! A great location in LoDo and the staff are some of the best that we have ever dealt with. It was great fun to stay in a hotel that was 129 years old and has been so lovingly restored. It makes you wonder what has transpired within those walls. The beds are to die for.Check out the restored Union Station which is only a half a block away for some great restaurants also.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Excellent Boutique style hotel, and top-notch customer service!","The Stay:From walking into doors that were opened for me, to being treated first class as soon as I walked up to the front desk, the Oxford Hotel is an amazing Boutique Style hotel. As soon as you walk in, you feel transported to the 1920's with the look and feel of the rooms and decor.The StaffVery courteous, friendly and fast. Throwing a shout-out to Thomas, Patrick, Hailey Andy, Dave (and forgive me if I missed anyone) for your outstanding customer service.The Dining:If you enjoy a classic martini, bitters, old fashions, etc. then a trip to The Cruise Room (within the hotel) is a must. Excellent service from Aaron the bartender; ask for ""The Vesper"" martini. Another bonus is the free (for guests) Bourbon tasting nightly, with a selection of mostly local Colorado distillery bourbons (and related). A terrific perk, and a great way to unwind after the day, before hitting the town. McCormick's is also a great place to eat for breakfast or dinner, I recommend the Crab Cakes Benedict and ""Buck-a-Shuck"" Oyster nights (Wed.)Additional dining locations (The Snooze for breakfast, The Kitchen for dinner) were recommended by the staff, and far exceeded expectations.The location:Fantastic location for the hotel, right next to Grand Junction train station. Amazing selection of restaurants and close to downtown.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Like coming home.....,"What to say about The Oxford, comfortable rooms with character, convenient to downtown night life and sports venues, steps away from Union Station and the RTD system which gets you from and back to DIA.. ""no fuss, no muss."" Really tho, it is the staff that highlights the establishment. From the doorman, to the front desk, to the guys behind the bar in the Cruise Room all go above and beyond to put you at easr and make you feel welcome. Well, well done all.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Satisfied Guest,"Overall, the Oxford was great! It was the perfect location near the train station, with an amazing complimentary ride to locations within two miles!

I used their transportation and the drivers were friendly and knowledge and made me feel welcome. My room was clean and decorated perfectly. I'll stay here again!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Boutique Hotel with History and Charm!,"I have stayed at The Oxford several times over the years.  It is located in the trendy LoDo (lower downtown) district of Denver, near fabulous restaurants, the Pepsi Center (concerts, Avalanche games, etc), the Performing Arts Center, the 16th Street Mall, Larimer Square and the walking/bike paths along Cherry Creek and the South Platte River.  The Union Station is just one block away with its fabulous cafes and gathering areas as well.  The Oxford is the perfect hotel for a romantic get-away.  Each room is unique in its décor and the bedding is luxurious The staff are very attentive, personable, and friendly.  This hotel will always be my ""go to"" place when I visit downtown Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Loved this hotel -- would stay again!,"I loved this hotel. The location is excellent, the amenities are generous, the spa is wonderful, and the staff are warm, welcoming and very helpful.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful stay,"I Stayed here for a big conference at the Convention Center downtown. I was nervous that this hotel would be slightly far away, but my procrastination in booking my hotel didn't leave me much choice--- and what a break it was. It's the perfect distance away from the convention center while still being conveniently seated. The car service was clutch and made life so much easier. The staff was so friendly, helpful, and full of wonderful suggestions on restaurants, bars, and outdoor activities. Leo, Alex, and the concierge service was on point, truly making this hotel a standout. Hopefully, I'll be able to come back soon for pleasure rather than work. Thanks so much for a great stay!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Outstanding restaurant.,"Great food and excellent service. We asked if they could make stuffed flounder The chef accommodated the request and a flounder stuffed with crabmeat was delicious. Scallops, monkfish and swordfish were excellent. Everything fresh and well prepared.Upside down apple pie fabulous.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Special Service, Old World Charm","Love the Oxford. The doormen are excellent - make you feel very welcome. The hotel is definitely old world charm - with antique beds and appointments, but the bathrooms are really clean and the beds are wonderful. I recently traveled there and the Christmas decorations were up. Fire in the lobby in the morning with your coffee and paper are lovely. Cruise Room bar is art deco at it's finest.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Not worth the price,"Went to Denver for a training class with my team and this hotel was close to the training facility (a block and a half away). When we pulled up, there was nobody from valet there to greet us to take the car (we had to go in the hotel and find someone to go out and take care of that which took about 5 minutes). The front desk was nice but the gentleman did speak quiet fast so it was difficult to understand what he was saying (and I am from the MW). The room was large and clean but with very dim lights (we spent most of our time in the hotel lobby because while the lighting there was dim it was better than the rooms). The bathroom was a decent size and clean but the lighting was great!! The bed and pillows were great! The wifi was good, and free. The lobby does have a fireplace which was nice on a chilly afternoon/evening because they put wood in it and it would make it toasty in there. Note: This hotel is not eco-friendly at all. There is no sign to hang on the door so they don't clean your room and when they do, they even take away towels that are hanging (what a waste!!!). The cost was between $240-260/night and taxes were just shy of $50/night. So not worth it!!! I would never pay this for a hotel! While the hotel is old and has a lot of historical features and is in a nice part of downtown, there are a lot of others around.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Not a Corporate Hotel,This is a very unique property in downtown Denver.  It is the oldest hotel in Denver and the decor is a cross between Victorian and Art Deco. My room was spacious and very comfortable.  Centrally located within walking distance of many restaurants plus the hotel has a courtesy shuttle in the downtown area.  Desk staff is very efficient and knowledgeable about local attractions.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Historical Hotel....,"The place is full of charm and character, from the exterior, to opening the front door, they have done a great job of preserving this gem. The staff greeted us promptly, the lobby was already decorated for the holidays, and they did a very classy job. I found out the rooms are all uniquely decorated and very tasteful. It's very convenient to lots of attractions in Downtown. Don't forget to check out The Cruise Room, it's famous bar.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"If you are even in Denver, this is the place to stay",We picked the hotel from a list and are so happy that we did.  We really lucked out.  This staff could not do enough to make our stay more comfortable  They are highly professional and knowledgeable.  The hotel is situated on a quiet block in historic downtown.  Totally charming place and their car takes you everywhere you want to go in a 2 mile radius.  There is a full service spa connected to the hotel and well a a full gym.  We were there for 2 weeks and could not have been happier.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful historical hotel in a perfect location,"We had a family dinner at McCormick's in the Oxford Hotel, so we came to Denver to enjoy this special occasion.  The staff was extremely pleasant and welcoming, and we were able to check in early.  Loved this location!  We walked around Union Station and the 16th Street Mall area and found lots of wonderful choices for lunch. The room on the 5th floor was very quiet and the beds were extremely comfortable.  There was not much of a view, but we really did not feel that that was an issue for us.  The room and bathroom were clean and there was plenty of room for the three of us.  The retro look of the tile in the bathroom was very attractive!  The Remington sculptures in the halls, the dark wood trim, and the décor throughout the hotel was lovely, and we loved the Christmas tree and decorations in the lobby.  Zack was very efficient on the front desk when we checked out, and seemed genuinely pleased that we had enjoyed our stay.  I would love to return to Denver, and I cannot imagine a better place to stay!  Thank you, Oxford Hotel staff, for being a part of this special family trip!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful Stay!,"The Oxford Hotel is a stunningly beautiful older hotel in the heart of downtown Denver. My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this charming place. Everyone who worked here was super friendly and welcoming. The room we stayed in was really cool, and I loved that we could walk everywhere. We left our rental car in the garage the entire stay. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and the shower was amazing! I absolutely love the old-school style of dropping off your key at the front desk when you leave and picking it up when you come back. I highly recommend this great hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Old But Swank,"Ended up staying at the Oldest Hotel in Denver; It has wonderful charm and is located in a perfect spot in LODO.  1 block from mall bus and 1 mile from Hwy on ramp.  They allow pets dogs/cats, which made our trip the more enjoyable.  Evenings they provide a shot of whiskey as a historic past time, with a fire in lobby fireplace.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic Boutique Hotel in the Heart of Denver,The Oxford is a stylish boutique hotel only steps away from Union Station in the heart of downtown Denver. It is turn of the century retro & has a friendly staff & great atmosphere. Though there is no pool in this property there is access to a gym next door. It is a perfect location for attending any venues at the Pepsi Centre or Mile High. It is a short walk to the light rail train that is one stop from Pepsi Centre & two from Mile High. The rooms were neat & I left the old style key with the front desk whenever I left the hotel,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful historic hotel,"Just spent one night but thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We like staying I. Historic hotels on our anniversary, and The Oxford was a short drive (an hour) for us.  The staff were very welcoming and genuinely friendly, and our room (one step up from the base) was roomy and clean. Located next to Union Station there are plenty of restaurants, bars and stores nearby to keep you entertained. The hotel lobby is cozy and the evening ""bourbon tasting"" is relaxed and enjoyable (part of your stay). The hotel is pricey (we paid around $300 for one night) but worth it for a special occasion. We parked in a nearby parking garage, but would probably just do valet parking next time as we only saved about $10 dollars.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Attractive place with minor issues,"The first floor common areas of this historic boutique hotel are beautiful, but our suite was just okay.  I realize that rooms often are not the high point in historic buildings, but that doesn't justify entry doors that are too thin (fortunately this wasn't a problem after 11) and hide-a-bed sofas with ridiculously saggy mattresses.  The shower was a small semi-half-circle area within which I kept bumping into the soap bar in the middle, including bashing my forehead when I bent to wash my feet.  But the main king bed was quite good and the room furnishings fit the historic upscale character of the hotel.  We also were impressed with the staff, who were all personable and professional.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A long Broncos weekend. ,Stayed 4 nights. Just loved the hotel. Great location for the game. I work at the Belligio in Vegas so I know customer service. You guys rock.  I just love the history of the Oxford.  Highly recommend your hotel. Can't wait to come back.   Ted & Sandy Utecht.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Historic hotel, excellent location with stellar service!","We loved the location and ambience of The Oxford.  It is right in the heart of Lodo just steps from Union Station and fabulous Larimer Square.  I was very impressed that each time we came and went, the hotel staff knew our names.  The valet parking was very prompt and they offered a complimentary whiskey tasting while we were there.  They change the rugs in the elevators to reffect what day it is.  Bathrobes, bath products and linens very nice.  Only complaint would be not enough shelf space in bathroom (pedestal sink) and the King bed had nightstand on only one side.  It appeared as if they updated to king bed at the expense of space.  The armoire in our room was difficult to access because it was so close to the bed.  Nice glassed in shower in bath.  Because it is a historic hotel, they have actual keys on corded tassel but allow you to leave at front desk for retrieval upon return.  Love the way the doormen/vallets wear trendy hats.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A very special place,"This hotel is elegant, beautiful and the customer service is superb. It's one of my fave hotels and hotel experiences. I enjoyed the fireplace the lobby. Got my shoes shined. Had a glass of complementary bourbon. Enjoyed the plush bed and the clean, new bathrooms. Interacted with smiling, friendly employees. Accessed restaurants nearby at Union Station, Lodo, and Larimer Square. Loved every second of it.",5

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great small hotel with interesting history and superb location,"We had a great stay in Lower Downtown (LoDo) Denver at the Oxford. Superb location within walking distance of Union Station, Larimer Square, Coors Field, etc. Lots of nearby restaurants and museums. The staff was very friendly, particularly the Bell Staff, and helpful and when we took a tour of LoDo, we found ourselves back in the hotel, as its history is part of the tour! Fun stay for our first real visit (other than passing through the airport) in Denver. The weather was terrific and we had a terrific time. We'd defiinitely return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Visit to Denver,"I had a delightful stay at the Oxford Hotel.  The staff is very welcoming and go out of their way to make your stay pleasant.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Really neat place!,Love the historical preservation here.  The bed was very high and comfy except for the pillows.  The room was exceptionally clean and fresh.  The staff was welcoming and professional.This place just has a cool vibe and a wonderful atmosphere all around. In a top-notch and very walkable location.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Don't miss, don't look elsewhere. Excellent hotel.","We loved this historical building. It is decorated in the Victorian style and the lobby jazz music also fits the ambiance, it is a trip in time and that is what we like. The staff is super trained for all of your needs, everybody smiles and is extremely polite, knowledgeable, and genuinely friendly. They will orient you in any direction you wish. I was stunned to see that the elevator mat was changed every single day. I thought it was very cute.We even found the clientele interesting, everybody seemed friendly and respectful of each other. This is what happens to the environment when people are treated with such respect and are pleased with the service they have. Even though this is far (we are from Tucson), and this was a one time trip for us, we want to go back just to be at the Oxford again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Denver in a classic era,"From the genuine welcome as you approach the front door to the last wave as you pull away from the curb, The Oxford Hotel is a step back to Denver in a classic era. The comfortable lobby lends itself well to an early morning cup of coffee and a quick look at the news. The Bell staff and Front Desk staff are quick to remember you by name and make you feel at home. Throughout the hotel you are surrounded with antique furnishings that take you back to early days of the West. Guest rooms have the elegant appointments of a fine hotel. Service is always delivered with a smile and a genuine interest in making your visit memorable. With it's close proximity to Union Station and numerous places to dine, I would not hesitate to put the Oxford Hotel on my list of ""must do"" places while in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lovely Vintage Hotel,"I stayed 5 nights at The Oxford Hotel.  Walking into this hotel my first thought  was wow I have just stepped back in time. The ambiance ,decorations and scent of the lobby remind me of the house of my great aunt. My room was very clean. The matress was not to hard and not to soft. The bathroom was huge considering there was no tub ,which I prefer a shower over a bath any day. Lots of action at night in the hotel. I could not hear any noise from my room. I will definitely be back to visit this hotel again !",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Hotel Denver CO,"Fantastic property- well restored and comfy- great location downtown Denver- friendly staff! Very well restored with beautiful furnishings throughout. The elevator even has rugs that tell you what day it is, no need to check your phone!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Stay for the History,"I stayed there primarily for the history of the place but it was just as convenient as other nearby hotels. You're a stone's throw from the train station and surrounding restaurants. Rooms, and entire hotel really, have managed to retain the character of the structure while offering the comfort and functionality of modern places. Remember, this is an old place so don't expect some new modern place like the newly renovated Crawford Station.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Old world charm, modern amenities-best of both worlds","Stayed overnight with my husband to check out Denver's vibes before heading out to RMNP with my brothers who live in Colorado. This hotel was super comfy, nice dark room for sleeping. The furnishings were art deco style which was fun. The artwork in the main lobby was amazing. Staff at front desk were friendly & helpful. The valet's wore fedoras, nice touch. Near Union Station (Snooze reataurant right there-great for breakfast) & other historical buildings- good location. Got a great room rate-booked well in advance of stay. Highly recommend!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Old Style Elegance Plus Modern Convenience in One of Denver's Hottest Area,"Sometimes the only positive one can muster for older hotels is something along the lines of ""nice wainscoting"" but happily the Oxford offers much, much more.  While it is true that this boutique hotel has plenty of old world charm including warm and comfortable wood paneled public rooms and funky tasseled keys that need to be checked in when you come and go, it also has plenty of modern conveniences. We sprang for one of the rooms above the basic offering in a ""park and stay"" package on the hotel website and were vey happy with the large, clean and modern bath. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable perhaps the best of our entire trip to three cities. The period piece desk in our room had cubbies and nooks for stashing transported items, but this antique piece was complemented with a Bose sound system/clock, a flat screen TV and completely adequate wi-fi. The entire staff was both friendly and helpful with a special recognition to the bell staff which was one of the best we have encountered. Speedy at delivering bags and our car and also knowledgeable with many helpful recommendations for restaurants, sights, etc. they helped make our stay a great one. The location in Denver's LoDo is excellent and the proximity to an overwhelming number of restaurants, bars, museums and other attractions is excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel with nice amenities and excellent staff,"This was my second stay at the Oxford.  A hotel with Old World Charm, lovely rooms and and outstanding staff whose focus is on the comfort of their guests,  made both of my stays very pleasant.  I was there for an annual visit to National Jewish Health.  The courtesy car service was a godsend.  Always friendly and prompt. Also loved the LoDo area.  Lots of restaurants and shops nearby.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Ambience within Denver's Historic District,"The Oxford Hotel has atmosphere reminiscent of the movie ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"".  The room was comfortable but they charge you for certain amenities in the room such as facial creams, which I found somewhat outrageous given the hotel's price.  Breakfast was great, but was annoyed with certain hidden charges when ordering juice.  I prefer to get charge a hefty fee that getting surprised with hidden charges at the end.  Don't get me wrong, the food is amazing, just keep your eyes open for unlisted prices.  Also, be prepared for the service at the restaurant, we felt they were actually doing us a favor for serving us.Definitely offers a great location if you're planning to walk to Denver's Art Museums which are quite an architectural experience worth your time.  The shopping district around 16th street was no quite what my wife and I expected, as it was occupied by many homeless individuals.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great experience!,"Staying at the Oxford was a great experience! It is absolutely gorgeous and everyone of the staff members that I came across were very nice. Between the comfort of the rooms, cleanliness, decor and fabulous staff it made for a very pleasant experince!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Romantic Getaway,"This historic hotel is in the heart of downtown Denver just a half block from the newly restored Union Station.  The staff was kind and courteous.  They have a complimentary nightly bourbon tasting (there was a mandatory extra charge of $11.50 that included this and free wireless, but this is pretty standard in many hotels now).  We were celebrating our anniversary and they gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne!  It was lovely to revisit this hotel again and we would definitely stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Favorite place to stay in Denver,"My mom and I traveled to Denver for the first time about a year ago and stayed at the Oxford Hotel. We fell in love with it and knew we'd be back! In fact, we just returned from our second stay and couldn't be happier yet again. Everything is impeccable - from the service, the staff, the room, the spa! Everyone we encountered was exceptionally kind and always looking to help. You also can't beat the location. You're just a short walk away from everything you could need! We didn't rent a car this time so we walked everywhere we needed to go in the city for our stay. It was great.Can't wait to be back again sometime soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful old world elegance,"Great hotel, near to Coors Field.  Great amenities including free local car service.  Beautiful room, very quiet.  Cool secret doors in hotel.  We really enjoyed staying here and would go again.  We were surprised that there was a fee for parking considering the price of the room.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great spot in Denver with top-notch service,"Stayed here for one night during fast in-and-out business trip.  Located in downtown Denver; only about 10 minute walk from Coors Field.I completely agree with other reviewers that highlight the Oxford's great customer service: Warm, genuine welcomes from the bellhop to the front desk; all very helpful and seemed to really care about my stay.Rooms are traditionally appointed.  Quaint and cozy; would've been more fun (read romantic) with my wife.  Room key is an old-fashioned key (not key card) hooked to a giant tassel that you can leave with the front desk if you want when leaving the hotel.  They have a nightly bourbon tasting that I missed due to meeting.Bathroom had a nice shower.  Older feel to it but of course the hotel is over 100 years old.  Only suggestion for the whole stay would be to upgrade to fluffy towels; just adds to the luxury.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Perfect Place To Stay In Denver,"This past week we stayed at The Oxford prior to the flight back home.  We have stayed at this fine hotel on two-three other occasions.  The Oxford is conveniently located in the LODO section of town, a short walk from Larimer Square and The Union Station.  It is the oldest hotel in Denver and retains much of its late 19th/early 20th century heritage.  The room décor and furnishings evoke much of this period.  The baths and mechanical systems are very much 21st century. The building is well maintained and clean.The staff is professional, cheerful and eager to help.  The hotel is the antithesis of the large corporate/convention enterprise.  The desk staff remembers your name and is always available to help.This will be our place to stay in Denver for the foreseeable future.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Awesome!,"As a Denver native (who unfortunately moved away), The Oxford Hotel is the place to stay when we visit home! 1) History - Opened in 1891, but they've done an amazing job of keeping its old-world charm while incorporating modern updates. They still use the original keys for rooms!2) Location - Heart of Lower Downtown Denver: Bars, Restaurants, Shopping, and Coors Field!3) Staff - Friendly, welcoming, and fabulous. I left my phone on the top of my vehicle when the valet drove away. 5 minutes later, the attendant brings my phone to our room. THANK YOU!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fabulous! ,"We are on the second night of a three night stay here.  We were kindly upgraded to a huge front facing Victorian room for our anniversary.  Also, a lovely note and bottle of bubbly was in our room.  The hotel is so old and beautiful and has kept all its character.  Bourbon hour is fun and you get to meet other guests.  Love this place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Historical, Great Staff, Service, Location  - very cool","Not a W type thing. But if you are into classics and friendly service this is it in Denver.Super location, the valet vehicles are excellent. A throwback to yesterday. No electric key card here. You get a real key with a fluffy keychain. Internet is good.Oh when you get back, after a big day, if you time it right enjoy the complimentary scotch.  A cool touch is they change out the elevator mats everyday. Just in case you forget which day it is. Nice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Hotel 💫💫💫💫💫,Amazing Hotel central to everything in downtown Denver. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was extremely helpful and bell service went above and beyond any other place I have stayed. Leo and Stewart know the area and make sure that you don't miss out on anything during your stay. Won't consider any other hotel on my next trip to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing staff and fabulous hotel,"Me and my now husband stayed at The Oxford for three nights. The night before, the night of and the night after we were married. We decided to elope in Denver last minute and chose the Oxford to stay based on the location, wonderful reviews, and services they offer. We are both sort of into the history thing and this place was really cool. The hotel rooms have been updated to modern comforts but the feel of the hotel common areas is unique. The staff was absolutely fabulous, provided us a complimentary bottle of prosecco, and were very friendly and helpful !Everyone who was affiliated with the site including bartenders, wait staff, desk persons, bell 'hold', valets, comp car drivers, salon/spa staff are incredibly friendly and helpful with lots of information about the area and were quick to help and always with a smile. If you have the opportunity you should stay here! Excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Delightful stay at the Oxford Hotel,"We totally enjoyed our 4 day stay at the Oxford Hotel.  Its charming, old-style elegance was delightful and afternoon bourbon tastings in the lobby were a real treat.  The location -- one block from Union Station and another from the 16th Street Mall -- could not have been better.  The LoDo section of Denver was fascinating and full of amazing restaurants.  The hotel was spotless, WI-FI was strong and steady, thick towels and comfortable bed.  It couldn't have been better!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Stafff,"Our family had a wonderful stay at The Oxford Hotel. Rooms were very clean, beds very comfortable, and staff both friendly and helpful. Good location for us as we were in town to attend a Rockies game. My only disappointment was how much the price of the rooms increased for a holiday weekend (we were there over Labor Day weekend), and on top of that a nightly amenities fee.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Stay and Enjoy Denver's History,The Oxford is one of Denver's unique historic hotels located in the heart of Denver near great restaurants and hot spots! I have enjoyed a room at the Oxford as well as have hosted / planned a wedding in their ballroom. Their service is wonderful and the space holds a certain charm.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Location, Location, Location","We like old boutique hotels, and this was one of the best.  Check out the recent reviews - they are spot on.  Our street-view room (316) was bright and comfortable with minor street noise.We spent four days at the Oxford tooling around LoDo and other Denver attractions and watching Giants-Rockies games.  Perfect location for us.  Easy walk to Coors Field and free on-off streetcar rides to other stuff.  Consider taking the Historic Denver LoDo walking tour if you're into an architectural look at Denver a long time ago and what LoDo is today.  Our guide was excellent.One bone to pick: The Oxford has this European-like key thing where you turn your tasseled room key into the front desk every time you go out.  Most of the time the folks on duty gave us our key back with a smile after we uttered our room number.  Several times not so smooth.  Often they seemed distracted and into their computers.  Occasionally we had to stand around and wait while they made sure we were who we said we were - and not some street person trying to score a room.  Annoying.  I know the desk people can't be expected to remember everybody as they come and go, but they should be trained to cough up a key promptly when asked.  Having to spell my name and wait for them to check their registration lists is not a good pr gesture on their part.  The guys out front who greet you were great.  Friendly, ready to answer your questions and strike up a conversation (you name the topic.)Great old hotel.  Definitely recommend .",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,HIstoric Hotel,"I stayed at the Oxford for a couple of nights and found it to be a pleasant place to stay. The location is great, next to Union Station, close to lots of dining options and also a short walk from Contemporary Art.The staff at the front desk were excellent. They remembered my name which I was quite surprised about. The guys at the door were also extremely friendly.The hotel is very old school using physical keys as opposed to the modern key card system. You can feel the history in the hotel however the place is maintained well. The gym facilities are also exceptional.The only issue I had was on the last day of my stay the fire alarm was triggered in the morning and fire brigade arrived but it wasn't clear what was going on and what we should have done…stay or leave the hotel and there was no explanation as to what happened. Having said that, overall, I still had a great stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,One Year Anniversary,"This place is classy! The customer service is off-the-chart.  Leo rocks!  Love the tweety-bird in the lobby.  Being that it was a special occasion, they put a complimentary bottle of champagne in the room upon our arrival.. What a nice touch!  Plus, they upgraded our room.  This 100 year old hotel is clean, charming and classy. If you go, you have to go to the Cruise room but, hit the complimentary bourbon tasting first, if applicable (ask).  Location is great for downtown night-life!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful Well Kept Historical Hotel,"I had a wonderful stay here, the only downfall was the construction right out our window the time we were there and the lack of letting people know about the valet costs.Bonus about the valets was their knowledge of the city and their manners. cheers to Buddy Holly and Leonardo!!-Destiny Riotfest2015",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful old hotel with modern amenities.,"We were warmly welcomed by a sparky young man on the door as we arrived and the good service continued St the front desk. Our room was spacious and comfortable and furnished to suit the historic feel of this classic old building. The area has plenty of great places to eat and the Train Station, which has had a beautiful face lift seem to have very few trains but lots of cool restaurants and bars. Best though, was the ice cream place! We only stayed one night but could easily have stayed longer. Very happy with our choice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Very Classy and a great location,Spent two nights there with our family of six....two great rooms.  The service was excellent...the little extras were so nice.  The valets were friendly and timely.  the place exudes class but doesn't over do it.  Fitness center was outstanding. I recommend it highly to everyone.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"The place is great, the people even better","The Oxford Hotel is a boutique hotel. The oldest in Denver (from 1891). But don't worry is been renovated several times (one of those very recently) and has almost every modern life service available, being able to keep the atmosphere and most of the furniture and spaces of a bygone era.The hotel is very close to the recently renovated Union Square, and the only hotel worth noting in the Low Do Area of Denver, an area full of trendy restaurants, art galleries, bookstores, cafés and bars. Don't expect to find good shopping spots (groceries, drugstores or clothing nearby). If you want to go shopping beyond the souvenir stores of Union Square, you have to walk to 16th street and take the FreeMallRide Bus that will take you in minutes to a lively comercial district full of all kinds of stores, cinemas, theaters, etc.When talking about the room, experience will differ greatly. Partly because every room is different. They have two different decoration styles, feel free to look at both options in their website.Upon arrival we had several pleasant surprises. We asked in advance for specific room decor and floor and our wish was granted. We asked for an extra-firm pillow, and two were waiting inside the room, with a complimentary bottle of wine because we were celebrating our anniversary.The room was on the small side, and not so well lighted, but had a decent enough TV, a good Keurig coffee machine, and a Bose stereo CD/Radio player. The bathroom was big, super clean, and very comfortable.The bedsheets are top quality and the bedspread one of the best I've ever slept on.Our only issues with the room were: a very noisy bathroom door and the lack of a security box.Leaving those aside, rooms open with old fashion keys, have a very quiet and efficient air conditioner unit and dimming lamps. Lovely room.The hotel has two very fast elevators, even if they are old. The lobby of the hotel has a distinct funny smell that can be a bit off putting for some. I don't know if its the smell of age on leather chairs and wood, or if its something filtering from the restaurant next door. Not their best feature.Their absolute best feature is their people. Every clerk in the Front Desk was friendly and helpful. They remember your name, offer water, apples, newspaper, and if you are around by 5 PM, even a local bourbon tasting. They were friendly warm and helpful all the time, exception noted for a grumpy night clerk. I distinctly remember Bree (spelling might be wrong) and Toms as two very helpful members of the front desk staff.Front desk has small security boxes, bank-like, only usable to store money, credit cards and passports. We felt every day at home, welcome, comfortable and safe.The second floor of the lobby even has a small guest library, donated by a cherished local book store, with good enough reads that one can loan during the stay. The hotel charges a small $10 daily fee that covers, some of the amenities (bourbon, water bottles, wi-fi, phone calls, and a close-distance car drop out that we didn't use, during summer walking is better), totally worth it.Book through their very own website and if you look carefully, you can get the best price and response.The building alone is worth the visit, but with this staff the hotel is in a whole different dimension.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Old world elegance,"Have been staying at the Oxford for past 25 years, both business and leisure travel.  Lovely ambiance and service.  We consider it our home away from home. Historic Denver at its best.  Great limo service.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classy Hotel,A quiet comfortable hotel in an excellent location with outstanding service. I normally stay at cheap hotels so I have dropped one star because of price (on my scale of hotel values). Good fast wi-fi and convenient desk for work.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Everything was PERFECT!,"We had such a great experience at this hotel! The location is so perfect, close to everything we wanted to do. The hotel is very nice with such a unique, historic vibe! We really truly enjoyed everything about our stay. The hotel staff was super friendly, beyond our expectations. Rooms had everything we could ask for and was kept very clean! Overall, I couldn't be happier with the entire stay. The city was beautiful, quiet and this street in particular was not very noisy or busy at night. Do yourself a favor and book your stay here, you will not be disappointed!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect downtown stay in Denver.,"A great hotel in the heart of Denver.   The lobby, rooms and location were fantastic.  There was an initial snafu when we were given the wrong room (yes they still have actual keys not computer card).  After assigning another room, we smelled cigarette smoke (oops looks like a wild wedding party?), the manager was extremely apologetic and gave us the Presidential Suite!  This room was way over the top and we thoroughly enjoyed this surprised hospitality.  I loved the location and the service and suggestions by the staff was spot on.  I would definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Extremely cool!,"Our room was lovely with a fireplace, elegant stuffed chairs, comfy bed, historic beauty and decor. We loved the free chauffeur services to anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel and the staff couldn't have been friendlier. After an interlude in the mountains, we returned to Denver and stayed elsewhere and we missed The Oxford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful weekend,Such a beautiful historic hotel. Staff was so friend and did everything they could to make our stay wonderful! Left us a bottle of wine for our anniversary. Have a wonderful whiskey tasting bar in the lobby.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect visit at the Oxford,"We had a great stay at this property.  We had originally thought we wanted to stay at the Ritz or Four Seasons - but the prices were ridiculous!  So, we went the historic route and we were so glad we did.  This hotel has a great vibe, lots of history (be sure to have a drink in the Cruise Room) and wonderful service (Sara at the front desk was especially helpful!)  The room was clean and very comfortable.It's also a great location!  We walked to Union Station, around Coors Field and then to Larimer Square for dinner.  We would stay here again for sure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Birthday surprise celebration,My husband booked the Oxford as a birthday weekend surprise for me. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay and enjoy the hotel amenities and the Cruise Room for drinks and appetizers. We had a fine stay and I would recommend it for those special occasions. Exceptional service all around.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great place to stay,"Our room was great and the courteous staff made us feel at home,and went out of their way to help us out. The food also very good and more friendly service. Also their was many places close to the motel to eat and shop within walking distance.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Our Recent Stay At The Oxford Hotel,My wife and I recently stayed at the Oxford Hotel while visiting Denver. Our stay there was exceptional ! We were warmly greeted when checking in & all of our needs were met with a smile and promptness. Suggestions on dining and what to see and do were very much appreciated and we were greeted by name when coming and going. We would definitely stay at the Oxford again.Just book it when you go to Denver !,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Convenient, friendly and historic",Great hotel a short work from Union Station. Staff at all levels are super friendly. Rooms are large and comfortable. Lively bar and good restaurant. Hotel is great base for exploring the city either on foot or by public transport which can be accessed at Union Station.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The old curiosity shop,"Quite the most odd place. A characterful building, chock-a-block with antiques and fine architectural detailing. The keys to the rooms come on massive comedy sized tassels. The rooms themselves are individual, decorated with ornate plasterwork and more antiques. The overall effect misses the mark. Not quite elegant old-world charm, more musty antique shop. The corridors again feature antique wooden dressers. All empty and unloved. The pots of trapped cockroaches add very little to the ambience.It's a quirky and interesting place, the staff were lovely and the location is terrific for the city and the station. If you want to try somewhere a bit different - give it a go.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Denver Gem,"The Oxford is a beautiful, historic hotel in downtown Denver.  Our stay started with a bourbon tasting at the hotel, then we walked through a great downtown area to a Colorado Rockies game that evening.  The Oxford staff is outstanding and our room was beautiful.  This was one of our most enjoyable hotel stays ever!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great time at The Oxford Hotel in Denver,"Our whole family found The Oxford Hotel to have 5 star personal service, but from an unique, older hotel, very different from other ""cookie cutter"" high rated hotels. Although older, everything was updated and clean and we had no issues with the wifi. The location was perfect with easy access to downtown and restaurants, but also convenient for day trips to all the Colorado ""must sees"" including Red Rocks, Estes Park, and Boulder.  Valet service includes rides within a 2 miles radius is very convenient. Best of all, the service can not be complemented enough.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great old hotel,"If you like old hotels that are impeccably maintained with excellent, friendly, helpful staff, this is the place for you! This old school hotel has a complimentary whiskey tasting every evening. Also make sure to check out the Cruise Room for a cocktail!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nice hotel,"Stayed 2 nights.  Room was nice, bathroom extremely small.  Had a problem with housekeeping as room was not cleaned until 3:15pm after we had called twice asking for service.  We did like location.  Nice and personable staff.  Loved the history of the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Hotel,"Enjoyed our stay very much. Rooms were clean, staff very helpful and food was excellent. It was our anniversary and there was a complimentary bottle of wine on ice in our room when we arrived. Thanks!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,In The Heart of Downtown,"Business stay here for 3 days/nights. The charm of this place is endless. Charm doesn't equal, cool, hip, trendy, etc. This is the oldest hotel in Denver and a perfect home base for downtown activities. While the accommodations were good, it's an old hotel. Lots of cool antique furniture and decor throughout. Went in the heat of Summer and the AC seemed to be having trouble keeping up - retro-fitting old buildings can be a challenge. And on more than one occasion, the aroma of some of Colorado's finest could be easily detected throughout the building. Helpful staff.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,This is a great hotel experience.  Old school charm with modern comforts and amenities.  The hotel staff is fantastic.  Great location in Lodo.  Awesome restaurant and bar.  My favorite place to stay in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great stay at the Oxford,"As one of the oldest hotels in Denver, the Oxford has a lot of history.  Our room was beautiful and the service was top notch.  The doorman Stewart was extremely helpful and friendly.  It is in a great neighborhood with a lot of things to do nearby.  I'll be staying here on my future trips to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great, Convenient Location","We only had one night in Denver and were planning to catch a Rockies baseball game, so the location of the Oxford Hotel caught our eye.  We were very pleased with the location, the  surrounding shopping and eating selections, as well as the great staff.  The Staff was able to offer suggestions for places to eat as well as some things to do before the game.  Wish we had a little longer to stay in Denver and enjoy the downtown area and The Oxford Hotel a little more",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Nostalgia and location,Great step back in time at the Oxford.  Wonderful accommodations and great staff.  All the bell staff were very knowledgeable and cheerful.  Loved the small things they did to make you feel comfortable.  The location could not have been better for a stay in Downtown Denver!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great location. Everything to do within a short walk.,"Trip Advisor recommendation. All expectations exceeded. Excellent staff. Older building but good renovation. One of the best beds of our trip.In a part of downtown Denver that has full range of choices for shopping, restaurants, ball park, brew pubs & excellent Mile High Distillery!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,One of the Best!,"Great experience, staff very friendly and helpful.   Very clean, great location, would defiantly stay again! The only downfall was our view was another buildings wall.  The Oxford has done an amazing job with staff!  They don't come much better!  The rum tasting at 5:30 was also a plus.  Will always recommend this hotel to others!  Thank you for a great stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,An Historical Hotel in Downtown Denver,"The rooms were comfortable and clean, the staff were welcoming and accommodating, and the location was ideal.  The rooms are considered ""historic"" yet they do not feel outdated or uncomfortable.  The cost was a bit on the high end, but it is worth it to be so centrally located.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,My business stay at the Oxford Hotel,"Management & staff were very attentive and the rooms are a real kick.  A blast from the past with modern comforts and technology.  Great location for restaurants and arts/baseball games.  McCormicks clam chowder is out-of-this-world.Beware that there was step leading up into the bathroom in the room I stayed in.  Rooms were very clean and service was great.  This hotel uses the old fashion hard keys which is a unique touch.  I have stayed in this hotel several times -- it's blast to get one of their ""haunted rooms"".  The TV came on in the middle of the night in the room I stayed in before -- the channels kept changing until it stopped about 3 minutes later.  Luckily it was a movie I had never seen but wanted to.  Enjoy this multifacited, unique experience in history!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"OK, but would not stay there again.","The hotel lobby is charming, the rooms however left a lot to be desired. Upon checking in we were assigned to the tiniest of rooms that happened to be incredibly warm,  upper 70's with the AC  set to lowest setting.  So after an hour we called to see about another room. They upgraded us to the room with the  bigger bathroom,  yet the room itself was still much smaller than a standard hotel room. Both rooms windows faced the interior of the building where they keep ac units, so all you saw were other rooms windows.  The 2nd room was still warm, but bearable. There was 1 tiny closet that had its entire space taken up by a suitcase and ironing board. I had to keep my suitcase on the floor behind the door, which meant I needed to step over to get in the room. The headboard was loosely attached the frame of the bed and banged against the wall any time there was movement. Although the bathroom was big and it had a separate shower / tub, the vanity was much smaller than I would have liked.  My wife's makeup bag and hairdryer took up the entire space. The room keys are ridiculous. They are a standard metal key that is attached to a huge key chain that looks like it came off a pair of curtains. The front desk at checkout told us that most people drop them off when they go out so they don’t have to lug them around all day. Glad we found that out as we were leaving. The only parking options are lots down the street at 15.00 a day and you need to pay each morning,  or valet at 40.00 a night (I did overhear that the valet misplaced someone's car, that car owner  was not a happy camper. You never want to hear the valet say to the owner, ""are you sure you didn't move it last night?"") So if you like cool old art deco type details you will love the public spaces of the hotel. However, if you are looking for comfort and amenities skip this hotel. You can always stop in for a drink and see the upside to the hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Stay with old world charm,"My husband and I love historic hotels, so we were ready for any kind of experience.  Upon checking in, we were directed to a room that, while lovely, should have definitely been put on a maintenance block.  There were a few issues with the room; however, maintenance had obviously been there earlier in the day with a very strong smelling epoxy that was so intense that I immediately got a headache.  No problem, we were moved to another room that was just lovely.  It had one of those car wash type showers, but it sadly only partially worked.  Still, the overall experience was lovely.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nice pleasant stay,Very different but pleasant hotel. Historic for sure but comfortable. Clean rooms & bathrooms. Hotel staff was there and  prompt when needed. Free shuttle to the airport was a plus! Definitely will return,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful hotel,Great location and friendly staff. Room was spacious and comfortable. Lots of nearby restaurants and shopping. Capitol bldg and Art Museum within walking distance and/or mall shuttle. Morning coffee too.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Could try harder,"The hotel is beatiful and historic.  Definitely worth seeing.  The staff however were generally condescending and lacking in insight.  Bathroom had no soap on arrival.  The  doorman did not book the taxi to the airport as requested, and then disappeared.  No apology.  This was a shame because this should be a special place",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Individual style in the center of the action,"This place has 19th century style with serviceable antiques in the rooms, otherwise quite up to date.Hotel provides a free shuttle in an Esclade to any location within a 2 mile radius.  VERY CONVENIENT.Complimentary local bourbon tasting in the afternoon.  NIce touch!Fitness center is one of the best I have come across in a hotel.Cruise Bar is astonishing.  Classic 1930's decor.  Great period music and ambience.  My only critique is that the very talented staff could dress with the theme;  Bartenders in white service jackets with gold buttons instead of open collar black shirts with red suspenders.  The women should be in Suzie Wong dresses.  Then  they would really knock this surprising hip venue out of the park.In the restaurant have the Denver Omlette for breakfast....(when in Rome afterall) it is the size of a football but a great way to start the day.All of the Staff is super friendly and that begins with the doormen Leo and Stew.  Both are young, professional, very informative and helpful.  They really take pride in their work.  Bonus for also being easy on the eyes.This hotel is walking distance to the ball park and all of the new bars, music halls, and restaurants that have blossomed around it.  I did not give this place 5 stars only because it is a 19th century hotel, not a 21st century cutting edge experience.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"5 star hotel, 10 star service!","Despite the late check-in, staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly, especially Patrick. Suite was beautiful, the historic charm adds a lot of character to the hotel. Bathrooms were very nice and clean. We look forward to staying here again soon.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful hotel and great staff,"These was a splurge on our Yellowstone trip--the hotel is more beautiful in person than on the website. My family and I walked around downtown Denver and found it to be a very neat city. The staff was fantastic. We had one problem while we were there, but it was resolved super quickly--no questions asked. By the way, the top floor has all new mattresses as of July 22-23!!! They offer a free ride within a two mile radius, so that comes in handy if it looks like rain, which was our case. Also, another neat element was the display window outside the Oxford, which changes daily. They display different quotes from classic literature. I loved it!!Tip: Reserve your room in advance--the earlier the better. The prices at this hotel more than double the closer it gets to your date. I would definitely stay here again, but with an advanced reservation.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Mommy/Son weekend in Denver,"The hotel staff was incredibly friendly, from the valet to the front desk to the spa/fitness center, all was amazing.  My 9 year old son said this was ""the best hotel I have ever been at!""  Great location as well - would definitely come back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,One of the best in Denver,"Stayed only one night, but the hotel was superb.  The staff was courteous and helpful.  The hotel is within walking distance of many attractions - Coors Field, Union Station, etc.  The room was perfect - nice size, very clean with an outstanding bathroom and amenities.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fun in LODO,"We had a great stay in LODO! Too bad the Rockies aren't up to the level of the staff at the Oxford. Everyone was exceptionally helpful and pleasant. Location near Union station and Coors field is perfect. The room was of decent size, as was the bathroom. Our bed was wonderful, too. We had no view of anything other than the brick wall, but that made for a quiet stay in the heart of the action.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Location, location and ...great staff","There is the location, just steps from the wonderfully redone train station as well as brew pubs and restaturants as well--and did I mention walking distance to Coors Field? The decor is old-timey in a film-noir sort of way, yet well kept. Did I mention the bourbon hour? But to us, the real clincher was the staff. Really. Clearly they've developed a culture there that works. Staff like this doesn't happen by accident. Simply put, wonderful!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Weekend in Denver,"The Oxford Hotel is Perfect!  The entire staff was outstanding.  A special shout out to Leo, our go to guy.  Loved the historic lobby, with the whiskey tastings each evening.  Our room was comfortable THX",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Old charm,"Great history, fun staff, Leo the front door guys was super nice, great location, close to all the hot spots in down town, I would stay here again the only complaint is you pay a hefty daily parking fee and there's no pool.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great historic hotel with the best staff ,"Just wrapping up a weekend trip to Denver at the Oxford hotel. If you like hotels with character and top notch service, this is the place for you. Great location with lots of nearby activities and restaurants. The room was very spacious with amazing high ceilings. Bathroom was fantastic with great shower and nice hotel branded amenities.  Only downside to room is that it had slightly musty smell upon entering but didn't last long. It also seemed that only open outlets were two in bathroom which made charging all of our electronics a challenge. Upon arrival Nick and Leo greeted us and were funny to banter with the entire trip. Bree at the front desk was really great. Advised us on the bourbon tasting and provided an outstanding dinner recommendation and reservation for The Kitchen  which was just around the corner. This hotel was really a treat. the entire trip.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful building with fabulous service,"The Oxford Hotel is a charming and beautiful building with a great history.  It is a very romantic place.  Furnishings in public areas as well as in guest rooms are generally antiques (including our very comfortable but extremely squeaky bed).  The bathrooms in the guest rooms, though, have modern fixtures, and the free wi-fi throughout the hotel was unusually fast compared to most hotels.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Elegant without being snooty,"The location, it's history and ambiance of the hotel is impressive but it is the staff in my opinion that make this establishment. We were only there overnight arriving just as their whiskey tasting was winding down, but they were more than accommodating and did not rush us through taking their time describing and letting us taste the different samples. I had called earlier in the week and they had already made our dinner reservations. They have some sort of connection with the restaurant Snooze and were able to get us in w/in 1/2 an hour of our request (in the past we have waited up to 2 hours, but worth every minute of the wait). Our room was very comfortable and even though we were on the 2nd floor overlooking a busy street it was quiet. We will definitely stay there for a longer period of time on our next trip to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Cozy and Convenient,Historic charm and we'll informed staff! Leo made us feel special and welcome from the minute we pulled up until the minute we drove away. He even had great anecdotes rich with hotel and local history. We will be back because of him!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The best hotel ever!! ,Beautiful historical hotel in a great location! Walking distance to Coors Field and great restaurants! But the best part was LEO!!! His mom raised him right!! Fun friendly and accommodating!! He was awesome! !,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful time!,"We just returned from my daughter's wedding weekend at the Oxford Hotel in Denver. Everything was amazing!  The staff is wonderful.  They go above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of.  They could not have been nicer or more professional!  From Stephanie  and Char in sales, and Stewart in valet, to the front desk and everyone in between they made my daughter's wedding a huge success!  The rooms are elegant and very comfortable.  I loved the historical feel to the hotel.  The Cruise Bar is amazing!  Loved the decor and the service was great!  The location is perfect.  Blocks away from Union Station and a huge selection of great restaurants!  We can't wait to go back!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Sweet location in LoDo, Driving? Book the ""Business Special""","We stayed here for the last weekend of our CO trip. Afterwards, we went to the airport and stayed overnight (and returned our rental car), so we booked the business special, and got free parking, 20 buck credit at McCormick's for breakfast, and a free drink coupon (plus a free drinks, which any guest can have, of local bourbons in lobby in the afternoon). Very helpful staff! Two good coffee shops within 100 feet, and across the street is an ""old school"" (emphasis on men's) men's barber shop that does clips/waxing/pedicures. The Amtrak is right around the corner, and we visited the museum of contemporary art and ate a a wonderfully eclectic place called Zengo (over the Denver Millennium Bridge). Try the little bar that's ""hidden"" in the lobby. Very trendy place.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,pleasant surprise,"I had read reviews of the hotel before booking. some said the rooms were hot, there were no amenities in the room and the lighting was strange,  All wrong.   The temp was perfect, lighting commodious and plenty of snacks and drinks in the room.  the Staff was superior, genuinely friendly and kind.  The room was large the bed super comfortable, the CruiseBar was so unusual and pleasant.  I really loved the experience of staying at the Oxford and plan to go back again and again.  The location is perfect.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,We've got a new place to stay in Denver,"The wife and I spent one night, mid-week at the Oxford and really enjoyed the stay. The Oxford is a beautifully, renovated historic hotel and its 17th St. location puts you one block from Union Station and very close to Coors Field.   The front desk upgraded us to a king suite on the second floor.  There was a little bit of street noise but not bad.  Next time I'll probably request a room on a higher floor just to play it safe.  The room was large, bed comfortable with a decent sized shower and nice amenities.  We were headed to Red Rocks for the David Gray / Amos Lee concert and the shuttle bus we had booked picked us up and dropped us off 1/2 a block from the hotel.  It is absolutely the best way to get to Red Rocks short of your own limo.   The hotel also has not one but two delightful bars where we enjoyed pre-concert cocktails, hummus and fish tacos.   The only down side to the Oxford was the $39 nightly parking fee but where can you go in Denver and not pay for parking?",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Character, Service and Location","The Oxford hotel was recommended by friends who live in the area. We had a fabulous stay. Check in was easy, the room was large and well furnished with a comfortable bed and lots of pillows. The location is excellent. We walked to Larimer street for shopping and dining, Union Station, the aquarium, the modern art museum, 16th Street Mall, Snooze (the best gluten free breakfast!) and I went for a run by the river. The hotel has a great bar as well as a wonderful restaurant. There is a full gym and spa, which were a little run down (hey, it's an old building), but the services were great and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The valets were very helpful in getting us a car to the airport and offered us bottled water upon entry/exit which was always welcome. The only downside is the small bathrooms, however that is to be expected in an older building. Despite the size, they were well appointed.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent stay!,"We recently stayed at The Oxford. From the valets to the front desk, the staff was very friendly. They go above and beyond to learn your name and ensure you have a comfortable stay. We enjoyed the bar - it's the first to have opened in Denver after the end of Prohibition. The hotel also has a complimentary bourbon bar in the evening. The building itself has character and the rooms are nice as well. The only thing I didn't care for was the view from my window - there was a crumpled American flag on the roof of the building behind the hotel (which is completely unacceptable but likely out of the hotel's control). If you're looking for a hotel downtown, consider The Oxford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel!,"Large room, clean, very comfy beds, friendly service, nice amenities, great character. Would definitely return for business or pleasure.  Room was quiet also (asked for and received one not on street).",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Boutique Hotel close to sights in downtown Denver,My husband and I stayed at this hotel a few years ago and loved it so much.  Delicious coffee served each morning on every floor in a cute seating area.  Concierge was so helpful with restaurants and area attractions. Rooms are not overly large but comfortable and homey.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fantastic Denver Experience,Classy and enjoyable stay in the heart of downtown Denver. Great staff and amenities. Easy walking distance from everything in the area that we wanted to do while in town. Highly recommend the Oxford for a special getaway.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Service and Nice Location,"We recently stayed at the Oxford for my niece's wedding and, overall, thought the hotel was very nice.  The Oxford is the oldest hotel in Denver and we noticed that much of the original character has been retained, but the facilities were largely up to modern standards.The lobby is very nice, with comfortable chairs and couches, complementary newspapers and coffee and an attentive valet and bell staff.  The front desk was very efficient and pleasant.  We arrived very early (9:30 a.m.) given our very early flight from NY and they made our rooms available very quickly - we went and had breakfast at Tom's Urban (which was great, by the way) and they called us when the rooms were ready at about 10:15.  We had 2 rooms - a standard room for our kids and a junior suite for ourselves.  The rooms were very nice, if not luxurious, with modern fixtures in the bathrooms and an art deco decor.  We had a shower, which was nicely tiled and with a good shower head.  The standard room had a shower/tub combo, with a large soaking tub.  The suite had a sitting room, but no door between it and the bedroom area, which was fine for us, but if we had had someone sleeping on the sofa bed, it may not have provided enough privacy.  The bed was very comfortable, with high quality bedding.  We did not have a view - it was of the roof of the building next to us and of the Inspirato offices next to that.   There are no mini-bars in the room, but the staff will bring up a mini fridge if you request one.  We requested one, but the hotel was full by the time we asked and there were none left, but they brought ice very quickly whenever we asked. The restaurant downstairs was very good for breakfast (excellent egg tacos - and very, very reasonable, especially for a restaurant in a hotel) and I believe they also catered the dinner for the wedding, which was excellent.I have to commend the service - all staff greeted us at all times and the front desk knew us by name.  That was very professional and impressed us.The location in LoDo was fantastic, with lots of great restaurants and shopping around - we particularly liked Venice, right across the street, where the rehearsal dinner was held (fantastic Italian - and the bread is to die for!), and Rio Grande (Mexican) where we had dinner our last night (excellent margaritas).  They have a bourbon tasting in the lobby every afternoon, but we never partook. Overall, we though the hotel was very good and would return when in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A home away from home,"The Oxford is awesome.  My third stay there (a total of more than two weeks staying there in the last 18 months).  A cool old hotel. Charming.  Incredible location in LoDo, blocks from a ton of great restaurants.  And the staff - warm, thoughtful, attentive; they make you feel like family.  I adore this place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Vintage old west hotel with lots of authentic charm!,"The Oxford is just up the street from Denver's renovated Union Station. It is in the center of LoDo's nightlife, restaurants, and near to Coor's Field. The place is historic, but has been modernized for safety and function. The rooms are furnished with vintage furniture, and you actually get a real room key on a beautiful woven keychain.There is free wi-fi, and a contract spa nearby. A limo will take you to downtown attractions. The staffpeople are personable and helpful. The Oxford is less expensive than nearby chain hotels, but I wouldn't call it inexpensive. A great location, historical ambiance, and helpful staff all make for a good choice in LoDo. I stay there often.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great staff, service and location.","What a great place to stay.  Central location, wonderful staff, a hotel car that would ferry you to any place within two miles of the hotel...and back.  Every staff person was friendly, courteous and helpful.  Room was perfect and quiet. Hope to go back soon.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic hotel with modern sensibilities,"My wife and I spent our honeymoon at The Oxford Hotel and couldn't be happier. The service is first-rate on every level. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, with updates that strike a happy medium between preserving historical charm and feeling modern, clean, and comfortable.We made our reservations online in January, but when we got to the hotel, our reservations had been lost. However, the desk clerk and her manager did everything right and made sure we got the room and the (great) rate we had originally booked. This sort of effort on the part of the staff is par for the course at the Oxford, and every staff member we interacted with was personable, helpful, and oh so courteous. Needless to say, we'll definitely be returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Stepping Back in Time,"We are sleeping this evening in one of the oldest hotels in Denver.  Although some of the furniture is showing a bit of wear, it has been otherwise beautifully maintained and updated where desirable.  We have a decently sized room with a comfortable bed. Two things keep me from giving this five points: we requested a room with a view and a king bed away from the elevator. We got a queen bed with a view of a wall. (To be fair, we are located away from the elevator.) The second thing is the additional $10 fee for use of the amenities...gym, business center, wifi.  This is not a cheap hotel.  Considering the tariff, it seems to me that the amenities should be included.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lots of Character,"Great Place to stay!! So cute!  Great service...Fun Atmosphere!  They even have a little yellow bird in a cage by the front desk, named Charlie. Stay here if given the opportunity! Downtown right by so much",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Oxford hotel,The Oxford provided wonderful service. The front desk staff were pleasant and professional. The valet gentlemen were outstanding (esp Leo). They were very informal and willing to help make our trip memorable. Rooms were clean and unique. The old hotel feel was really cool. Loved the location.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,great people great place,"our stay was outstanding  . the people were great , leo,stew , zack and all the rest treated us like kings . the location was great . the places they told us to go were great , everything about it was great . i would strongly recommend this hotel . one of the best yet",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Doesn't Get Much Better,"This was our first stay at The Oxford but it won't be our last. Everything about this place was exceptional. The staff were attentive, very friendly and always eager to do what is necessary to make your stay a pleasurable one. The building is old and brimming with character as were the rooms. The beds were fluffy and comfortable. Although the hotel is quite old, it was very quiet. We hardly heard another soul while we were there. The bathroom was spacious and bright. It was nice having the bath product dispensers because I am always fussing with my own mini bottles of things and it was nice to leave them behind this time. It was also a nice touch to have an old fashioned key that we could entrust to the front desk without fear of misplacing it while out and about. There is no parking option other than valet but it's hardly a thought because they take such good care of you. The hotel is in the heart of Lodo so there is an abundance of restaurants to suit every taste. In fact, you don't even have to leave the building to have dinner or a cocktail. The Cruise Room is an elegant place for an after dinner drink with a fun old world vibe. Go and enjoy!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Superb Experience,"For us, arriving from San Francisco on the California Zephyr it was a toss up, based upon TA reviews, between the Oxford and the Crawford. We went with the former and are we glad we did. It's been so well redone. You will not believe it's over 100 years old. The service is fabulous. The car service worked very, very well for us. Our room, on the 4th floor, was plush and whisper quiet. The bed, towels, and linens fabulous. Yes, the soap and shampoo dispensers in the showers seemed a bit cheap. I hope they'll consider removing them. But, otherwise, we highly, highly recommend the Oxford and will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Stayed at this charming hotel for a family event,"The entire staff of the Oxford was warm, helpful and friendly. The lobby is charming and inviting for friends and family to meet and chat. The beds and air quality of the rooms is excellent, allowing for a great nights sleep. I will definitely stay in this wonderful hotel on my next visit to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Quick visit to Denver,The Oxford was fantastic. The staff went out of thier way to make are stay extra special. From the valet parking to the on site restaurant and bar everything was great. Location was specatacular close to everything in the LODO district.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Unplanned Amtrak Disaster,"My wife and son arrived at Denver's Union Station already 12 hours behind on their California Zephyr Amtrak train trip.  Rather than head through the Rockies in the dark, they walked the half block in the rain to the Oxford - warm fireplace and great service and rooms - and cowboy history awaited them.  They described it as a special hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Concert weekend with friends,"This was our 2nd stay at the Oxford. We were meeting friends from OR, AZ and NM for a concert at Pepsi Center and everyone was very pleased with the Oxford's location, rooms, service, friendliness . . . really everything. We were on the 5th floor, overlooking the street but never heard any street noise, nor could we hear anything from other rooms. We enjoyed the Cruise Bar and its history. All in all, it was a fabulous weekend - we will definitely stay at the Oxford again, on our next visit to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic delight,"Great experience, great staff, great location!  After reading the reviews we were not surprised by the warm, helpful staff or by our delightful stay at The Oxford Hotel.  Stewart, the bellman, was a go to guy for just about any question that we had.  He was not only helpful, but enthusiastic about making sure we were well informed and enjoying our stay.  We'd definitely come back.  Oh!  Great work out facility 😊",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great Location, Friendly staff, Tiny rooms.","Great old historic building in the heart of downtown Denver. Hard to beat the location. Staff was very friendly. Room was the smallest room I have stayed in since my college dorm room. While room was clean and the bed comfortable, size of the room was uncomfortably small. There was only room for an antique armoire for our hanging cloths. But even that was so close to the bed that the doors hit the bed before fully opening. They had no dresser in the room to put clothes into drawers. All folded clothes had to stay in the suitcase or on top of the very small desk. On top of that, our view was across a small rooftop to other rooms of the same hotel. Their windows were probably 20 feet away and I could see people walking in their rooms so I'm sure they could see us. No way my wife will stay here again. Maybe an ok room for a businessman who comes in late for a dinner downtown and just needs a close bed to sleep in. I am giving it 3 stars because staff was very friendly. I can't believe people rate this hotel as high as they do. There HAS to be someplace better in downtown Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic and hip,"This popular hotel just adjacent to the newly renovated train station is one of our favorites in Denver.  The hotel maintains its historic charm in Denver's center of nightlife and entertainment.  A cool martini bar is located just off the lobby, a great spot to start the evening.  Staff is courteous and helpful, rooms and hallways are spacious.  Thanks, also for providing coffee right on the floors in the mornings.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Experience,"Thank you for the service of your friendly staff, especially the valets.  They were extremely helpful as we were unfamiliar with the area.  The hotel itself was very unique and an experience in itself.  We had a great time.  I would definitely recommend staying here if your in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great downtown location and cool hotel,"Great service, clean, old school, western type hotel. Could feel the history. Very comfortable beds. The location is great for walking around downtown to Union Station, the ball park or convention center.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic Hotel with Excellent Staff,"To step into the Oxford Hotel is to step back into the late 19th Century in Denver. From the ornate lobby to the antique furniture in the room you feel that you are a part of another era. The courtesy and efforts of all the staff to make our stay enjoyable were the highlight of our time at The Oxford.  We were on a budget for this stay and ended up with a very small room. On top of being small the room had a large table top desk, large office chair which took up an inordinate amount of space.  The room also faced the space between the two hotel wings which added to the closed in feeling.  If we stay here again we will pay more for a larger room with a view.Had it not been for the room size and obstacles we would have rated The Oxford a 5.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service","Perfect location. Walk to ball game, fantastic restaurants and bars. I recommend making dinner reservations in advance (especially in the weekend). Valet your car, and walk everywhere. Unless you are in heels for the evening. Then, ask the hotel's car service to take you to dinner (but let them know ahead of time...they book up and only have one car). Pedi-cabs are everywhere if you need a lift back. Service was fantastic. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are cleaned to perfection. If you are celebrating a special occasion, don't forget to tell them.The classic decor is a great contrast to the trendy restaurants and nightclubs, and might be the only hipster-free zone in the city.If you are in a room facing the street on a weekend night, you will want ear plugs. We heard nothing from other hotel guests, but the street noise would have kept us awake had we not had our ear plugs.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Top Notch Staff!!,My wife and I enjoyed our recent stay at the Oxford Hotel.  It was our first trip to Denver and we were very pleased with the location and our accommodations.  We had a very comfortable nicely decorated room. The staff was EXTREMELY friendly and helpful.  A GREAT bar in the lobby!,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Perfect Stay,"What a treat of a hotel!  My husband had never been to Denver, so I wanted our first visit together to be special - The Oxford Hotel provided 4 nights of bliss with an amazingly friendly and accommodating staff.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Staff!,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.  We stayed in a Junior Suite - the extra space was nice and I loved the classic decor. WiFi was strong - able to stream HD movie with My Amazon Fire Stick. The location of the hotel was very convenient - we were able to walk to the ballpark, Union Station, the 16th Street Mall, etc. The best part was the customer service. The staff was friendly, courteous, and helpful. I remember Leo and Stewart, but every staff member I interacted with was great. There is always someone in front of the building ready and willing to help. They have cold bottles of water on hand for guests as you leave or enter the hotel.Would definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great friendly staff! ,"The Oxford Hotel is gorgeous and the staff are very helpful and friendly.  I was in town for a convention so could have stayed closer to the convention center, but with the complimentary car service, Leo was happy to drop me off daily!  And, with a phone call back to the bellmen, they would come retrieve me after a long day of business meetings and activities.  Once back at my lovely Art Deco accommodations, I stepped into the Cruise Room to sip a delicious cocktail in a stunning setting ( and I sat where Jack White sat during his video filmed there! Extra bonus). I'll return to the Oxford undoubtedly!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Welcomed Comfort,"I arrived in Denver well after midnight. The hotel was very accomodating to my late arrival. The room was beautiful and the bed was comfortable. I usually have a difficult time sleeping in hotels, but the Oxford was an exception. The staff was very friendly and the hotel itself is beautiful. Breakfast was reasonably priced as well. My only problem was that I wish I could have stayed longer!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Friendly Staff,This hotel was amazing. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The hotel was close to everything. And the staff was amazingly friendly. They even made reservations for me after I checked out of the hote. Loved every minute of my stay here.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Favorite Hotel in Denver,"We travel to Denver once a year, and The Oxford is our hotel of choice.  It is conveniently located near Union Station, Coors Field, shopping, and a wide range of eateries.  The rooms are very comfortable, nicely decorated, and kept spotlessly clean.  The lobby is cozy, inviting, and has a treasure trove of western art on display.  However, the staff is what makes us choose the Oxford.  We are welcomed back by Dave and Stuart when we arrive at the door.  The staff on the desk is also very welcoming and check us in efficiently.  They genuinely want to make our visit pleasant, and they always make us feel special.  We visited Denver for several years before we found the Oxford, but now we won't stay anywhere else.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect Night,I purchased a night at the Oxford for my Parents stay in Denver and everything about it was flawless! Blaine at check in was so hopeful and made their stay comfortable and enjoyable. They will definitely recommend The Oxford to family and friends!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Kitchy Boutique Hotel, right in the middle of it all!","Loved this hotel!  We stayed here right around Halloween, which played right into the old victorian ghost stories and wild west tales.  The lobby is beautifully decorated with antique western sculptures and paintings.  And of course, all done up for hallows eve.  You're given this wonderful tassled key chain to your room.  They have a little canary by the check in desk, he and the Road King became fast friends.  The night clerk was charming, knoweledgable, and truly seemed to enjoy his job.  Our room was richly appointed with antique bed frame, cupboard and velvet chairs.  The location can't be beat, and the valets are extremely quick and helpful.  One of the best parts of the hotel is that the restaurants are run by McCormicks.  The drinks and dining from brunch, to all hours of the evening is top notch.  While we were there, they offered a fantastic happy hour, great prices for five star fare.  When in Denver, this will be our go to place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Denver Spring,"Took some time to go watch some baseball at Coors Field. After checking out hotels near the ballpark I settled on the Oxford as it was the most reasonably priced within walking distance. When I pulled up to the hotel I was greeted by the parking valet. He was friendly, courteous and happy. He immediately helped with my luggage and explained the valet system. At the front desk I was pleasantly greeted by the receptionist. She seemed genuinely pleased to see me and was very helpful being quite knowledgeable of the area and its attractions. In my entire stay I was made to feel welcome and special by all the staff. The room was clean, the bathroom spotless! Comfy bed with lots of great pillows. I would recommend this hotel and guarantee that when in Denver I will stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fabulous Location,"We recently spent 2 evenings here and loved the experience.  The facility is lovely and historic, very near Union Station.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Awesome Location, Super Staff, Old and sometimes a bit funky, but loved it.","We came with another couple for a visit to Denver and to go to a few baseball games at Coors field. We couldn't have been happier with the location and the wonderful and helpful staff. This hotel is old, so you do have to ""embrace"" the eccentricies of staying in an old hotel. We would definitely come back, it fit the bill to perfection for this trip. Everything we wanted to see on this trip was in walking distance so we didn't need to rent a car. A great four days in Denver, ant the Oxford was an integral part of it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming Oxford,We really enjoyed this charming authentic historical hotel. It is filled with all kinds of beautiful artifacts from Denver's rich history.

Finally, an escort vehicle was always available to take me anywhere in downtown Denver",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great for Business or Pleasure,"I stayed at this hotel on a recent business trip to Denver. Everything about the property was top notch - from the staff, to the room, the restaurants and the historic bar! It is also close to Union Station and all their fabulous restaurants.

"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,We love the Oxford,My husband and I stayed at The Oxford for the first two nights of our honeymoon last July. We arrived to friendly valet men. Friendly service all around! We were kindly and generously upgraded to a corner room. Everything was absolutely perfect. Our room was comfortable and beautiful. We hardly wanted to leave and it was not just because it was our honeymoon :). The Oxford is classy without being stuffy. It made us feel like we were stepping back in time but stepping up in  quality. We are so grateful for the experience we had at this hotel. It made the best day yet of our lives even more memorable. We will be back.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic Hotel,"The Oxford is a fabulous old building in the heart of revitalized downton Denver.  My room was large and quiet with a large tub and nice light.

Service was strong, the people were all nice and I enjoyed it greatly.",5

Love the charm of the doormen, mats in the elevator that tell you the day of the week, coffee and newspapers in the charming lobby in the morning. They always remember me and welcome me back. The bar in this hotel, to me, is one of the best in Denver. The Cruise Room just has incredible decor and excellent cocktails. Really fun. As an older hotel, the decor isn't standard ""Pottery Barn"" -- even a bit kitschy...but always very clean, well appointed and comfortable. They generally are very large rooms, with large comfortable beds and secondary seating. Great location with super restaurants and the new Union Station complex practically next door.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Always a great stay,"Once again the Oxford Hotel in Denver was a great stay.

The rooms were extremely spacious, plenty of room for our family of 4.  The front desk folks were very friendly and instantly made our kids feel welcome.  They informed us about all the fun things around to hotel to check out; some historical photos, a gorgeous ceiling, a special carpet and even Charlie the canary (whom my daughter particularly loved).  The location downtown was fantastic for us, as we were making a visit to Coors Field which was just a short walk away.  All in all a great place to stay, we would highly recommend it to anyone!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Location Great Hotel,"Charming, historic Oxford Hotel is the ideal place to stay in Denver. A block away from Union Station (a really fun place to eat and shop) and so close to everything you'll want to do in Denver.  The staff was fantastic.  Price is reasonable compared to other luxury hotels in Denver. Probably the most romantic place to have your wedding. Even if you just want a drink or some breakfast, stop by.  It's great.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Lovely Get Away in Denver!,The Oxford is a cute cozy friendly hotel in downtown! Close to everything and makes for an easy ride from the airport to Denver Union Station. It is a very close walk from the station and super close the Coors Field. We had a lovely stay. The room was very nice this is an old redone hotel and they did an excellent job. The restaurant was terrific we ate there 3 times. The staff were very helpful with all of our needs. The room was very quiet so sleep was great. We will stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel and staff,"we stayed at this hotel in April, it rocks!  Lots of character, been in business since 1890's, but well preserved.  Room was spacious, quiet, comfortable bed, all good.  Bath is small, but a great shower.Staff is friendly, front desk helped me with a room for quick conference call, valet staff got my car delivered every time fast.  We got great directions and recommendations for food and drink in the area, you are just a block away from Union Station, great food and drink.Got a huge exercise room, it was all good.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Amazing and wonderful staff, rooms a bit outdated","I stayed at the Oxford Hotel recently and really enjoyed my stay. If you want to take advantage of great restaurants, bars, and just the overall downtown lifestyle then the Oxford is the perfect location. Everything I ever needed was in walking distance which was wonderful. And the staff was so helpful and genuinely friendly. They were always offering a solution to any problem, and have great recommendations for me to explore the city. The gym and (free!) gym classes are also a nice bonus.The only downside to our trip was a small one. The rooms are just a bit outdated. (No fridge, microwave, exhaust fan in bathroom or even movie channels on the TV.) Not the worst thing in the world but for the price they were luxuries I had come to expect with the room. I would absolutely reccomend this hotel to anyone, as I would also recommend to update the rooms a bit!Thank you for a great stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic Charmer,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Oxford Hotel in Denver, Colorado. We were visiting for my son's wedding and were very pleasantly surprised by the uniqueness of this hotel.  It has an old world charm that almost makes you feel like you lived back in the days that it was built but with all the comforts of what you would expect from a modern hotel. The room was large and beautifully appointed with antique furniture, a fireplace and subway tile restroom.  We were especially impressed with the hotel staff.  They were extremely attentive to all of our needs.  I'd like to call out on person in particular by the name of Leo.  He brought up our bags, retrieved anything we requested and arranged transportation when we needed it.  We were quite impressed with his attention to detail. Another perk of the hotel is the free transportation via black SUV to destinations within two miles.  This came in very handy for us.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for a lovely stay for the weekend in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best hotel service I've ever experienced!,"It started off by us getting a room with one bed when we had requested two.  The front desk staff immediately corrected this and gave us an amazingly beautiful new room.Even better, Bell Captain Leo Krizan lugged our heavy bags from the first floor, to the second, and then to the fourth.  Leo was extremely helpful in making sure we had a ride to all of our events and made sure it was there on time. I have never experienced such amazing service and I will definitely be going back.  The hotel is not only historic, but it is breath taking and I am so glad I got to experience it.  Thank you to all the hotel staff for making our stay one we will always remember.  And Leo thank you for all you did while we stayed there.  5 star Bell Captain :)",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,AMAZING!,"Wonderful boutique hotel in the lower downtown area of Denver (LODO). My husband and I stopped for two nights on our way to aspen. Caught a Rockies game down the street (amazing stadium!). Leo was there to greet us on our way in, amazing service from start to finish. Check out the Cruise Room for a nightcap before calling it a night. Wonderful historic property and must see.  Jax across the street has best happy hr in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Not worth the $$$$,"My best friend had her wedding reception at the Oxford and it was completely overrated. The food was awful. We had a sit down dinner reception, I ordered a filet cooked medium, it was well done and tasted terrible, and it wasn't just me. Everyone in the room of 40 people complained about the food, one person even got sick. The rooms are not worth the price we paid to stay there. Bed not comfortable, amenities were so so. To top it off, you had to carry around this huge tassel thing on your key to your room. The only good thing I can say is the service was great, but most hotels where you are paying more than $200 a night are, so that didn't seem to be an advantage to them. We will NEVER stay at the Oxford again.",1
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great service, quality, and value in the heart of Denver","This was my first trip to Denver in many years, and I must say that the Oxford did not disappoint. The staff was extremely friendly across the board, but I must say that the bell man Leo was the highlight of the staff at the Oxford. My favorite part about the hotel was that it really had character, but still provided the modern comforts. The beds were especially nice.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic Elegance/Great Location,"I was looking for an established hotel near Coors Field in Denver and cam across The Oxford. The pictures on their website are accurate and the local area is full of upscale dining and shopping. We were celebrating out 1st Wedding Anniversary and they gave a free upgrade to the Presidental Suite. It is only a short walk to Coors Field and I highlly recommend going to a game while in town. Our valets, Dave and Stewart, were very helpful and could not do enough to make our stay a wonderful experience. Please try this hidden gem in downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful Weekend in Denver at the Oxford!,"I can not say enough good things about this hotel and especially about the staff!  I was in town to visit my daughter and look at some property.  I wanted to stay close to Union Station to get the feel of the area now that it is open.  The Oxford was a perfect choice blending an excellent location with the historic hotel and all if it's fun quirks. I stayed in a Junior Suite and was very happy with my room. It was a little smaller than it looked in the photos but was very comfortable.  My only strange incident was my shower got cold for a minute or two the first morning.  I was concerned with the age of the hotel how worn and clean it would be but it was immaculate and very well kept up. Because of the age of the hotel there are no ice machines, but they are very prompt in delivering ice to your room at your request.  Another pleasant surprise was free wi-fi.  Most ""distinguished"" hotels like to charge a lot - and it was really fast wi-fi - not the typical hotel kind. The hotel staff was outstanding.  From pulling up curbside to valet and check in to registration and beyond, everyone was very friendly and helpful.  I really felt like they cared about the quality of my stay.   Leo, at the front door was my favorite - he was so helpful and fun to chat with. I used the complimentary car service multiple times to go to dinner, to a meeting downtown and to meet with my realtor. I tried to schedule it in advance when I could but they were great about impromptu requests.  When I called to have them pick me up from dinner, I swear they were at the restaurant (about a mile away) before I could walk from the table to the door!I highly recommend this hotel for it's great location, luxurious accommodations & fabulous staff!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,60th birthday,"We stayed at your beautiful hotel this past weekend. The staff was wonderful, especially Leo! The concierge. So very helpful with everything. They all were, really. The bar in the hotel is beautiful. The location is perfect. Union station, restaurants, attractions and shopping. Will definitely return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fabulous hotel and superb staff!,"This hotel offers all the modern amenities you need with classic, old world charm.  The staff was always on point and always charming.  Dave and Stewart were our champions from advice on local fare to rides to and from the convention center.  The hotel is conveniently located to shopping and dining.   It is also located right next to Union Station, making getting to and from the airport easy.  There is a romantic charm about the hotel which tells me this hotel would be great for a weekend get away.  Hope to stay there again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Elegant History!,"We only had a 3 day stay here (as part of a whirlwind, cross country sprint visiting Law Schools with our daughter.)  We wanted an older hotel filled with Denver history rather than an expected national chain type.  Wow!  Over 120 years old with the creaky charm from a classic hotel, but with modern amenities.  Comfortable beds with antique wooden, charmingly mismatched furniture.  Real keys!  The Cruise Lounge Bar was the first to ""open"" (reopen???) the day after Prohibition ended.  Superb drinks expertly mixed (none of that theatrical free pouring nonsense.)  Glowing lobby with fireplace, deep comfortable chairs and an attentive, knowledgeable staff.  Would gladly stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Beautiful, classy hotel with a superb staff and ideal location","I spent a weekend at The Oxford with a group of over 20 people for a birthday celebration.  I was one of the last to arrive and the others in my group were already raving about our accommodations, the staff and the location of the hotel.  After settling in, I was in complete agreement.  I love the age and history of the hotel as well as the comfort, cleanliness and ambiance.  The walkability factor is also a big plus.  The hotel spa is lovely as well.  A special thanks to Leo and Carly for taking exceptional care of our group!  Carly spent time answering questions about some interesting hotel history and was personable and knowledgeable.  Leo made each of us feel like a guest of honor, took care of every detail needed and made it all look effortless.  He's a gem!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A truly wonderful hotel,"Upon arrival the very personable staff made me feel welcome and were extremely helpful and resourceful. They pointed me to a wonderful wine shop which was invaluable for entertaining my clients and guests. The elegantly historical presidential suite provided a memorable experience and was perfect for entertaining and meeting clients, but I could easily imagine returning for a romantic getaway. It is extremely spacious and boasts not one, but two fireplaces!The bathrooms were well appointed and immaculately clean. The decor is an elegant but understated nod to turn of the century Denver. I especially like the luxurious 4 post king sized bed which made for a good nights sleep. I look forward to another visit to Demver and a stay at Oxford Hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Sixty is Sexy,"Our exdperience was wonderful!  A big group of ladies came to celebrate my mother's 60th birthday.  All of the employees treated us as if we were the only guest.  Carly at the front desk made sure we all had coffee in my mother's suite in the am and took the time to tell us about the history of the hotel and area.  Leo at the front door got to know all of us personally and made sure that my mother felt like a queen.  He took the time to greet us personally everytime we saw him, he made sure if there was anything we need, he got it right away.  And the night security guard was very polite when we got to rowdy.  It was such a fun weekend for all and the hotel made sure to go the extra mile for us.  Having worked in the hotel industry myself, I was very impressed with everyone there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great Location, Exquisite Place","From the minute the valet parked our car and took our luggage, it was evident the staff here meant to please. Check in was handled in about 1 minute and we were given a late checkout due to a long wait for a breakfast table at Snooze. (Worth the Wait) The hotel provides transportation within 2 miles for those without a car. We have ridden the train in before and Union Station is just across the street. In room coffee, plush terry cloth robes, hair dryers, fabulous linens...all the amenities you expect from a nice hotel. Our rooms have always been on the street side which can be noisy at night. I'm sure, if asked, they could find us a quieter room, we just haven't been bothered by the noise. Great reading nook with books provided by Tattered Book Cover. Three restaurants within the building catering to every taste imaginable. Spa is amazing. Since the train station has opened, there is a plethora of places to shop and eat. Great location. Great place to stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A Delightful Experience!,"The Oxford is perhaps the best hotel for ambiance, food, staff, comfortable beds, and cleanliness that I have experienced in many years of travel.  The valets, Stewart and Dave, get rave kudos for their friendly helpfulness.  The hotel staff made sure that a special occasion my friends and I were celebrating would be one to remember!  And, indeed, it will be.  The antique furniture displayed throughout the hotel added to the historical flavor.  The close proximity to historical Union Station was a plus, also. Don't miss an opportunity to spend a night or two in this grand hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Elegant and historic in the heart of Denver,"My wife and I spent our anniversary at the Oxford.  What a perfect choice!  The hotel exudes elegance and charm.  The hotel is located right in the heart of downtown Denver near the new Union Station development and Coors Field.  Wonderful antiques in the room, hallways and lobbies along with historic photos of Denver give you a sense of the rich history of the more than 120 year old hotel.  The room was spacious and the bed comfortable with all the modern amenities present.  The staff was personable and welcoming.  We loved our stay and were reluctant to check out.  We will definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Couple,Best place i have stayed at in denver hands down. With testro at a very close second. Oldest hotel in denver. Huge clawfoot bathtubs and amazing shower. Feng shui was spot on. Incredibly helpful front desk. Courtesy car driver was so cheerfull.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Historic, charming, totally updated and well located","What a fun stay! This lovely, historic property has been updated in such a way that it hasn't lost any of its charm. The staff, some of whom have worked here for years (shout out to Stewart) make you feel welcome and valued. We loved the complimentary afternoon bourbon tasting and our quiet room. And if you like to walk in a downtown/shop/eat, you are right at the heart of it all.  Proximity to Union station, still a functioning train station and also now an uber cool shopping area, is a huge plus. Have breakfast at Snooze!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Outstanding Hotel,You are in for a treat when you stay here. This is an old hotel that is meticulously cared for. The rooms are updated and immaculate. The staff are so helpful and accommodating. The location is perfect for all that Denver has. Right next to Union Station. You won't be sorry staying here.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,First class all the way,"From the check-in staff to the cleaning personnel, everyone at The Oxford made us feel welcome. The location was excellent and the valets did a great job. We would stay here again and recommend it to anyone taking a trip to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historical building in a great location.,"Stayed here for a one day layover before catching a flight the next day. Located about a block from Union Station this hotel is in the perfect location. Took the RDA downtown and a short walk to the hotel. It's only a few blocks from Coors Field and the Shopping of 16th Street, as well as having a good variety of bars and restaurants in the area.The hotel itself is in a historical building, but is very clean and up to date. The staff, every person we dealt with, was very courteous, helpful and friendly. This is somewhere I would definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classy all the way,"We had an excellent stay at The Oxford Hotel.  Our room was spacious and comfortable, and the bathroom was ample size.  The hotel, itself, was quiet, though there was late night noise outside but that's to be expected in that part of town.  Speaking of which, the location of the hotel was terrific.  We liked exploring shops and bars at Union Station, and The Tattered Cover Bookstore is right around the corner.  Service at the hotel was friendly and classy, just the right amount of attention.  One tip: check out the floor of the elevator each day for a unique surprise!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Classic elegance,"Stayed Sunday/Monday nights and Union Station/LoDo area was fairly quiet and fun to explore. The Oxford is maintained nicely with wear showing but this hardly matters. Excellent staff & everything that is important in a stay is quality. If you need larger bathroom space--request. Very small shower, no tub in some rooms.  Pricey valet parking but not much choice anywhere in this area. Easy walking to food, coffee, union station, tattered book store, etc.  We will return.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect St. Patrick's Day weekend,"Just returned from our sixth year in a row staying at the Oxford for the St. Patrick's Day parade weekend. The Oxford is our favorite hotel in Denver. From the second you arrive and are greeted by Leo the valet, you feel so at home. The rooms in this hotel which was built in 1891 are amazing and so are the staff. We highly recommend you give the Oxford a try, and I bet you'll be hooked.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Pit stop at the Oxford,"Stopped at the Oxford for 2 days before beginning a ski trip with friends.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful, but what set the hotel apart in my mind was the terrific staff!  ""Whatever you want,Leo Getz!""  Anything you need is a phone call away.  The gym set up was spectacular! The hotels rich history shows throughout the building. A must visit!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A great first night on our Colorado trip.,"We went skiing at the main CO ski resorts and stayed for one night. Together with the Brown Palace, the Oxford is one of the best hotels in Denver. We had a large room and the beds were very comfy. Wifi was for free and the lobby is a nice place to sit down and meet other guests. They have a real fire there, not that fake sh**.... The hotel is close the the main train station and other public transportation and the 16th street mall is close by (there's a free shuttle) Pepsi Centre is a 10 minutes walk. The McCormicks restaurant downstairs is a great place to eat and they have a very nice happy hour selection every day. I can recommend the Oxford the everyone and we will be back for sure! The service is outstanding! A big minus is, that the breakfast is not includet in the price.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oldest and Best Hotel in Denver,"We booked this hotel on Hotwire.com and got it by default for about half off the rack rate. It exceeded our expectations. Everything was perfect! We took an AFS bus from DIA to Union Station and when you exit the the train station, the Oxford is just a half block away. The front desk clerks were all very helpful and friendly. We were given a free upgrade.The room was furnished with antiques and had a fireplace. Most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept on. Rooms are quiet. This is the oldest hotel in Denver  (1881) and has been restored to it’s original appearance. McCormick’s Fish House is adjoining and has a great inexpensive breakfast. One block over on 16th street is the free Mall Bus. The hotel also has a free car service (a new Cadillac Escalade!). We highly recommend this property. I promise, no disappointments.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Incredible,"It was my first time staying at the Oxford. The staff, Tiffany, Derrick, Dave and all the other staff went above and beyond any expectations to provide the highest quality service. I observed several staff of the hotel treat all the guests with the utmost respect and concern. They bell captain and his staff made themselves available to provide suggestions to me and my wife during our stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Always Great,This was a last minute decision to head to Denver and my first choice always is to stay at The Oxford Hotel. Between the amazing front desk to the fabulous divers/bellman to the wonderful spa and fitness area....there is nothing missing! Everything is more than perfect!I cannot wait for the next visit to Denver. I will be staying with my friends at The Oxford Hotel soon!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historic and awesome!,"I am in Denver at least once per month and always try to stay at the Oxford. The location is perfect to walk to nearly everything. A historic hotel that was renovated the right way, preserving the charm but with all the updated things you need. The Cruise Room is always fun, great service and great people. Every time I come back, even if it has been 3-4 weeks, the staff always remember who I am and what I like. If you haven't stayed here you should.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The doorhops made the experience above average!,"I was very impressed with the Denver Oxford Hotel.  The staff was incredibly nice and accommodating.   Leo was the best doorhop! He was quick to always help us with our belongings,  with transportation around Denver to recommendations on places to go.  I left some of my belongings in the dresser when I was there and the hotel was more than nice about it and I received my items with a couple of days from submitting my lost and found claim online.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The Best Place to Stay in Denver!,"I travel into Denver frequently for work and always stay at The Oxford Hotel. I found this initially because it was within walking distance to work and I will continue to stay here because of the above-average service and unique charming setting. The rooms are just beautiful and have an old-world charm but are still modern, clean and well kept at the same time.  If you don't want to leave the hotel, the food options are fantastic and there is even a trendy bar downstairs as well.  What really sets this place apart is their service.  Everyone who works at the hotel is so friendly and accomodating. Recently my small children tagged along with me to Denver and I was blown away with how accommodating they were to young kids.This hotel is very centrally located and within walking distance to  almost everything.  If you're looking for a wonderful place to stay in Denver, look no further!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Anniversary Weekend,"Shared a weekend at the Oxford Hotel Denver celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary. The hotel surprised us with champagne but that wasn’t be main reason we rate this experience so high. The hotel is very historic in nature. Our room was spacious, the bed very comfortable and overall very clean and enjoyable. McCormick’s was great for diner and breakfast. Location was close to the 16th St. Mall free bus which took us to theater and elsewhere up and down 16th street. Staff were friendly and helpful. Overall a stellar weekend!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing Customer Service,"We only stayed two nights in a beautiful one bed room on the second floor. Everything is so charming about this place. The doormen are amazing, they aren't serious and stern all the time, they're very personable and helpful (even though I'm sure the poor guys were cursing at me in their minds when I asked for my car, then told them I didn't need it.....) They bust their tails in the cold and should all get a pay raise. ;) the front desk people were extremely helpful, we asked if we could put our leftovers in a fridge somewhere and they sent a mini fridge up to our room. There was a mixup on the breakfast and the girl delivering apologized profusely. The location is amazing, if you want a fun and cool downtown experience, stay here!!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Blaine was very helpful!,"You can't get a better location and the service and amenities are great!  We visit here often when and the service and environment is always really good. Recently we had to work late in denver, after a long day and being exhausted from a photoshoot Blaine at the front desk took a load off our shoulders worth incredible customer service!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Service, character, and location set it apart","I don't know what I can add to other reviews: What a great hotel! We had 2 rooms for a family get-together and we loved the Oxford. The front door and desk staff could not have been more gracious and accommodating - maps, restaurants, water bottles, everything. Rooms were spacious, clean and full of charm (although don't expect views out your window).The hotel is in a super location - we walked and took public transport everywhere. Didn't even need to rent a car. Our new favorite place in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Not what I expected, in a good way!","The doormen in ""Downton Abbey"" attire welcome you to this old but classic hotel. Rooms are nicely sized. Fireplace in the lobby. Escalade service within 2 miles. Great location to everything downtown. Note: elevator rugs change daily. :)",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Beautiful, comfortable place to stay","The restoration of the hotel is magnificent and my room was very comfortable, everything worked fine.  The lobby is impressive.  Rates are acceptable considering the location and rates at nearby hotels.  I came by train and it's very convenient to the main station - about 1/2 block.  Very convenient to the light rail station to go anywhere in the Denver metro area.  A very good restaurant is located in the hotel, and there's lots of other choices within easy walking distance.  The whole LODO area has been nicely restored with lots of activity.  I'm definitely planning a return visit.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Simply wonderful,"My husband and I stayed at the Oxford for our anniversary last year and this year, and it only gets better and better.  The staff is respectful and helpful, the rooms are unique and comfortable, and the location couldn't be better.  We walked around Union Station, explored different restaurants in the neighborhood, and loved the couples massage and facials we scheduled at the Oxford Spa.  The best part was room service for breakfast and the late check out time the hotel staff agreed to.  It was relaxing and lovely.  A treat you should one day enjoy.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Old world class,"Have just left this beautiful old hotel. Loved the old world charm and great service. Very comfortable bed. Just needed a kettle and tea in our room. Great food at the restaurant, we had a lovely meal with great service.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Old-World Hotel,"Located within a block of the newly renovated Union Station, the Oxford Hotel is situated perfectly for any visitor wanting to experience downtown Denver. There are many great restaurants in the neighborhood and the walking mall is only a few blocks away. When the light rail system to the airport is completed, it will be trivial for visitors to access this hotel when flying in. Our room was furnished in period pieces, but even though the hotel is more than 120 years old, it has been fully updated. The staff is friendly, the rooms very clean and the beds comfortable. The room rates seem to be a bit below those of the Crawford, which is inside Union Station, so we will choose to stay here, since it's almost as convenient.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Absolutely Love Staying at The Oxford,"When staying in Denver, The Oxford is my first choice. Absolutely beautiful hotel, perfect location, georgous rooms, amazing bedding, oustanding staff.  If you are on the fence about choosing a hotel, look no further.  Thank you for being exceptional.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Good location, friendly staff, unique hotel","The Oxford Hotel is justifiably proud of being ""the oldest hotel in Denver."" It has kept its elegance without sacrificing comfort or being overly cute with ""Western"" or ""Victorian"" details. (That said, the wide halls built to accommodate hoop skirts were noteworthy!). Our room was a ""deluxe"" level and looked out on the street (no noise to speak of, even though it was a three-day holiday weekend as well as Valentine's Day). In retrospect, I probably would have opted for one of the rooms with a stand-up shower, as getting into the tub to use the overhead shower (which was easy to work) felt slightly treacherous (no handgrip). Staff were friendly and attentive. We used the available free car service (2 miles or less travel) to get to a friend's house. They did not have a mini-bar in our room, although we didn't need one. The location is great--right down the street from Union Station (which will up its game even more very shortly once rail to the airport is completed). It is also right around the corner from the Tattered Cover, a book lovers' mecca. Lots of good restaurants in the area, too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great weekend getaway,"Stayed at the Oxford for the first time Valentine's weekend 2015.  Beautiful comfortable room, excellent service from the bell service to desk service and room service.  A fantastic historic hotel that has its history all the way back to the late 1800's.  Be sure to look at the old photos on the hallway walls throughout the hotel.Will definitely do it again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fabulous Stay!,"We booked the Oxford through hotwire (luckily!!) and loved it. Friendly staff, quick check in and valet parking *(which ended up being the exact same price that it cost our friends who parked themselves in the same garage). Our room was on the 5th floor and was absolutely gorgeous. Decorated with an antique style and so clean and spacious. We felt like royalty. The bathroom was on the smaller side but was clean and bright so we didn't mind a bit. The best part of our stay was the shuttle service they offered us to get over to Williams & Graham (the speakeasy) in a black escalade. They took us promptly and came back to pick us up 5 minutes after we called. What an awesome amenity!!! If you get the chance... stay here!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Awesome Boutique Hotel in an Awesome Location,"I don't often stay at boutique hotels, and I was not the traveller who booked this one, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The decor was old but in a good way. The rooms were very comfortable and clean, and had more of a 'house' feel than a hotel (also a good thing). Staff were incredibly helpful and happy to accept our tradeshow delivery boxes and store them for us behind the front desk before we arrived. The doormen were all very pleasant and friendly (we got to speak to them a lot as we are smokers). The location is fantastic, there is a coffeeshop next door and pretty much anything you need within a couple of blocks (walking distance). If you have a car then that's even better, as you are in the heart of Denver and have a ridiculous amount of awesome food choices around you, shopping, etc. (PS- I Love Denver). All around a very pleasant, almost regal experience at the Oxford. Huge fan and will definitely stay again next time we're in town.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Really cool old hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Oxford. Our room was huge, the bed was insanely comfortable, & it was in a great location. The shower was a little on the small side, but the bathroom was beautiful & really nice. The staff was very friendly, & we liked the ""old style"" keys - no key cards here. I'd stay here again no question.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A gem of a hotel,"The Oxford is one of my favorite places to stay. It has character and class. It is NOT just another forgettable warehouse of rooms. Each room is different,  complete with charming touches. I love this hotel and stay here every time I come to Denver on business. The wood fireplace, lobby, and service staff cannot be beat.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Shhh...the Oxford Hotel is the best kept Secret in Denver,"The Oxford and I have shared a variety of relationships over the past decade, from meeting rooms for Company business to overnight rooms for Holiday guests to being a guest myself when I was relocated out-of-state five years ago.  In each and every situation, I have found the staff to be above and beyond any other in the hospitality industry, period.  The bellmen - Stewart and John, specifically, remember me from year to year even though I only frequent the hotel twice annually. They've been with the hotel longer than me!  The front desk staff (Blake) is amazing and don't forget to greet Charlie, the canary, when you check in.I feel like I am walking into a distant era each time I walk into the lobby - a time of gentility and pride in craftsmanship, a time of beauty and grace, a time when care and kindness meant a personal touch.  This is the Oxford, where time stood still.  They carefully selected all the good things from the past and made them work for today.  I am overjoyed!  The rooms are elegant and user-friendly, not stuffy. This is a gem of a hotel for a 'real person' who appreciates the finer things in life.  I really hope that you take a peek into the lobby to see for yourself, just don't book a room when I'm planning to come to town!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"The Oxford Hotel, Denver",We enjoyed our stay at the Oxford Hotel. We had flown in from Detroit to Denver and wanted a hotel near the train station as we were leaving on the train the next morning.  The Oxford hotel was perfect! Everyone was so nice there. The room was very nice. It was easy to walk to the train station the next morning and we walked around and saw some of Denver the evening we arrived there. There was always someone at the front desk and a doorman to open the door for you.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A downton gem,"We were taking the California Zephyr in the morning and stayed at the Oxford the night before to be close to Union Station, located a half-block from the hotel. Our brief stay was one of the highlights of our trip! The hotel is elegant and beautiful, everyone on the staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the room was immaculate and inviting. It's easy to see why so many presidents and celebrities have chosen the Oxford for their stay in Denver. In particular we'd like to thank Leo at the front door, our kids loved him. The hotel bar and restaurant are first rate and the night life in the area is vibrant and fun with something for everyone. Thank you Oxford staff, we loved this historic gem.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Awesome Stay in Denver,"Amazing stay, spent two non-consecutive nights at the Oxford. Staff extremely friendly, went above and beyond to fulfill the needs of four friends on a ski trip. Rooms are nice and spacious, location is great. But what sets this place apart is its people. If I am ever in Denver again, I won't consider any other option; I'm going straight to the Oxford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel; Excellent Staff!,"Went for a 5 day getaway in the Denver area and loved this old style, renovated hotel.  Beautiful front desk area, proper keys that you can leave at the desk when you wander around the city.  The location is central to everything.  Catch a bus at Union Station, walk to a number of restaurants, and if you want shopping, it was just a short walk (about a block) to catch the free bus (Free Mall Bus) that takes you up and down 16th.  The hotel has a car that will drop you off anywhere in a 2 mile radius.  If you're going farther, the concierge/bell-hops will get you set up fast and easy.  The room itself had ample space for the two of us, a wonderful king sized bed, and a nice bathroom with shower/bath.  The floors creaked as you would expect in an older building, but we could not hear creaking or sounds from the other rooms.  All of the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Proper shout-outs to Stewart and Leo at the concierge, they really took care of us with getting setup, travel, advice and more.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel; Great stay!,"Went to Colorado for a long weekend getaway and found the Oxford Hotel to be very charming.  Great location within walking distance to restaurants, bars, Union Station, Snooze, and shops.  Loved our room and the decor.  The hotel bar was perfect, too!  All staff were friendly and accomodating.  Especially enjoyed the 24hour shuttle service within a 2mile radius.  Most hotels have them till about 11 or midnight but they run their service at all hours.  Enjoyed the spa for massages, steam room, etc.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed for 5 nights for business. It's a heritage hotel but room size was still ample and bathroom bigger than expected. Super comfortable bed. Front desk and lobby creates a cool, effortless vibe with it's seating areas, fireplace and proper keys on tassels. Gym bigger and better than many large hotels. Free Steam room a nice amenity.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best of LoDo Denver,"We found the staff, exercise facility, and Spa to be first rate.  This is a renovated old hotel that is easy to access from the highway.  Our corner room was elegant, and with double sinks.  The lounge off the lobby, the Cruise Bar was fun.  The breakfasts were fabulous at the McCormick's restaurant.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Not suited for everyone,"This is based on a old hotel style, while charming and pretty, the hotel lacks anything that hotels didn't have back in the 1900'sNo hot tub, pool, gym,If you like arts and history, then you might like itService is great though.You can always find the missing amenities, at the Union station hotel nearby, but then again, why not book there to begin with?3 stars",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful weekend in the city,"We stayed at the Oxford Hotel while attending a show at the Buell Theater. Very accomodating staff, especially the Bell Captain and Courtesy Car driver. The hotel is old but well maintained and modernized. Spacious, clean room, comfortable bed, just what we needed. It is close to the Union Station which has many restaurants, coffe shops, stores etc. Also walking distance to Larimer Square. If you like old world class and comfort this is it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,excellence overall,"Outstanding service from everyone. I was there for a couple of busy days of an intense class and the contrast of the welcoming, cozy old hotel where I could rest and recharge made the quick trip enjoyable. They took me to my class nearby in the mornings, so no worries about extra transportation. I'd taken the city skyride airport shuttle bus to Union Station which is a short walk from the hotel, but they were happy to come pick me up since I was having some physical challenges walking. That just made the entire experience so much easier for me. Very comfortable bed. Wonderful deep tub to relax in. Enjoyed the steam room by the gym. Dinner and several breakfasts in the restaurant were all delicious. Will definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautifully restored hotel with top of the line service,"This is one of the oldest hotels in Denver, and they've kept the period style with beautiful antiques throughout. When I arrived the lobby was still decorated for Christmas, and it was charming. The staff was warm and welcoming. And then they went above and beyond. When I wasn't feeling well the next day they brought me a tray with chicken broth, plain rice, Gatorade and other items purchased outside the hotel - at no charge!! And wait, there's more. The day I left, the bellman hand carried my luggage across the street into Union Station. I have never received more personal service - and genuine kindness - during my travels.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nice historic hotel,"Said to be the oldest hotel in Denver.  From the outside not much to see, but inside it is a quaint hotel that definitely feels like you have stepped back in time.  There's a wood burning fireplace and old fashioned front desk where you can check your brass room key in and out.  Rooms are comfortable, but you should be aware that the walls are a bit thin and floors creak.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming Hotel,"The Oxford is the oldest hotel in Denver and though small, is quite charming.  The rooms are cute and the bedding very clean and fresh.  Great location near the 16th street mall and free bus.  The staff were friendly and helpful, and pointed us on our way to a wonderful two days in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Not In The winter ! Understaffed and Freezing ,"Nice location nice decor but Room 404 is freezing cold , noisy and they promise to fix termostate but don't . At our arrival the impression was they are understaffed. No one to take our luggage at the car. Never again. For this money I could do much betterAnd I am on this business",2
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,So great we didn't want to leave,"If we were to dream up a nearly perfect hotel for our young family, The Oxford Hotel would hit pretty close to the mark. Everything was so great during our 4-night stay that we tried to extend our stay another night, only to find out the hotel was fully booked.The Oxford strikes the right balance between all the luxuries of a large upscale chain hotel (comfortable beds, robes and slippers, and evening turndown service) while also having the charm and curiosities of a small boutique or even a B&B (keys with tassels instead of keycards, haunted room on the 3rd floor, friendly and courteous staff).And not to mention the location in LoDo, which puts you in walking distance to a whole bevy of great restaurants, bars and shops. Maybe the best of all is you're a stone's throw from the wonderfully renovated Union Station. We were very pleased with our stay and definitely hope to be back soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fabulous Holiday Hotel,The Oxford Hotel is a quaint yet modern hotel with a fabulous staff and location in Downtown Denver.  Loved the restaurant and bar options.  The hotel was was well decorated for a holiday celebration. The luxury spa was a nice addition and I would highly recommend their services.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Loved this Hotel!,"First time in Denver and had an amazing time! Hotel was amazing, staff was super friendly and helped us out with stuff to do in and around Denver! Great location! Room was giant and very clean! Valet was fast and friendly! Will be back every time I'm in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent stay,Loved it all! Will be returning. Staff was very attentive. The room and amenities were very good. 4-5 star hotel in downtown worthy of going to 5. The house car was a great perk. The lobby was always busy which is a great sign.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Christmas Vacation,This hotel was wonderful. The facility is clean and the staff are all very helpful! We had a little trouble with our neighbors talking late into the night and the front desk offered to comp our breakfast. It was a very nice gesture and made the trip that much more enjoyable. I would stay at this hotel again in a minute! It is very conveniently located and just beautiful!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Overnight Stay,"Took the overnight train from Chicago on way to a ski trip and stayed at Oxford Hotel for one night - loved the hotel, staff, breakfast, wood burning fireplace, neighborhood and especially the walk over from the train! Used the courtesy car to visit the Still Museum and it was very prompt. Lots of good recommendations from staff - Tattered Page bookstore, Wyncoop Brewery, Duffy Rolls and great barber across the street. So much to do in one day - can't wait to return for more fun!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent downtown hotel!,"I wanted something special for my family in Denver for Christmas, and, after searching many web-sites, decided on the Oxford Hotel.  The hotel itself is a vintage structure, however, well-maintained, comfortable and stylish.  The rooms were first-rate, with fixtures that fairly sparkled.  Equally impressive was the staff!  Everyone we came in contact with radiated their pride in working at the hotel!  Everyone seemed genuinely pleased to make our visit as pleasurable as possible.  It is truly an exquisite hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,First time it Colorado!,From the moment I pulled up to the curb till checkout EXCELLENT SERVICE!!   The Valet were awesome & helpful. So quick taking my car & dropping off! (& patience with my drop off & pickup often on one day!!).   The desk personnel were awesome too.  Loved my room. And especially loved the gym!   We enjoyed The Oxford Hotel very much!  Hope to come back someday.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A great experience,"I'd been wanting to stay here since I first ate at McCormick's 20 years ago. I finally had the time and money as my wife and I celebrated a milestone in our lives.  We booked the Park & Stay package for one night and it was wonderful.  The hotel is splendid, of course.  Old world, great attention to detail, and historic décor that is comfortable and welcoming.  All this was great, but it was the service that made the experience.  Staff expressed a genuine sense of caring, as opposed to a corporate efficiency or ""fake-nice"" that's not uncommon even in expensive hotels.  Each hotel staff person we talked with answered our questions and accommodated our every need, then followed up when they saw us later.  Their respect and caring for the quality of our stay seemed genuine.  The Park & Stay package enabled us to get a ride back from the restaurant we ate at not far from downtown, and the service was quick and friendly.  We enjoyed a nightcap in The Cruise Room Bar, where the atmosphere, service, and our martini's were superb.   The Oxford Hotel is more expensive than we can generally afford, but the price was fair and the experience was totally worth it.  I hope we can stay again in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,My Denver Favorite,"The first time I stayed at the Oxford hotel was in 1983 when I had an early train to catch.  It was an absolutely charming place then and remains so.  The rooms are good sized and decorated with period charm, but have all the modern comforts with especially comfortable beds.  Downstairs, the lobby is a great place to relax and people watch.  The workout facilities are top notch and the steam room is Gatsby size.  Treat yourself to a massage before heading out for a fun evening in downtown Denver.  I stay at the Oxford whenever I am in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,World Class Hotel & Experience,"This place is incredibly special. Top notch service from the moment you pull up and Stewart (17-yr veteran employee) greets you and makes you feel like an all star. Then the warm personal touch that Karly and the front desk staff offer as they explain the historic charm of the hotel and get you checked in and on your way to your room...is simply one of a kind. The rooms are all different and unique, exhibiting the historic charm that comes with a hotel that's been around since 1891. They clearly have an antique feel, but remain very well appointed and offer classy understated modern amenities. This is not a just a place to stay if you're needing a place to sleep while visiting Denver; there are plenty of cookie-cut chain hotels in the area to suit that purpose. This hotel is an experience in and of itself! Highly recommended for those special occasions and romantic get-aways. And it's position perfectly in downtown Denver to have access to anything and everything you'd want. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. After staying there just once, you'll never want to stay any place else in Denver...no matter what your purpose for visiting the city is. Great restaurant and bar/lounge too. World class!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Beautiful, Historic Hotel","This hotel is beautiful! In keeping with the fact that this is the oldest hotel in Denver, the decor is of the era, but with all the modern conveniences! The hotel lobby is all decked out right now in all it's Christmas splendor! We had drinks in The Cruise Bar, built in the 1920's, after prohibition. It's so fun! We had a blast! The hotel is right beside the Union Station and a quick walk to the 16th street mall. Staff is impeccable and everyone is friendly, and helpful. I will come back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,What a great experience!,Everything exceeded our expectations!  The hotel is beautiful and charming and in a great location.  The service was excellent and the staff was very attentive.  We also had dinner at McCormicks which was really good.  We would highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,We will be back to sit by the cozy fireplace!,"Loved this hotel, it's cozy lobby decorated beautifully for Christmas, the friendliness and professional staff and the McCormick fish restaurant and bar which was hopping on sat night!  Location perfect for walking to nearby 16th at mall and restaurants!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Top shelf,"Everyone and everything was top shelf. Check with Leo one of the doormen for anything. Seems I've got to fill up 200 spaces so ... We had a great time, with great service. Mccormicks restaurant nextdoor is outstanding. Really if you need anything see Leo. Check out his new truck. The Oxford rocks!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A great experience and the complimentary limousine was a bonus,"This is the oldest hotel in Denver and has two styles of rooms - Victorian and Art Deco. We stayed in a Victorian room which was large with a Queen sleigh bed and beautifully tiled bathroom. We did not have the safe and fridge which we were expecting. However the reception and lobby were beautifully decorated for Christmas and the blazing log fire was very welcoming. A special word of praise for the bell boys - these engaging young men, smartly dressed in bow ties, went out of their way to help with information about the local area and seemed genuinely interested in what we had been doing. In addition the hotel offers the complimentary use of a limousine, driven by the bell boys, to locations within two miles which covers the downtown area.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Different Can Be Better!,"We stayed at the Oxford for the very first time this December. Friends we met Downtown stayed at another hotel property. When we shared our experience, their hotel was, "" a hotel room."" The Oxford is not, we took our friends back to the hotel. Our room was larger than most hotel rooms. It felt like a bedroom, not an office space with a bed, high ceiling with large chairs make the room appealing.  Our friends mentioned, ""Now this is a nice room!"" We drifted down to the lobby fireplace with our bottle of wine, the front desk provide our guests the extra glasses. The hotel also offered to shuttle our guests back to their hotel as the night was coming to a close, it was a nice touch! The hotel is connected with a great bar and a good restaurant, we had breakfast, fast, filling, delicious. Free car parking downtown was included, which saves $18. Location is good, because it is in the quieter part of downtown, which can get noisy on the weekends. I hope this helps with your decision, let me know. I think you will enjoy the difference.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Good Location and Decent Little Hotel,I was in Denver for a week and stayed at this hotel. It's got a lot of history to it with antique finished and furniture.Certain pieces of furniture were a little dirty for example the TV Wood stand / Coffee Stand were a little sticky with previous spill overs but that's the only downside.Location wise it was perfect close to all the shops and restaurants. With easy access to the Mall.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful hotel but disappointing service,"I stayed at the Oxford on my wedding night - obviously a pretty special occasion.  There were mix-ups upon check-in where we were sent to a room category below what we'd booked and paid for, but we eventually sorted it out and the bell staff were very helpful and professional.  However, the next morning was a little bit of a disaster - all we wanted the morning after our wedding was room service breakfast, and to make a long story short, two hours' worth of back and forth failed communication with room service ended up in us missing the breakfast deadline.  My husband and I still recount the details of this two hours with disbelief; I will spare the reader the full version, but say that we only wanted a full menu as opposed to the doorknob menu (and the directory in the room had only dividers in it - no menus or information on anything).My sister and I also did hair and makeup in the Oxford spa for my wedding day, and while my experience was good, my sister's was not.Because of all this, I asked upon check-out for a place to give feedback and someone hand wrote an email onto a general business card and gave it to me, which seemed strange to me but I figured there had been recent turnover.  I eventually wrote to this address in great detail about the service issues I'd experienced during my stay, and am very disappointed to say I never got any reply from this person.  They must have received it because I was contacted by the spa manager seeking some more details about my experience there (without any subsequent follow-up to my response) but that was the only time anyone reached out.We are pretty easy going people, and I will admit that my standards and expectations were higher because it was such a special day.  But now my primary complaint is not the clumsy service issues we experienced during our stay; it's that my feedback received no response from the hotel, except for the one from the spa seeking more details.  I will also say that we seriously considered the Oxford for our wedding, and found the event staff with whom we dealt to be extremely top notch and service oriented.  However, after our experience and especially the lack of response to my feedback, I'm glad we didn't end up there for our wedding.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Unique hotel with great service,"Loved our stay at the Oxford! Unique, individual rooms gives so much charm in this historic building. Not your ordinary hotel. The service was outstanding from the valet, bell and front desk check in. Great location, close to everything.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect!,We hosted our daughters wedding at the Oxford and it couldn't have been more perfect!  We had quite a few guests staying there with us for the weekend and had so many compliments  from them about how we chose the best venue ever!  Everyone at the hotel was friendly and very accommodating!  It was so warm and cozy and welcoming. The beds and pillows were the most comfy I've ever experienced and would really like to know what they were so I can replicate the feeling at home.  I'll always remembere that weekend as the best ever!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Experience at The Oxford,"We stayed at The Oxford Hotel in Denver and had a great experience. The staff was really welcoming and attentive. Further, it's a beautiful hotel with a very ornate style that doesn't come off as stuffy at all. It's walking distance to a very beautiful train station, some really delicious restaurants (thinking of Snooze), and some craft beer bars. We stayed in the winter, and it had an especially cozy ambience to it. Beautiful, ornate, and not pretentious in the least.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Exceptional Stay & Staff!,We came to the hotel to view the property for a potential wedding venue. We were upgraded to a suite and given first class service the entire time! We are now planning to get married there so our family and friends can experience the luxury of the historic property as well as be treated like royalty by the staff. The food was awesome too from the bar to the restaurant to the room service! Can't wait to be back and celebrate many anniversaries to come at the Oxford!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Location, location, location.","Although this has not the poshest hotel I have ever stayed at, I had the best time at this one.  My hubster and I arrived at 8 am. The desk people were the best. They had a room ready. And when we asked for a delayed checkout,they accommodated.   Customer service is the best. You can't go wrong.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Best front door concierge in Denver!,"After a long travel day back to Denver from South America and a great vacation, we came home to a dead battery in the car.  We had parked in the car at my office and used Uber to get back to the city from the airport.  Excited to be home, and pissed when the car didn't start, we walked to the Oxford Hotel and grabbed a room.  This Hotel has been great to me for over 20 years since I first started staying there.  They had us in the room in 5 minutes and at a very reasonable walk in prices.  I highly recommend this place and is my suggestion on my business website for visiting partners.After a great restful evening, the gents at the door had the car jumped via their ""handy dandy"" jumper unit in 5 minutes.  These guys set the bar for help with a smile.  Thank you both, you guys made Wednesday before Thanksgiving a great day for our family.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,A fun time,"We go to Denver regularly and like to try different interesting hotels. This time it was Oxford and we had lots of fun. The location, a block from Union Square, was excellent with lots of good restaurants nearby. The hotel lobby is beautiful, its history as the oldest hotel in Denver and it renewal during the transformation of LODO are all nice features.We stayed in a corner room that was spacious with a nice mix of funk and comfort. There was a comfy bed that was a bit odd in that the bed was CA King and the mattress was regular king. Nice comforter and good solid mattress.The bathroom included a big claw foot tub for two (also had a shower) that was very nice. The decor was very pleasant and appropriate for the context. The martini bar looked fun but it was too crowded for us to be able to enjoy a drink. Next time.The gym is very complete, it is a health club as well as hotel gym. Plenty of cardio and complete free weights and machines. There is even a room for classes and spinning.There is a little landing area with a reading library with books from Tattered Cover, Denver's famous bookstore, which has a store a couple blocks from the hotel.Parking was valet and $34.This is a different experience than a Brown Palace type boutique, funkier and informal. I would not hesitate to return.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,And More,"First off, we had to change our reservation from September to October and it was handled well and without much fuss, thank you.The bedding in the room was one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in, with just the right amount of softness and firmness to keep my back happy. Also, the number of pillows was well just excellent and was happy with the choices.I also liked that they have made an attempt to try and keep an authentic period ambiance to the room and hotel. The shower was huge and nice. Only a tiny complaint but this has to do with lots of boutique hotels: The Sink. I find it funny how there is either no room, or the sink does not catch all the water. Here the first part was a bit of a problem. We ended up putting our necessares where the towels would go. There is definitely room for a small shelf, which would be most appreciated. Again, small small detail.Now for the More. We left something rather important with the hotel that ended up getting lost. Tiffany went above and beyond the call of duty, and it was most appreciated. This is what makes the difference in staying in a hotel that matches up with everyone else. Service!!! Also, the cleaning staff were just so nice and friendly, was also nice how well we were treated.We would be more than happy to stay here again, no question!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Cool place in great location,"Right in the Lodo (Lower Downtown) section of Denver, a block from train and bus stations, the Oxford was right where we wanted to be. The staff was as helpful as you'd find in a B&B. The doorman directed us to great area restaurants. We really liked some of the other details like real keys kept at the desk and day-of-the-week rugs in the elevators. Our ArtDeco room wasn't overstylized but also wasn't the same room you would find in every other hotel. The room was compact, but suited our needs and budget perfectly. Excellent value.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Could easily be a great hotel - but isn't.,"I stayed at the Oxford Hotel this week.  I noticed some of the rave reviews on this site.  I agree the service was fine, the beds were good, overall the room was appointed well.  But I stayed in room 505 for one night and have to say it had the filthiest carpet that I ever saw in a hotel.  Changed to room 403 and it was better but my no means good.  This hotel really needs to invest in some new carpeting. I'd be hard pressed to stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Very Satisfied Customer from Mississippi,"Wonderful location, cozy hotel with wonderful antique furnishings - friendly staff - eager to please, morning newspapers to enjoy, clean rooms, spacious hallways, rooms and bathrooms - loved our stay.  Doorman, Stewart, was full of energy and added a personal touch to our stay!!  Highly recommend!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fantastic Hotel!,We had the most wonderful long weekend staying at The Oxford Hotel with other family members. Our rooms were as comfortable as they were beautiful and every need for our little grand daughter was met including extra towels for her bath. The lobby was charming as they were beginning to decorate for Christmas and we felt that it had the warmest welcoming atmosphere of any hotel we could recall.  The staff (each and every member we encountered from front desk to housekeeping) couldn't have been more helpful or accommodating and we will definitely look forward to staying here again. The location was very convenient and we really enjoyed walking to sites and restaurants during the days and evenings. Highly recommend!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Hotel,"Spent three nights here in mid Oct. Great location, city center and next to the station if your coming in by train. Hotel has kept all its original character and atmosphere. Furniture and fittings stylish and functional. Room was clean and spacious. Bed and pillows perfect for me. We were woken the first night of our stay due to our room neighbour blasting out hip hop at 3am. Called reception and within seconds night staff were attempting to wake our sleeping friend. Unfortunately he couldn't be roused and had his security lock on. Without prompting we were offered an immediate change to an upgraded room, but as this offer was being made, security managed entry into our neighbours room and removed the offending in-room Bose sound system. All being good, we remained in our room. The following morning, without prompt, reception staff apologized for previous nights incident and we were again offered a room upgrade. As our stay was short and our basic room was already so comfortable we again declined only for the manager to offer us a free full breakfast. These people really want to make you happy, this is service as it should be. The restaurant and bar attached to the hotel are also exceptional. Great happy hour (drinks and bar food) and professional bar staff.  I couldn't fault this hotel or its staff. Six weeks in the US, and $ for $, this was by far the best hotel experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Phenomenal,"This is a fantastic hotel.  The hotel itself is beautiful and historic but the staff is amazing.  We were only there one night but they made it a point to remember and greet us by name each time we passed through the lobby.  They delivered a handwritten card and wine to the room thanking my military husband for his service, and were exactly what you'd expect of a hotel that's both ritzy and warm and welcoming.  The stay was perfect and we already look forward to going back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,I want to move in.,"I want to come back to Denver very soon just so I can stay here again. The hotel was lovely, service in all areas - from the door to the desk to the restaurant  - was absolutely fantastic, and the atmosphere and ambiance was perfect down to every little detail.  Take advantage of the knowledge the door staff has to offer with regard to where to go if you are heading out on the town.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,It's What Hotels Used to Be!,"The Oxford is a beautiful throwback to days when opulence and service came hand-in-hand. The front door is opened for you and the front desk is bright and friendly. I enjoyed the amazing holiday decor and the signature tasseled keys! They've integrated ""just enough"" modernity to make the stay convenient but kept the vintage feel and furnishings. The location couldn't be more centered in the downtown area--making business and pleasure easy to blend in. Very cool spot!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming full-service historic hotel - a gem!,"We couldn't have been happier with our stay at the Oxford Hotel in Denver. It is a charming, historic hotel, but with modern amenities. The rooms were well appointed, the bathrooms were luxurious, the staff was attentive and the building itself was gorgeous. It also offered free access to the Oxford Club next door, which included a gym with everything you could ask for. The hotel is in a great location, right in LoDo and steps from Union Station. We will definitely be staying there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Fun...Great Service!,"I recently spent 4 days at The Oxford, on an annual girls' trip.  From check-in to check-out we were totally taken care of!The hotel is top-notch.  Go to the website and read about the history, tradition and decor.  A speakeasy, a ghost, a bird in the lobby, and much more.  Totally entertaining.Our room was antique filled but with every modern convenience you would want, and very, very clean.  Our service was always perfect.  Leo, the Bell Captain, is super fun, extremely efficient, and very knowledgable about the area.  Joshua, in the bar, is the best.  He is very good at his job, from serving food and drink, to remembering us every night as we came in to watch the World Series.  He is funny and made us feel very welcome.  The hotel's location can't be beat, as well. The Oxford is a GREAT choice!  You will not be disappointed!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Lovely historical, boutique hotel","We absolutely love the Oxford Hotel.  The location is great.  The staff were outgoing, professional and very friendly. Leo and Stewart greet you and do everything to help make your stay the best.  We are already planning a return trip and will stay longer.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Outstanding Boutique Hotel,"My husband planned a quick one night away from the kids for my birthday in October. The night before, however, we received an email saying the flight was cancelled. My husband quickly called the Oxford to rearrange our reservations for the following night. The front desk staff was understanding and very helpful, yet little did we know just how understanding.When we finally arrived the staff said they felt so bad for us that they reserved the presidential suite for us. Wow! Needless to say we were overwhelmed by their generosity.The suite was lovely, as was the hotel itself, decorated in themed, yet original artwork. All the staff was friendly and helpful.The location is perfect, as it is within walking distance of good food and interesting shops.I truly hope to stay at the Oxford again, even if it is not in the presidential suite.The only negative were the massages. We had a couples' massage, so my husband and I were in the same room. The ambiance is lovely, but the masseurs were mediocre at best.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Sister Bliss in Denver!,"My sisters and I plan an annual reunion trip and select a different city each year.  This year Denver got lucky!  We arrived on a Wednesday and checked into The Oxford Hotel.  In each city, we find something to rave about.  In Asheville, it was the size of our rooms and croissants at Modesto.  In San Francisco, it was our location on Lombard Street.  Though we loved all of Denver, the Bell Staff at The Oxford made our trip.  Leo, Dave, Nick, Ben and Rick bent over backwards to make our stay a pleasure whether it was driving us to dinner in the rain, making restaurant suggestions or just chit-chatting with us about how we'd spent our day.  The hotel itself is beautiful (we had two rooms with two queen beds) and the location can't be beat.  Go to Snooze for the sweet potato pancakes, Osterio Marco for the charcuterie platter (ask if John's there - he's the bomb), Populist for everything, Rioja for the artichoke tortelloni.  And, don't miss the Chihuly exhibit at the Botanic Garden.  Enjoy!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect place to stay!,"The oxford was a perfect place to stay. Along with the historic background and its location, it made our stay even better. Walking distance from many restaurants and tourist sights. Will stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Sister Reunion October 2014,"Every year, the four sisters converge on a city for 5 days of relaxation and sisterhood.  This year we chose Denver and stayed at The Oxford.  Our stay could not have been better.  The concierge staff was superb!  Leo, Dave, Nick and Ben were professional, warm, informative and so ready and willing to assist us!  We looked forward to seeing them every day!  This hotel was beautiful!  It is charming and comfortable.  Our 2 rooms with 2 queen beds were wonderful!  I would recommend this hotel to anyone!  And the location was fantastic!  Leo and Dave suggested the best restaurants!  The food in Denver is awesome!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Luxury and value in Denver,"The Oxford Hotel has it all:  a terrific location, great rooms and amenities, an amazing staff, AND reasonable rates.  Located in the Lodo section of Denver, The Oxford is 1/2 block away from the newly-renovated Union Station, about two blocks from the famous book store, Tattered Cover, and two blocks from the free shuttle on 16th, that takes you all the way through the heart of the city.  Larimer Square--think terrific boutiques and awesome restaurants--is about six blocks away, or a short, free ride in the hotel's Cadillac Escalade!   The rooms, hallways, and lobby feature antiques from the Victorian days, and the bathrooms offer great shower heads, deep tubs, plush robes, and nice toiletries.   Some rooms have windows to the street; other's  windows face a small interior space,  lit by a skylight.  Want to check the weather outside:  go with the street side.  Want utter peace and quiet;  go with the interior rooms.  Best of all: this hotel has some of the finest staff I've ever encountered.  From the front desk to the bellmen, everyone is friendly, helpful, and eager to make your stay a treat.  The bell captain, Leo, and his staff (Dave, Nick and Ben) have to be mentioned by name; they all really went out of their way to make  a sister reunion memorable!  If you are into modern decor and architecture, this is not the hotel for you...but if you are happy with a well-located, historic, beautifully maintained building , with antique decor, and an amazing staff, book a room soon !",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Welcoming, kind, open arms, most accommodating, fabulous service!","We stayed from Thursday-Sunday and had THE BEST stay ever! Our Bellman, Leo, greeted us with open arms after having experienced a delayed flight. We had top notch service our entire stay! The Oxford Spa was amazing also! Amy was a most incredible masseuse! We loved everything about our stay!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great place to celebrate 61st wedding anniversary!,"The Oxford Hotel has the best employees we have encountered in sometime.  From the bellmen who greet you, to the receptionist, to the maid----all are super friendly, helpful and very accommodating.  It is a great place and at a reasonable price!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Character and comfort,The Oxford is perfect for special occasions and fun respites. The neighborhood has so much to offer and the hotel takes its guests' comfort seriously. I've rarely been treated with such sincere hospitality at hotels that were much more expensive. The Oxford gives you the indulgence of a high-end hotel with the hospitality of a family-run bed and breakfast. It was a great experience and is now my favorite Denver hotel. I'm glad I gave it a try. Great service and atmosphere.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Historic, but not sure the price is justified by the quality","We were kindly put up here by family last minute when visiting Denver prior to a work function. The service was impeccable- everyone we encountered was super friendly. We checked in late, and a lot of drunken people were returning from the beer fest and were really struggling to retrieve their room keys. The front desk was super patient with that.Regarding the hotel itself, I'm more of a resort with a pool kind of gal, so am trying to keep that in perspective when reviewing this historic property. Assuming one is seeking a really old hotel right downtown, the decor and restorations were a little  hit or miss. The tiny hexagonal tile in the bathroom was lovely, as well as the whole lobby. The wood in the elevators was pretty scuffed up.  As others have mentioned, the room furniture was hodge-podge and not very useful. There was a huge desk with a million tiny compartments, but no loveseat or sofa. The giant wardrobe had complicated compartments, and didn't really hold any of the hanging clothes we brought. The bathroom and bed were arranged so that it was literally three steps from the toilet to your pillow, which was a little close quarters. The biggest dichotomy in quality was in the Oxford Club. They put a lot of effort and money into a gorgeous steam room, nice showers and lockers and flooring in the locker room. But the gym itself was like a run-down fitness museum. It's in a dark basement. It has no ceiling, just exposed plumbing, and faded linoleum puzzle-piece tiles that are mostly peeling up. Overall, the historic nature and the mansion-style were in many ways charming, but hotel does seem to have an identity crisis of whether it's a 2 or 5 star. One big deal breaker is that I was shocked to discover when getting ready that there was no hair dryer in the room. That's not acceptable for a $350 hotel room. The staff did bring one when I called, but it took them 30 minutes. By then my hair had already dried, and not attractively, and I was nearly late for my meeting.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Hotel,"We were married at this hotel and had our guests stay here as well. We have stayed here on numerous occasions. Granted, it needs a bit of an update since it's starting to look a bit dingy, but you can't beat great service and the history!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Lovely Hotel, Superior Staff, Exceptional Dining !","A large number of us just spent 4-5 days there for last weekend's ""Cleveland"" wedding, and it was absolutely perfect in every way ! From the charming lobby, the quaint and well-equipped rooms, to the infamous Cruise Bar and McCormick's exceptional seafood dining - not to mention the perfect wedding and reception venue - our whole group was really quite pleased ! A special shout out to the following for their service above and beyond : Bell Staff Members Stewart and Leo, Front Desk darling Carlie, and for superior service in the Corner Bar, Dez and Allie ! You all - and more of you that we sadly didn't get names for, made our stay simply heavenly, and we'll be sure to book our next Denver stay there again  - we hope to real soon - what a treat !",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"In the LoDo, The Oxford is the only great place to stay","In Denver you want to be in the LoDo and in the LoDo you want to stay at at The Oxford. This is an excellent, old west style ( a mansion really ) grand hotel in the fashion of the 1800's. However, it is modern in what matters. Coors Field is very close. The Valet parking guys are very efficient. Th bed and shower were awesome. I can't wait to stay there again !",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Standout Hotel In LODO,"Well, I'd been to the Cruise Room on previous visits, but never managed to stay in the old hotel. So when a friend booked a wedding here, I jumped at the chance to stay (after all it's right around the corner from a dispensary!). A plus is the proximity to the train station as we had tickets to SF after the wedding. Lots of great touches in the hotel - the elevator carpet tells you the day of the week - helpful for the disoriented traveler - and a great breakfast restaurant, McCormick & Schmick, and the best men's room you'll find - complete with giant walk-in urinals.Our room on the fourth floor was small, but charming and clean with a lovely renovated bathroom.One of the real treats in staying here is the right to use the outstanding Oxford Health Club which includes a wonderful vintage steam room and a clubby locker room. The staff is unfailingly friendly and a bit humorous as well. Grab some wheels from the bike share across the street and ride along the nearby South Platte River.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"The Ultimate Triple Threat, Charm, Class, Service","It was last September and I was in town for a conference. The Cruise Room was highly recommended by a local merchant, and as my colleague and I sat sipping on the best made cocktail of our lives so far we decided that the next year (this year) we simply must stay here.From the moment we arrived we were greeted with the ultimate hotel experience. Absolutely nothing revitalizes a weary traveler like being told you have access to the steam rooms and showers in the attached spa to shake off that airplane feeling.I used the classic key and tassel to open the door to my room, and was amazed. The high ceilings, soft indirect light and beautiful curtains took me back in time. The room was spacious and had a great bathroom. Not much better that a good bathroom in your room.The service got even better when we were headed out for the night and were given a ride to our work party in an Escalade. The look on the other party guests was priceless.As in any business trip you can find some personal time to get a nice meal. We were expertly guided by Leo to a local FTT spot. On our way it was Rick's turn to shine as he recommended we get on the waiting list for another Speak Easy while we eat. Good thing he knows the city, because a 2 hour wait would have been too much. As it stood, we got a call to go to the Speak Easy as we were paying the check.It was all of the little things that added up to the best hotel experience I've had. The staff, especially the staff, the amenities and the old school charm of the building.If you don't stay here, you are doing yourself a disservice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful and Friendly Historic Hotel!,"My husband and I were in Denver recently and decided to stay at the Oxford Hotel, used to stay at the Brown. The Oxford is not only the most historic hotel in Denver but, is absolutely lovely and the entire staff is fantastic! What I loved about the staff the most is that they were not over solicitous but perfectly available, happy, helpful, great advice, and funny. We enjoyed numerous interactions with the bell staff especially who gave us great advice and direction while having big laughs. The front desk sent us to exquisite restaurants. The hotel has the best bathroom ever and is right across from the timeless Union Station that was totally redone and turned into a mutli-venue site with multi-modal transportation connecting to it. Fantastic! We walked everywhere from the hotel as it is perfectly positioned in the city. I highly recommend staying there as I know we will be for our future visits.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Venerable but ancient railroad hotel,"A fine place to stay in the 1930s and 40s, or today if you are a senior citizen.  Oxford is a short half a block from Union Station, the transportation hub of central Colorado.A high four-poster bed, a heavy mirrored armoire, a step up into a bathroom tiled with black and white hexagons, and a former fireplace camouflaged with a plastic shrub and a 12-foot ceiling characterize the rooms, unchanged for generations.The staff is exceedingly polite and often apologetic, since they frequently have something to apologize for.The restaurant on site is really good, as is the house bar.",3
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Great service,key location, reasonably priced",My husband and I greatly enjoyed our 3 night stay this past weekend. Our room was spacious with neat old touches mixed with up to date conveniences. Everyone especially Leo was very helpful. I liked that the hotel felt intimate and not impersonal. I also loved that there was a nice spa and gym as part of the hotel. Ask for Veda for a massage. And the location is within walking distance of a multitude of classy bars and restaurants. Try Southern Hospitality for Sunday brunch- fried chicken and biscuits....yum!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Experience old school class and refinement.,"If you want to spend some time experiencing what class, refinement and comfort meant to people early in the last century you have come to the right place.  My wife and I Love old school premium hotels such as the Oxford.  Where to start?  The people.  Absolutely the friendliest staff who made it their pleasure to go out of their way to make your stay not only in The Oxford but also in Denver the best it could be.  Leo and Rick went above and beyond many times.Other incredible features of this hotel included the Complimentary transportation around Denver in the Cadillac Escalade. Traditional door key system where you could leave you key with the front desk while you are out and about.  Access to the Oxford Spa for a Eucalyptus Steam before and after work.  AND LAST BUT NEVER LEAST……The Cruise Room Lobby Bar.   Old School Speak easy that makes you feel like you are in the roaring 1920s.  You must get an old fashioned cocktail and if the local crowd is a bit to much just retire into a leather wingback in front of a wood burning fire in the lobby and sip you cocktail in total peace!Best Hotel Experience to date which includes a trip to the Fairmont Royal York in Toronto in Auguest and The W in Times Square in June.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Definitely A Victorian Hotel,"If you want to spend a night or two in an Agatha Christie setting, this is the place.  I did expect a few more ""modern"" touches, such as, convenient  places to recharge electronics, larger flat screens and bathrooms with shelves and/or some vanity to put my stuff.  The staff is wonderfully friendly, the restaurant and bar are excellent and access to the Fitness/Spa Center is a plus.  Although I think it is better to walk outside, down two doors for access to the center rather than follow the convoluted directions in the hallway.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fabulous Massage at Oxford Spa,"We had access to this spa and gym while we were staying at The Crawford Hotel at Union Station. For our group of four, we scheduled two massages and two facials on Saturday morning. Upon arriving at the spa we were quickly checked in and directed to the locker room. Since it's in an old historic hotel, the décor and facilities were quite dated. For a top spa I would have thought they would have put more effort into keeping a state of the art facility, but I'm willing to forgive since I had the best massage service of my life here. Based on reading reviews I requested Michael for my 90 minute sports massage. I'm so glad I did. He was very professional, had great pressure and technique. I would definitely recommend scheduling a massage with him. I will schedule a massage with him again on my next visit to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Old but satisfying,"This is an older hotel in LODO - but a classic from another era. If you don't like older hotels with creaky floors, small elevators, old style keys you leave at the desk, etc. this might not be for you. BUT - if you enjoy those types of hotels this is a great one. Our room included old art deco furniture. Everything matched, even the bed headboard and the room's clock. (our friends room was the similar) Attached to the hotel is the McCormick seafood restaurant and Jax seafood is right across the street, as is the Venice Italian restaurant. Best of all the ""Cruise Room"" martini bar is just off the lobby, it features classic art deco décor inspired by the Queen Mary, even if you don't have a drink stop in to take a look. We would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Recent Stay,"Great  Hotel always  immaculate . Staff is  always  helpful I  would  recommend a deluxe  room has  better  views , better light  and is larger Valet  parking is great in a covered  secure garage. Restaurant is excellent  and  well priced  for the food you get.... The  Hotel is well located     a couple of blocks  from the free Mall shuttle. Close to other restaurnats. Has a Cadillac Esculade to take  you places  within two miles of the hotelAcross the stree  from the new Union Station Transit  Center",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Nice hotel, Good Location",I enjoyed my stay at the Oxford Hotel.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and comfy.The location is smack in the middle of downtown Denver. The building has a history to it.I would recommend staying there a night or two.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Good hotel. Exceptional gym. ,"I'd stay here again on the strength of the hotel staff, location and gym. Hotel has character and the staff are very friendly. Room decor looks ""old in a beat up kinda way"" to me. Bed comfortable, work desk functional, ironing board ""about the same quality as I had when a student"". Breakfast does not start until 7 so if you start work early, you'll be eating nearby (there are options). Gym is exceptional, but not 24 hours. Yes this was written from the perspective of a business traveller.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Denver Reunion,"Outstanding location, operation and character all describe this hotel.  We staid there in August for a five days for a family reunion. It retains the character of it's origins (1891), while conveying modern comforts.  Added was exceptional service and the proximity of entertainment, restaurants, and transportation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"LODO, Location Location","For the price point and location you cannot beat the Oxford Hotel. It is conveniently located near the hub of their public transportation system making it a prime location. You can walk to the 16th street mall, walk to Coors stadium and several brew pubs. The hotel is older and the rooms are small but clean and safe. They offer a shuttle service within a set radius. Make sure to check out the Cruise Room for a martini during your stay!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Charming Historic Restoration next to Union Station,We selected The Oxford Hotel package including VIP tickets to the Dale Chahuly exebition at the Denver Botanic Garden.This property was built in the 1800's - when built rooms were $1.00!   Well it costs more now and we felt quite special from the reception of the doorman and valet to the customer service rep at the welcome desk.  We were upgraded to room 210 - on the corner - overlooking Wazae and 17th streets.  Extrodiniarly comfortable 4 poster bed - antiques throughout the room and hotel.  Morning hot coffee on each floor.  Only issue My lap top would not connect to the internet - my wife's iPad worked  just fine.  Easy off and on from I-25.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent service from staff and Comfortable room,"My husband and I spent a night here for our first anniversary while in town from TN for a weekend away for the occasion. We booked a room with the romance package, and it turned out to be quite a nice treat for the special occasion.We arrived a bit early, thinking we would just have the car parked and check our luggage. It turns out they had a room available, so we were able to get into it early. Our room was very nice and felt luxurious! Sarah from guest services later delivered our amenities to the room that came with our romance package. There was a small misunderstanding in that we expected that receiving bath salts meant we'd have a bath tub (which we did not). We considered moving to a room with a tub but opted to not worry about it (our choice) and later returned to the room to find an additional rose, some chocolates, and a note from Sarah apologizing for any misunderstanding. i found this level of service top notch and something that seems to be lacking in the realm of customer service these days (in general).We visited the spa as part of our package for a couples massage that was one of the best massages either of us have received. We also enjoyed drinks in the Cruise Room and breakfast from room service as part of our package, and it all made the special occasion memorable as we wouldn't normally splurge on such things.We slept very well, and we found every encounter with hotel staff to be positive. The location was also terrific as we were able to easily walk around downtown and explore.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,One Word: Wonderful! ,"Our stay at the Oxford was simply wonderful! Even before we arrived, the staff was friendly and accomodating. We had some issues with our flight, delaying our arrival by a day. One phone call and all was taken care of. Upon arrival,  we were impressed with every detail. Check in was flawless.  At every turn the staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful. Our room was fabulous. Very comfortable and quiet with modern updates. The location was perfect and very close to everywhere we wanted to go. The car service is a wonderful amenity and both drivers were prompt, helpful, and friendly. We loved our stay at the Oxford and would recommend this establishment to anyone staying in the Lodo area.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Perfect.,"We chose Denver as a central location for a family business meeting.  From the initial reservation (thank you Matthew) to our departure our experience was very nice.  Ryan was exceptionally proficient in the history of the hotel and very helpful with suggestions for dinner etc.  If you stay here, take advantage of the complimentary car service and check out The Chapultepec bar for excellent jazz.  There are reports of ghosts inhabiting the hotel, and one night our TV came on at 3:00am.  Whoever owns this hotel needs to give this great staff team a big Christmas bonus because they are awesome.  Never once did we encounter anything but smiling faces and helpful attitudes.  They seemed to really care that we enjoyed our stay and helped with restaurant reservations as well as transportation options to the airport.  We witnessed an employee bring a glass of water to a man on the street who was struggling in the heat ( and probably not a guest) which reinforced in us the genuine helpful attitude of the staff.   Loved the daily carpet change in the elevator, although we never figured out when the change took place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Unique hotel experience,"We usually stay at larger, name brand hotels but needed a night out downtown, so we Hotwired a room and got the Oxford. This was our first boutique hotel experience and it was a good one. The hotel provided friendly, helpful service, the rooms were clean and comfortable. The hotel itself has actual keys for rooms instead of the key card like larger scale hotels which I liked. We didn't eat at the restaurant as there were plenty of options nearby and the point of our trip was to get out. There certainly was that personal touch with this hotel and had we had this not been our first one, it very well could have been rated a 5.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Very nice place with great service, but loud!",Wonderful historic hotel in great location. The service was lovely and the people so nice. Our room was on the street side and it was horribly loud all night long. No sleeping here. That's too bad for such a great old hotel. Perhaps a room on another side of the hotel would fare better. I can't say enough about how great the staff was though.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful old hotel,"We stayed at The Oxford Hotel for a conference. The hotel and the rooms has such character, but unlike some older hotels, everything was in excellent working order. The furniture was gorgeous, and the bed was very comfortable. The friendly staff made things even better.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful stay,"The hotel is in a great location, in walking distance to Coors Field, lots of shops, and tons of restaurants.  The service was fantastic!  The hotel is restored, but warm, and I love the tassels on the keys.  When we checked in, we were told ""do not disturb the tassel on the back of the door.""  I thought that meant ""don't touch the tassel on the back of the door,"" but it really meant that the tassel on the back of the door is the ""do not disturb"" sign!  The room was quiet, the beds were comfy, and the bathroom was fine.  A great place to stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Nostalgic,"My stay was refreshing. The staff were attentive, cheerful & friendly. The hotel is stately yet feels warm; like home. I could wander through its corridors enjoying the beautiful furniture and architectural details for hours.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Hotel's Best Qualities,"The hotel is very quaint, classic, a turn of the century feel when you first enter the lobby.  Down to the smallest detail, the rugs in the elevators are changed daily and have the day of the week printed on them. I have to say the only real complaint I have is that a hair dryer is not provided. The best thing about this hotel is it's staff of dedicated employees. The Bellmen are fantastic. But Patrick at the front desk, his name should be listed under Hotel Accomodations. He is professional, polite, and accomodating. A class act.  Both Bellman and Front desk will help you will dinner or travel suggestions.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Western Charm, Refined Taste","The Oxford Hotel is a delightful little spot at the end of the pedestrian downtown corridor.  I stayed on the top floor and what i found: a quiet, serene room with lovely furniture made out of actual wood, ample linens, fringed lamps, plenty of space and a bathroom tub that was - i'm not kidding - waist high.  When was the last time you missed a meeting because you were lounging in a hotel room tub?  Well, it can happen here.  The staff was wonderful, attentive and friendly and while my meetings were at the Convention Center - the free shuttle bus made it easy to get back and forth.Tip:  if you walk the other way on 16th street - away from down town and cross the Millennium Bridge (5 minutes) - there's a lovely park, the river and a lovely non-tourist Denver neighborhood.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,If your looking to sleep... Don't stay here,Beautiful hotel with a lovely spa but the walls are paper thin.  Lots of drunk guests coming in at all hours and having after parties in their rooms.  We didn't sleep a wink.  Not worth the money.  Go to the spa and then sleep somewhere else!,1
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Lovely place,"I didn't actually have a choice in the selection of my hotel in Denver as it was arranged by a conference organizer, but I wish I could thank the person who chose the Oxford.  It has everything that makes staying in a hotel special - friendly staff, beautifully restored building and rooms, comfortable beds, and bright, clean bathrooms.  If you are someone who likes staying in hotels where every room looks exactly like the last hotel room you stayed in, the key cards all run together, and you can't even keep track of what city you are in, this is *not* the place for you.  I'm so glad to know that there are lovely, unique and beautiful hotels like this out there - it definitely makes researching where you stay worthwhile.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,History in the City,The Oxford Hotel provides a unique experience for every guest.  The restored historical elegance of the building is just beautiful.  We enjoyed a pampered stay there within walking distance of Coors Field and the 16th Street shopping district.  The staff was excellent and very helpful and accommodating.  And what better way to relax after a day of sightseeing than in the claw foot bathtub in the historical bathroom!  Would go back anytime we are in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Amazing hotel,"This hotel was fantastic! So close to everything, and the staff was extremely helpful! The hotel is very historic. The keys were even actual keys, not key cards. The staff was very accommodating: making reservations, suggestions on where to go or what to do, even bringing bath salts to the room. I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,The perfect home away from home,"The Oxford Hotel is charming and everyone who works there is friendly and helpful.  It's in a wonderful part of Denver for walking around, going to the great bookstore nearby or having a fabulous coffee across the street at Pronto Maggiano.  Mikey the canary in the lobby is the best greeter ever, and you'll love the whimsical touches, such as the elevator carpets which announce the day of the week to you. And if you are a hot-water lover, you will be in heaven when you turn on the bathroom taps and immediately get super-hot water.  We were in from Texas and used the hotel's car service several times and especially loved Dave the driver.  The property is quiet for sleeping, the ambience is great, and it is well-situated in Denver.  For the price of a room, it has to be one of the best values around!  Try it! You will love it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Exceptional stay,"We chose this hotel due to its proximity to to Amtrak station (we flew in and took the Zephyr out), and I couldn't be more pleased with the location, service and amenities.  We booked early and the room rate was extremely reasonable for the area.The staff was, without exception, friendly, helpful and courteous.  We used the car service a number of times and they were very prompt.  The room (2 queen on the fifth floor) was lovely and charming, with period furniture and a wonderfully spacious bath.  Even the kids were impressed - this was their favorite hotel to date.  We would not hesitate to stay here again!Highly recommend this lovely property, both for its historic charm and for it's exceptional staff.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,perfect service,"We stayed here several days prior to The Fourth of July and on the actual holiday.  The service from the front desk and the bell hops is second to none.  It's probably the best I've experienced.  Everybody was super friendly and helpful.  When we checked in, our toilet was not working.  We went out for coffee, and it was fixed when we got back.  The bell boys never failed to greet us or ask about our day.  I really cannot get over the friendliness.The room itself was clean, and the robes are a great touch.  We didn't partake of the mini bar, but I thought the selections were good (especially the gummy bears on offer).  The location is convenient to multiple restaurants, microbreweries, and the 16th Street Mall.  I'd definitely stay here again.  No complaints at all.  Additionally, given the location and the level of service, I think this was a steal, even with the holiday price.  Stay here!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great Hotel!,"Great location, although I have nothing to compare it too it was safe, in a great part of Denver, and convenient to many restaurants, bars, Coors field etc.  The breakfast at the hotel I thought was fabulous which is important to me.  The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and quiet.  Id recommend staying there to anyone.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great spot to tour LoDo,"Stayed here 1 night w/ my wife for a friend's wedding. Just a hop & skip to 16th st mall, where we were able to get to anywhere in the city. Right next to Mcormick & Scmicks which is nice place to grab happy hour.Rooms have a lot of space & personality, but thinking they're all fairly different because of the age of the place.  Lots of space, but fairly small bathrooms which make it a bit awkward for 2 people to get ready quickly. Also no fridge, which had us a bit confused.Overall great stuff, we'd do it again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Fantastic old and stately,I spend a good hour the 1st night we were there exploring all the nock and crannies of this old hotel. It has been totally and authentically refurbishing in the its original style and splendor yet with modern amenities. The staff was friendly and very helpful.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Sleeping in history.,"it was super refreshing to stay at the Oxford Hotel in LoDo Denver. The Oxford is a beautiful timewarp back to a season where elegance and service were fresh and ready for the picking. While the Oxford is the oldest hotel in Denver, it certainly doesn’t look like it; modern amenities, deluxe bathrooms, and even a free hotel car await you at this refurbished relic.This hotel has a ton of fantastic history, impeccable service, and just charm on tap. I can't say enough about it... see my whole review and pictures here;) http://cineclast.com/2014/07/03/denver-sleeping-with-history/",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,My second time staying here and it is great!,"The Oxford is a jewel.   Located in lower downtown, rebuilt older hotel, not the cookie cutter modern hotel.  This hotel has character aplenty.  The staff is very nice, courteous, the rooms all unique, the guys at the front desk very helpful and nice.  From DIA, take the bus $11 each way to the train station across the street from the hotel.  Skip the cab, which is way pricey.  The bus only stops once on its way to downtown Denver.  Extra, you do not need a car in downtown Denver.  If you love baseball, this hotel is down the street from Coors Field.  The hotel has a limo service which will take you anywhere downtown.  There is also a free bus that goes between lower and upper downtown.  Downtown Denver has restaurants and bars, etc, aplenty.  The food is excellent.  And if you are gluten free/celiac, Denver is the best city of gluten free in the US.  Nearly every restaurant has options, and there are Udis Cafes everywhere even at the airport.  Another hint, the interior rooms at the Oxford are better if you like it to be more quiet.  The rooms that face the street have more noise.  So don't worry if you have an interior room, which look across to another room or building, which are very quiet.  Also, have a drink at the bar in the hotel, it is very unique, the bartenders friendly.  Also, the gym, a private club nextdoor, is a jewel as well, with helpful staff, free weights, machines.  The first thing I do when I arrive is go to this fabulous gym.   I will be back, and so should you!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford Business meeeting,Stayed on night at The Oxford Hotel and had a full day and a half of meetings in the hotel.  Staff was great from the check-in to the valet to the assistance with our meeting.   Room was very nice as well.  Will definately stay here again.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Second visit as great as the first,"I spent over a week at the Oxford last fall.  I was just there for a conference and to visit my son.  Nothing like pulling up in a taxicab and having the staff come out to greet you by name.This is a very cool old hotel in a great LoDo location.  But what makes it really special is the staff.  Caring, thoughtful, friendly, and very professional.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Good property and customer service,Great staff. Good property if you like this sort of thing. You get to use the gym at the adjacent club; good value there. Excellent location. Good value overall. Bathroom is up to date. Lots of original furniture.,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Luxury in a historic hotel - Fantastic,Western Art-Deco - Who knew there was such a thing?  This is an exquisitely appointed hotel.  I thoroughly enjoyed a short stay returning home to east coast from Aspen.  Art deco is a great favorite of mine.  The art deco room we stayed in was wonderful.  Bose CD player by the bed. Comfortable and quiet air conditioning.  Stewart the concierge is delightful to chat with while waiting for your car to be brought to the front door.  The service does not disappoint.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Excellent Consierge Service,"Rik and I stopped in here after game at Coors Field looking for help to get back to our rented apartment in Capitol Hill area.  Alex from customer services dept gave us a ride home, saving us time and money.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Wonderful stay ,My husband came here for his birthday. The staff are all wonderful. The bellman and helpful and funny. I think it is great that so many of the staff have worked at the hotel for years. It really shows that this is a well run place. We really enjoyed our beautiful room and the claw foot bath tub. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Denver Breather,"Prior to joining up with CW Adventures for a walking tour of the Mesa Verde, Canyonlands and Arches National Parks my wife and I scheduled a three night stay in Denver.  Our travel agent provided us with a few hotels to consider and after reviewing each we selected The Oxford Hotel - we are so happy that we did.  Others have mentioned in their respective reviews that The Oxford Hotel is in a great location, particularly for those travelers who wish to explore on foot, and that is so true.  Museums, restaurants and shopping are easily reached on foot; and public transportation is close by.  And, as others have mentioned, we found the staff at The Oxford Hotel so very pleasant and helpful; they really went out of their way to help us.  I should mention that The Oxford Hotel has an impressive historic presence which we enjoyed; a very splendid atmosphere.  We look forward to returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Historical Hotel close to everything,Great historical hotel with nice rooms. Only negative is that bathrooms tend to be small with some very high lips (24 inches and more) on the bathtubs. Great location close to good restaurants and entertainment and shopping. Floors are somewhat jumbled up but that is part of the ambiance. Great place to stay downtown Denver,4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Very nice stay,"Beautiful hotel, great location.  Perhaps the helpfulness off staff made this stay most pleasurable.  (Especially the valet staff)The hotel has an old world charm to it.  The only negative I could find is that our hotel room was dark, you would have not known the weather outside was beautiful and bright.  Perhaps that was just our room.",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Our favorite hotel,"My husband and I absolutely love the Oxford Hotel in Denver.  We stay for our birthdays, anniversaries, and we stayed after our wedding.  The staff really makes the experience special each and every time.  The bell hops, especially Dave, Leo, and Nick, go above and beyond, providing advice, recommendations, and friendly conversation.  They are always extremely helpful in accomodating all of our needs.  The Oxford provides complimentary car service within a few miles of the hotel, making it easy and convenient to travel around a variety of downtown locations, and many bars and restaurants are located within walking distance.  The hotel is beautifully decorated with both art deco and victorian rooms, and staying there makes you feel that you've traveled back in time to an era of wonderful customer service and attention to detail.  We will continue to consider the Oxford our home away from home.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Ultimate Denver,"This hotel is in such a great location! Right in the middle of everything, you can walk to most of the most desirable destinations. The staff was amazing and SO helpful. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I could hear everything going on outside our door and in the room next to us. But that was the ONLY down side. It was so clean and comfortable. I completely recommend this beautiful hotel!",4
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Quiet elegance,"We've stayed at the Oxford twice in the past 3 weeks.   It's convenient to the AmTrak station and near many restaurants and bars.   When we were ready to return home, our train was late, and the hotel was a good place to pass the time until the train arrived.  The staff are wonderful, especially Stewart at the door, who always made us feel welcome, and is charming, helpful, and friendly.    The rooms were clean and comfy.    A step back in time.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Oxford review,"Oxford is a great hotel in a great location in downtown Denver.... The staff is always super friendly and really accommodating. The rooms are classic, comfy and clean. It makes a great spot for a date night get away. The cruise room is also really fun. Mccormicks bar is convenient but more times than not I've had very rude, poor service there- I don't know what it is with the bartenders and waitstaff there?? But just skip that place and treat yourself to the Oxford- it's awesome!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"The exceptional staff, great location and charming rooms make this our favorite hotel!","The downtown Denver location made ever thing that we wanted to see within walking distance.  The staff was friendly, polite and very helpful. It is hard to adequately describe the beauty of the hotel.  The ambience is of an era long gone.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Combining b&b comfort and hotel conveniences,"We recently had the pleasure of staying two nights at the oxford hotel. The rooms had a Victorian elegance and the hotel was attached to a lovely restaurant and  a luxurious bar and lounge. But what made the hotel superior was its staff. The hotel personnel went out of their way to provide personalized service with tips for dining and shopping. They all had smiles and a genuine desire to make our stay special. Stewart in particular was a huge help taking care of our bags, getting our car from the parking garage and providing a running commentary of thoughtful advice and tips.The entire staff worked hard to make it a special place to stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Outstanding business hotel !,"First time I stayed there. I will only stay at the Oxford when in Denver from now on. Room was really nice and the lobby was extra comfortable for a brief meeting. Stewart and Dave at the front door treated me like a friend. Really helpful with directions, local advice and hotel amenities.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,"Amazing, historic, classy hotel with top notch service","I stayed one night for a conference and was thoroughly impressed by the staff and the classy facility. Stuart helped me get my bags in and was always attentive to my needs including arranging a great towncar service back to the airport. The front desk was so helpful when I arrived very early at 9am, and they called me when a room was ready within the hour. When I was leaving they printed my boarding pass from the front desk. I loved the experience and would definitely come back with my wife on personal travel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Really wonderful place withe exceptional service,"I stayed at The Oxford with a small group of friends to celebrate my 21st birthday in Denver. We chose this hotel during Memorial Day Weekend due to the fact it was walking distance to BETA nightclub, had a Escalade car pool service and after checking the prices around at every other high end hotel in the area, this one was the most expensive, so I felt it would be the most extravagant. I’m not entirely sure if it really was all that extravagant for the price. Maybe I just had my expectations set too high especially for the price we paid. Even my friends agreed that for the price of 325, they expected much more. The room was very poorly lit and didn’t have a bathtub and the view was TERRIBLE. There was a dirty sock in the window from outside and our view was rocks and a wall. I almost feel compared to the rooms and pictures online, we may have gotten the worst room on the premises? Although it didn’t match me expectations in my head or pictures online, it was still the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The beds were heavenly and the room was exceptionally clean. The TV was small. The robes and towels were nice and the complimentary coffee and tea in the front desk was great as well and we took advantage of that. I honestly was going to storm into the front desk and demand to get a nicer room after seeing that I had paid over 300 dollars for a room but I stopped myself thinking maybe I over paid due to the fact it was memorial day, but the hotel didn’t seem very busy. I was also stopped by the fact that the hotel had exceptional service. There wasn’t a single person there that wasn’t extremely friendly and helpful. They were friendly and liked to joke around and were kind to us despite we were fairly young. They were perfect and made me feel like a princess. It was the best service I’ve ever experienced. I can’t stop raving about the crew at the Oxford. The staff and the crew working from valet to front desk to the club spa were just wonderful! The best staff I have ever had the pleasure to service me. That’s another thing during making a reservations they never mentioned that we had to pay a 50-dollar deposit and 30 dollar valet fee until I called to confirm my reservation and to pay for it. I will most likely be returning to the Oxford for another extravagant weekend, but not during a holiday weekend!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great hotel with awesome gym,"I love this hotel! I travel a lot for work and I am committed to staying at hotels with ""points"" to use for family travel. However, The Oxford Hotel is an exception. This place is fantastic. I travel to Denver at least twice a month and make it a point to stay here each time. Not only is there exceptional service (bottled water offered each time you enter the hotel, free car service within 2 miles, fresh coffee each morning), the attention to detail and vintage feel is fantastic. You'll notice that each day a new carpet is put in the elevators with the day embroider. The staff remembers your name and is exceptionally friends. The rooms and bathrooms are huge for a downtown hotel. But, my favorite feature is the gym. It's just a few doors down from the hotel -- full workout facility with spa lockers, yoga/fitness class and AWESOME feel (exposed brick, beams). As much as I hate to say it, I consider myself a hotel snob and I LOVE this place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Springs Eternal,"I live in the mountainsGlenwood Springs, out west!A trip to the oxford Is cosmopolitan...The best!Denver draws meAs Winter to Spring brings the changeThe museums, the gardensA cultural hone on the rangeRockies Baseball and the hopeOf a brand new startBrings with it the dreamOf playoff possibilities to my heartBut the very best way to relax and enjoy The offerings of Denver's fine faresIs a martini at the Cruise RoomAnd an elegant suite at the Oxford upstairs",5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Great stay!,I couldn't be more satisfied with The Oxford. I've been to five star hotels for triple the price and I was much more satisfied here. The valet and shuttle service were absolutely outstanding. The only thing I disliked was the layout of the bathroom. I will be staying again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Oxford Hotel,Beautiful Historic Building in charming area,"I made a reservation for a short stay while we had a new preemie in our family at Presbyterian- St Luke's Medical Center.  I have made quite a discovery, and so glad I stepped out of the usual big hotel chain for this trip,Many of the original features of this building have been preserved and/or restored.  There are gorgeous old tile floors (check the area just upstairs from the front desk) and when you arrive at your room, look at the door hinges!There are some older features in the room and a lovely updated bathroom.The room I stayed in was huge, and this was one of the last rooms available and was discounted, I'm anxious to try a better grade of room next trip,The bed was extremely comfortable as was the bedding and pillows.I used the valet for parking, it was easy and fast.Lastly, I have to admit that I really did not want to leave a review.... I would prefer to keep this little secret to myself!  Thanks Oxdord Hotel and staff!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,The worst,"Wanted to stay at this hotel because we stayed here four years ago and had a great experience.  I'm sad to say this time was totally different, so much so I'm canceling my second day. The beds in this hotel are sooo uncomfortable. My hips are aching for one night. Also they really should invest in soft close doors you hear doors slamming all down the hall all day and night long! So annoying. Lastly parking being so far away for the hotel is terrible. Not fun running across the street in the cold at night. Disappointed in my stay. Only good thing about this hotel is the proximity to good shopping and restaurants.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Mountain time,"Excellent hotel.. Great location within walking distance of 16th street mall, very clean, easy check in and out. Valet available along with parking garage will definitely stay again while in Denver.  Starbucks inside hotel was a plus",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not a great experience,"We stayed at the Hilton at the end of November and were pretty disappointed. We checked in and were charged an early check in fee of $58. I’ve stayed at many Hilton properties and have never been charged to check in early if there was open rooms. The first room they gave us smelled like cigarettes so we were moved to a different room. The second room was not cleaned properly. There was hair in the bathroom, dust everywhere, and not up to the clean experience they kept advertising they were taking the extra mile on due to COVID. We were finally moved to a 3rd room which was fine but connected to another room so the noise level was frustrating to deal with the whole stay. The hotel was clearly not full so why put us right next to another occupied room that had a connecting door? Especially after moving 3 rooms already. They tried to make it right by giving us free breakfast at the Starbucks which was a nice gesture by Kevin. But if you are looking for a hotel during covid that you feel is actually making it a priority to keep things clean, this is not the one. It was clear common areas like elevators, hallways, etc were not being cleaned regularly either. I would expect more from a Hilton and unfortunately will be avoiding them in the future, especially while covid is still around.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Dirty little secrets ,"First off let me just say the things i am including in this review can not be explained away using the Covid excuse. My family and I always stay at Hilton properties because of the standards, however this one falls below the line. First I know all of the Hilton’s put the little sticker on your door saying this room was cleaned. Has anyone else thought...wait so my room wasn’t cleaned to standards in the past? 🤔 Our room however was sub cleaned, meaning there were finger prints on the windows and obviously the bathroom was not swept or mopped because someone had left an eye makeup pencil there. It just kinda had a dirty feel to everything. There weren’t many guest as you can imagine during this period but yet they put us in the room right next to the elevator. The room itself is small to say the least and why in the world @hilton would you decide to replace perfectly good bathroom doors with a barn door on rollers that literally has a 2 inch gap on each side that you can see into and that children’s fingers can get caught in and the door doesn’t even lock! There was no shampoo in our room and I found a housekeeper and she said sorry we don’t have shampoo. So I called the front desk and they said oh let us check because we have been out! So maybe they can blame that on Covid but wouldn’t that have been nice to know ahead of time! Shampoo is like a standard in any hotel. At any rate they finally called back and said oh we found some and you can stop by the desk to pick it up. Another thing you want to be aware of is that they charge you $32 a day for parking! Now I understand that you will pay for parking in a big city downtown that’s not a problem....the problem is that every time you leave the parking deck, you have to go back by and wait in line at the front desk to get another parking validation for which they charge you a $1 every single time you come and go from the parking deck. That’s ridiculous! My last complaint is that I accidentally left my stand up makeup mirror in the room and when we called back to check on it, they have no record of it. I hope whoever has it enjoys it. In closing the only good thing about this hotel is the location.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great service at the Hilton,I came to the Hilton after a long day of flying. The staff was caring and showed genuine interest in what I had to say. I even got a upgrade for free. Lovely experience overall! I would highly recommend the Hilton in downtown Denver to anyone.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great service,"The warm greeting and excellent service from the front desk, particularly Desire, was very appreciated. I travel every week around the US as well as other countries—she went above and beyond to help us out. Thank you, Desire!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Horrible experience!!,"Me & my fiancé checked it the hotel on Friday November 27,2020,, now mind you I have 20+ years in Guest Services & Hotels industry.. so I know what can be done & what’s the protocol for most check in & out services. So we checked in that night ( late) & the front desk agent Mr.Kevin charged our card for the normal check in process but in the mist of it his system crashed & he said he didn’t see our transactions go thru but we showed him the verification on our phone the bank statements showing it was removed from the bank.. he went to another computer & proceed to try it again & said he was going to just charged a dollar jus to have our card on file & check back in the AM ( which was maybe 4 hours from then to come get that issue straight.. so we wake up & had 1,000 charge on our card because he overcharged us twice instead of jus waiting a few hours for us to get downstairs.. so we get up & go to the front desk & was greeted by the Manager Ms. JESSICA!! She was sooo rude & disrespectful & we are the ones with the problem.. so to management at the Hilton City Center Denver please confront these two individuals on more training & guest services!!  I don’t refer this hotel to NO ONE!!",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Ok stay,The hotel was ok.  It’s a little dated but clean.  We paid extra for a corner city view room but there wasn’t much a view.  There was no coffee or breakfast which is pretty disappointing for a Hilton.We had to pay for our own breakfast at a limited time service Starbucks downstairs.  They do have a nice open area in the lobby where we can sit down and walk.  Walkable distance to the city center and restaurants.  We rented a car for a day and parked at the nearby garage for $6 overnight as Hilton didn’t cover parking at a time.  I would try to stay somewhere else next time I am in town.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hotel,"The room was good however, the A/C would not turn off.The only thing negative I have to say about this property is that no where in the fine print does it state that there will be a $50 charge per night. My front desk clerk wasn’t so nice compared to the other front desk clerks I heard servicing others.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Best part of our trip ,"As Hilton Gold members, we always seek out a Hilton when we have a choice of branded hotels. This was one of the best Hilton’s we stayed at, on par with NYC Times Square and Malta! The staff was extraordinarily friendly and welcoming, we were offered a beautiful upgrade, breakfast was provided by Starbucks which opens at 0630, and the hotel was very clean. I’m sure aside from COVID restrictions, this hotel is even more amazing.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,What Hilton Should Always Be,"Great Hilton in the heart of downtown Denver.  VERY clean and the staff was consistently friendly and helpful.  Parking is not currently being offered on property, but a parking garage is right across the street...very convenient and easy to access.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay,My husband and I had an extremely nice stay. Nice spacious room on the 10th floor. Sad that Denver is hit and miss with what's open. Front desk staff really friendly. Thanks to Lisa and David for all of their recommendations.  Extremely comfortable beds. Only negative were the large number of bums around the hotel.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Love the HILTON!!!,"I must say this hotel is absolutely perfect!!! It is in walking distance to so many restaurants, 16th Street  Mall and other transportation. The hotel is very clean the staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back plus love the fact you can’t get access to the guess rooms unless your a guest.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Short trip,"We came here for work as a short trip as videographers. The hotel staff was beyond amazing! The cleanliness of the hotel was impeccable. Upon entering your room there is a sticker of sanitization, housekeeping only upon request, breakfast can be ordered for in room service as well as an attendant to help serve breakfast. Our overall stay for three days was nothing short of perfect.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton,When I first arrived I was blown away by the excellent customer service. The staff is extremely helpful and welcoming. The room was clean and comfortable with an amazing view. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Decent stay,"The hotels location to the 16th street mall this the biggest benefit this hotel offers. The bed, pillows, and shower are amazing. My comforter came pre stained with four separate spots of blood. I’m sure they would have gladly changed it had I asked though. The air conditioning didn’t work great. It woke me up every time it switch on during the night it was so loud. I had to adjust the air so it wouldn’t turn on and off during the night.  Staff was great and will try to accommodate most anything.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Traveling to Cali,The hotel staff Chris was amazing and very attentive and was always there to help. In a good location to walk to 16th street. Bed is comfortable and overall great stay. There is a Starbucks also attached to the building,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Forced out,"Front desk was friendly and accommodating, however, housekeeping knocked on the door several times (3) hours before check out (Do not disturb on door) The city was dead and the hotel was not busy.  I understand business is challenging due to the pandemic, but don’t force guests out before check out time.  I didn’t expect this from the Hilton brand - disappointed.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Immediately let down.,"We didn’t see any mention of the fact there isn’t any parking through the booking, which hey. That’s kind of our fault for not looking into it more. So I can somewhat excuse how that’s conveniently left out everywhere we looked afterwards to see if we missed it. But we checked in and immediately noticed in our room there are several cherry pits on our floor, obvious hand prints all over the windows, and a few other things out of place that make us wonder how well this room was actually cleaned before we were put in it.I don’t know. We’re here for a few days but I definitely wouldn’t recommend it to anyone and definitely won’t stay here or at another other Hilton ever again.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Exceptional  Customer Service,"I had an amazing customer experience thanks to Kegan at the front desk. He was polite and  very helpful. I was surprised with how inviting and informative he was. Will definitely come back, and will recommend to my friends!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Spring Break Stay,"Very nice hotel.  Staff was so friendly, from check in to the shuttle drivers.

"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful location and perfect customer service,"Great place to stay while visiting Denver. The front desk staff was super accommodating and friendly. Warmly greeting me when I walked in. Thanks to Michael for helping me find a good restaurant! Room decor was nice but I found it a little strange that there was no fitted sheet on the bed? Overall a good experience, would stay again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent Business Hotel w Great Staff,"I had an excellent experience at this Hilton on a business trip.  check in was terrific - she even looked up my Hilton Honors member number and then gave me a free upgrade to a nicer room on a high floor.  Room was spacious and clean with great bed and pillows.  The room had a couch and table so i could spread out my work - extremely helpful on a business trip. Extra towels and great bath products in the bathroom, which was extremely clean.  Staff was very friendly and professional from front desk to room service.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Downtown Denver Hilton - Great Service,"For only a one night business travel stay, I was treated like I was a prince!  Great staff, great room, great value!  From check-in to check-out the entire staff was professional and courteous.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Volleyball trip,Great stay. Small rooms but clean. Maid service missed on last night.  Had to ask for towels twice because not enough left. Loved bathroom. Staff very friendly. Close to convention center. Smelled nice in lobby,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Service,"The hotel is clean, comfy and convenient. More importantly, the staff here are friendly and helpful. Keegan at the front desk truly saved my night and turned what could have been a terrible 3 hours into an easy 2 minute solution. I truly appreciate his customer service! Will definitely stay here again next time I am in the area.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver Hilton City Center - FABULOUS !!,"We loved being at the Hilton Hotel downtown.  It was so special.  Everyone was so hospitable, friendly, and kind, and so welcoming.  They made us feel like we were truly “welcomed guests”.  We loved our room.  We loved all of the wonderful amenities, the ambiance, the fireplace, the fun of just being right down there in the heart of the city with a wonderful place to call home.  Then there was the surprise gift from the hotel of the “champagne” and fabulous chocolate cake!!  Thank you for arranging for that to happen",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Disappointed ,"The room is was dirty. Dingy and lots of steins on the walls and the ceiling. Disappointed that this Hilton was sub par. We had to call staff to request them to vacuum as the carpet had crumbs from the prior customers. The beds were comfortable. The room was quiet. The bar/restaurant area was nice and the manager from Plantation, Florida took care of us! Thank you! Staff was friendly. Please keep the rooms cleaner. Doubtful I’d return.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent service and kind staff ,I stayed here for a meeting and happened to be under the weather during my stay.  The staff made sure I had whatever I needed to feel comfortable.  They even brought me a water kettle for sinus washes and checked in on me.  Victoria Luna from their housekeeping team was amazingly attentive.  The room was well maintained and clean.  They had access to Netflix on the TV which was nice and the bed was very comfortable.  I would stay here anytime!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,outstanding service,"staff from front desk to housecleaners went above and beyond. excellent service everywhere, and great value for a downtown hotel. Helped when adult daughter became ill, and routinely helpful with 80+ y.o. mother.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Was let down,Just rude service the waiter took forever also as if we didnt exist rude to at check room wasnt ready by the time i got there was given attitude when i asked if my room was ready was bad experience...,1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Overpriced for what it was,"Room was not clean (didn’t appear vacuumed and bathroom not as clean as expected) upon arrival. Reported safe not working but it was never felt with. Location is far for winter from Convention center, would have picked something closer. Felt like it wasn’t a great value for price.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"A/C in room was broken, room not clean, and poor executive lounge.","Front desk receptionist were very friendly. Check-in was easy. Get up to our room, and the thermostat was reading 74 deg. Lowered it to 60, and it kept blowing out hot air. Notified the chamber maid which called  maintenance - confirmed the unit was not working and told us to keep the window open. (Though window had no screen).  They were unable to change our room, as the hotel was sold out. Was given a card with executive lounge hours, per the card - it was open on the weekend (see picture of the card). Evening reception was mediocre. They charge for any alcohol (even beer) which was a first. They ran out of food an hour into it (we arrived at around 6:30) and the person running it said there was nothing she could do (""I called the kitchen and they know about it""). Left after waiting 20-30 min. Tried to get coffee on Saturday morning, to find out that the lounge was closed the entire weekend despite being told by the receptionist that it was open - and given the hours on a card by the front desk. They gave us vouchers for breakfast, but only covered coffee and COLD food (basically yogurt or cold cereal).  They charged around $10 extra pp for hot food off the buffet. Wait staff in the morning were not friendly at all. Had to ask 3 times for coffee. Room was not cleaned properly. Shocked to see dirty dishes left in our room 2 days in a row.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Exemplary staff and facility!,"First of all, let me just say that we haven't even checked out but I couldn't wait to write this review because of how amazing our time here has been so far. My fiancé and I are staying here for our Valentine's weekend and I called ahead of time to set of a few things in the room. I believe I talked to Kevin and he was such a delight to speak with! We arrived in to the room and were so pleasantly surprised with the requests I had made. The hand written card from the staff was such a sweet and kind gesture. We travel often and who knew that all we had to do was drive 15 minutes to find our new favorite hotel! Thank you to all the staff for helping us make such great memories. We will be back soon!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good Service Recovery,"I stayed here 3 nights on a business trip to Denver and the accommodations were very comfortable. Great location, close to Convention Center and restaurants, room was updated and had a view of the city. I requested a microwave and it was delivered promptly. Nice fitness center. I had the misfortune of a cold shower my last morning (perhaps due to 18,000 physical therapists waking up at the same time in Denver that morning to get to a conference), but I was contacted by the hotel via text to inquire about my stay and when I reported my experience, they asked how they could make it right. I requested points toward a future stay and without hesitation, they were added to my account. This is why we are Hilton Honors members.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing stay!,I have a great stay here. No complaint at all. The restaurant beneath the lobby floor has delicious chicken sandwich. Slept in on the my last day and the hotel let me do late check out. Thanks to Michael for a good check out experience.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good business visit,Stayed here for an annual organization meeting covering 3 days.  Found the room clean and compfortable.  Room servicing was in the morning making the room available during the meetings. Did not use the recreation service.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Gorgeous hotel,This hotel is stunning. They only have one option for parking which is valet service with a pricy fee (it is downtown. The hotel is very clean with modern rooms. We would stay at this hotel again. Our kids loved the pool.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business or Pleasure?,"The Hilton Denver City Center is situated within walking distance to restaurants, Starbucks, Corner Bakery and Coors Field.  Upon arrival, we were drawn to the warmth of the fireplace and the friendly staff.  The lobby bar, although on the lower level, provides a casual setting and a some great snacks.  We recommend the popcorn!  The rooms are well-appointed with a refrigerator, coffee pot, safe and updated bathroom fixtures.  The meeting rooms on the lower level are easily-accessed by escalator.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great experience,"Great stay. There were some initial concerns when we checked into our room. The restroom still had trash in its bin and there was used Bar soap on the counter and in the bathtub that hadn’t been replaced. Also, the a/c was making a clicking noise. Thankfully, they provided a change and upgrade in the room.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Last minute get away,"We booked our stay here based off of other reviews and we absolutely loved it. The lobby was clean and sleek, staff was so helpful and ready to recommend things to do in a snow storm, the restaurant and bar was great and our room had a great view of the city and had been kept so clean throughout the stay. The location was right in the center of downtown and it was so easy to just walk everywhere we wanted to go. The only downfall is valet parking is $49/night which is very expensive and self parking is still $26/night and the parking garage is off site about a block away.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Impressive!,"I stayed at Hilton City Center for 4 nights (still here now) for work and I am pleasantly surprised and impressed. I am a corporate trainer and here for a client program. I travel extensively and work at many hotel properties. The Hilton City Center has exceeded my expectations.Front desk has been consistently wonderful. Responsive, friendly, quick. My room is very comfortable, always clean, and amenities always replenished. Bed and pillow are comfy. I requested a robe and extra blanket and the arrived straight away. View is great and plenty of room to get work done.The conference room I am working in is small, however comfortable. The temperature has been good (which is unusual for hotels...usually way too hot or cold.) Our AV guy, Luke, is TOP NOTCH!!! Professional, friendly, super responsive.Executive Lounge on 17th floor is great. Very nice breakfast with lots of choices. Good appetizers in evening. Always sodas, coffee, water, tea, and snacks throughout the day. Desserts in evening.Hotel is in a great location, just a block from 16th Street Mall with plenty of restaurant and shopping choices. Very close to convention center, as well. I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Diamond member—very underwhelming,"I had a bad check-in experience at this hotel. I’m a diamond member and have noticed during several recent stays that the front desk will fail to recognize the status or offer me information about my diamond benefits, upgrades, etc. I just checked in at the Hilton Denver city center and the gentleman at the desk just handed me a key card, without a word. No info on the hotel; no information on the executive lounge, WiFi, or other offerings; and certainly no upgrade offer. I told him politely that I’d seen online that there were suites available and asked if I might be upgraded. He told me the suites weren’t available for my entire stay, even though the Hilton app said they were. When I told him the app showed availability for a suite my entire stay, he got flustered and disappeared for a manager. The manager came out and told me the same thing—that availability in the app was wrong. He upgraded me to a smaller suite and handed me the room key without a word. I went to my room and realized I’d received no info; I didn’t know how to connect to the WiFi; where breakfast is served; what my options are for parking (for 5 days); where the fitness center is located—basically I’d received no information about my stay. I returned to the front desk and a different person helped me; when I told her I’d come back to find out this information, she said “oh sorry, my coworker forgot to tell you all that because of the commotion.”This was a very disappointing check in experience and I definitely do not appreciate being told that I caused “A COMMOTION” by asking for an upgrade. I don’t think I’ve ever felt as unwelcome at a Hilton brand property. I stay in Hilton properties frequently and I don’t think my expectations are unreasonable at all, but I certainly expect to be informed of basic hotel info and not to be accused of causing “a commotion” by asking for an upgrade.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Best hotel ever,"Great staff, great location! I highly recommend getting the honors program. I had the best experience here! The people were extremely nice and accommodating. The breakfast and the service was really quick and amazing.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Clean room, friendly staff, but train and garbage truck noise","I stayed here for one quick overnight while at a conference downstairs. Although I arrived before 11, they were able to let me check into my room. The king room was of ordinary size, with a comfortable bed and pillows. The bathroom was modern, clean, and had the usual amenities. I was on the 2nd floor, which may account for the noise. I could hear the light rail trains frequently, but I wasn't in the room a lot, so no big deal. But in the early morning, there was what sounded like a garbage truck banging a dumpster. My room looked over California street. Don't drive there! parking is $49/night. Lots of public transportation nearby, including free bus along 16th Street mall (two blocks away), which goes right down to Union Station.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Okay hotel during Convention Time ,"This was our first show at Outdoor Retailer and the hotel was 100% booked. I ended getting a room on the 7th floor which was a handicap room. They didn’t tell me this when I checked in and it was too late to make a change due to no more rooms. The bed is comfortable and you get a fridge. You have to pay for water but at least the wifi is free. The gym is large but super packed and the indoor pool is nice if your with kids. Overall; the hotel is average, but at least it’s clean and the bed is comfy.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,First Time Visit,"Great hotel, location, atmosphere, and staff.  Highly recommended when staying in Denver.  The front desk, events, and room cleaning staff were friendly and professional. (Why is there a required minimum number of words for the review? This is a ridiculous requirement.  Please remove this requirement.)",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Appreciation for helping me with a gift to my Finace',"Tonight, I called and talked to Jessica Cruz - Front Desk Supervisor and asked if she could help me with arranging a card and gift to my Fiance' that was attending an event at the hotel. Jessica was AMAZING!!! Her smile and cheerful personality went through the phone. She helped me and wrote in BEAUTIFUL hand writing what I wanted to say and arranged a bottle of wine also. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! Great Timing and execution. Prompt and professional. Jessica and Hilton Team....THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!! SO MUCH!!! I can't wait to travel to Denver soon and stay here!!! My Finance' was happily pleased and I'm blown away with the customer service!!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing!,Enjoyed the city before skiing in Aspen! Stayed at the Hilton Denver City Center for a birthday trip. Room had an amazing view of the city and layout very cool. The staff was very kind and helped me surprise my girlfriend with birthday champagne when we arrived.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great Value, Beautiful Hotel","I stay at a lot of hotels for quick business trips.  This hotel was perfect for what i was looking for.  Comfortable bed, soft warm lighting, good room-service food options, great wine [pinot noir - usually terrible in most hotels], great location, reasonably priced.  This will be my go-to as long as the prices remain reasonable.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Fine business hotel, but odd customer services lapses.","I’ve stayed here before, and it’s been fine, if not exciting. This time, the check-in was just odd, with several weird attempts to “upsell” me. When I arrived to check in (early, admittedly), instead of telling me my room wasn’t ready, or that there would be at $50 early check-in fee, the desk clerk went ahead and checked me in - then asked if I was a Hilton Honors member. After she looked me up, she said, “That’s great, so we can waive the $50 early check-in fee.” That was the first I’d heard of it. Odd, but since it was waived, no biggie. Then, she told me that they had me in an accessible room, looked me up and down, and asked if I *needed* an accessible room. When I said no, she offered me “a room on a higher floor with a king sized bed.” I told her that would be fine, since that’s what I’d requested anyway. When she told me there would be a $10 surcharge, I told her I couldn’t do that, because my room (for work) was at the government rate. Instead of backing down, she said, “That’s fine, we can just put it on your personal card.” Odd, and this time, a hell no - why would she assume I would pay extra (of my own money, when on work travel) for a higher floor? So she eventually put me back in a room on a lower floor (incidentally, not accessible, so who knows what that was about), and I moved on, shaking my head a little. Then I got to my room, where *the trash hadn’t been emptied.* That’s a first in my many years of business travel. There are so many excellent hotels within a block of here (e.g., the Monaco, the Magnolia, and a nice Residence Inn) that I can’t recommend staying at the Hilton, given all these oddities.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,As expected ,I arrived here for a conference and my room was ready. (As it should be since it was after 6pm). The rooms are clean and well appointed. No surprises which I consider a big plus when traveling for business. Front desk pleasant and helpful. Housekeeping did a great job. Dining is limited. There is a Starbucks in the lobby. Their restaurant/bar is in the lower level with bar food selections only. Not much to write home about. But there are lots of options nearby. My view from the 12th floor. Which was beautiful at night. But I was told there is a Mountain View. That’s a bit of a stretch since we are surrounded by tall buildings.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel,"Customer service was out of this world. Our hotel room was not ready at 9:30pm (check in was 4pm) and he made sure to get us in another room. We were in town for WESA and my husband competed at the rodeo that day and we were headed to the wrangler party that evening at the hotel. Having our toddler daughter with us and our room not being ready at 9:30pm was not good, but they got us in a different room ASAP",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Better options in Denver,Room was up to date but small and dark.  The HVAC unit was awful - didn't cool the room even with thermostat set at 60 degrees and fan set to high.  The bar food wasn't great but the staff was awesome.  The executive lounge was good for breakfast but pretty anemic the rest of the time.,2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton Believer,"We had a wonderful stay at this facility and the valet people were amazing as well as the whole staff. The location of the facility was wonderful and easy walking distance to all the shopping, the capital, the Molly Brown House, the mint and Union Station.  if you fly into Denver make sure you take the train to Union Station it's easy easy and the hotel will pick you up from there!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great Stay, Incredible Service, Wonderful Robes!","My wife and I stayed at the Hotel on Friday and Saturday night (01/10/20-01/12/20) and our stay could not have been better. We first went to our rooms and we were a little bummed to find there were no robes. We called down and found out that we had to request robes, and they are complimentary. The staff delivered our robes promptly and they were heavenly! The room was nice and the bed and bedding were perfect.  We actually did not leave the room often.The hotel is very conveniently located in downtown. Anything you would need is within a reasonable walking distance. There is even a Target only a block away.We were impressed by the staff, Justin the bartender was a real standout. He made my wife's drinks perfect every time and was incredibly helpful.Overall, I cannot think of anything that was not absolutely great!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Skip the Executive Lounge,"I’m torn on this hotel.  In most respects it’s a great hotel - great location, modern interior and the staff were impeccable. However, I paid extra to get access to the executive lounge - and to my surprise this lounge does not offer complimentary alcohol.  I have been to countless Hilton lounges and this is the first one that I’ve seen that didn’t offer complimentary alcohol.  I also didn’t see any hot food when I was there (but could be wrong). I would definitely skip the lounge.  I definitely regret paying for it and think Hilton should call it something else to avoid confusion - it is not an executive lounge as most of us know it. Also the walls are very thin so the rooms can be noisy - I could hear a neighbours TV and another neighbour snoring.  When another guest closed their door my whole room shook.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very Good Hotel,I want to compliment the checkin staff which were very nice.Rooms were clean and modern.Location is right in the center of Denver.Big improvement from when this hotel was the Marriott many years ago.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place and great location,"Awesome hotel, comfortable beds and rooms.  Location is convenient and the lobby has great areas to hang out by the fireplace and in the upper loft area.  Kyoto Ramen next Dior has the best ramen, and Starbucks in the lobby is great as well.Parking - valet is outrageous at $50 a day, but Stout Garage which is around the corner has a deal for $5 per night (6pm - 6am) and works perfect!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent experience,We loved everything about this stay with Hilton. Staff was great and very helpful. Breakfast food was great. Enjoyed having a very clean room.  The swimming pool area is kept very clean and we were able to enjoy.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,2020 New Year Celebration!,"My family and I had a wonderful overnight stay in the 18th floor! Beautiful views, excellent free breakfast, and a wonderfully appointed room. Excellent staff and service from the valets, managers, and concierge. I would definitely stay here again for a trip to downtown Denver. Very close proximity to 16th Street Mall and so many restaurants! 5 stars!!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great price,"Flew in saturday for the bronco game sunday.  Price was great.  Location was great.  A lot of other fans stayed there also.  Bathroom was too small for my taste,  especially that tiny shower.  Room was small but clean and nice.  Served its purpose.  Would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Thank you Hilton!,"It was such a great experience for our family staying at the Hilton! Being upgraded to a Diamond Status for that stay was unexpected and the upgrade made our stay experience exceed our expectations. The staff was polite and courteous, the valet service was great as well, the amenities and the cleanliness of the surroundings were wonderful and most of all, the use of the Executive Lounge, heightened an already great experience. Our hotel stay was worth every penny that we spent on. I’ll surely use Hilton again on my  future trips with friends and family",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful Stay,"Right from the start, Ben at the front desk really listened and took great care of us, he was amazing. All of the staff were the best, and so kind. The room was awesome! We loved our night at the Hilton! We will definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Holiday Trip,"Had a wonderful stay here over Christmas. Savannah and Kevin went above and beyond for me. It was my first time staying at this property and I received an email from Savannah on the morning of my arrival letting me know that she’d upgraded me to the Diamond of the day which came with an upgraded room and access to the Executive perks.Everything was what you would expect from a Hilton property, nice, clean, updated, rooms. Friendly and accommodating staff across the board.Will absolutely be returning to this hotel and if you’re coming to Denver, I highly recommend making this place your choice of lodging.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,I will stay at Hilton hotel again and again,"wonderful people, clean rooms, and the hotel is near 16th street mall for shopping. you can drop your luggage and come back to check in later. free computer to print out your boarding pass. love it. love it.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton Denver City Center,"Stayed for one night for family trip.  Staff was very courteous, professional.  Hotel, room, very clean.  Location was excellent. Only drawback was that bathroom, esp shower, was small.  Desks, furniture felt a little outdated.  Lobby was smallish for a large 4 star hotel.  Overall, good stay.  Would recommend.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place to stay,"My wife and I enjoyed our three nights downtown.  The hotel was very clean and modern. The gym is big with lots of new high quality machines, some free weights, and some pilates equipment. The pool is nice and is open 5 am to 11 pm. The hotel is only a few blocks from the 16th street mall. There are lots of great restaurants and shops within a 10 minute walk.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Awesome hotel in the heart of Downtown.,I loved the location and the view from floor 20 is amazing. Definitely upgrade if available. Staff was great and. Lyndzy made messaging the hotel a breeze over the app. The concierge hadn't arrived yet and she knew the answers to all my questions.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Birthday Trip,Had a great time and love the location.The staff was amazing very personal. The valet service was frustrating when we were checking in we were told we had to turn over keys though we weren't going to use the service.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Outstanding hotel,Outstanding Hotel]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]We recently stayed here overnight to meet up with friends and go to the Botanical Gardens Blosoms of Light. The hotel is located in a safe area and is easy to get around to the main attractions in Denver. Once you park you can walk to most all of the Downtown attractions.The staff was very friendly at checkin and checkout. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable.I would highly recommend this hotel!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice hotel, VERY Convenient!","I was here on a business trip, for a conference at the hotel. It was well done. Food was great at each meal. The service staff for the meals was excellent. Check-in and -out was swift and friendly. It was walking distance to a lot of restaurants and retail stores.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent location,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. The hotel is in a great location and close to the 16th street and convention center, One can walk to many shops and restaurants. One can also take complementary 16th street trolley and visit various parts of downtown conveniently. Executive lounge offers a good breakfast and snacks during happy hours.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location and lovely hotel,"Really beautiful hotel in a great location and walking distance to so many shops and restaurants.  We took the train in from the airport to Union Station and took the 16th street trolley (free) to within a few blocks of the hotel.  We ate that first night in the hotel's restaurant, Prospect's, during Happy Hour, and it was good food for a great price.  We chose not to get a rental car as the parking fee is very high, but to be expected in a downtown high-end hotel.  Would definitively stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,$49.00 valet parking,Nice hotel. Clean and comfortable. Great location to downtown Denver. If you are driving stay somewhere else. Self parking is not available and their valet is $49.00 per night. They don't tell you that at the desk. There are other similar hotel options in the downtown area that have free self-parking.,2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Location location location,"We stayed here for 3 nights December 6th-9th. We had an executive room, 1716. My favorite thing about this hotel is the location.  Very short walk to the 16th street mall with numerous restaurants and shopping. To our surprise the Parade of lights happened to be this weekend and the parade went down 17th St, right in front of the hotel.  We had an amazing view from our room but went out to see it anyways as the weather this weekend was great! High of 55F! If you have an executive room or are a Hilton Honors Member you have the option of a great complimentary breakfast buffet in the executive suite. There were eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, fresh fruit, pastries, coffee, 3 types of juices and your regular english muffins, toast, oatmeal and cereal, as well as a cooler with bottled water and soda. The rooms were modern with Crabtree & Evelyn products in the bathroom. There was also a Starbucks on site. Some things I would fix: We requested a remote control for the TV after we checked in via the phone # left on the nightstand. We received a response we'd have it soon and it took a phone call the following morning to receive it; the refrigerator would not close properly and Starbucks closes at 1pm on Saturday and Sunday.  Also provided with the executive room (or Hiton Honors members) is a period in the evening where they serve appetizers, mostly deli meats and cheeses along with their ""honor bar"" (basically take a glass of wine or beer and write you room # down to be charged). This was closed on Sunday for a private event. I would think that with the number of venues within the hotel to have such an event, it would be held there, rather than taking the benefits of others who've paid for these amenities. There is no parking onsite, only valet service at $49/day. They do provide a shuttle within 2 miles of the hotel and the free public transportation in the area is frequent and across the street.  Long story short I'd stay here again and also recommend it to others because of the upscale amenities and location.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent service and rooms,"I stay here many times a year for work.  My rooms are always clean and great.  The bartenders are great and always remember me, even when I had only stayed here a couple times.  I can always count on going to the bar and them remembering my drink even months later.  You can't get that any where else!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay!,"We stayed at this gorgeous hotel in September while in Colorado for a wedding. Absolutely perfect stay. The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of everything, making it super easy to get around to shopping and eateries. Valet parking is a smidge pricey, but that's to be expected. We were incredibly comfortable during our stay, and we deeply appreciated the kindness of the staff here. We look forward to hopefully returning someday!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Pleasant and Enjoyable Stay,"I had an excellent experience at the downtown Hilton. The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. The room was wonderful and the overall experience excellent. The only issue would be that the restaurant pricing was rather excessive.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very helpful,A Great Employee!!! Very helpful with any questions that I had! Remember that good employees are hard to come by. I will recommend that you get this one on your next trip. I think that the snow is the last thing on my mind.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,SC 19 Conference Ttrip,"Stayed at the Hilton Denver City Center for SC19 - great facility after the Marriott conversion.  For me it was a little far to walk back and forth from the convention, but their complimentary house car made it more than accessible and enjoyable.  Great staff and excellent accommodations.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice decoration and good service,"Exceptional hotel with: A great bathroom design.Responsive/informative TV/satellite system.Nice garden view.Very good restaurant (enjoyed the southwest flatbread for breakfast).Recommendations:Shower water pressure could improve.Valet service communication– most of the time they answered the phone, but at check-out they didn’t, so I was a little late to my appointment. Didn’t try texting them, perhaps that should be the only option. This was my first time in Denver and didn’t research the car parking options. The hotel offered the $49.00 per night option (with unlimited in/out access). Valet parking representatives mentioned 24-hour security and they promised (and delivered) the car in 15 minutes or less. My only issue was adding this to travel time, as my preference is to always be on-time.Overall, I recommend this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great downtown hotel!,"Staff is friendly, and Hilton Honors benefits during our stay were great! Walking distance from convention center and a variety of retail stores such as Target, Walgreens and CVS and restaurants -- 16th Street Mall is awesome and we highly recommend eating at Henry's!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice Hotel, Spotty Room Prep, Unreliable WiFi","This Hilton is convenient to much of Downtown Denver.  There are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops nearby.  Having the target one block away is very convenient.  Getting there is easy too as there are many public transit options (e.g., take the Free Mall bus from Union Station).The rooms themselves are well designed and up-to-date.  The biggest problem, and it was continuously annoying, was that the rooms were not well prepped.  Prior traveler’s items were left in the room, things that should have been there weren’t, and inexplicably the number of towels got smaller by the day.  Almost as big was the WiFi.  Connectivity was strong throughout most of the day. However, from 7:30 to 9:00 in the morning it regularly dropped.  This made working in the morning almost impossible. Oh, and the beds and pillows weren't very comfortable.There was a large convention going on so maybe to housecleaning and the internet were just overwhelmed.  I’d still recommend but likely wouldn't go back unless the price was lower than comparable chains.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Concierge,"Rich Zaccagna is the concierge at Hilton Denver City Center. He was so helpful to me and my whole family whom were all in town for a wedding. He helped us all figure out how to get to where we needed. He showed so much patience with my family, some of whom are novice travelers and not tech savvy that needed help with airline check in, boarding passes, etc. He takes the time to make sure to give you all the info you need for whatever you are wanting to do. He truly is a gem. The hotel in general is awesome as well. We never wanted for anything. Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Staff and accommodations,"Very friendly staff which were always willing to be of service. From the front desk, concierge, housekeeping and valet, all were ready to serve in anyway needed. The staff morale must be high as their service exemplifies such.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Fine,"The shower was very small, but overall the room was fine.The A/C unit was a bit temperamental -- either too hot to too cold.The restaurant was just okay.  Some of the seats at the bar are in bad shape and the covers are torn and the padding and cover need to be replaced.I had a burger one time -- it was drowned in sauce and the bread was completely soggy.Next time was a turkey sandwich -- don't order it -- cheap cold cuts and drowned and soggy.The fries were really good.The food is mediocre and over priced, and the place is a bit in disrepair.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, great staff.","The Hilton Denver City Center is pretty close to most everything you needed.  There is walk-ability to 16th street mall, shopping, groceries, and more.  I certainly have no complaints with our stay...five stars (or dots)",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very good location and amenities!,"I stayed here to attend a conference and for meetings in Denver. The location is excellent and the hotel has a good restaurant, bar and workout facility. The rooms are comfortable and clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. The concierge, Rich, is a real pro who directed us to fantastic restaurants nearby. Savannah at the front desk was very helpful as well. This is a very good place to stay when in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,The royal treatment,"What can I say?  Doesn't our experience begin and end by the way the people treat us?! It's a make or break for me. Upon checking into the hotel I was greeted by Kevin at the front desk. Talk about getting the royal treatment... this guy turned my post 17-hour flight(s) frown upside down and was a ray of sunshine on a frosty day. I just knew right then and there that this would reflect a great deal on this hotel and my next week staying here and so exactly it was.  My room on the 14th floor was quiet, spotless, very roomy & comfy.  I took advantage of the room service that Kevin suggested because he could tell that I was just too exhausted to start looking for restaurants about town.Rich, the hotel concierge will restore your faith in the kindness you never knew you were entitled to. Bless him! Simply a great experience. Don't go elsewhere. This place is lovely.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Christopher & front desk great service!!!,"Christopher checked us in and had exemplary customer service!! He made our stay very welcoming.

"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good Meeting Space ,We were here for a 3 day conference.  Meeting space was great.  Room was very nice.  The hotel restaurant food was very good but service was very slow. Same for the bar staff. There is a Starbucks in the lobby. The hotel was centrally located. About 30 minutes from the airport.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,ROOM NOT CLEANED,"Terrible room service. My friend and I stayed for 3 nights and housekeeping never cleaned our room. Not only that, we had to go to the front desk and request clean towels and toilet paper on a daily basis. They apologized, however every day we would come back and our room was never cleaned!! My friend and I are deaf and we can’t call to request things so we had to go to the front desk to request toilet paper and clean towels. This is a Hilton one would think the room would be cleaned daily!! I will never stay at a Hilton again!!",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing service,We stayed at this hotel and it was awesome service. The concierge was very helpful and accommodating. He helped us rent a car had us driven around in the hotel truck. Even after we checked out we left our luggage there they dropped us off at our destination and picked us up with our luggage then dropped us off at the train station. Absolutely would stay here again. Nothing but great things to say about our stay here.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful Hotel,This is a beautiful hotel and a perfect location. I spent 3 nights there and that staff were excellent. I had a minor problem and the front desk manager was extremely attentive. I would stay at this hotel again. The room and lobby were beautiful and the restaurant has an ama zing breakfast.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Underwhelming,"Outside of the first floor this was very average compared to most hotels of this caliber. The bathroom didn’t have a fan, our key cards never worked for the Executive lounge, and the pool is quite small for such a large hotel.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient and comfortable,In town for the Film Festival.  This hotel was convenient to the 16th street mall for easy access to the venue and various places to eat.  Check in was quick and the desk clerk helped me use the card reader which was placed at a height possibly designed for your average male business traveler instead of this vertically challenged retired librarian.  The room itself was lovely with a street view and nice furniture and good lighting for reading in bed.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A very nice hotel.,"Stayed at the Hilton Downtown Denver for 1 night checking in on November 4th.  I'm actually a Hilton Diamond Member but Priceline - price for comparable room was50% cheaper (Half price, who could resist?)  So were forego'd  the possible upgrade, concierge lounge access, free breakfast, etc.  and decided to take a gamble on the priceline room and were pleasantly surprised.  Ended up being placed in a very clean 12th floor room with a view of the front Atrium.  Location wise, its right in the heart of Downtown denver right by the 16th Street Mall, and about a 3-4 block walk Denver Pavilion.   We had a rental car but opted to park it at a parking garage via Spot Hero , which i'm sure saved us a ton.  Starbucks in the lobby was decent, and the gym and pool appeared to be very clean. (just took a look but didn't actually use it)    Overall, would NOT hesitate to stay at this Hilton again. (Minus 1 star for our air conditioning / heating system in the room which in the middle of the night started to make a loud flopping noise, which woke me up.   Turning off the unit and turning it back on resolved the issue, but still.....)",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great business hotel in the heart of downtown Denver!,"Great location in the downtown Denver. Close to major O&G company offices. Appears to be a newer property or at least newly redecorated. Rooms are on the smaller side but well appointed. No bathtubs only showers. Friendly and helpful staff, good customer service.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,WCET Conference ,"This hotel is clean, quite, and walkable to Denver’s attractions (next door to 16th street mall) On Tues. they have free yoga and yogurt! It was great and the instructor a charm! Definitely should offer a few times  a week! And all I can say about the catered food - WOW!! The food was phenomenal!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel; great location,"Nice hotel and great location in the city.  Very clean and much to offer in the way of amenities, gym, restaurant, bar, etc.  Close to the 16th Street Mall area.  Also has a nice club level with good offerings.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Go Broncos!,"Welcomed by a friendly staff, we enjoyed our two nights stay in Denver! Great location to walk to restaurants and shopping! The amenities and accommodations were excellent!  Thank you to Keagan for going up & above and making our stay extra special!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Ok hotel, but disgraceful room service","I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The room I had was large, clean and with dated decor. My mountain view room offered a glimpse between newly constructed buildings blocking the view. Staff was friendly and solution-driven within their power. Location is right downtown near the conference centre and many restaurants. I ate in the restaurant, and it was quite good. The bar is not somewhere you’d want to hang out, since they have huge TV screens on. I opted for room service...... and on that note, the room service is some new idea by management that all items be brought to your room in a bag, with disposable containers, napkins and cutlery. It is a disgraceful amount of waste, and the staff feel powerless to make change. Thumbs down, Hilton!!!",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful location ,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The lobby is very nice and they have a Starbucks onsite.  The gym was great for a hotel and they have a nice indoor pool.  Breakfast in the executive lounge was above average.  My room was clean and modern and the beds were very comfortable.   Very nice bathroom.  Fridge and safe in the room.  Incredible location that is walkable to hundreds of bars and restaurants + shopping.  Train is accessible right out the front door.   Highly recommended.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Clean, modern suite but customer service lacking","I can attest to the fact that the front desk staff were very friendly and expedited my check in. Also, my room was beautiful and modern and very clean. I would have given them five stars, except for a couple of points. First, I erroneously booked this hotel because I thought they had a hot tub. In fact, the front desk attendant made a point of pre-warning me that they didn't have one! Second, I had to go down to the lobby each day to get further coffee supplies because the cleaning staff did not restock them. I know that this is minor, but I would expect that this would be on a check list and that after complaining the first time they would have have it fixed after that. I expect that when paying for a top rated hotel, customer service would be much higher. However, I am not suggesting that people shouldn't go. There are enough good points about that I may come back, but I cannot give them five stars.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location - Nice Accommodations - Average Value,"I visited this hotel for four nights for a conference. Overall the hotel was very clean and extremely convenient being right downtown. That being said, the room was a bit pricey and the cost for parking my car was more than the cost of the car itself! I wish I had used a rideshare instead.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Awesome ,"Super friendly check in.  Beautiful big room with a chaise lounge chair.  Extremely clean. I would absolutely stay again - this might even be my go to hotel for future trips...I’ve stayed at some other big properties in Denver, and this is by far the best within my price range.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver Business trip,"I was extremely pleased with my stay at Hilton Denver City Center. The location was perfect for my work conference, walking distance to the Convention center. The room was clean and bed was very comfy. The Hilton Honors app with digital key, check in & out was perfect.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Solid hotel....Great location...,"We moved from a hotel down the street mid vaca so we could try something different. Upon check in we were told that our room wasn’t ready but we could pay 50.00 for an upgraded suite...We did. The room looked amazing walking in...top of line appearance. Awesome bed and two huge mounted TVs. The hotel is a short walk too many restaurants and bars as well as a target. Great location...Very clean and fancy looking hotel. Negatives- Room smelled like weed upon entering...not what we would expect after paying to upgrade to a suite. NO AIR CONDITIONING....Seriously, stunned. I set the thermostat in both rooms down to 60 degrees and all the units did was blow out warm air. We had an engineer come up and check on the room and he said that “sometimes the guest shut the AC valve” ...weird. Anyways, the room had to have been high 70s all night...we ended up not really being able to sleep so we got up early and headed to the airport.This hotel had so much promise but our stay was ruined because of the AC issues which appear to be consistent in other reviews.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great first visit to Denver,"Hilton Denver City Center was a great pick and a great price for our first visit to Denver.  Add on top of that the best concierge we have ever encountered, Richard Zaccagna.  He went above and beyond to give us advice ahead of arrival and while we were there and he made our trip much more enjoyable with his tips, especially the Red Rock Amphitheater experience.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing room!,"The room was stunning: huge comfy bed on a pedestal, shelves surrounding. Plenty of storage and surfaces. A small parlor area. Refrigerator, too. Would have liked more dining options. Nice to have Starbucks in the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Conference stay,Staff was excellent.  Friendly and extremely accommodating.   Rooms were nice and clean. Only negative was they forgot to replace trash bag and tissue daily.   Executive lounge was great and the staff very friendly.  Would recommend and stay again!,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Clean but no bathroom privacy,Staff was friendly and helpful. The property appears to have been recently renovated. Room was clean and nice. My only complaint about the room is that there is little privacy in the bathroom. It’s a barn door and has a two inch gap all around which is obviously less than soundproof. Bad design! Gift shop is closed on Sundays which is inconvenient. Overall a good property but probably wouldn’t stay here again if traveling with anyone.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place to stay!,This was a really great place to stay and have our annual meeting. Staff was very courteous and helpful. The food was really good! Room was clean and comfortable! I would definitely recommend Hilton to anyone traveling to Denver!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Conference,"Excellent location, staff, accommodations, nearby restaurants and convenience store, conference facilities. Weather couldn't have been better; sunshine each day and snow on the mountains in the distance. I hope I have another conference to attend here.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient location with quality staff,"I like this hotel for business or tourist visits to Denver. Easy access to downtown, Lodo and Cherry Creek with the highway close for DTC and airport drives.I had an upgraded room with a sitting area, bed on a platform and shower with rain style shower head. It was a little dark (not much sun could get in), but it was stylish, comfortable and clean. I will definitely be back.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Terrible Night,"I stayed at this hotel last weekend for a bachelor party. Checked in at 9:30pm, left right after and didn't get back to the room until about 2:30am. Upon our return, we discovered that they AC did not work. I tried calling the front desk three times, but nobody answered (isn't this a 24 hour property?). My partner and I spent the entire night miserably hot. We were able to get the fan to work, but it had hardly any power, so alas we were hungover in a 90 degree room. Making matters worse, I don't think the AC or heat would be sufficient in this room to begin with -- the room's only vent faced the curtains.On top of that, there was also crushed up cereal behind the room's couch, and nail clippings on the desk. I don't know how they overlooked that... but eeewwww. And housekeeping came aggressively knocking around 9:00am -- three hours before checkout. Not to mention that we had the do not disturb sign up, this was a terrible annoyance and disruption. The front desk did not care to hear about any of this when I checked out. I would not stay her again. Even though I got a pretty good last-minute deal, this ranks among my worst nights in a hotel.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Best hotel with friendliest staff,"Best hotel, friendliest staff wonderful service. Located in the heart of downtown Denver and walking distance to everywhere. This place is great for business or vacation. Restaurant on premise is excellent. Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Long weekend,We arrived at the hotel after midnight and were able to check-in with no problems. The room was comfy and clean. The location is perfect for getting to many of the city attractions. We walked everywhere. We didn't take the train system anywhere but it was conveniently located right outside the hotel. We opted to pass on housekeeping the first 2 days but wanted service on the 3rd. We got new towels and linens but nothing else was replaced that had been used. We tried the restaurant but weren't impressed. The sweet potato bites however were excellent. Will stay here again.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Ecellent Location,The hotel has an excellent location very convenient for almost everything.The hotel itself is very nice with great front office staff.Rooms are very good with very nice bathrooms.  But some of the rooms seem to get a lot of noise from the adjacent rooms.Convenient coffee shop in the hotel.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay,"I was very impressed with the amazing service at this hotel. The room was very clean, comfortable and quiet. If you want a quick bite I highly recommend their mac and cheese with green chilies, it has just the right amount of spiciness.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Best service—thanks Chris!!,"From the moment we got to the Hilton, we were welcomed by Chris at the front desk. He went out of his way to make sure we had the most comfortable stay. He got us the room we wanted with extra amenities! We were staying here on the last night of our honeymoon, which came up in conversation at check in. We were totally surprised when we got to our room and there was a card, wine, and dessert from Chris waiting for us! Best service! We loved our stay!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Perfect for our Bad Moms Weekend,"I met two girlfriends at the Hilton Denver City Center for a long weekend away from our 5 kids under age 4. WHOA. We all flew in from different parts of the country and chose a hotel relatively central to many options so we wouldn't have to be concerned about driving. Because OBVIOUSLY. Holy cow. The hotel was seriously a couple of blocks from everything. Close to the Mall Ride, close to a LIQUOR STORE, close to a Target, close to a 7-11, and just a short walk to several areas with walk-in bars and restaurants. And to top it all off, we explained our trip at check-in and Tori hooked. us. up. An hour after we arrived, a knock at the door (we weren't THAT loud, surely) revealed a basket of wine and crackers and cheese, welcoming the bad moms and letting us know where we could easily find Advil. Tori is aces. Smart TV for easy Netflix login, more than enough wifi signal. We stayed on the 12th floor with a city view.This hotel is the best.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,First time in Denver,"The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful. If you are in Denver for pleasure, stop at the concierge. His recommendations for restaurants,shops and site seeing were outstanding. He really made our trip. The hotel is a great location, a block from the 16th street market.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Enough ,"Stayed here for one night on business in Denver. The room was very nice. Bathroom well lit. The HVAC did not perform well, not cool enough. I was charged $10 to receive a package. Which I thought was ridiculous. I receive packages regularly while staying at hotels. This is the first time I remember getting charged. Maybe this company wide and I just haven’t experienced it before.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing service,"We stayed here a few days for our honeymoon this week. Adrian Aragon, the employee who checked us ensured we had an amazing time. When we got our room, there was a bottle of white wine, and cheese/crackers/jam for us to celebrate! She also made sure we had breakfast every morning in the executive lounge. Last but my least, we got two free drinks from the bar. She went above and beyond to make sure we had a blast! We will be back next time we are in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Fabulous hotel, great service and location","Clean room, great food. Room temperature was perfect. Really nice location for a conference. The conference food was excellent.  Concierge service was great. Definitely recommend this hotel for business or pleasure. Located in downtown very close to 16th St. where there is shopping, walking, eating opportunities. Plenty of Lyft drivers, can service, and a hotel car service to Union Station.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hotel staff is absolutely wonderful!,"I was in town for a week to attend a work conference and did not have one bad experience my entire time at the Hilton Denver City Center. All of the staff, from the front desk to housekeeping to the restaurant team were all amazing. And, Rich at the Concierge Desk was by far the nicest and most helpful person I encountered during my entire stay in Denver. He went out of his way to make sure my group had a wonderful time. And, he's a wealth of knowledge for local sites, transportation, etc. I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"For superior accommodations, service and location stay at this hotel!",We ran into an issue with our reservation that we had booked through hotwire and the front desk was very accommodating and was able to secure a night for us despite showing that they were sold out for the night.   She not only did that but she also gave us executive club access for the evening and breakfast for the inconvenience we experienced which by the way had nothing to do with the Hilton but Hotwire.  She just wanted to make us feel better as we had been there 2 nights and our 3rd night which we thought was booked was actually not booked.  We will be coming back to this Hilton!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Staff makes this Hilton excel,"Staff I encountered during my two-night stay was exceptionally friendly and polite — housekeeping, front desk, bar staff, and concierge. Bell staff even let a group of us use the employee elevator to avoid a long wait for the main elevators when a conference let out. It felt like we got a mini “backstage tour!”The hotel’s food was fabulous, too — what was served as part of the conference, as well as at the bar. Happy hour was hopping, and I can see why. The margarita flatbread was especially satisfying; I visited twice because of it!Room 516 overlooks the building and square next door and was relatively quiet. It was clean and on the small side, but perfectly adequate for a solo traveler on a short stay. Any “complaints” I have are minor: 1.) Tried to catch valet staff for the hotel shuttle, but after 15 minutes they were still MIA, so I opted to hoof it in the heat. 2.) I’d requested a king bed and got a double queen; usually, I’m asked beforehand if that’s okay (which it usually is), so it was just a surprise.The hotel is in a great location with easy access to public transportation, restaurants, and the convention center... I’d happily stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Bathroom not good,The shower was soooo small and uncomfortable.  Seems as though a man designed it.   Very disappointing and hard to get ready in to go out.  Also did not like elevator situation.   Slow to come up and down and hotel has long halls.  We were far from elevator.  Request to be closer.  The dining choice was minimal.  Down an escalator that did not work was a bar / restaurant area.  Very cold environment.  Not cozy.  Wait staff was nice.  It was like a sports bar environment.     Was able to get Starbucks both mornings in nice shop connected to hotel main lobby.   Valet staff excellent.  And when asking for towels from housekeeping they were helpful.  Bed was fine.  I would only come back to this hotel if I was going to a convention in the hotel and there were no other choices.  Checking in and out my husband took care of.  No problem.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Extra ordinary,"I stayed there for a one night reservation returning from Vail and spent our anniversary at your hotel. I was simply blown away by the service and will to problem solve by each person I interacted with.I got a presidential suite upgrade, which in itself for awesome....the room is just fantastic. But the way the hotel members interacted was just too good for me not to comment.I really must commend Lynzy, Olivia and Vanity. Lynzy because she upgraded us and made the stay super special. Our social media friends are all jealous!! Olivia because she is the world's greatest problem solver and knew answers to all our questions. Vanity because she helped us with not one, but 2 humidifiers after my nose was completely blocked (thanks Colorado weather!) at 1 am in the night. Its hard to think a downtown hotel would ever make me feel this way, but this was my best hilton stay so far. I cant stop gushing about this hotel to anyone who will listen to me.I hope to be back soon, and I hope these people feel appreciated!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Dirty Dirty Dirty,"I found other people’s hair in my bathroom in several places and that was it.  First, there were multiple hairs on the toilet tank (not seat) and then, while showering, there was a woman’s hair in my soap dish.  The mirror was also smeared.  While I am not a housekeeper, I suspect someone was clearing with a dirty rag or the cleaning was just not thorough. Beyond that,  the hotel is very nicely located just a few blocks from the mall which is super convenient.  There is also self parking just a block away.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice and clean,"We only stayed one night but it was comfortable, reception was friendly, bathroom was big and clean. They had a 24 hour gym with plenty of running and weights machines and also had a water machine where we could fill up our bottles",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good Hotel,"The hotel room was impressively large and  clean. The hotel was quiet, making it easy to get work done in my room. The hotel was well run and efficient. Overall a very good choice, particularly for business.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent hotel.,"Great hotel. The only problem I experienced was noise from a presidential room on the floor above but we solved it with help of the guest service and security. The remaining was excellent -- room, design of interior, quality of breakfast, cool stuff like a fireplace in lobby/restaurant etc.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place,Recently stayed had a great time. Everyone was great from the front desk to the restaurant. Special thanks to Christian for making my fiance's birthday great!! I highly recommend great location staff is friendly and helpful.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location!,"We really enjoyed our recent stay at this Hilton property. Ben, at the desk, was professional and remembered us by name with each entry and exit. It is a nice property and centrally located. Thanks, Ben, for a great experience.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Best Customer Service, Beautiful Property",The front desk staff and management are world class here. They went above and beyond to make my stay exceptional (including bringing milk and cookies to my room one evening). The hotel interiors are great and the location is very convenient in downtown Denver. Will be back.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,X,Great stay at Hilton City Center.  Four days at conference held at hotel.  Every staff member was welcoming and kind.  My room was lovely and very clean.  The 17th floor executive area is a real bonus and provides a nice space to catch up on emails or visit with other guests.  All in all I would give the Hilton City Center in Denver Colorado five stars!  Ginny,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Conference,"Hotel room good, as expected.  Hotel staff very helpful and particularly the concierge in lining up trip and adventure arrangements.  One knock - could not reach anyone when I tried calling to complain about pot smell from room above.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel stay,Our stay at this property was very excellent from the maid service to the front desk and all in between! The concierge was the best of all. I will not continue with this voluntary contribution of comments to fulfill your ridiculous requirements,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great experience,"Here for my bachelor party, and Christian was amazing at check in, the hotel was very busy. It he took his time and the experience was great.  My room was spacious and bed was very comfortable! Rich at the concierge desk was great too! Will be back and will be staying here!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Disappointing,"I have always held Hilton Hotels in high regard, but this one fell short. The staff at the front desk and the maintenance staff were great. Housekeeping was hit or miss. One evening we came back and they had only dumped the trash, replaced only two towels, and pulled the comforter up. They didn’t even straighten the pillows, smooth out the bed or tuck in the covers. The workout facilities are fantastic, though. They also assigned us to a room we didn’t ask for and we ended up dealing with a shower that spewed water all over the floor every time we used it. We needed the other two towels just to wipe up the floor after we showered. They seem to cater to the convention crowd. I wouldn’t recommend it for leisure, especially considering the cost.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Highly recommend this hotel and their event staff,"Megan and her team were extremely helpful and with them on our side our event went smoothly and easily. I highly recommend working with Megan if you need to plan an event!The staff at the UPS store on site were also great and were fast, efficient, and friendly.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Summer in Denver,"Nice hotel, super staff and very comfy bed. Great location in the heart of Denver. Nice restaurants within walking distance. Nice indoor pool and exercise room. Great view from our room, overlooking a tree lined plaza.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good downtown hotel,"Overall this hotel was good. It's rooms were clean and offered a coffee machine, refrigerator, and TV with good channels. The room was a little small but good enough for two people. Conveniently located two blocks from the 16th Street mall! This hotel is in a very walkable and scootable area. If you're looking for a hotel downtown, this is a great choice.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Loved it!,This is a great Hilton! Being a gold member I was treated great from check in to check out! The beds were comfy and the location is great. Breakfast was ok. Need a few more gluten free options. Very convenient location. Will definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very comfortable hotel,We really enjoyed our stay here! The front desk staff was friendly and welcoming. Valet parking was smooth. Would recommend booking parking through SpotHero as that made parking a good bit cheaper! The rooms were very tastefully designed and decorated. The beds were super comfortable! The rooms were quiet. The fitness room was nice and the pool was clean and about the right temp! Would definitely stay here again! Thanks for a good stay!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton Denver City Center got almost nothing right!,"Checked in without issue, front desk staff was courteous and efficient. Was a bit disappointed when I got in the room and found that the requested bath tub room was a shower only but understood that this was only a request with no guarantees. My wife noticed two candy wrappers on the floor by the beds and fingernail clippings on the carpet, not just one or two but many. Wife freaked out and told me to call down and get a different room. I called the front desk about this and was told that the hotel was booked solid but they would send up housekeeping to vacuum and accommodate a  change in rooms which would include a bathtub the next day at 5PM. Next day, 5PM, family was all packed up and ready to switch rooms, I went down to the front desk to change rooms and was told that no rooms were clean but to go back to my room and I would be called once my room was ready, no later than 6:30PM. I waited till 7PM, no call, I called down asking about my room and was told that no rooms were available yet but they would let me know once a room became available. Now I was agitated because of the lack of follow-up by each progressive person I spoke with. I told the last person to forget it, I was withdrawing my request and was disgusted with the cleanliness of the room and the lack of response to make it right by putting me into a different room. Next day I got a call about 2PM from the front desk letting me know that I could switch rooms, at this point it was to late because I would be checking out the next morning at 3:30AM. At about 7PM I received a call from the hotel manager letting me know that he heard about my difficulty with the room cleanliness and the poor followup on the room switch and apologized. I appreciated that the manager was finally involved and recognized the issue. The manger went on to offer me 10,000 points on my Hilton Honors to make up for the inconvenience. I accepted the 10,000 points but of course this did not make for the aggravation that this caused my family. If this had been the only two issues at this hotel, I would have rated Hilton Denver City Center a 2 or 3 but it wasn't. My first night stay, I visited the pool which was very nice. My boys and I had been swimming for about 30 minutes when a Mother of a young girl let me know that her daughter had thrown up in the other end of the pool. The Mother advised everybody in the pool and also stated she had called the front desk to let them know about the accident. Everybody vacated the pool area. One of my sons and I came back down to the workout area after changing. The workout room also serves as the entrance to the pool. We looked in on the pool and saw that the vomit had not been cleaned up in either the pool or the deck area. A wet floor sign was in front of the deck area but other than that there was no sign warning people to stay out of the pool area. A maintenance person did pass by and I mentioned that there was nothing stopping people from entering the pool area, I'm not certain the maintenance worker understood what I was saying. My son and I were in the workout area for the next hour and twenty minutes and warned at least 15 to 20 people to not enter the pool. We left the work out area about twenty minutes after the official 11PM closing and still nothing had been done to clean up the vomit in the pool or on the deck. Through out this entire time there was nothing stopping guests from entering the contaminated pool except my son and I warning the guests of the contamination. I mentioned my concerns to the hotel manger when he called to apologize about the room issues. The lack of a process being in place for instances like this as well as the lack of urgency to clean and sanitize the pool immediately was disturbing, this prevented my family from entering the pool for our entire 3 night stay (the pool was a major reason we picked this hotel to stay in). The next day after this pool incident, I did look at the pool while visiting the workout area and it looked good but regrettably I had lost my confidence that it was really sanitary based on the initial response by staff to the unfortunate incident. The Hilton brand is better that than this one hotel. I suggest you pick another hotel to stay in while visiting Denver.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay,"Stayed here 2 nights while in town for a concert. The hotel’s common areas are very nice and appear recently renovated. Our room was large enough, renovated and had nice amenities. We upgraded to Club level which included access to the club lounge with a great breakfast spread. Location was also very handy for all of downtown Denver. Would certainly stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Disappointing,"Nothing like getting an attitude from the front desk as soon as I was checking in all because I asked where I could park my car.  Rooms were okay.  Clean and comfortable.  Breakfast in the executive lounge was okay for people who don’t mind finding out at 9 am that there is no more coffee, and food other than granola bars and some toast.  Best toast in Denver though.  Nice hotel at $75 per night, not so much at $230.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location in Denver,"The conference centre, food and service staff were great. The actual selling feature is the location to bars, restaurants and attractions all within walking distance. Facilities are at Hilton standards for the pool, workout facilities and restaurant.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great Location, Great Staff, Great Hotel :)","I travel a lot, mostly weekend excursions and Denver City Center was perfect for my travels to Red Rock Amphitheater (I took the CID shuttle in). Getting to the hotel was a breeze, taking the train in from DEN, then calling the Concierge Rich, and asking for a shuttle pickup. 15 minutes later, I was scooped up by a very friendly Sean and taken around the city back to the hotel. At the hotel, there was a huge group checking in, but I checked in through the app, got my digital key, and I was on my up to my room before the line died down. Very convenient, and a little strange to have zero interaction with the front desk. The restaurant downstairs was adorable, had a real ski chalet vibe. My room on the 19th floor was immaculate, and it was fun to access the executive lounge as a gold member. Most memorable was the Concierge, Rich Z, - he was incredibly knowledgeable, funny, helpful; he clearly knows the city and if you reach out to him before your visit, he's a human google -- restaurants, tours, transportation, sites, the hotel, he answered it all. Highly recommend this spot if you're in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Exemplary reasonable and thoughtful,"The hotel is what you can expect from Hilton a reasonable accommodation with exemplary service and staff.  This is the way a hotel should operate.  It was quiet, comfortable, well appointed, clean, affordable and attentive.  The location in convenient to public transport and the local shopping areas.  There’s plenty to do and see within walking distance and you’re close enough to main roads to get anywhere quickly. This is a city hotel the rooms are not large they are adequately sized and thoughtfully appointed.   There is not a lot of light on one side of the hotel.  The only unfortunate side to this hotel is the executive floor that apparently many guests find the lounge and raid it like a hoard of locust.  That’s not the hotel it’s the clientele whom while I was staying apparently had never seen granola bars water and a television. The WiFi is more than adequate as well as free— the elevator is fast and the lobby while under construction had a nice bar tea and coffee shop close by.   All in all fair price and good accommodations.  It’s not a resort but it’s a comfortable nice space.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver in July,Hotel room was as beautiful as the mountain views around it. Staff were amazing and the Starbucks in the hotel was a nice addition. Being in the heart of downtown made exploring the city convenient and easy to walk to shopping and tons of great restaurants.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Average Hotel,"The hotel rooms are a bit small and dark, not very impressed with this specific hotel, the pool is ok, wish there was a hot tub or somewhere to relax.  I like most Hilton Hotels but not this one!  Breakfast was good, great location.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Too brief but great,"I arrived late and left early but appreciated my stay a lot. Great check-in and check-out service. Renovations going on around the lobby but nicely apologetic signs that make customers appreciate the reason for the inconvenience. Many fast elevators with almost no waiting. Very modern room with excellent bathroom facilities. On the negative side, the view from the room is OK but not beautiful and the air conditioner's lowest non-off setting is a little too loud for my taste.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,DONT DO IT,"There was puke in elevator, took them almost an hour to check me in, completely disorganized. They don't clean the rooms - which was just a shock - even after I called. A few minutes late for checkout? They will charge you $40.  Don't ruin your stay in Denver - DON""T STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very nice,It’s a quality Hilton property with great amenities. Couldn’t give them the fifth star though. Renovations in lobby made checkin very clunky and far too slow. I’m sure it will deserve that last star when the reno is done.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Graduation!,"My husband and I stayed here for my college graduation (MASTERS @Colorado Technical University!! YES!!!!) and we really love the time at this hotel. The staff there was VERY nice and helpful in suggesting “hot spots” to shop, eat, and entertain at. The room (king size) was very nice, clean, and pleasant. The pricing was reasonable. We had a view of the mountains with a dusting of snow on the top of them; however, due to the construction going on a few blocks down, a crane somewhat constricted some of that. Also, with there being construction during our stay and the hustle and bustle of the workday and some of the nightlife traffic, the floor we were at (8th), had complimentary ear plugs- even though WE had no need for them. We slept like BABIES!!!  :-)    Nonetheless, we enjoyed and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the use of the free gym & pool.Only two MINOR down sides to our stay: slow shower drainage and PARKING! Shower: My husband likes to take long showers (as do I but I like hot showers); however, the shower drain is SLOOOOW and fills up pretty fast. This caused the water to almost overflow in the bathroom floor the first night we stayed and one of us having to wait for this water to finish draining down. We felt this may just be a minor thing so hubby felt there was no need for us to worry about it. Now, on to the NEXT --- PARKING: The cost of valet was $40 a day. Now, mind you, we were told if we want to self-park, it’ll be hourly or $20 daily BUT!! It was across the street and across the corner from the hotel PLUS if it’s not the coming and going per say if you used Valet parking without getting charge. And, trust me, that adds up daily if you want to leave for a ride around the city or whatever. Overall, the time here was GREAT!!And being that this hotel is in the heart of downtown Denver, you get everything in walking distance; from restaurants to vendors to the Bellco Conventional center to the street performers, especially around the 16th Street shopping area.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Outstanding Service!!!,"Kevin at the front desk was EXCELLENT. I do have diamond status and this was recognized. I will tell you that I cancelled my reservation at the Hyatt Regency to stay here and I am GLAD I DID. The service at Executive lounge was great. The room service was outstanding, anything you needed they took care of immediately. The General Manager at this hotel is doing something right to have such an Excellent staff...Congrats!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Superlative graduation experience,"Aspen University hosted graduation in the hotel. It was wonderful to have a comfy room right in the place where there were receptions, the graduation, etc. The staff for breakfast were fabulous, as I was still on the Eastern time zone and they kept the coffee coming to keep me happy (no coffee in the room but there is a Starbucks on site). The avocado toast was so good that I ordered it every morning! Cupcakes at the reception were amazing. Overall, great staff and wonderful experience.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Both good and bad,"Good-Price. Was very affordable off of Priceline -most of staff was very nice and amazing. Concierge went by as we were checking in and gave my daughter a popcicle-room was very nice and quiet-was great location for us (restaurants we wanted to eat at and downtown church)-room was clean other than pillow casesBad-parking!!!! valet is 46/night. If you park it yourself, it is not $6 like they claim. It was almost $30 and hard to find spots unless on 6th floor and is a block away- used their Netflix deal on their tv and then got an email from Netflix that said our account was compromised so spent an hour getting that resolved. Could be a coincidence but seems a little fishy that it happened while we were staying there. -stayed while the president of Taiwan was staying there. Shut down some elevators just for her. Was a busy night to boot so just added to issues of wait time. -dirty pillow cases when we checked inI want to rate this higher because I would absolutely stay here again and outside the parking, the issues were small and weird. I do want to reiterate the staff was very very friendly and helpful.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Decent stay,"I must say that we were spoiled by another Recent Hilton stay. This stay did not give us the over the top service or value that we recently experienced in another city. The location is nice and the rooms were clean and attractive. We reported a broken bathroom door which was never addressed. After checking out and reviewing my bill, I discovered a mistaken valet charge. When I called they actually argued with me.   I never had a car, but they insisted that I did.  Although I was eventually told that it would be corrected, over 24 hours later, this still has not been rectified.   Decent stay, but review your bill closely.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Birthday weekend,"Went to Denver for the weekend to celebrate!! We had a great view, the rooms were extra clean and the hotel was overall very nice. Wasn’t a huge fan of the valet parking. You can park else where but you still had to pay. But, will be staying here again!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Unaccommodating,Fails to accommodate guests with special needs.   I have severe food allergies and requested a microwave to be in my room so I can prepare my meals as I cannot eat at restaurants.  I have stayed in hotels all across the U.S. and this is the first Hotel to refuse to address my medical/dietary needs.,2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location!,"The Hilton Denver City Center is tragically located within walking distance of the 16th Street Mall, Civic Center, Performing Arts Center, Coors Field and a host of amazing restaurants.  The amount of conference traffic at this particular property was high, but seemed to be handled well.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver Long Weekend,My husband and I traveled to Denver for a long weekend.  The downtown location was perfect with lots of things to do withing walking distance. The hotel was clean and well kept. The concierge was great!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location,"Hotel is in a great location. A couple of blocks from 16th street and within walking distance (roughly 1 mile) from Coors Field and Union Station. The only issue we had was street noise, but that's to be expected in downtown.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay and GREAT Customer Service,"We recently stayed at this hotel for 7 nights.  I had 2 adjoining rooms as we are a family of 6.  This hotel was SOLD OUT!!  There was the World Series of Youth Lacrosse in Denver & that's why we were there.  This hotel handled it ALL!Rich in concierge was AMAZING!!  He helped w/ shuttles, dinners, things to do, etc.  He even tied my oldest son's tie as we were running late and trying to run out the door!  They opened the breakfast buffet at 5:45 am instead of 6:30 to accommodate all the kids to ensure they got fed before their LONG days started on the field!This hotel is where the opening ceremony was with 1200plus people and it was organized and orderly!The front desk gives you water to ensure hydration.  There is a pool and restaurant that was very good downstairs with a bar. They accommodated some of the boys with ice cream even though serving hours were over.   It's close to everything and you can easily get an UBER or Byrd!This hotel truly above and beyond all of my expectations!!!  Great staff!  Thor at valet was great as well!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel,"We stayed here for my Graduation from Aspen university. We had booked a room on Hotels.com but the reservation was never confirmed. Hilton gave us a better room at the price I had with Hotels.com. Everyone was so nice and friendly and willing to help, the concierge even helped navigate the map of all the places nearby. They brought us a fan (can’t sleep without one) and extra pillows (I had to elevate my ankle). It’s very close to 16th street so cars aren’t needed. We did use valet the first night, but they even told us about the $6 a day parking so we’d have an option! The rooms were clean, very little noise. We found other places to eat opposed to a $20 burger, but hey it’s downtown so prices are what they are! We had a great time",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient and comfortable ,This hotel is conveniently located within the conference center. It’s also within easy walking distance to great dining and attractions. My room was comfortable within typical amenities. The hotel itself has a comfortable lobby and lounge area. The staff was friendly and helpful as well. I would stay again upon a future trip to Denver.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Disappointing service,"Many problems with service on this stay.  Perhaps this was due to the 4th of July holiday, and the hotel being full of families at a sports tournament, but definitely not the service we would expect from Hilton.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,sleep well,Great job all the way around. When possible I will use this hotel again. It is close to the city center or the 16th street mall. Everything you would need for your trip is at the hotel or within walking distance.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, service, and easy to get to","Perfect choice for us.  Plenty of places to walk to for all kinds of meals.  Easy to get to:  take the train from the airport, exit at Union Station, then take the 16th St Mall Shuttle to get to California St.  Walk 1.5 blocks.  Hotel service was great - love being able to text to the staff.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Clean hotel in Denver Center,"Good value for the area.Close to several venues. Able to walk to Coors stadium. The beds were just not that comfortable for us.  But overall good, clean.  I used the valet service as part of the room package,  I think that was a good value.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,World Series of Lacrosse - Team Hotel,Great food! Great  accommodations. Speak with concierge for all your needs around Denver to include great restaurants and reservations.  Really enjoyed the restaurant at the hotel for cocktails appetizers breakfast and dinner.  UPS store on site very helpful for receiving and shipping.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel! So convenient to everything! ,"We stayed at this hotel over Fourth of July, attended baseball games, parties, and visited many restaurants and bars downtown…This hotel is very comfortable, well appointed, and the service was terrific!  You don’t need a car here, there are plenty of options including the local train, Uber, and Lyft If you have your car, don’t let the crazy cost of parking stop you from staying here. There are more than a dozen options within 3 blocks - The lowest price per day during our stay was $16 - and if you reserve at these garages using the app from SpotHero, many will allow in and out privileges for a longer than 24 hour stay! The service at this hotel was impeccable. The room was incredibly clean - and we would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A stop to visit friends.,This Hotel was just what we needed just 5 miles from my friends house and in the center of the city. It had a large starbucks. as well as some nice restaurants. The bed was comfortable and it was wonderful to see my old friends.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Weekend Trip,A friend and myself stayed at this hotel for 2 nights one weekend to catch the Rockies game and go to Pride. The hotel isn't too far from the stadium. We actually walked to it and it was about 15-20 minutes or so. The location made it easy to walk to local restaurants and shopping. Valet was quick and easy to use and the bar had a nice selection of drinks (definitely try the Sparkling Blueberry Basil Lemonade). The executive lounge had a nice selection of snacks and drinks and offered discounted alcoholic beverages as well. Overall this hotel was a great place to stay and we look forward to coming back for another trip to Denver!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great service, personnel, and location. Be aware that parking is an extra fee.",Personnel and service was outstanding. Ty Hilton did everything to make our stay comfortable. Since the location is downtown there is very little parking so the garage is $50 a night to park your car. The valet concierge and housekeeping personnel are very responsive to any requests. The beds are so comfortable and everything was very clean. Would definitely stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent location.  Excellent property.,"The property is located within walking distance of 16th street Mall,  Coors Field and several nice restaurants.  Rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable.  There is Starbucks on site and a nice bar with good food selections.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing staff!,"Jessica A was amazing!!  As soon as I walked in the front, she helped me Check into my room really quick and offered recommendations of where to eat and other places to go. The other staff was amazing as well and I would definitely come back to this hotel. It is located right downtown within walking distance to pretty much anything and a lot of really nice upscale bars and restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Best hotel in Denver,Amazing hotel! Best service and friendliness! They even sent me a text to make sure everything was golden! Signed up for Hilton Honors because of the wonderful staff! I would recommend the Denver Hilton to anyone and will be staying here again!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Quality stay at Hilton Denver City Center,"This hilton is all about location and quality.  Enjoyed our stay to see a Rockies game.  Budget additional time for check and be warned that valet is pricey and very slow.  Location provides easy walk to Coors Field, the convention center (you have to see the big blue bear), and 16th street mall.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Second Time is the Charm,"We visited this hotel last year and while the staff was very nice there were some issues with the housekeeping. Lynzy graciously arranged for us to return with the promise of making thing right! Well this hotel exceeded all of our expectations. First the upgraded room was magnificent. It was really a suite with a separate living area and kitchenette. Second, the Concierge, Rich, was perhaps the best concierge we have had the pleasure to meet in over 40 years of traveling. Friendly, passionate and extremely knowledgeable about everything Denver. From restaurants to watering holes, from entertainment to sports, Rich seems to know it all and his recommendations were all spot on. He was willing to spend the time with us and followed up with emails complete with live links to the places he told us about. Third, the location is perfect. Just a 2 block walk to the 16th Street Mall where you can catch the free bus up to Union Station. Actually everything in the downtown area is in walking distance. Finally, every hotel needs a bartender like Frank. Yet another knowledgeable, friendly member of the Hilton team at this hotel. Absolutely would recommend without reservation.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Experience,"My husband and I recently vacationed in Denver. We chose to stay at the Hilton Denver City Center and were so pleased with our experience. The hotel is lovely, and the rooms very pleasant, certainly up to Hilton standards. The staff was amazing, especially the concierge Richard Zaccagna.  He arranged our pick up and return to the airport, made other transportation arrangements for us, and set up a city tour. He also made restaurant and site seeing recommendations for us. Another staff member that made us feel very welcome was Liz, the desk clerk. She even checked back with us after our arrival to be sure everything was all right. The hotel proved to be a great location. We could walk easily to the 16th Street Mall and use the free buses to get to numerous locations, including Larimer Square, Union Station, and the ballpark. The other passengers were friendly and helpful. We had no issues with homeless individuals or panhandlers as has been mentioned in other reviews. We stayed on the Executive floor, which was ideal. Every morning we enjoyed a big, hot breakfast and lots of extraordinary fresh fruit. We even made it back to the hotel a couple of evenings for the free appetizers and moderately priced wine or beer. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wedding anniversary stay,Extremely nice! Very elegant modern hotel and friendly accommodating staff.   Superb cuisine at the prospect's urban restaurant.  We will definitely stay here in the future or utilize other Hilton hotel locations when we travel.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Delightful stay!,"This full service Hilton is a delight!  The accommodations are very nice and modern, the service was outstanding, and you can’t beat the location....about a block from the downtown mall, right on the light rail, walking distance to Union Station and the capital. Ideal for fun or business. Highly recommend this sleek hotel!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver in June,The front desk staff was Super. Made check-in fast.  Thank you.  Very nice place to stay.  Everything about this hotel was good. Thanks for making my stay relaxing.  Rooms were very clean. Everyone who worked at the Hotel had a Positive Attitude.  That was great.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Better Lost and Found Service Required,"Service during the trip was good. However, after checking out and realizing I had left belongings in the room the staff was not very helpful at all and has not responded to my lost belongings reports or phone calls.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Staff is wonderful,The staff was very attentive and helpful the entire stay.  Meeting rooms were were great and the food for breakfasts and lunch were great to.  The staff in the hotel restaurant were very friendly even when we stopped by and ran tea for 2 hours.  They never made us feel unwelcome and always stopped by to refill our glasses.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Terrific Hotel - Clean, Modern, Friendly Staff, Recently Remodeled","From checkin to checkout and everything in between, it was a 5 Star Experience. Rich, the concierge, was outstanding.  Great knowledge and insight, and asked US what was important to US before making recommendations.  Thanks Rich.  Staff was great on checking in and out.  Room seemed brand new, super clean, light and bright, modern USB plugs, great bathroom.  Terrific location.  Look forward to staying here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,So so experience,"The location is fantastic. sheets were not changed daily unless requested, but it still looked gross aftee you requested. Continent breakfast ended earlier than scheduled time because they ran out of food and wont cook more. It happened three days out of four days we stayed there. You should know how many hilton members come enjoy your continenr breakfast, you should be prepared. Your staff were rude and pushed people away in the morning for breakfast!",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"Very close to everything, so walking was easy. Ben made things a breeze at checkin. The beds are great and the hotel is very clean. Only reason sleep quality got a 4 is because someone was vacuuming very early and screeching furniture above us. However we were offered breakfast for our inconvenience although we were unable to take up the offer.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good hotel in downtown Denver,"I was here for a business trip in May, 2019.  My room had a small refrigerator and a nice in-room safe in a drawer.  The TV and Wifi worked well, and the lighting was good.  The fitness center was nice and clean and had a decent number of bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, and machines (as well as free weights).  The only downsides were the bathroom showerhead was a ""rainforest"" type with barely adequate water pressure.  Also, the heating/cooling controls were not the most responsive.Overall, a good hotel near plenty of restaurants.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, lovely room","I was in Denver for five days with my wife during the Memorial Day weekend. The location of the hotel is perfect: quiet, yet close to many of the city attractions. Upon our arrival, as gold Hilton Honors members we were offered an upgrade to a corner unit, which was a very nice touch. It felt great to be welcomed with such a great hospitality. The room was spacious, comfortable and quiet. The hotel features a nicely equipped gym and a heated indoor pool. Unfortunately, there is no hot tub, which would have been a great addition to an already terrific propriety.As Hilton Honor gold members, we had access to the business lounge where free food is served every day from 5pm to 7pm, in addition to wine and beer for a small fee ($5 per serving). Also, for gold member, breakfast is included in the business lounge. The options for breakfast are extensive, going from hot breakfast (sausages, bacon, eggs, etc.) to mini pastries, toastm, fruit and yogurt. Often, however, the lounge was crowded in the morning and it wasn't unlikely that coffee was out. They should make an effort to promptly refill the thermos.Valet parking is available but it is pricey ($45/day). It is however easy to find a spot a couple of blocks from the hotel for $15-22 via SpotHero.All in all, it was a great stay and I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Denver.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hotel staff were extremely helpful and courteous.,I have been to this hotel few times and at all times the hotel staff were just amazing! Nothing was too much trouble and every time I needed anything they were available to attend to my needs. I have high expectations and they met all of them!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great value. ,"1. Appearance/Appeal: This is a very nice hotel right in the heart of downtown. It puts you within walking distance of most everything. The lobby area appears to have been remodeled and is very nice. There’s a Starbucks in the hotel as well. The downstairs bar in the lower lobby has plenty of TVs and the bartenders are really nice. Overall, the hotel does look a little dated, but it is a great value.2. Beds: Absolutely no issues with the bed. Very comfortable and the linens were very clean and crisp. The pillows were typical Hilton excellence. I slept very well despite the altitude.3. Coffee: The coffee maker worked just fine. The only issue was finding an outlet to plug the coffee maker into. Could have been just an issue with this particular room (1438). For some reason there were very few outlets and I actually had to use the outlet on the nightstand, which meant I had to set the coffee maker tray on the nightstand which was very small. It was kind of a pain in the butt. Coffee maker, which was duel Mr. coffee with the pod inserts, worked great though.  4. Location: Perfect location in the heart of downtown.5. People: The staff was very friendly. We needed a recommendation for breakfast and one of the concierge‘s mentioned Sam’s #3, which was on Diners Drive-ins and Dives. It was a great place to have breakfast. 6. Restaurant/Bar: see above. I did not eat in the restaurant. There is an excellent steakhouse across the street called Guard and Grace, which was amazing. 7. Water/Shower: My bathroom was ADA accessible, which was fine. The shower worked great but water did splash out into the floor, witch is due to the way the shower is configured for accessibility. The bathroom was clean and tidy though. No issues. 8. WiFi: Internet worked perfect. 9. Misc: The workout facility is very nice in this hotel. I used it one day that I was there. Lots of treadmills, ellipticals, and free weights.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Reliable comfort,The Denver City Center is centrally located in downtown Denver which makes it very convenient to find quality restaurants within walking distance. The staff was extremely helpful and the usual Hilton comfort made the stay very comfortable. The only drawback was inconsistent time for making up the room. Varied from morning to late afternoon.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good Big City Hotel,"It’s just what you’d want in a big city chain hotel.  Efficient and surprisingly personable check-in, clean rooms with all of the amenities you’d expect and an equally efficient check-out.  Good fitness room.  The pool area didn’t look beautiful but it was of decent size and what would you expect from a downtown Denver hotel when it’s snowing outside? (Yes, they had snow in May.) A corporation was having some kind of convention and the attendees all seemed well-treated and having a good time. Due to Hilton status had access to the breakfast in the executive lounge and found it good. I was thinking of knocking a circle off for the $49 valet-only parking charge, but that’s rather unfair as that’s a common in a large city downtown and you might not be needing parking anyway.  The 3rd-party lot caddy-corner from the hotel charges $26 per night (no in/out).Overall if the price is fair I’d stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Pleasant stay,"The hotel and lobby were very nice, the room was spacious and comfortable, and the bathroom was very nice. The staff were also friendly and helpful. Location was excellent, very close to the Colorado Convention Center and 16th St. Mall, and lots of restaurants.The only issues I had were:-elevators were very slow. I think one or two weren't working.-my hair dryer didn't work and I called for a new one which didn't arrive for about 25 minutes- it wouldn't be a big deal if I was on vacation, but I had a meeting to get toOverall, I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Handicapped ? Don’t stay here,"Im on Crutches , my wife is a Hilton Diamond member , we received no assistance with our bags , we struggled to check in , then via security desk to our room , nobody cared , my wife had to deal with all the cases by herself .Not what we have enjoyed during our USA trip , Denver doesn’t do Disability , don’t stay here .",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not off to a good start,"Technically I haven’t started my trip yet, but so far it’s not off to a good start.  Tried to call hotel about access to hot tub and pool.  Was sent through to a call center where the person on the other ends phone etiquette was horrible and was a crackling line.  Seems I cannot speak to anyone who works at hotel about early check in and If in fact we have access to hot tub as it’s one of the reasons I booked.  Was hung up on by call center twice.  Asked to join honors of which I am a member...  So far I’m regretting this.  Hopefully it gets better on check in.  Hopefully my question gets answered.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Compact Room,"Stayed in Denver in May of this year.  Even though it was cold outside, we had a hard time getting our room cold, even with the air set around 60.  We could hear the unit running, but seemed to only want to put out warm air.  Finally turned it off and opened the window, which worked better.  Otherwise, no complaints with this hotel other than I wish it had HBO.  It's a pretty quick walk to the bars and restaurants on 16th and there is a Target nearby which is nice.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Luxury Dormitory ,"No sound proofing at all (ps hilton provided ear plugs in the room no winder), when next doors slams the door my walls shaked, very friendly helpful efficient staff, restaurant is not good i m afraid, good locationOverall - i wouldnt stay there again",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Successful Hospitality,This hotel made my trip extremely wonderful.  I have a handicapping conditon and a wheelcahir was made available to me my entire trip.  The staff was very generous in helping me about the premises.  I love this hotel!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Decent hotel - terrible restaurant,"Stayed for a work conference which was well run and the rooms were decent, but nothing special. The big disappointment was the bartenders each night - there were a LOT of people with the conference enjoying late night drinks every night together. Bartenders were overwhelmed and quick to close down at night, downright rude when they were asking people to leave. It's a shame because they could have done some good business had they catered to their clients a bit better. Breakfast was also lackluster - don't order the avocado toast. I had it for room service and couldn't eat it, another colleague ordered in the restaurant and sent it back. How do you ruin such a nice simple breakfast? Cover it in tart lemon dressing so you can't taste anything but lemon. There are better options in Denver for hotels..",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Pleasant visit,We recently stayed at the Hilton Denver City Center and couldn't have been happier. We arrived at about 5am and wanted to check our bag for the day but they had a room ready for us to check in early. Darryl at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. He had us checked in and on our way to our room in just minutes. The only thing we weren't told was that in order for the elevator to move you have to swipe your key. But signs were posted in the elevator. The room was spacious and the beds and pillows were so soft and comfortable. We had asked Zayoob for directions to our rental car and he told us about the free car service they offer within 2 miles of the hotel. He was very friendly and gave us many suggestions on things to see and do. Overall every employee we encountered was very friendly and always had a smile on. We look forward to returning for another visit.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,EXCEPTIONAL resolution to my issue,"I posted a complaint about my stay this property on January 13, 2019, and am following up to report that I have now communicated with management to address the issue. This post details my service experience with hotel managers Courtney Shafer and Matthew Anderson. When I called, I reached Courtney first. This complaint isn't even her purview, but she listened carefully and apologized for my experience. She also took it upon herself to get me to the right person and even followed up with an update e-mail. Courtney, thank you for your professionalism! She connected me with the hotel manager Matthew, who called me within an hour of being informed of my issue. Wow! Matthew, I also want to thank you for your attention to my experience, and for your proactive and generous resolution. (Matthew refunded the points I used in my upgrade, and issued a few more for my inconvenience.) I am grateful for the points, of course, but believe it or not, I still consider myself an 'old school' traveler, and I was just hoping to catch a manager's ear, and perhaps be the beneficiary of high-level customer service in the form of empathy and professionalism. Matt, you and Courtney exceeded each of my expectations in this regard. You two are exemplars for Hilton, and are solely responsible for my decision to stay at the Hilton City Center the next time I am in Denver. Sincere thanks to both of you.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Lack Luster,"The location of this hotel is great for business purposes and conferences and several good restaurants are within a quart mile radius.  The staff was warm, friendly and courteous but the accommodations were very disappointing for this high end chain.  The room we were assigned, however, left much to be desired.  A modern barn door was mounted to the bathroom entrance and was visually appealing but had a three inch gap which meant no privacy or sound abatement!  There were no robes or slippers provided but they were provided upon my request.  The robe had such a strong stench of bleach, I could not use it!  The room had a chaise lounge but it needed to be deodorized!  Yuck!  I bought Lysol to handle the issue!",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Stay,I had a great experience. All the staff were friendly. The hotel was very nice. I enjoyed the bar. The conference area was also very nice. The food the hotel served for the conference was good. My room was awesome and very clean. The bathroom was also clean and the shower was great.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton Denver,This hotel is right in the middle of the city and everything is within walking distance. Valet staff gives you a number to text so that your car is ready when you need it. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Kevin at the front desk/concierge was great. I will definitely stay at this hotel again if I make my way back to Denver,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hilton hotel centrally located with executive lounge,"Located in Denver's city center, it's steps away from tons of eating and entertainment options, definitely check out the executive lounge if you're a diamond member or get an executive level room as it provides a pretty decent breakfast and horderves in the afternoon. As a diamond member I was bumped up from an regular king to premium king, which differed in a slightly larger living room space, TV, and raised platform for the bed (which while looked cool, was actually a bit annoying).Our room's view sucked as we faced another high-rise, but the one from the executive lounge was nice and unobstructed for the most part. The TV was on the fritz and the bathroom fan did not appear to be working well early on - they sent over a technician who fixed the TV but didn't appear to fix the fan...oh well. Pro-tip (if applicable): save money by grabbing waters from the exec lounge.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wow!,"Great place to stay for a great price. Was impressed with the hotel access to public transportation. No need for a car if you are staying in the city. Room was clean, well appointed and comfortable. Coffee maker in the room and Starbucks in the lobby. We felt safe as you could not get the elevator to move without swiping your key card.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hotel!,"I am a loyal Hilton Honors member so was delighted there was a Hilton near the conference I was attending. Hotel is beautiful, staff very friendly, and all the benefits that come with Honors. I chose my room on line, and they changed it to a room with a view of the park. The executive lounge was a great quick way to grab breakfast. Rooms are clean and beds are very comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good location,The location of the hotel was good. Short walk to other hotels and food places. The rooms were spacious and clean. The TVs were fast and Netflix enabled. There could be some outside noise on lower floors but it was not bad at higher floors.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great choice in downtown Denver,"Just stayed for 3 nights at the Hilton Denver City center - great experience overall.The hotel is centrally located with many places to visit within a short walking distance. The Colorado convention center is a only a few blocks away, and you can walk there within 10 minutes. Hotel staff are very helpful, friendly and courteous. Check in process was a breeze.The rooms are spacious, clean, have very comfortable beds and pillows, have a nice big screen TV (though I did not get a chance to turn mine on at all), a small fridge, and a coffee maker, and a nice work desk. The bathroom in my room had a nice walk in shower, very clean/fresh towels, and Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries.The hotel has a restaurant and bar as well as a Starbucks located close by.Breakfast is not included with the room rate and is on the more expensive side IMO. ($21 for the buffet). Parking is extra (not sure of the rate since I didnt get a rental car), but WiFi is free and worked well throughout my stay.Overall a great choice in downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Place,This was a nice hotel. Our bed was very hard but it was clean. We arrived early but the front desk was able to get us in a room without having to wait at all!!  Our room was very nice and updated. There is a very nice pool and fitness room. No hot tub.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice and clean... corner room is a nice size ,"Stayed for business, the room was a Corner room over looking the side main road. View was not that fantastic. Hotel in an easy location to get to the town centre. Starbucks inside the hotel. Good for my business stay.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,AMAZING!!!!,One night stay for a quick biz trip on a friday.  Was upgraded (as a HH Diamond) to quite possibly the best room I have ever stayed in at Hilton Hotel.  Lindsay - you are awesome! Executive Lounge is well stocked and food was great!  Location in downtown Denver is super convenient.Will defo stay here again!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great, renovated property. Ease expectations. ","I never write reviews, but am inclined to this time. I read some here before booking and all seemed very petty and negative about facility and staff almost making me look elsewhere but it was a good deal for one night business so I went with it. Hotel was beautifully renovated and staff were excellent and more than willing to help. (Especially the concierge). Perhaps people’s expectations are wildly high in the Hilton name, I guess I would caution people not to expect Four Seasons service at 1/5 the cost. This is an excellent hotel, location and you should stay here if you’re on the fence.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel in city centre location,Great comfortable hotel in city centre Denver. Walking distance to 16th Street Mall wit h shops and restaurants. Breakfast was plentiful and very good. Can only recommend. Friendly staff at check in and free shuttle bus to Union Station was a bonus too.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Lovely, comfortable setting for a business trip","I had an excellent experience at this hotel-loved that the staff did an excellent job of recognizing my diamond status, loved my newly remodeled room on the 18th floor, super comfy bed, great breakfast and snacks at the lounge, but most importantly, found one employee, Elizabeth West from the front desk, incredibly helpful at delivering 5 star hospitality. She printed a document for me and was outmostly kind and even wished me good luck in my presentation the next day. Kind, humble, and professional-wish staff at all hotels were like her! Top notch place and would absolutely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Don’t Leave Valuables in the Room,"Left my iPad in the room, only to have it disappear, and Housekeeping says they didn’t see it.  The security team wouldn’t take the information directly, making me go through a 3rd party website.  3 days later, I have no indication that I will get my iPad back or even hear anything back from the hotel.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Attentive and caring concierge, great service.",Im staying for 4 days and the service has been phenomenal. The concierge was so polite and witty. I really like it here. The room was super clean and I can tell everything was washed and prepared for my stay.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Don’t waste your money on Executive floor access!,"I am Gold Hilton so have experience with hotels. In Denver on vacation and so kids could experience the city stayed here. Upgraded with charge to Executive Suite. Nice room. Pull out couch didn’t have sheets so asked housekeeping that was just down the hall and they said they would give us some on our way back to room. Came back and they did it for us. Super nice! Went to Executive Lounge about 6:45pm (appetizers and discounted drinks 5:30-7:30) and they were out of chips and crackers. Had to ask for more. Not much left! Went to breakfast in am and it was worse!!! I would have rather paid to get a nice waitress and actually had food to eat! Opened at 6:30 and by 8 most all was gone. Very few people in room. No muffins, danishes or croissants and when I asked her was told they have no more at this time. Eggs gone and replaced while we were almost done as were the danishes. 2 coffee pots not labeled and no cream anywhere. A guy came in and asked if one was decaf which I didn’t know. He said he didn’t want to ask attendant in fear of “getting his head ripped off”.   I was like this is ridiculous! I asked and she muffled under her breath no decaf and cream is in refrigerator. RIDICULOUS!!!!!! So rude! Next time we will get a regular room and go out for breakfast! I rate Executive Lounge is a half star at best!",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Night Stay,"This hotel is fantastic! The location is great, very close to the 16th street mall and other walk-able attractions.  The check in staff were most helpful and the lobby is beautiful.  We had a King room reserved and upon arrival were told that a king corner room was available for a small fee.  I am so glad we upgraded, the corner room had so much space and was a stunning room. Very clean as well. We had an early flight out the next morning and when we came down to the lobby we saw security officers checking room keys, i thought that was wonderful! Would definitely recommend",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Perfect location,"Staff was super friendly when we arrived, and we had a quick and easy check-in. Our room was clean and were excited we had an empty frig to use. The location was convenient and close to everything: bars, restaurants, transportation, shopping, etc.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beautiful rooms!,"Excellent place to stay! The hotel is super close to 16th street Mall and walking distance to the Convention Center. (2 blocks) They have the nicest workout facility I have ever seen in a hotel! It is full of lots of cardio equipment from treadmills, to elliptical and bikes.  Also lots of weight machines and free weights. Even an area to do stretching or core work with weighted balls. Nice clean towels, cold water and fresh fruit are provided as well. In addition, to the locker rooms with showers. The indoor pool is nice, although a hot tub would be really nice to have as well! The rooms are super luxurious and the beds are so comfortable. ",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,HILTON DENVER,"Pros: The location is good, in central Denver, within reasonable walking distance of central; attractions. Rooms are comfortable but small. Cons: Unappealing restaurant, high bar prices, and poor amenities.  Parking is valet only, at $49/night.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,All good except...,"No bathroom privacy because the “door” was a sliding barn-style door with opaque glass allowing others to see shadows, and there was a gap between the door and the wall even when the door was in closed position which also allowed for others to get a peek inside... Also the restaurant was always understaffed and we had to wait a long time for food/drinks and once we got them had to ask for refills... Oh and had to beg for the check. Other than that the hotel is great!  ",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton Denver City Center,Stayed at the Hilton Denver City Center while attending a conference for work.  The staff and service were excellent.  The staff was also very friendly and always willing to help.  The rooms were clean and the internet was fast.  Overall a great stay.  Definitely would recommend.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Fantastic!!,"We stayed here in March 2019 for a volleyball tournament, we checked in late on a Friday evening and the agent made every effort to ensure we had everything we wanted and needed. The room was spotless, beds were very comfortable.  We had dinner in the restaurant one night and the food was excellent.  Excellent service and a beautiful hotel! We will be back!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,great to explore downtown,"our flight arrived in denver at 6:45am so by the time we made it downtown, it was around 9am - obviously still super early to check in for the night's stay. we went in to ask if they could hold our bags while we explored but were surprised when tori said there was a room available and we could check in. the process went swiftly. our room had a nice view of downtown and there weren't any problems with toiletries or wifi not working. we were able to walk to most of our destinations for the weekend. since our flight left late sunday night, we were able to leave our bags with the hotel until we headed to the airport. definitely a wonderful stay and will be rebooking next time we're in denver!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great service,We flew in with a group of over 30 people for a conference. Reservations for the 9 rooms were a little mixed up coming in but the management was incredible helpful through the entire process! Tori and Jessica where extremely attentive and helpful getting us all checked in. Incredibly happy with the entire experience at Hilton so far!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Pleasant Experience ,"This was my first time coming to Denver, CO I had a pleasant stay here at the Hilton and everyone was very knowledgeable and helpful. Great customer service! And I loved the hotel and my favorite part was that Starbucks is in the lobby so I was able to take advantage of that in the mornings.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,3 star at best,"Phone in the room didn't work.  They don't answer the phone if I call them on my cell phone the lobby.  Says press 3 for operator, press 3 nothing happens get the same voice mail.  Shoddy construction like  a motel 6.  Park a block away and schlep bags.  No Directory in room to say what floor the pool is on.  Do not recommend.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"A grand time at the Denver Hilton,",The wait staff were excellent and extremely attentive to our needs.The breakfast buffet was perfect and the service was kind and very prompt.   The front desk staff were also very helpful at check in even though it was after 11 o’clock at night.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location ,Loved the location of the hotel. It is walking distance to so many shops and restaurants. Our room was nice sized and the bed was comfortable. We struggled regulating the temperature in our room especially at night. It wouldn’t stay cool. So we tried sleeping with the window open and that didn’t work great either as we are downtown with the bus stop outside. Front desk staff were pleasant. When leaving we had to wait almost an hour for our car to come from the valet partially due to an accident in front of the hotel. Although in talking with others they had problems getting their cars out of valet quickly even before the accident.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Fantastic location by 16th Street, knowledgeable of the area!","Went for my birthday weekend, received wonderful nightlife recommendations and came back to a bottle of wine to celebrate (which was an unexpected surprise!) Clean, friendly, great location. They definitely earned 5 stars!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Comfortable city center hotel,We stayed two separate nights in the same week. Check in and departure were handled very well. The rooms were comfortable with bedding conducive to a good night’s sleep. Our second room on the 11 th floor was significantly noisier during the night. I used the modestly sized fitness centre and pool early in the morning alongside a handful of other users and it was a positive experience.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business trip Hilton Denver CC,I had a lovely time at your hotel.  The restaurant was wonderful. The bar downstairs was clean and staff was personable and my room was very nice. I will definitely come back to this location. My coworkers were also very impressed with the hotel.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Alright value for money,Rooms are equipped with comfortable beds and the window can be opened.The rooms are rather dark and the dark carpet and furniture does not do much to make them lighter.This hotel often hosts conventions so be prepared for quite a lot of noise at all hours.It is very centrally located within short walking distance from the 16th Street shops and restaurants.Overall good value for money.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver's Best Concierge,"My wife and I travel to Denver several times a year and over the past two years have made this hotel our base. It has everything we look for in a top hotel. Its location in the heart of Denver is convenient and the hotel is in easy walking distance of a multitude of very good restaurants and tons of shopping. It is one block from the 16th St. mall and the free bus that makes going down to LoDo and the Union Station area a breeze.We always stay on the Executive floors (17 & 18) to get access to its great lounge which has a delicious breakfast spread and nightly hors d'ouevres. The room are not huge but comfy, but have all the amenities one needs. The restaurant on the lower lobby level, Prospect's, is a hidden gem and serves great food and drinks.The hotel concierge, Rich Z., is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet!! He knows everything about Denver and goes over and above to make sure guests are well taken care of. Just a great place to stay and we will return often.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,So last century,"Enough electrical plugs for a phone and one computer near bed.  Two USB that don’t work with new Apple products.  Nothing available on desk.  Handicapped room and had to crawl under desk to plug in lap top and THIER LAMP!  If you want coffee in the morning, plan to carry tray to bathroom to locate plug in.  One cup for two people.  (& this is their “rewards” program). Nice but ineffectual people (placate training, don’t address the problem).  “Old hotel, refurbished” was the tone — refurbished for 1980 — which is a waste.  Also, expensive parking and can’t access stairs from lobby (e.g., take an elevator to floor 2 if you want easy stair-climbing exercise).  No hot tub or sauna; very basic, minimal fitness area.  Won’t be back.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,We loved it,"While it took a lot of our group a while to get their rooms, we got ours pretty fast. It was a good location, nice bar/restaraunt, and clean rooms.  My only complaint would be the valet parking is ridiculous price wise....that loses them one star.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Dance Comp with my Girls,"We had a wonderful time hanging out at the hotel and around the area. We were in town for my daughters dance comp and my other daughters and I had a wonderful time in the gym, pool, and relaxing in our room.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Cozy Hideaway,This is a very beautiful and clean hotel.  It has all the amenities you could look for in a hotel when traveling for a few days.  The lobby lounging area is very cozy with a fireplace.  Having inside access to your own restaurants was nice.  Also Starbucks right inside. The host were fantastic as to how they dealt with guest.  Very polite and professional,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Pleasant Business Trip,It was a brief stay but for a business trip. I enjoyed the stay. The sirens of Downtown Denver SUCKED! ALTHOUGH COMPLIMENTARY EAR PLUGS ROCKED They were given in the room with the team understanding that yes we do have loud sirens please accept our apologies in advance with these complimentary ear plugs. LOL! The true factor was that I enjoyed my stay with out complications.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Staff and Service could use improvement,"The staff was not very friendly. Any time I asked a question answers were short and curt as if they did not want to be bothered. Housekeeping service was not efficient. First day room was not cleaned until after 4:00 PM. The next day I was gone all day got back after 5:00 PM and room again was not cleaned. Called the front desk and they said they would send someone right up. I said I needed a 1/2 hour as I needed to get ready for an event. He then said ""well housekeeping leaves at 6:00"". I had been out of the room for 10 hours. They had plenty of time to clean it earlier.There are plenty of hotel options in Denver. I would not stay at this one again.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful Experience ,"Everyone away the Hilton was so helpful and friendly. The entire staff helped make our conference run smooth. I have not received a single bad review from anyone of our attendees! The rooms were clean and the entire building was welcoming. My biggest complaint is my room never got as cool as I would have liked, butter would have been comfortable for most others.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay!,"We stayed here for our daughters volleyball tournament at the convention center. I loved how the hotel was in walking distance. The rooms were nice, clean, comfortable and quiet. My only wish is that the pull out bed was bigger than a twin size.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Snowed in but happy,Super efficient business hotel.  Great location.  Nice remodel.  Efficient check in and check out.  Good internet. Everything you would expect from a business hotel.  Everything just works like it is supposed to...,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Just AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all all the rooms were great and clean and remodeled, lobby very cozy and service oh let me tell you it’s the best hotel crew I have ever seen, how about this Mr Rich Zaccagna (concierge) remembered me from the prior year when I visited the hotel and went all out to see if I needed anything and Darryl James also remembered me and welcomed me like I was family these guys will treat you like you are family and it felt great, love this hotel and if I ever go back to Denver you bet on it that I will stay here again, loved all these guys and the gentleman who checked us in was super professional and made our check-in super easy and fast. Thank you all and thank you Hilton for having us",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Experience,"We stayed at the Hilton as our conference was held there. Everything made for an excellent stay. The concierge had great recommendations and the hotel location and free bus service made it easy to spend time downtown. The only slight negative was that the bed wasn't very comfortable, otherwise, it was a wonderful stay.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Hotel downtown Denver,"Very nice clean hotel in downtown Denver. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. We had a room on one of the exec floors. Very pleased with the room, the bed was so amazingly comfortable. Would definitely stay here again. The location was perfect and plenty of available restaurants near by. Only complaint would be that they closed the executive lounge on Saturday and Sunday, the website showed the lounge closed on the evenings on Saturday and Sunday, but that wasn't the case during our stay, it was completely closed. They did have the breakfast still in another room but it was sub-par.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Service & Location ,"We just had a great stay during the Colorado Crossroads volleyabll tournament.  The location from the hotel to the convention center is so convenient, only three and half blocks away.  And there’s a Starbucks inside the hotel which is perfect since we needed to wake up early for the games.  The hotel rooms are clean and modern.  Special thanks to our concierge Rich Z!  Days before we arrived, he answered my questions and helped me finding a restaurant to host our team dinner.  And he always helped us when needed during our stay.  We will definitely come back to stay next year.  Thank you",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Gold star customer service!!!,"The Hilton Denver City Center is the poster-child for hospitality. Stranded in Chicago due to connection problems, I contacted the Hilton main customer service line to cancel my hotel reservation in Denver. After being put on hold 5 times by a novice rep without getting anywhere, I decided to contact the hotel directly. Andrew at the front desk assisted me. He was professional and extremely helpful. He went above and beyond to help me. Andrew enlisted the help of his manager (Greg) and not only did they cancel my reservation, they offered to host me the next morning prior to my business meeting. It had been a while since I stayed at this Hilton (which I have to say is a very nice property), but the Hilton Denver City Center will be my go-to hotel in Denver from now on. Thank you Andrew and Greg for going above and beyond.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Decent hotel for the price, good location","We paid $99/night for this hotel, which we thought was a good value for the quality and location. There were a couple of minor issues - the room is pretty small, just a bed and a small sitting area and table with a desk and chair against the wall. The room was pretty noisy between doors closing/voices in the hallway, the light rail train bell right outside the window, and the water pipes. The staff was great everywhere, including valet, front desk, housekeeping, and the restaurant. And the food in the restaurant was quite good.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Worst stay ever,Fixing the A/C unit consisted of maintenance advising me to switch the fan from “auto” to “low or high”. Managers did not know how to apply tax exemption. Rooms were ready 4 hours after checking. Mgmt offered nothing except one colleague a free executive lounge breakfast.,1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton City Center,Nice place to stay if you can afford the parking.  Staff is excellent. Room was nice and very quiet.  Food was good but expensive.  Nicer places to eat within easy walking distance.  Close to 16th Street Mall.  Light rail stop right across the street.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Stay,The staff all over the hotel is GREAT!  Always so helpful and attentive.  If your room is on a lower level you can hear the train near by.  The food was great and the conference space was pleasurable!!!!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Expected better,"I expect a certain level of service from a hotel of this caliber and I didn’t get it. First, the things they got right. I requested a room in a quiet part of the hotel. No problems there, although I was a little worried when I walked into my room and saw complimentary ear plugs to block noise. The bed was blissfully comfortable. Unfortunately, the air conditioning is non-existent. I had it down to my the lowest setting - 60 degrees - and I was sweating. The on-site restaurant is very basic - I would have expected more options. I got in at night and really did not want to go out. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, which would be better described as noodles and lettuce. Four tiny pieces of chicken in the whole thing - looked like a third of a chicken breast. Not what I was expecting. Valet parking is $49 a day, which lets you go in and out as often as you want. I got there at night and was leaving the next day, so had I used the valet, it would have been $100. Kudos to the bellhop and the valet for suggesting that I self park at the same garage they use. Since I got in after 4 p.m. it was $6 for the night. I had business within walking distance of the hotel the next day, so I just left the car in that garage. Maximum daily charge is $20, so I ended up paying $26 for parking - which is a lot more reasonable. I tossed and turned all night because the room was too warm. In the morning, I opened the refrigerator to get something and a flood poured out. There had to have been two inches of water in the bottom of the refrigerator. I wasn’t eating the food I had put in because who knows where that water was coming from. So that was a waste of money. Shower head is a pretty square thing, but no pressure whatsoever. Needless to say I was very grumpy by the time I got to the checkout. Oh and I forget to mention the fact that there were food crumbs and whole almonds on the room’s carpet, so clearly it hadn’t been vacuumed. I told all of this to the front desk staff, and the response - “we’ll let maintenance know.” What happened to the make it right motto? I cannot recommend this hotel. The property is beautiful but there are maintenance and staff training issues that need to be resolved.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,5 star quality hotel at very reasonable prices,"This is a wonderful hotel, with a fantastic staff, and comfortable, well appointed rooms. The front desk staff are always very welcoming and helpful, as is everyone I come in contact with.  The rooms are clean, quiet and very comfortable.  This was not my first stay here, and the consistency is always spot on. It is a 5 minute walk to the convention center, and there are tons of restaurants close by. I will definitely be back!  Kuddos to the manager Lynzy and her team.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not Hilton Standards- stay away,"I am not one to write reviews, but I am also one that is easily pleased and rarely complain. I checked in late tonight, and if it had been earlier in the day, I would have left right away. The hotel is a total joke and an embarrassment to the Hilton brand. At check-in there was zero elite recognition despite being a diamond member- which is not that big of a deal. Upon entering my room on the ""executive level"" I was shocked and confused. The room is so small that I almost hit my head on the door and on the one tiny light fixture. I dont even know if I can fit in the shower. The room is extremely dated to the point that there is no overhead lighting in the room itself. If this is the executive level, I would hate to see the other rooms. STRIKE 1.... After I dropped my bags I walked to the lounge before the hors d'oeuvres ended. There idea of lounge hors d'oeuvres was a few piece of cheese cut up and thrown on a plate. The executive lounge makes the United Club look like a lounge at the Ritz... Strike 2. After this, I tried to call downstairs to have some clothes pressed. I hit the guest service button on the phone and it just rang and rang. I put it on speakerphone after a few minutes out of curiosity if anyone would ever answer. After five minutes someone came to the phone who said they do not press clothes in house. I would call that strike 3 but gave it a pass. I headed down to the ""restaurant"" to get dinner before heading to bed. The Denver Hilton's idea of a full service restaurant is a few tables thrown around a bar. Total disgrace for a full service hotel- STRIKE THREEI wanted to checkout, but it was too late to move. This property is an embarrassment to the brand and I will never return... Oh and they even leave you plastic earplugs by the bed due to the ""city noise"".....more like hallway noise..... RUN FAR AWAY",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great place to stay, close to go to places downtown.","The brand i always very good, never fails to deliver on the value and  their locations. The front desk was helpful when we arrived and whenever we asked for directions or recommendations for transportation or places to go. Clean and nice beds to rest the tired body.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, very comfy beds.","The staff was helpful and friendly. Just one block from the downtown 16th Street Mall, three blocks from the Colorado Convention Center. Very comfortable beds. Our shower was small and the bathroom door is a sliding ""barn-style"" door with no lock (odd).",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Executive Lounge Needs Management Attention,"I do like this hotel as a whole, just not the Executive Lounge. This Hilton needs to notify Diamond and Executive Floor guest that the food in the lounge is served on a first come basis. Note  that the one staff member in the lounge seemed to be working hard to keep up and the lounge was clean, large and nice. This is a management issue not a staff issue. At breakfast, by 8:00am 75% of the food will be gone and by 8:30am you get left over scraps of what was marginal food at best. Completely out of basics like real milk, pastries, certain cereals and bagels etc. Holiday Inn express has better offerings, pathetic for a Hilton. Most Hilton Hotels of this caliber serve much better food in the executive lounge. At night please do not even bother to goto the executive lounge unless you are into scraps of vegetables. No deserts either. On Valentine’s Day the lounge was gracious enough to offer one Halloween style candy bowl of Hershey kisses.....give me a break.  Mgt should be ashamed. Location is great, and staff was friendly, especially the valets. Rooms were clean and nice.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,just like Camping,"No Hot Water. just like camping out, except it was below freezing out. Was let a note that the hot water was going to intermittent ,went to take a shower no hot water call done to front desk and questioned is intermittent no hot water and was told that is what it meant",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Poor customer service,Booked with free cancellation called and canceled with the hotel. Was still charged and was told they had no record of my phone conversation. Stayed here 2 times prior very nice place. Will never stay again after this.,1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not the service I’m accustomed to receiving at Hilton properties ,"The location is great!  Close to restaurants and the 16th street mall.  Valets and bellman are excellent.  The complimentary breakfast in the executive lounge was good.I requested an upgrade as a diamond member and was given a room facing a building.  I was told the executive floor is an upgrade.  I thought access to the executive lounge was standard for diamond members.  The shower is nice but the water pressure is too low to enjoy the shower head.  The hot water was tepid the entire stay.  Room was noisy, can clearly hear ppl next door in addition to street noise.This property is nice but needs some tweaking to become worthy of returning.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Just what you would expect (and hope for),"Really big, efficient hotel right in the centre, where everything works, the rooms are comfortable, spacious and well appointed, the clubroom breakfasts are good, there is a Starbucks on site as well as a UPS office, multiple bars and restaurants and good, well trained staff. Just exactly as you would/should expect.For my taste the beds are too soft (but this is a US thing which us Brits are not mad about!!) - like a pillow filled water bed, but they are huge,m every room has an iron which works well and the showers work well. Good value too! Just the job",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location and fabulous staff!,Beautiful hotel with great amenities. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The location is great and easily accessible. Great hotel if you’re visiting Denver for the first time. Plenty of amenities offered inside the hotel too.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very nice. Great location,We enjoyed staying here. We were surprised to know there wasn’t a shuttle that went to and from the airport but we were glad we were in walking distance from the buses at 16th st mall. We also wished the bathroom doors actually closed and locked instead of just rolling closed. Privacy was slightly limited for those in the restroom while others were putting things in the closet. We loved the bar and fireplace downstairs although drinks were slightly pricy. We will definitely be back soon. Thank you!,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"Great location, clean hotel.  I gave this a 2 for one simple reason.  $30 for breakfast no wait staff available to tell you it isnt included for the stay.  You eat then they pop out of nowhere to collect.  Weight loss surgery so I eat little paying $30 bucks for coffee, 1 egg, 1 piece of toast and one slice of bacon is a bit infuriating.  Could have been avoided if staff was there or there were signs I dictating the price.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Shameful Executive Lounge,"Nice hotel and enjoyable restaurant downstairs. Room comparable to other Hiltons. BUT I’ve been loyal to the brand since the mid 1990s and have NEVER been to an executive lounge during the hours that horderves are offered to find slices of cheese on a board, several sad raspberries sprinkled amongst the cheese and no crackers. Tiny plastic cups of limp salad was only other item offered. An embarrassment to this property. I had complimentary access to this sad excuse of a lounge. I hope no guest upgrades and pays for access.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great Location, Great Staff","The Staff was over the top friendly and helpful, the location was great, also convenient that there is a starbucks connected to the hotel, just a few feet from the elevators, and a nice restaurant/bar inside the hotel as well.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Paper thin walls and overpriced.,"Worst hotel stay in a long time. The walls are paper thin and you can here everything in the nearby rooms and halls. people were slamming doors and it my the walls in our room shake. They obviously know it's a problem since they leave out earplugs. But one one pair of earplugs, you have to ask for more. Then we went down for breakfast and they wasn't any signage or a waiter around, so we went to the breakfast buffet. As we were eating a waiter came by and dropped of a check for $50! Who charges $50 dollars for a mediocre breakfast?! For $50 I at least expect some booze. Front desk lady said they would work on putting up better signage. We'll see, but I doubt it.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver downtown excellence,"Location allows the freedom to walk almost anywhere you'd like to go; shopping, restaurants, movies, bars/lounges, and only 3 blocks to the Denver Convention Center straight down California Street. Hotel also has a shuttle service, that will take you and pick you up, within 2-mile radius of the hotel; very convenient",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Corporate Greed,"We stayed at this hotel over a long weekend to attend the WESA trade show. Staff were knowledgeable, kind and great P.R. skills. Room was clean when we arrived. We found out that the Wrangler Party was in the basement of our hotel the second night of our stay which was a plus. There were many things we liked about this hotel but nothing that stands out. This is a very nice hotel and has much going for it but now for my rant:1. My wife and I stayed on a King bed which was nice, but the problem is the bed is set on a six inch high platform, so if you have to get up in the middle of the night and your forget you are six inches above the rest of the floor, you end up with a possible trip or coming back to bed in the dark (you don't want to wake you spouse) stubbing your toes and tripping too. I am surprised that have not had legal action from someone. ( not me I am not the type).2. The first night we turned the thermostat down to 65 but the room temperature did not drop lower than at best about 70.  I sleep much better in a cool room and did not sleep well that night from the heavy blanket that was on the bed. 3.We had paid for two rooms, one for us and one for our son who was there also attending the trade show, at total of $320. Anyway I go downstairs to get breakfast and am informed that if I want to eat breakfast, the price is $24 per person. Somehow, it sticks in my craw that if you stay in a nice place, most hotels will feed you some sort of breakfast, but corporate greed dictated we needed to pay more. We opted to take the free breakfast at the WESA trade show instead rather than drop another $75 bucks.4. On the last night we stayed, the maid did not clean our toilet and did a fast, cursory job of half cleaning our room, at best.  (there was still some garbage on my night stand). And the bed looked like a 3rd grader had pretended  made it. I think the maid was in a hurry to get her job done, or just lame and tired that day?5. The rest of the nights we set the thermostat down to it's lowest point at 60 and the room still stayed around 70 or so. We had a thick blanket on our bed and my wife who can sleep in a warm room even complained to me about the room being too warm. Again good old corporate greed overriding the thermostat so they can save a few more bucks and pork the clients with high $ hotel room . I have stayed in many nice hotels but very few who are this cheap.  Not what I would expect from a nice hotel like Hilton.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Wonderful Hotel, Staff and Amenities","Our stay was special, my daughter's birthday and first time skiing. Staff made it special by setting up a surprise in our room. Valet service was great! Concierge was helpful and pleasant.. above and beyond by recommending activities via email",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not what I have come to expect from Hilton,"I am a Hilton Gold Member and stay at Hilton properties (as exclusively as possible) for both business and leisure. That will not change as a result of this experience; however, I must admit I was SORELY underwhelmed with the Hilton Denver City Center. First of all, I used points to upgrade to an executive floor. The room was not particularly well apportioned or designed. I used the online check-in function to select my room online, but upon arrival (at almost 5:00 PM) this room was not available. I was given another room without explanation. Upon entering room 1905 (a one-bedroom king suite), we found food crumbs in the floor and a water circle on the counter. We also had only two glasses by the sink (there were three of us), only two towels in the bathroom, a single set of regular shampoo/conditioner, and no sheets or pillows for the sofa bed. I walked down the hall, found a maid, and informed her we'd need to have the floor vacuumed and to get a few more items. I also asked for extra toiletries and sheets/pillows for my daughter. The maid said she would come by. She didn't. Thirty minutes later, I called guest services. Vanessa (if I remember correctly) was very apologetic and offered to make things right. Thank you for being so professional, Vanessa. Unfortunately, another 20 minutes passed without someone coming by, so we called back. Again, Vanessa... again, very apologetic and helpful. A few minutes later a man came to the door. Without saying a word, he just handed us three plastic cups. Remember, this is an executive floor. After this, a maid showed up with a lint roller to get the crumbs. She also gave us another towel and handful of the regular shampoo. We received no apology for the inconvenience or the food crumbs in the floor. Finally, we had to call AGAIN to get them to bring the sheets and pillows. At this point, a woman we presumed to be a guest room manager came with sheets and pillows. All in all, it about an hour to have our concerns addressed. During that time, we went to the executive lounge. Terrible. There was no attendant, no alcohol. Only a coffeemaker and refrigerator with Cokes. This space certainly added no value to our ""executive experience"". Overall, the room they gave us was unimpressive. The ""walk-in"" shower was inexplicably narrow. It had one of those fancy square shower heads, but water pressure was so weak, I'd have preferred a regular one. Sure, the high-floor view and location are nice, but it came at a price... which we paid, so that's to be expected. when we checked out the next morning, we were not asked ""How was your stay?"" Surveys always ask ""Did you bring anything to the attention fo the manager?"" No I didn't... but I have never felt it is really my job to do that. The staff should do that when they are informed of a potential problem. Besides, I have a feeling they usually already know where the weaknesses in the team are... Isn't that what being a manager is all about? Anyway, being on vacation, I really just wanted to get on the road. All this said, if I ever stay here again... and due mostly to perceived apathy among most (not ALL) of the staff I likely won't... I wouldn't waste the money or points for an executive floor.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent customer service & Great Location,"My husband was supposed to stay at this hotel on business for two weeks and I flew in for the weekend. The room was very great. It was clean, modern and decorated nicely. The location was perfect. It was just a block off of the 16th street mall which has just about any store or restaurant you could hope for. Union Station was only about 10 minutes away. We walked to the station which took us directly to the Denver airport. While I was in town, we got a rental car from Avis which was only two blocks from the hotel so we walked over to get that. This hotel really is in a great location. Towards the end of our weekend, my husband got kidney stones so we cut our trip short. Within an hour of leaving the hospital we had booked new flights home and checked out. The young girl who checked us out was the icing on the cake. She was very sympathetic and they did not charge us for anymore nights even though we were checking out late. We are very appreciative. My husband also said that he and his coworkers were allowed to check in early when they arrived and that one coworker got bumped to a suite because his room wasn’t ready (even though they checked in early). Since my mini vacation was cut short, I’m planning on bringing the whole family this summer and we’ll definitely be staying at this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel with wonderful location,"Wonderful location, wonderful staff, little bit expensive if you eat at the restaurant, but the food is amazing! Staff are very incredible as well! Definitely would recommend to friends and family!!!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great except for the HVAC system,"Stayed on the 12th floor, southwest side of the building.  Just one night as the wife and I were attending a corporate holiday party.  The building is located in central downtown between the northbound and southbound RTD Light Rail lines and less than two blocks from the 16th Street Mall and the shuttle line there.  This Hilton lived up to our expectations for the most part - just a problem with the HVAC that we did not report since we were only there one night.  My wife and I both awoke with hearts racing because it was way to hot in the room (1212) and our hearts could not keep our organs cool enough.  Temp on the thermostat said 65 degrees, so who knows what it really was.  Turning it down to 60 helped a little, but only as long as the fan stayed on.  The fan was set to automatic and there was no way to change it to stay on all the time (we both tried).  In short, it was a miserable nights sleep.  Do yourself a favor and check the HVAC operation as soon as you check in to avoid such an experience.  There is a nice place for Brunch on the weekends nearby (16th & Glenarm Pl).  Get there before noon for Happy Hour pricing on food and drinks.  Lots of other dining and entertainment options within walking distance.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location!,"The hotel was in a good location to easily walk around the city, close to 16th Street shopping/restaurants, 16th Street free bus, Union Station. Trolley stop right across the street. Good restaurants within a block of the hotel and across the street.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Relaxing Stay: Perfect for Work and Leisure,"I don't usually stay in downtown areas, but I'm glad that I chose to this time. The Hilton is a tall structure with a nice modern feel inside. Best of all they have a Starbucks cafe next to the elevators. The room was spacious and the bed was the standard excellent quality that the Hilton brand is known for. My view was not the best, another office building, but that is not to fault the hotel as it is in a downtown area. There are many excellent amenities such as restaurants and fitness center (did I mention Starbucks ;) One of the best things that I liked about the hotel is actually it's location. It is only a couple blocks from a vibrant downtown area for shopping and eating. The area is nice to walk around, with free busing up and down the strip. I used Uber to get to places in Denver, and they were frequent in availability. The hotel is well worth staying.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay!,I had to stay for work on Christmas night. The staff was friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. The room was clean and super nice. The restaurant was amazing. The pretzels with cheese were awesome and the cheeseburger was hands down the best I’ve ever had.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Overall great stay!,I would have given it a 5 rating had it not been for the receptionist who checked me in when she acted like she didn't care to much to do so.. very unenthusiastic. Otherwise great quality of stay and great breakfast,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Excellent location, excellent staff",The hotel is very customer friendly and in a great location.  The bartenders and waitresses were particularly friendly an accommodating.... definitely a great place for a weary business traveler.  WIll stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hotel!,The holiday decorations were beautiful!! The room was a little tight but very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay and the price was unbeatable! Loved how close it was to restaurants and downtown Denver.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Close to where you want to be when visiting Denver,"Just 2 blocks from 16th street mall, which is where you want to visit when coming to the city. And first time visiting, this was the best location. A hike to Mile High Stadium, 2.5 miles, but we walked both ways and it is a safe walk (we are NOT regular exercisers either). Got a great price on rooms, so was well worth the price. Had twin Queen room, and was pretty tight quarters. Not a fan of sliding bathroom doors either (not private enough), but was a very updated, modern room.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel with a great location,"Overall, a pretty nice hotel located right down the street from 16th ave.  The location was great as there were plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance.  2 elevators were down on Sat night, but other than that, everything was pretty nice.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"The hotel gives you the basics of a “nice” hotel. Comfy beds, hot shower, mini fridge, coffee maker. Fairly well decorated and well lit. My biggest complaint is that the room walls were thin and i could hear everyone in the hall and in the rooms next door. Starbucks and restaurant within hotel as well.The location is amazing, especially for first time visitors. Easy walk to dining,shopping, entertainment. Service is mediocre. Some of the employees were very helpful and friendly, some looked at my friend and I like aliens, but it didn’t ruin the experience because they were not essential parts of our stay.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Expensive to park,At $60 a night for valet or $12 to park in a parking garage that is a few blocks away in the winter is not fun. The rest was okay but not enough to outweigh the frustration of finding parking. You can find some tasty restaurants in the area.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Awesome!,Just a great hotel with a fantastic location! Everyone on staff was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great location! Right in the middle of everything and the price was certainly right!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great Location & Staff, Poor Management","The location & staff service are fantastic at this hotel! Everyone was very helpful and responsive despite a few confusing inputs, but these were quickly & efficiently resolved. The room was also excellent although, even with several suites available for reservations online, management did not see fit to upgrade a Diamond HHonors member beyond a standard corner room.The truly disappointing aspect of the stay was the very, very poor executive lounge experience. The breakfast offerings were paltry & of poor quality. And there was essentially no evening lounge offering, bags of chips & crackerjacks along with one bin of cold, stale wonton like appetizer with no beverages beyond the coffee machine & sodas that were available throughout the day.While I would consider staying in this hotel again if my trip required the location (which is truly excellent), in general they have a long way to go to really portray what I consider the Hilton level of quality. The staff were great, very helpful & prompt to respond. But the overall impression I got was of a hotel run by cheapskates with little to no interest in maintaining the Hilton reputation. The front desk manager even admitted that the reason the evening offerings in the lounge were so poor was to encourage guests to go to the bar & restaurant in the basement of the hotel.So if you want a clean room with a great bed in a very good location for Downtown Denver with professional staff & don't care about the quality of the HHonors experience, this hotel is fine. Otherwise, don't expect much out of your HHonors loyalty at this hotel.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel overall,Hotel is in a great location and has all the amenities. Room was clean and large and the gym was good size as well. Hotel was courteous and you can walk many places around. I would recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Poor Customer Service,"I booked my one night at this location few weeks in advance to ensure that I can get a room and send my special request (Denver / downtown gets busy on the weekends). I requested a quiet room, far from the elevator. Upon arrival, I was told the hotel is full (18 floors?) and received a room very close to the elevator. There was a football game in town and I ended up sharing the floor with several Broncos fans who used the elevator all evening. People next door to me were super loud, got drunk and were up till 2am. I checked out very disappointed and when asked for a feedback, I got the same answer as I got upon check in (we are sorry, the hotel was full, we didn’t have a better room). What is the point of accepting early reservations then? Had I walked in, I would get the same exact room. I travel A LOT and almost every hotel I stayed at, honored my advanced request and I stayed in nice & quiet rooms. This is my third time at Hilton and second time when I had an issue with the room request  - I doubt I will stay at Hilton again.5* for the location and comfy bed thou.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel,Hotel is fine. A bit dated. As a Hilton diamond member there are various benefits such as a free upgrade that should be offered. Did not receive any of them. Staff should take care of diamond members or diamond members should switch brands,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business travel,They provided me a room even though I was very early in the day. Every amenity possible was available.  Service was great!  Restaurant and bar downstairs had excellent service and the food was good.  Recommended choice for HHonors in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hotel!,"Enjoyed our one night stay.  Diamond status, upgraded room, and felt the executive lounge was good by USA standards.  Staff was helpful and friendly.  If the valet only parking is a concern, there is plenty of parking garages within one block, in my case across the street for a total of $12.  I typically stay at the Sheraton for Denver meetings, but think I will make the Hilton my first choice now.  200 nights/year in hotels for me, so I'm a bit of an expert.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Avoid the bar/dining room,"Our room was ok, not great by Hilton standards. Although two of us we only had towels for one and soaps etc. for one. With airline restrictions you count on this stuff being in your room, particularly the Hilton!!?Out check in went fine and the first two nights our room was cleaned. On the third we called when we left the room late for housekeeping. Returning four hours later the room wasn't touched, so we called again. After being told they would be right there we went to the lobby/business center to kill time, and returned in an hour to an unclean room. At this point I called the manager who was more concerned with what went wrong, what happened than with assuring me it would be dealt with and maybe an apology...? I finally had to literally stop him and say what happened is your management issue my issue is just getting the room cleaned and towels.Given these issues when I checked out I reviewed the bill for a credit due. No surprise it wasn't there...Terrible service and lukewarm food in the so called dining room. I would advise against going there. I had a 3 inch stick in my french onion soup that the manager argued was not a problem probably from a spice. So a bay leaf?? You generally remove a bay leaf. Nope according to him it stays in so look out you could get a full bay lead in your soup I only got the long stem!!! Amazing. Will be back to Denver, will not stay here.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Terrific executive lounge, great location","I've been to a lot of executive lounges, and this one is superb for their hot buffet breakfast. Scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, potatoes, yogurt with lots of fresh fruit options, pastries, latte machine. It's in a spacious room on the 17th floor with great city views. Many seating options have plugs for charging your devices. Never crowded.No evening buffet, but you get a coupon to use for appetizers at the hotel bar.Great location in the city, with northbound light-rail on one side on California and southbound on the other side on Stout.Full-service Starbucks in the lobby. Very nice surroundings, helpful staff. No complaints.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,10/10 Recommend!,"Perfectly located, incredible staff, beautiful hotel. If you're a Hilton Honors member definitely choose this hotel. If you're not, SIGN UP for free with a front desk agent and definitely stay at this hotel. You wont regret it. :)",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Poor service all around; staff blame management and others,"I checked into this hotel in Nov 2018 at 530PM - an hour I would think many people, likewise, check into hotels worldwide. There was one person at the front desk (who I later learned was a manager on duty). He was serving a family who appeared to be asking a lot of questions about upgrades, etc. After waiting in line for 30 mins., I asked the bell desk staff if there were more staff on duty who could be helping me and the five people in line behind me. I was told there was no one available. Waiting an additional time, I was called to the desk by another staff who appeared from the office. The clerk who checked me in told me I had access to the Executive Lounge (as a Hilton Diamond, I am aware of the benefits), and he promoted there were unlimited breakfast granola bars and water in the lounge. I thought he was joking, so I laughed. He told me he was serious. I suggested this was ridiculous for a downtown business hotel. He said it was the general manager's decision. I arrived in my room and would suggest the style is an old convention hotel which needs refreshing. I received a telephone call from the man who had been waiting on the family for ~30 mins. He apologised. I told him about my conversation about the Executive Lounge and he offered to host me for dinner in the restaurant given the length of time I waited to check in and given the executive lounge disappointment.I ate in the restaurant. Every table in the restaurant was either dirty or occupied. I stood next to a dirty table and was able to capture the attention of a wait staff person to ask if I could take the table. She cleaned it. After 15 more minutes, she returned to take my drink order. Thereafter, I ordered a french onion soup and a fish entree. Both arrived together. I said I wanted time to enjoy the soup before my entree. She blamed the chef.The hotel appears to have a bit of work to do in terms of training of the service staff from the front desk to the restaurant. Additionally, I'd suggest the decision to change the Executive Lounge to a room with unlimited granola bars and water needs to be reversed.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Home away from home!,"Very comfortable, amazing staff, perfect location, therefore a short walk to EVERYTHING (16th Street mall, stores, restaurants, bars, etc). Impeccable customer service by the staff. Comfortable beds and pillows. Like the title said, perfect place to feel like a home away from home. Very warm service from EVERYONE!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hotel was fine-Mgmt are scammers!,We were re-routed unexpectedly from LAS to DEN and got in after midnight. Having never been to Denver we were excited and wanted to stay downtown. We booked our room and the booking made us select 12/1 as it was technically the next day. We get to the hotel and low and behold the check in agent can’t find our reservation. She locates it after a few minutes and then states we cannot check in because it was too early. I asked if they could accommodate an early check in as it was a flight situation. She grabbed the manager who stated no. At this point it’s 2:30am and I’m tired and cold. I asked when they could accommodate an early check in. We were told 3am. So I opted to wait for 30 mins in the lobby. At which point I made it clear that I felt 30 mins could be navigated in the spirit of customer service. They told me to call Hotwire and cancel my booking in order to get checked in. They offered me a walk up rate at $100. I decided not to as Hotwire is impossible to get a person and I already paid a non refundable rate of $87 for the night. The manager then told me if I paid $50 I could check in. Not happening. He told me then I’d get $10 back meaning I could check in for $40. Absolutely not. He then proceeded to check us in. For no fee. Annoyed and cold we proceeded to the room which was decent for the price. Not great-basic for 7 hrs of sleep. When we go to check out I’m told there would be an early check out fee. Say what now? Like. At this point I’m over it. She gets a manager and they waive it. How generous. No idea how this is an affiliated national brand bc it felt like a long walk down and alley. Constant hustle.while I appreciate being checked in I made it known I’m well traveled and have never heard of these fees/practices. Also other reviewers stated they couldn’t get money back after paid which I why I refused. Don’t do it. Go elsewhere and if you’re stuck at the airport just pay and stay at the Westin!,1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Just Average,"There are good and bad things about this hotel. The location is good. There are many things to do within walking distance. Service was good, except I wouldn’t count on getting picked up at Union Station in you take the train from the airport. The rooms were nice, however there was quite a bit of street noise. A white noise app on your phone may help. Breakfast was similar to a free breakfast from most hotels, here it was $24. Beer selection at the bar was good. There is a nice common area in the lobby for relaxing and visiting.",3

"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful staff,"Stayed here for a conference. Beautifully appointed lobby and meeting rooms. Staff was great and very accomidating @ front desk-did not see others. However restaurant is high priced for what it is with very limited menu, bed was extremely uncomfortable and noise level was pretty crazy for being on 9th floor. Pillows were comfy. Room was clean but could have been better supplied. Meeting rooms cold. Odd food and beverage service for conference but not sure if was hotel or conference issue. Good location. High priced parking.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Good, but","Nice hotel close to good dining and shopping. Service was great and food was wonderful. Not a fan of the sliding bathroom door in the room, didn't offer any privacy when using the bathroom. Door does not close flush with wall so every noise/smell made in the bathroom was soon in the main room. Probably not bad when you are with a significant other a little uncomfortable when rooming with a coworker.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Stay Here- Eat Elsewhere,"The hotel was very nice and had all you would wish for... the staff are not exactly the most helpful people you could meet. I found myself relieved when my colleagues did not want to eat at the restaurant because it was some of the all time worst service I've ever received. With two different conferences going on, they had two people working plus a bartender. It was something that made you feel bad for the wait staff but irritated none the less. While I would like to say the wait staff members were running like crazy they would just disappear. It took (no exaggeration) 40 minutes just to get my check. the place is beautiful and the location is great. Just avoid eating there if you can.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton Denver City Center: All about Location,"Hotel has a great location downtown Denver. It is 2 blocks from 16th street shops, restaurants and public transportation. Rooms are modernized with great amenities. Hilton Lounge offered array of snacks, beverages with excellent breakfast.Only negative about this hotel is the outdoor noise is extremely noticeable in the room. I was on the 5th floor so it might not be an issue on upper floors. Hotel does provide ear plugs that did not resolve the issue, then again I am light sleeper.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Avail yourself of the concierge!,"While I've stayed at many hotels where there was concierge service, I have never taken advantage until now.  Our dinner reservations ended up not working for us, so we were without dinner reservations on a Friday night.  The concierge was quite helpful and informative and got us into a restaurant which was exactly what we wanted (seafood) and, bonus, the restaurant had a $25 discount in place for the referral!  I would have increased my tip to the concierge had I known!The hotel has a complimentary in-house car service which will take you anywhere within a two-mile radius of the hotel.  Downside, there is only one car - but if you are flexible and leave enough time in case you have to wait, this is a great benefit. Tip your driver!Hilton Denver City Center is 1 1/2 blocks from the 16th Street Mall, where the free bus takes you up and down 16th Street - plenty of restaurants, bars, shopping, and will take you right up to the Union Station.  Be sure to check out the Tattered Cover Bookstore.]The only disappointment about the Hilton was no waffles on the breakfast buffet. LOL! A petty complaint, and a personal one, as I am a big waffle fan. Otherwise, everything about our stay was great.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very Nice Property - Great Location,This is an excellent property for business travel.  It is centrally located in downtown Denver and easy to gain access to with a parking garage literally right across the road. The hotel restaurant is excellent with a super professional staff. I was welcomed with waters and a snack and was given a free upgrade in rooms due to my hilton honors status. I have stayed here twice on business and both times was very satisfied. The Hilton Honors suite had excellent snacks and drinks - really great breakfast in the mornings and beautiful place to have a glass of wine during the sunset. Highly recommend this hotel!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Just what I needed,"Just a block from my conference and very comfortable, plus really helpful staff. Lots of little thoughtful touches, like the earplugs in case city sounds distract you, and the almond milk for my coffee. I like that you can forego housekeeping and earn extra points for future stays.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel!,"The hotel was great, accommodations were very nice. Our room was a little on the small and dark side but overall fit our needs. The staff at the restaurant bar had some of the best customer service I have ever experienced.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay at Hilton,Great stay at Hilton Denver City Center.  Close to everything including the Convention Center.  Clean rooms and facility.  Friendly staff.  Bartenders were fun and friendly.  Very decorative and beautiful place to stay.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very adequate for conference/convention stays,"Hilton Diamond, stayed here for a conference for most of the week. I am most enthused for the customer service shown by the staff here than for the actual hotel.Checkin was unremarkable. Room was surprisingly larger than what I would have guessed for a in-the-thick-of-it hotel. Bed was comfortable, HVAC was fine, bathroom and toiletries were also adequate. Housekeeping wasn't superb, but I was spoilt by my recent previous stay; it was again, adequate.The elevators were a slight issue, but I wasn't totally put out by it as such. The executive lounge was a bit of disappointment. The views were quite good and the space itself was quite nice. The food/drinks options were a bit insipid though, surprisingly for a downtown hotel. The breakfast eggs however, were quite good. I believe the alcoholic drinks in the evenings are not free, so a little different from other Hilton executive lounges.Whenever I had the need to interface with the staff however, the customer service was exemplary and thorough. That's really what pushed this rating from a 3 to 4. In separate incidents, I interacted with the front-desk, housekeeping, security and concierge (on telephone) and they were all top of the line as far as understanding my problems and doing something about it. Please, Hilton Denver Management, keep them happy and they will serve you well.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient,Recently converted from Marriott. Nice hotel and restaurant. Convenient to downtown businesses. Rooms are nice size. Enjoy the app based check in / check out / key. Room was clean. This time there was a distinct smoke odor in the room... very uncommon.  Will be back.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not a good choice for a convention center stay,"The Hilton City Center is a great location but unfortunately a terrible experience. Arrived late to a dirty room, toilet didn’t flush and cooling system didn’t cool. I finally got another room and a free latte card. One day room was never serviced. The waits in the evening for an elevator can be 15 min. Front desk has so much business that there is no personal customer service.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Well kept, professional staff","This was a pleasant surprise. First they had adequate staff for check-in and check-out, minimal wait. Staff very professional. Room was exec king or something similar, a little larger with a little sitting area. Hotel well kept. Maid service good. For a conference, the meeting rooms were well-laid out on a lower level, not all drawn out over a city block like some larger properties. The food at the hotel restaurant was particularly good, ranchos huervas and everything.  Central location. Good choice, I would certainly return.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Fine for a quick stay,"Stayed at the Hilton for a conference with work.  Hotel was just fine, rooms were clean and felt pretty modern.  I typically enjoy a boutique hotel to which this is not.  The elevators were beyond slow.  Took ages to get up to our rooms.  The location was nice to walk to many of the area restaurants and shops.  If I were to head back to Denver I wouldn’t pick this hotel but if it was all that was available it would do the trick!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Loved It!,"The Hilton Denver City Center Hotel is, in my opinion, the ideal downtown hotel.  I stayed here for ASME B16 Code Week at the beginning of October.  Its décor screams the city life.  It's in a fantastic location, making a car not even necessary to shop, dine, and enjoy tourist attractions.  I LOVE this hotel's concierge lounge.  It's one of the biggest I've seen. Breakfast was decent - they served the same thing every day, but that's alright (it was free!) Up until 10 p.m., you have access to as many fancy hot gourmet beverages (hot chocolate, cappuccino, vanilla latte, etc.) as you want.  Bottled water and soda too!All encountered staff were helpful and nice.  My hotel room was my oasis, and I highly recommend this hotel.  Be warned though: it's pricey.  You pay for its greatness.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beautiful property!,Rooms are spacious.  Lots of very nice touches. Quiet. Great location. Everything was first class. Friendly and helpful staff. Excellent and very busy steakhouse right next door.  Liked the conference space.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel; seamless stay,"I stayed here whilst on a business trip. It was an easy, short walk to the Convention Centre each day, and great location to various restaurants in the evening.The hotel staff were all very helpful and polite. The room was spacious and clean with a nice bathroom. Despite reading comments about noise, there was minimal noise from trams and the street in my room and I was in a room looking down to the street.The only negative would be that the gym was very dated and tired, and the pool was closed; but apparently they were renovating this at the end of the year.I would definitely recommend staying here if you are thinking about visiting Denver. While my trip was for business, I very much enjoyed Denver as a city and would love to return - with the Hilton Denver City Centre my first choice of places to stay!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,One night stay for college visit,Good location for visiting CU Denver.  Great breakfast in the executive lounge! Room was pretty standard for a hilton and very comfortable.  Valet was easy to access with texting your ticket number and they warned us to request 15 minutes before you need the car.  We walked to a restaurant recommended by concierge to watch some Sunday night football and enjoyed a great burger.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Privacy sign is a joke,"After a short business trip, my family and I decided to stay at Hilton City Center Denver for one night to explore Denver a bit more and to rest a bit.  Around 9 am we called the front desk requesting a late checkout, granted until 2 pm without any issue because we are Hilton Honors member.  Then, three different persons knocked on our door, starting even BEFORE the regular checkout time, ALL ignored the big privacy sign hanging on the door and All asking the same question:  when are you checking out!  The third time we had to tell the guy this was the third time and they needed to talk to the front desk.  Here goes my “benefit” of a late checkout!",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Helpful conference staff,"Staff keep trying to find the solution when I have a problem with my cable to connect the projector to the computer. Staff at breakfast and lunch are very efficient, they took the dirty plates right away.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good location and supportive valet,"Stayed two nights at the end of a National park drive holiday. Put the car into Valet for the first day at $52 but used the services of Ryan and team well, including use of the courtesy vehicle for some local drop offs. Rooms are good but surprisingly, the housekeeping was lacklustre. We had to ask for fresh towels each days, and toilet paper as well, as while the room was cleaned, there was no replacement of amenities. We weren't sure if they wanted a tip to be left in the room before cleaning, but I wasn't expecting that of a Hilton anyway. When we approached the housekeeping on our floor, it was a pretty unhappy reaction to being asked to get towels. But when we called downstairs, the items finally did arrive.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Perfect Location, Perfect City Hotel, Everything you would expect from Hilton!!",I don't think we could have picked a more perfect hotel for Denver City.Its was our anniversary and we were upgraded for free to the top floor in a suite with a bottle of wine waiting. Thank you to Concierge Rich Zaccagna for making our trip truly special. Its people like you that makes a difference and make guests feel special.In light of the above we were invited to breakfast on in the club lounge everyday.Perfect location with just short walk to all the main areas.Garage parking 100 yards away..approx 15 dollars week days and 5 dollars weekend.Thanks again Hilton Denver City.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Girls Trip,We stayed overnight in Denver and had a great time. The hotel and rooms were modern and clean. We got an “executive” room which came with a free hot breakfast and was worth the difference in price. The location was great. We walked across the street to a fantastic steakhouse. It’s also walking distance to a mall. We called guest services twice for an extra towel and a forgotten toothbrush and they were up to our room in less than 5 minutes. There is also a Bluetooth speaker to play music. Would definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay at a wonderful Hotel.,"We very much enjoyed are trip into Denver and our visit to the Hilton.  All team members were great to work with.  All tried to go above and beyond expectations.   We have stayed at the majority of hotels in Denver, and this is top two for sure.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel! Awful food,Very nice hotel in the center of all the action in Denver! Was there for a conference and the food was the worst I’ve ever had. Upon check in rooms were not ready. Made that work there was 14 of us so we shared rooms to freshen up. Room service was very fast on delivering beer to room. Be prepared to pay a service charge and gratuity was included. Room was clean and spacious.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice sky high executive lounge. Courtesy transportation for supper out and shopping. Great central location. Everyone was really nice and facility was clean. Close enough to walk to mall downtown, which offered many great stores, restaurants and sightseeing.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Quick Stay,"I've stayed at the property a few times now, overall it is a great place to stay. but from my last stay to this stay, they have changed their in-room dinning and it is 2 dumb's down. Felt like a meal from from a cafeteria. the value of the food was crap. but other than that, love this place",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Okay stay,Room need updating. Had empty light sockets and instead smaller lights installed above the bed which made for a poorly lit room. Only 2 outlets to charge devices and shower leaked all over bathroom floor every morning,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Older property with pluses and minuses,"Older Hilton, which had previously carried a different flag. Rooms are small. My “corner room” was a huge let down. Bathroom was the highlight. Beds are comfortable. Also a plus is the Executive Lounge, with a very nice hot breakfast. Staff is generally good, with a couple exceptions. Overall, I can’t say this property does much for me... there are a lot of other options downtown, I wouldn’t stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great, central Denver City hotel. ","My husband and I had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at this hotel. It is located only a 5 minute walk from the famous 16th St Mall, making it highly accessible to all the restaurants / shops and tourist attractions. (Excluding Mile High, which is a cab ride away). Our room was large and newly refurbished. The beds were literally the most comfortable I have EVER slept in, anywhere! Amazing. It was extremely hot during our stay and the hotel offer free bottled water at the front desk to keep you hydrated and to reduce the risk of altitude sickness. Excellent, and highly appreciated touch. The front desk staff were also very helpful. Any information you seek, they are willing to offer advice and assistance. A couple of negatives: the housekeeping was hit and miss. Often the cleaning team would come in at about 3pm, which doesn’t really work when we’ve had a long day sightseeing and want a break before heading out again for the night. They also failed to come at all on one occasion. THE LIFT!!!! If you are facing the elevators with your back to the reception area, DO NOT use the middle, left one!!! Not once, but twice this broke down on us. It was literally terrifying. First occasion it got stuck and then every time we pressed a button it felt to drop a couple of inches each time. After about 5 minutes it started moving again. We then accidentally found ourselves in it again one evening and it broke down completely. We were sat in there for about 15 minutes with some other panicky guests, until engineers came and fixed it. Avoid. Would definitely stay here again though next time we visited Denver. Really enjoyable stay, thank you. PS: some people have reported issues with the card holding thing. No issues to report here. They took $50 per night stayed as a hold and it was returned 7 days upon check out.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business Conference Trip,"The venue was great.  The staff are extremely courteous and helpful.  The rooms are very clean.  Right outside is noisy due to the tram, but that can't be helped.  The digital key feature is very slick and cool.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Terrible customer service.,I was double charged for my room and was told the extra charge would come back off in 3 to 5 business days .I called tbe desk and was informed to call back later due to she was on lunch. They made the mistake and want to fix it at their convinence is unacceptable. The room was not as nice as pictured before arrival .If you are thinking about staying here..do yourself a favor and don't .I have stayed at other Hilton locations and they were wonderful without any problems.,1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Perfect after a long flight,We had a great first night of our vacation here after a long flight and the staff and room were perfect. We had stayed in Denver before but not here and will now use it for our visits. Close to everything you would need.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice, what you'd expect for Hilton, but pricey","We spent one night here on our way through town to see a concert at Red Rocks. It was a good location - midway between airport and Red Rocks - but we paid a lot for that. After spending 24 hours in downtown Denver, I think there are many other options nearby that would not be as expensive for what you get. The hotel was nice - no complaints other than the walls were a bit thin - we heard people in the next room pretty clearly. Be aware that parking is NOT included and adds a lot to the cost - valet is $49 per day, which isn't a luxury because if you park yourself you end up paying $20 for one in/out of the garage so if you leave and come back within the day, you might as well valet park. Friendly staff.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location,"Located in the heart of downtown Denver, you can walk to the ballpark and all over the place. Nice high rise hotel with a very nice 17th floor Executive Lounge. The breakfast was more than adequate. Great job. The lower level bar is a nice place to relax and watch sports. Huge projective screen tv. Nice beer selection. Would like to single out Austin Bierdek, Front Office Supervisor, for excellent service. He was helping out at breakfast one minute, then down at the front desk the next minute. Was soooo helpful and professional.A word about downtown Denver...It has been invaded by homeless people. The 16th street mall is close to the hotel, but it's loaded with homeless. I come from a very large city, and was still surprised by the amount of people. Kinda scary at times on darkened streets. The Target by the hotel was robbed as we were checking out. Be prepared for the smell of pot everywhere. I will say that there were lots of cops all over the place.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice place, nice location.","We were in town for the baseball game.  We chose this hotel since it was within walking distance of the ballpark.  And like the other Hilton's that we've stayed at, it was a nice place - comfy beds, clean facilities, nice staff, etc.  We stayed on the executive level so the breakfast and evening snacks were part of the deal.  Valet parking was a little pricey so we used one of the parking garages across the street.  All in all it was a great weekend...no complaints.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Perfect Location & great rooms!,"Great location downtown, walking distance to everything.  Very clean and modern rooms.  Can be loud being downtown but they provide ear plugs for you.   There is a starbucks inside the hotel which is convent in the mornings.  Check in was fast and Craig was great.  It was a hot day so they had a mini fridge full of free otter pops in the lobby which is a fun touch.  Bed and pillows were super comfy, I never wanted to get out of bed!  Overall a great stay!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location great staff,Great property just need to improve on the in room dining. Brown bag delivery and very little selection. Great staff !!!!Will probably stay at another Hilton property on my next visit just due to the limited food options on property.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice, Clean, Convenient","Check-in was SO slow. I have never waited in line for so long to check into a hotel. After flying for hours, luggage, cab ride - I'm ready to relax. The room was pretty quiet, nice, bed and linens was comfortable. I loved the fact they had room service from their restaurant. As a female staying alone, I'm not going out unless it's a group. The food was decent, and service was spot-on. They thought of everything. The cleaning staff was friendly. I stayed for business, and the location was super convenient to my work.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Convenient Location, Stylish and Spacious Room","Spent 5 nights in Denver at this beautiful Hilton hotel. Stayed on the 17th floor and was able to access the executive lounge on the same floor. The room is pretty big and comes with a mini chaise sofa. The bathroom is also decent size and look very modern.No problems with Internet speed or connectionsLounge offers good variety of hot breakfast like eggs, potatos, bacons/sausages, yogurt (only 1 favor), 2 coffee machines, fruits, pastries (good), and fridge has all kinds of drinks you can grab (water, soda, alcohol ($)..etc)The hotel is also located right next to the 16th street mall so if you go uptown or downtown, you can choose to walk along the mall area, take the free bus going up and down the mall area or rent a bike using the bike dock right at the hotel entrance. The only down side is the elevators, even though they have like 6 or 8 of them, i dont think all are activated. The wait could be a little annoying at timesWe also used the valet service, a little mix up on tickets like 2 times during our stay (different ticket was registered to the system so even we called ahead of time, they couldn't find our car)",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful Hotel,"I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our two night stay here for a recent Rockies/St. Louis Cardinals game.  All the staff was super.  Our room and the entire property were clean and nicely decorated.  We had an executive level room and the included breakfast was wonderful (with a very hard working, friendly lady in charge).  This is absolutely where I would stay for my next trip to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Really nice, but no cleaning","I thought the front desk staff was very helpful. My room was clean and newly remodeled. The shower was spacious and had great water pressure. My bed was super comfortable. Our group enjoyed drinks in the bar in the lower level which were delicious. I had the blueberry lemonade and it was great. My only issue was I was out of my room from 6:30 am until 3:00pm and no one came to make the bed, exchange towels. I am perfectly fine with reusing my towels and making my own bed, I just thought it was odd. A nice hotel close to all the action. We walked about 18 blocks to Coors Stadium for a Rockies game. Very fun.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,great hotel,our room was very nice and the staff was more then accomidating.  They had a car service that was free and would take you anyhere you needed to go in a three mile radious of the hotel.  We did tip ther driver though. Food at ther hotel was a little pricy but good. Bartenders was very sweet.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beautiful Hotel,"My wife and I were in town for a show at Red Rocks. This hotel was beautiful and clean. Hotel staff were friendly and attentive to our needs. The room was very spacious and comfortable. The bed was extremely comfortable. Business or pleasure, this is a solid hotel choice in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great staff, Great location, Great hotel","We had a fabulous 3 day weekend here at the Hilton Denver City Center.  It is perfectly located several block from everything and a staff that is attentive and wonderful.  Our room was beautiful and very clean with a great lightly, lots of plugs (you can never find enough plugs for phones and computers), lovely sitting area, and the executive lounge is well worth it.  Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent choice for business and/or Pleasure,"We had a great one night stay. Although this is an excellent choice for business travel, we were there for pleasure. Everyone (front desk, conceirge, valet) that we came in contact with was very, very friendly and seemed happy to be working there. We only accessed the Starbucks. Walking distance to so many restaurants, Convention Center, a Target, and mall. Appreciated water upon arrival and orange infused afternoon lobby water. Quiet night stay, comfy beds. After reviewing many other hotels in Denver- room was best selection for a double queen room. Only negative, I am used to paying $$ for valets in cities, but $49 a night is a little steep. This hotel feels very safe.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great newly renovated rooms and nice executive lounge,"Stayed here for two nights on business and got a huge newly renovated 1 King Premium room on the 8th floor. As you can see on the attached pics, it’s in warm wooden colors with a lot of local style elements like sliced tree layers on the walls. The executive lounge does a have nice evening and breakfast spread, which is way above the US lounge standard. The staff is very polite, attentive and goes into charming smalltalk.Thank you for this nice stay,Dankeschön",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice place,"This Hilton had very friendly staff from the front desk to the bar to the valet. They had water for guests outside at the valet which we appreciated on the hot weekend we visited. There is a lemon scent as you enter the hotel which was nice initially, but seemed too strong by the second day. The bar downstairs was nice but a little pricey. The room was clean. The bathroom was nice but the sliding door had a glass front which allowed the room to be lit up at night if someone had to use the restroom during the night. We also did not have enough towels (3 for four people) in a two bed room. Overall, the hotel was pleasant and the location was good for us to walk around the area to LoDo and Coors Field area. There is also a Starbucks near the lobby.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Needs to pay attention to details,The change from Marriott to Hilton has improved the property but they need to pay attention to details. Twice our Club Level room cards have not been programmed the first time to Club Lounge access. The TV channel srlection is sub-optimal. I could not even watch local Bronco game on their system. Their cable connection cuts ot intermittently in the evening. The hotel is busy and it is insulting that they do not offer Club Lounge services Friday and Saturday evenings.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location,"I recently had a horrible experience with another hotel chain so I was very nervous walking into my room with past weekend. I had no reason to despair, Hilton knows how to treat a customer. The check-in was a little confusing because I booked through Hotels.com but the hotel clerk made sure I wouldn't have to change rooms since the booking was done in stages. The room was amazing and the view of downtown Denver was very nice even though I was only on the 6th floor. The clerk offered great conversation while he set my room up (very friendly) and suggested places to visit. The hotel restaurant was a little pricey but they were very generous in their wine pours.The only issue I had was scheduling my room to be cleaned. They forgot one day and the next day I had to call and request it. Not sure if this was my fault or not but wasn't a big deal. The final issue was finding the light switch to turn off the light at the bottom of the bed. They need a full on map for slow people like myself. Great room and great service, highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Room for improvement ,"I stay at Hilton hotels all over the world and do so because I appreciate the reliable high quality. While this updated hotel has a modern and comfortable look and feel, is clean and the front desk staff were friendly, there is room for improvement.  I was shocked that the Executive Club charges $10 for a glass of wine ( I've never seen that, anywhere) and offered one red, and one white. Forget it. I went to the odd sports bar restaurant in the basement and was pleasantly surprised by creative healthy food choices, fantastic.  Service was friendly but not terribly attentive. Back to the room, and despite turning the excessively loud air conditioning off, it made a loud humm all night, which made sleeping impossible even with ear plugs.  They must have known this was an issue because they give you a pack of earplugs on the nightstand, it would be nicer if they fixed the system. In the morning I attempted to shower in the ridiculously narrow (24"" wide) shower, I am not a big person but found it very difficult to move. Why in the world did the remodel result in such a skinny shower? So the bathroom could have a trendy barn door entry. Silly.  Who knows what a larger person can do besides stand there. Maybe all rooms don't have broken air cons and RV sized showers, and since not everyone goes to the Exec Club, this hotel might be ok, just was not for my visit.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great service,Excellent hotel. Booked on hotwire for a great deal. All staff were exceptional. Enjoyed talking with Ben and Craig at the front desk. Would definately visit again. Wonderful car service within 2 mile radius.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel,We stayed here for one night for a Rockies game. The hotel is nice and located close to the ballpark. My only problem was the very pushy bellhop girl. I understand hotel policies but she started grabbing our luggage and stuff before we had a chance to decide what we wanted. Then parking is a huge concern if you don’t want to pay $50 for valet. There are garages all around but it was dark and being a woman I didn’t like the walk back alone. Check this out thoroughly before traveling with kids.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver or Bust,"Craig and Kyle are da men!  He continually checked on how my stay was going.  Clean Room, excellent and friendly staff, great advice on what to do (and what not to do) from everyone I talk to.  Nathaniel was a bartender beast on top of his game.   Close to everything downtown.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Outstanding hotel with comfortable beds.,The Hilton City Center is a fabulous hotel situated within a good central location. The hotel staff was professional and courteous. The rooms were clean and spacious. It was nice of the staff to offer a late check-out so that we could catch up on sleep before our late flight back home. We enjoyed exploring Denver while on vacation and would stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing Vacation stay,"We stayed at the Hilton !!City Center from July 27-August 1st. They were amazing. The rooms were clean and comfortable with plenty of room to spread out. The hotel bar was very nice, and we really enjoyed the pool and fitness room. However, the staff is what made this stay so amazing. They were very friendly and helpful when we asked questions about local places to visit or eat. Although the shuttle had shut down due to construction, they opened it back up for us because we had so much luggage. We loved Denver and when we come back we will definitely stay at this Hilton again. Thank you to all the staff who made our trip so enjoyable",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Our team won't be staying here again,"We stayed at the Sheraton last year and had a flawless experience. The biggest problem with the Hilton is you can reserve rooms on the company credit card for a massive team, but when they check in, everyone had to put down personal cards and WERE CHARGED for the ENTIRE length of stay. ($2,000 each - one poor girl went over her credit limit by $650 so we had to help cover her until the Hilton removed the hold on her card - which took 5 days!). At the Sheraton? You put down a card for incidentals, but the card used to reserve the room is charged in full for the stay. That's how it SHOULD be but the Hilton system can't handle it, so we won't stay with them again.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great service ,I stayed for a large work conference.   The Hilton Denver City Center was amazing for it!  They seemed most accommodating and it was a great place for a group of a couple thousand people.  Bar food and service at the bar was good.  They were very friendly.  Hotel check in really stood out to me and the group.   Krista was super friendly at check in and even sent a follow up text after checking in to see how everything was.  I received another text a couple days later checking in again!  I thought that was beyond excellent customer service.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location,"Comfy bed and a super delish executive breakfast.  Great location for our families 1st Colorado Rockies game. The weight room was updated, and I was able to enjoy my morning  yoga while my boys swam. We will visit again!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Worst Valet Experience EVER ,"When I arrived, the valet “allowed” me to get my 50 lb out of the rental car and told me cheerfully that parking would be $49. I guess that is why they don’t care AT ALL about service.  They handed me a claim check and told me very emphatically to text the last three numbers to the phone number on the check 15 minutes before I needed my car this morning. I did and I got a message back telling me the system wasn’t working. I went downstairs and no valet. Finally tracked one down and the man was so rude, he drove past me and snatched my key away when I reached for it, screaming that he needed to verify basically that I wasn’t stealing the car. Then I had to lift my suitcase again and I finally told him how rude he’d been. He shouted at me abusively.  On the drive at the entrance to the hotel. Shocking and such poor service. Decent enough hotel but I travel all over the world and this was the worst customer service experience at. Hilton ever.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Pretty good,I spent 5 nights at this hotel this month. I was quite impressed by how friendly and helpful  the staff at check-in. I liked my room and the amenities. I LOVE that there is a full service Starbucks in the hotel but there is another full service Starbucks right across the street. It is somewhat close to the convention center but it's a 15 minute walk. There is so much to do downtown and easily walkable!,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Poor experience,"Had a fast talking guy check me in, misrepresented add-on services, refrigerator smelled, wasn't working,it was fixed, most of the staff was professional & friendly, one or two staff who didn't know what they were doing & one who just plain lied to me. Too bad,great location.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent Dowtown Location,"Straightforward, clean, friendly and comfortable. Just the right location for our weekender. I will definitely book this hotel again for short stays in Denver. Easy access to everything we go to Denver to do.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good business value and great location,"I enjoyed the city and location of this hotel.  For the value, it is very well put together.  As a diamond member I wasn’t overly impressed by the lack of recognition which would seem to be a training issue.   I do recommend this hotel though as the cleanliness, amenities, executive lounge and gym were excellent.  The staff were very friendly outside of the check in process.   I was given 1k Hilton points to make up for the shortcomings at check in.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel with great amenities,"This is my first time to this Hilton and it has been great so far.  Check in was quick and easy, the rooms are nice and there is a spacious hotel lobby bar/restaurant with great service.There are a number of places to eat within walking distance and the convention center is about an eight minute walk.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Papa's review,Great service at check in and the valet team was outstanding in explaining the options regarding parking in a very busy city with a major convention in town. Everyone of the hotel staff was on point with friendly service!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel great location for business meetings,We stayed here for a business conference.  It was close to the conference and the hotel was nice. There was a kiosk with coffee and snacks on the ground floor. The staff was friendly and accommodating.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good option,"The hotel is located in a good location just a block and a half from the 16th Street Mall.  The hotel itself is in the bottom part of a large office block with a Starbucks in the lobby. Reception is modern but my hotel room was quite old although it did have a renovated bathroom. A welcome pack of water was provided on arrival as a Hilton member.  The room was an ok size with a safe, fridge and coffee making facilities. There was a large TV, and wifi was free and decent speed. The bed was comfortable and the noise level from the street fairly minimal. There is a guest laundry but no washing powder was available for purchase which was frustrating.  Breakfast was an additional charge so I ate elsewhere.  Valet parking was $45/day. The room rate was reasonable so this hotel is worth considering.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Rude parking attendants. No one will talk to you to clarify bill. “Leave a message”,Got to hotel stopped to get instructions got yelled at that I can not park there. Told attendant that I have never been there and was told move your car before I can talk to you. Was told valet parking $50 per day and three cars in front of you. Was directed to public parking ramp. There was vomit in front of elevators and not cleaned up Jul 12 2018. The receipt given was different than amount charged on credit card but can not talk to anyone all you can do is leave a message and they “will get back to you”  The front desk was very friendly and helpful but this is not a four star hotel by any means.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place to stay,"We had a 4 night stay at this hotel, from the moment we arrived the staff were great at the front desk, bell boys great and other concierge staff have all been great, helpful and nothing to much of a problem. They have a free shuttle car service for 2 mile tripshich was great and handle to get dripped off and pick up again when needed. This is free first come first serve thing.  Down stairs bar and breakfast room was also great and again excellent service. Place is very modern and nice decore, our room we had I. The18 floor was nice clean and again modern and we'll appointed. Same as bath room all very nice. My only complaint would be that the rooms are a little on the small side as is the bathroom. They are are the smaller side sizes. Our room had two double beds in it for our party of 3. The double beds are to small, now I am used of a king bed at home, so we fousn the double bed to small. At least queens would be lot better and would have thought in with moat modern day beding. This is a personal choice I guess. The beds were however very comfy, excellent linen and pillows though. The free drinks in the lobby especially the lemon iced drink was a real winner for us when returning to the hotel and releif from the heat outside.The staff here we found the be super helpful, friendly and if excellent standard.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Flying solo,I felt very safe staying here on my own. I had a large room with a fantastic central location. The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly. Good pool and gym facilities. Definitely recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, but over priced","I took my son and his GF to Denver and stayed at this Hilton for 3 nights. It was clean, staff was OK, but definitely not worth the price paid. Their “car” was in the shop, so we had to UBER. The breakfast was definitely not worth the $, save your money and eat out-much cheaper and better food.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not all it was cracked up to be,"Staff overall was very nice and the hotel was very clean. Personally felt it was too pricey for the amenities given. Breakfast is not included, you can either pay $23 per person for the continental breakfast or order off the room service menu. No happy hour at this hotel, although many others in the area offer this. The room does not have a microwave. There are only about 30 channels on the tv, and multiple of them freeze constantly while watching it. Housekeeping interrupted us on two evenings, one at 5:00 pm and the other at 6:30 pm. I am not sure why they were coming to clean the room at that time? They also seemed uncertain. Pool is nothing to write home about, and no hot tub available.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business/Pleasure Trip,"We stayed at the HDCC for 4 nights on a bi-annual business trip for my husband's company.  Overall, this is a very nice, well-kept hotel! The decor is gorgeous; modern, updated with a very cool midwestern vibe.  Great location, just 2 blocks from the 16th street mall, walking distance to a lot of the popular restaurants. Starbucks just off the lobby.  Good workout facility, my husband swam in the heated pool a couple mornings.Check-in: easy. We arrived around 8:30am and our check-in wasn't technically until 3pm.  They held our luggage while we went to get breakfast.  We were notified by text not an hour later that our room was ready, which was great considering how tired we were!Room: very clean, felt and looked like it had never been stayed in. Pretty, although we sadly did not have much of a view.  Bed and pillows were very comfortable, slept great at night.  There is a city train and bus car that runs right down below the hotel, and you can hear the dinging at all hours; thankfully, they provide earplugs for this.   Plenty of storage, good complimentary coffee.  Nice, clean bathroom; had hot water each night, great mirror lighting. Housekeeping: They came daily, and did a good job. They were very kind, would happily greet us in the hall.  I needed extra towels one night and asked the housekeeper in the hall.  She folded them very nicely with a smile before handing them to me, which I thought was sweet.  On our last day we found some things left undone.  For instance, trashcan liners were not replaced, but draped on or left beside the can.  Two pillowcases were left on top one of the tables where I had some jewelry laid out, whether they were clean or dirty I have no clue.  My straightener somehow ended up on the bathroom floor.  Not a big deal, just found it a little odd.For the business aspect of the trip, most of my husband's meetings were on the lower lower level, which was nice, because it was obviously set apart for any conferences or business groups staying there.  They hosted a couple meals and a cocktail hour on different occasions.  I have a gluten allergy, so I have to be very careful about buffet lines.  The meal lines all had labeling, but the cocktail hour did not. The servers were not knowledgable of which foods contained allergens but did go back and ask the chefs for me. Overall we had a great experience and would stay here again if in town!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beautiful Hotel,"Newly renovated former Marriott. Centrally located in the heart of Denver exactly where we wanted to be. Nice extra touches like texts from the front desk checking if everything was okay, sunscreen dispenser and cold towels in the lobby, and iced water at various places for your convenience. All modern amenities and decor. Would definitely return.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very nice hotel,"I attended a conference in this hotel. It was nice and clean. Although there was no conference wifi initially, the hotel provided a wifi network after some outcry. The food provided was also very nice, and generous.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Lovely hotel in downtown area ,"Very modern and welcoming arrival. We had a king room on an executive floor. The room was very spacious with a comfortable seating area by the window. Lovely bathroom with large walk in shower. We opted for bonus Hilton Honours points so our room wasn’t serviced during our two night stay but they were happy to bring us coffee and anything else we needed replenished, a very speedy service. We also had use of the executive lounge with our room, so had soft drinks (there is an honesty bar for beer/wine) and a selection of snacks between 5.30pm and 10pm. We stayed Thur/Fri and for some reason the lounge is closed on Fri/Sat evenings, which was disappointing. We also had complimentary breakfast there both mornings, which was perfectly adequate though extremely busy, which makes it harder to understand why the lounge isn’t open 7 evenings. Overall, a great stay.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Clean room,I stayed here for a conference the room was very clean and the service was wonderful.  The location is perfect you can walk to anything.  The only complaint is there is no shuttle service from the air port.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Park Elsewhere,"A clean and pleasant hotel with decent amenities, average service and a convenient location in downtown Denver.  Rooms are a little on the small side, with a shower and no tub, but decor is fresh and contemporary. Wifi is acceptable. Lobby includes a bar, Starbucks and restaurant (which I admittedly did not patronize). Parking (which is all valet), however, is excessively expensive at $50 a night. Find another garage nearby and you are better off. This skewed the value proposition for me quite a bit, as the rate was on the high side.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A+++ Experience,"My fiancee and I stayed at the Hilton City Center Denver to celebrate our recent engagement. Rich went above and beyond making our stay remarkable and one that we will never forget.  Rich - thank you again for all you efforts in making our stay one we will never forget. I was already a loyal Hilton Diamond Member, but this sort of experience solidifies my continued loyalty.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Mid city new modern hotel,"A newer hotel mid city convenient to the 16th st mall and walking distance to LoDo, writers walk civic center park Coors field.Valet parking is an **astonishing** $50 per night!!! Wow... lots adjacent and near hotel are around $10-$15 so this seems a bit egregious- one star off for this.Quick early check in - but a small snafu - a family keyed into our room about 15 minutes after we arrived!!! Credit to the front desk for fixing the situation but still...Well appointed room with great beds, good climate control and wonderful shower pressure.Lobby is spacious and comfortable.  In house restaurant and bar provided quick friendly service.Gym was modern and clean - indoor pool was small but well kept.  Locker room and shower in the gym area but no steam room or sauna.Friendly staff - clean and well kept property.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wife tags along for hubby’s conference ,"Husband was attending a conference, so I had the days to enjoy this hotel’s great location, gym, happy hour, and services such as helpful valets and front desk staff as well as friendly drivers for their bonus of local shuttle service to restaurants. Great lobby and restaurant ambiance and attention to detail in the rooms included ear plugs if the train was bothersome (which I never heard, and I’m a light sleeper). Notable to me during the stay: good shower pressure, tons of outlets for charging everything and generous sized king room. Loved the Hilton Honors executive lounge breakfast for club members starting at gold level. Definitely recommend - cafe station was nice plus many healthy options. Always had a water bottle-very important there. Great view too.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location,"Safe, downtown location. Nice bar and perfect for walking to entertainment. We also ordered room service and the quality of food was outstanding. I will totally stay here on our next girls night out! Awesome!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,First time in Denver,"This was a great experience based upon location, cleanliness of the hotel, the professionalism of the staff, and the helpfulness of the staff.  One change i would recommend: the room service menu is too limited, and I would have liked it to reflect the restaurant's choices.  As a result, I ended up going to the restaurant in order to get what I wanted after a long day of meetings.  I would have preferred to simply remain in my room.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel!,"This is a great location for everything downtown in Denver. Right near Brown Palace, a mile from Coors Field and right near 16th street mall. You have everything you could want right there! Would definitely stay again if I had the points and the price were right.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Marriott to Hilton a Work in Progress?,"First, from the concierge Rich Zaccagna (any hotel would be lucky to have him) to the front office, Lynzy Daryl & Michael to Jennifer & Dustin at the Prospect bar, you will not find a more professional, caring, dedicated staff. So why only 3 stars?  In a word – Housekeeping. We checked in using the new “Digital Key” in the Hilton app in response to an email. The earliest you can request for check -in was 3pm. On a weekend when the hotel was not at capacity we expected to be accommodated but were not. Ok wait until 4 pm – no our room was not ready until 4:56 pm. When we entered I noticed the duvet on the bed was spotted with an unknown dark substance. The Hilton brand should mean, at an absolute minimum a clean room. We went to the lobby to complain and that is when Rich stepped up. He took us aside, apologized profusely, gave us 15 minutes of his time telling us about all the best places to see on our visit and gave us 2 free drink coupons and a free appetizer coupon. In my 40+ years traveling I have never encountered a concierge step into the breach like that. Most stay in their own lane. After all this was a service issue. Rich took what could have been a customer on the edge and totally diffused the situation. He placed us right back into that positive vibration one hopes for when starting a vacation. We also learned that about 6 months ago this hotel changed over from a Marriott to a Hilton and they were having some transitional issues.We left with an assurance the bedding would be replaced and went out on the town. We returned at 10:30 pm ready to retire for the night only to find the bedding had not been changed. Daryl came right up and took full responsibility. Apparently, he had service change out the bedding in 1606 and we were in 1506. He had housekeeping come right up and offered us extra Hilton Honors points for the inconvenience. Ok everyone makes a mistake (or 2) – forgive and forget right? Well located, recently renovated, could still garner 4 to 5 stars.Well the next morning before we left the hotel around 9:30 am we called housekeeping to let them know we were leaving and would like the room serviced. On vacation we like to come back to the hotel in the afternoon to a clean room for a siesta before we go out in the evening. When we returned to the Hilton at 1:30 pm we decided to stop by the bar and cash in on our free drinks. Jennifer was outstanding and so were the wings. To bad the restaurant/bar is below ground. At street level it could easily double or even triple the revenue. Anyway, when we went to the room at 2 pm … you guessed it – the room was not serviced. Down to the lobby we went. Rich was there with more free drinks and assurances the room would be serviced immediately. Back to the bar for another round of drinks. Back to the room around 2:45 pm and drum roll please—still no service. By this point enough is enough. Rich offered yet more free drink coupons (we learned this is a frequently used giveaway as the hotel has many service issues) which I refused since my wife wanted to rest not drink. Rich did ask how Hilton could make it up to us. After some thought I said that they should offer to comp us for a weekend in the future once they got there act together and could show us what good service looked like. Rich sent up some prosecco with a note Michael sent up some snacks with a note and they did give us 10,000 extra points (20% of the 50,000 we would need for 1 free night).For over 40 years I have primarily used Hilton’s & Marriott’s interchangeably for my business and pleasure traveling needs and thought of them as worthy competitors. Over the last 5-10 years we have found ourselves using Hilton less and less. It now appears the clear winner is Marriott.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Having an excellent customer service experience,"I had thought our family would do well with a suite rather than adjoining words, but ultimately, we needed more space and privacy to rest well. The staff was so understanding and accommodating, and they exceeded our expectations at every turn. Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton Denver City Center - better when it was a Marriott,"This Hilton was better when it was a Marriott.  The hotel room, at least ours, was not the best.  It was a new design Marriott started when we originally booked our event in this hotel.  The toilet paper holder was barely on the wall and barely held the roll. The toilet leaked and didn't flush well.  The room overall was over used and ragged.  Our room had a loud, vibrating a/c system that would not cool the room.  It was 97 degrees during our stay but I would expect the room to be cooler.  We had requested additional hangers since we were there for 9 days for our conference with lots of dress clothes.  It took 3 days and additional requests and finally housekeeping got us hangers after leaving a note and $10.  We tipped daily and asked to get more towels.  Our last day we missed housekeeping all together. The bed was comfortable except for the heavy duvet cover on it. Overall our event went well but the rooms were not the best.  The important thing was our customers and vendor partners didn't complain much and our meeting was a huge success.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Military Friendly!,"Upon arrival I couldn’t help but notice all the Gay Pride flags - it was Pride Week! Sadly I noticed the US flag, it was displayed incorrectly outside the building, torn and grey. The hotel is in impeccable condition, and the valet parking system runs so smoothly in such a bustling area. We dined in the hotel restaurant that evening, the salad menu was fantastic, and Rachel took excellent care of us. Distracted, I failed to mention the US flag situation, but remembered when the hotel staff reached out, to check on us, the next day. We were off the property when they texted us and we suggested they address the condition of the US flag, especially since they were hosting an Army event that evening. Pleased to report it was corrected with a brand new flag and correctly displayed upon our return. As a retired military veteran, I was happy we were staying at a Hilton property that was concerned about respecting the flag of our country as much as the flag of the gay community.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Central Location,"Great downtown location, close to 16th street and many transportation options(bike, train, bus, free shuttle). Check-in was a little slow and there is no parking or shuttle from airport. Overall great stay.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Anniversary trip,My wife and I chose Colorado for our 30th anniversary trip. Denver was our 1st stop. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. My wife and I had a nicely appointed room and the breakfast in the Executive Lounge was great! We will definitely stay here again whenever we visit Denver!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Worth a Stay,"Good location in downtown Denver, easy walk to  almost anywhere including Coors Field. Clean lobby with very helpful staff. Room was updated, large and very modern. Restaurant and lounge on lower level was well staffed and food was very good.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Pleasant stay,It meets the standard of the Hilton hotels. Great service at the front desk. Quite clean. Comfortable furniture to sit and work in your room. No problems with the internet connection. Cleaning ladies there are all stars!,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel in downtown Denver!,"The service was excellent, room was very spacious, nice amenities, close proximity to downtown Denver. Can't think of anything wrong with the experience. I've stayed in a number of hotels in downtown Denver and would recommend this one over most others in the downtown area.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good business hotel,"I stayed here in April for a conference.  Checks all the boxes for a business stay --- clean, responsive, good location.  They could use more common areas to have conversations.  I would used it again when in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great value and great location,The Hilton Downtown Denver was as expected - top notch all the way. Every detail was handled from clean room to friendly staff and everything in between. Concierge provided complimentary ride to Enterprise car rental to top it off!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Average stay in large, busy hotel","The online information said this hotel had recently been upgraded and redone. It appeared to be so.  It's a big hotel in the business area of the city.  Service is adequate; staff is professional.  There's not much to distinguish this hotel from its competitors, but if the price is right -- and it was for me -- this is an adequate place to stay. Next time, though, I wouldn't stay in the business area as absent the Mall, which is a one-time experience, there's not much going on at night, and very few choices for nicer restaurants except those at Union Station.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,CENTRAL LOCATION,"This hotel was rebranded from a Marriott property in December 2017 and is located two blocks from the 16th Street pedestrian mall. It's in excellent condition with a staff to match.I stayed in a queen double room on the 14th floor. The elevators are very efficient and wait times are short. They require a room key to activate when entering. I found the room lighting and storage to be barely sufficient. The bathroom is nice with adequate horizontal storage. The room had a small refer and two-cup coffee maker. ""free"" room WiFi speed was acceptable to check emails, streaming would probably be a challenge.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent Choice,"Located in the main downtown area of Denver, this hotel is an excellent choice.  As a HH Diamond, the executive lounge was well stocked and promptly serviced.  Exercise facility was also quite good.  Staff were good.  Overall, would stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Very nice Hilton, conveniently located.","This is a nice Hilton.  As a loyal HHonors member I always consider added value of Gold membership.  This property did not disappoint. I was given a room on the 18th floor and access to the Executive Lounge.  The breakfast was very good with access to fresh brewed coffee options.  The evening reception was just ok.  I was also given a late check out with no fuss.  The rooms were clean and comfortable, but not very large.  Conference facilities were good.  I love public transportation and enjoyed ease of access using the light rail from the airport and catching the 16th street shuttle for a drop off a block and a half away.  The pool was small, but adequate.  I would plan to stay here again the next time I return to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hilton City Center,"Very clean, nice hotel, great, friendly staff.  Had no issues or problems during my stay.  Stayed for a conference, the facilities were clean and convenient.  Would be happy to stay at this hotel again when back in Denver",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Hotel/Good Location,"Hilton is a nice brand. I think other hotels at the same price point offer a better value. It is very easy to get around near the 16th Street Mall and many restaurants are right next to the location.  I would not recommend the valet parking @ $49, much more afforadable parking is within easy walking distance",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good choice for baseball fans & travelers to Denver,"If you’re coming for a game, and looking for location, location, location, you can’t beat the Hilton for value. Sure, it’s big, busy and can get crowded. But the rooms are quiet, comfortable and well appointed. We stayed on the Executive level — got a deal — and had breakfast each morning in the lounge. If the deal is on offer, take it. Breakfast offers big choices and setting offers amazing views of skyline. Close to the 16th Mall, walking distance to downtown attractions.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,GREAT stay! OUTSTANDING service!!,"Here for a three day/two night conference...  beautiful, clean hotel!  A special kudos to Ben at the Check-In desk.  My reservation was to be made for me by the meeting organizer of the conference I was speaking at.  By mistake, I was left off the group reservation... but not to worry; Ben quickly worked with a manager to get me into a room and into the group reservation.  He handled this oversight seamlessly and professionally, even with a line of guests behind me waiting impatiently to check in.  A few hours later as I was walking back through the lobby, he recognized me and greeted me by name.  Ben’s name badge indicated “in training “, but you wouldn’t have known it... he is a definite asset to this hotel!  In fact, all of the staff here seem cheerful and helpful.  Normally, I choose Hyatt or Marriott properties... but I’ve been so pleased by the Hilton Denver City Center.  I’ll be back!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very chic hotel downtown,"This hotel was conveniently located downtown, walking distance to everything. The rooms were modern and chic, and you couldn’t hear your neighbors or people in the hallway. The executive lounge was also very nice.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Continually raises the standard! ,"The highlight for this hotel is service. The outstanding level of service the staff provides has raised the benchmark. This place is spotless! A European level of design and precision along with the traditional American mix of comfort and functionality. These ingredients do well to complement the Denver City atmosphere. Business or leisure, you'll be more than satisfied.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Location was nice.,"This hotel is located downtown which is super nice for walking and exploring. The rooms were nice, staff were friendly, and they had a nice pool with a beautiful exercise room. The exercise room with the view of the pool saved this review because I could see my kids while i worked out. They do have valet parking for about $50/night which was nice. Now, to the issues. The breakfast was an absolute nightmare on the 15th floor. The place was disgusting. Empty plates and food everywhere. We had to clear a table ourselves. The food was almost empty when we got there. We were traveling with 3 kids under the age of 12 so breakfast is important. It was such a hassle we decided to eat out the rest of the stay. The shower in our room was tiny. I'm a big dude, 6'5"" and 325lbs, and it was not wide enough for my shoulders and I kept bumping into the glass doors. My biggest issue was clearly breakfast but figured I'd get it out there.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Charged to receive correspondence without notice. Poor breakfast at lounge,"I was charged to receive correspondence, I was not aware of such policy because hotel has an arrangement with an in-house ups store.  Client should not be charged for hotel private dealings. Breakfast at executive lounge was poor. Apparently not all elevators were working, long lines to go up and waits to go down.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice stay,"Arrived well before the check in time and they were kind enough to get us set up with a room.  I also had trouble reaching a restaurant to change a reservation and the front desk was helpful in assisting to get it sorted out.  All in all a great stay - the hotel is in a central location, in walking distance to a good selection of shops and restaurants.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Stay at the Hilton Denver City Center,Was in town for IPW conference.  Hilton was my home away from home this week and their staff and the quality of service they presented was top notch!  Very close to the Convention Center...walking distance.  Would definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very nice hotel,We stayed here for a couple nights while in town for a graduation.  It was exceptionally clean and fairly convenient.  From the Union Station one can take the free 16th Street bus and get off at California then walk about 2 blocks to the hotel.  We did not want to have a car since the parking is so terribly expensive.  Our room was quite nice and seemed roomy enough for a weekend.  I love having a Starbucks in the lobby!!  We liked staying here.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Really nice,"Easily one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at..the bathroom had some sort of fancy lighting behind the mirror.. No microwave but it did have a mini fridge.. The employees were very friendly. No parking on site, I paid $7 diagonal to the hotel and had to be gone by 9am. Starbucks around the corner from the lobby is convenient.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Outstanding Service!,"I received outstanding service from Matthew Anderson's team at the Hilton Denver City Center throughout my recent stay at the property.  In particular, both Lynzy at the front desk and the gentleman who drove me to Union Station in the hotel's Cadillac Escalade ""shuttle"" provided exemplary customer service! The Executive Lounge on the 17th Floor was well-stocked, well-staffed and provided a nice view of downtown during breakfast.      I look forward to my next stay in Denver, and a return visit to this Hilton property.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Trip to Denver,My daughter and I traveled to Denver to spend a few days in the mile high City!  Dined with friends; ate at good restaurants and drove to Georgetown for a bit of history. It was great to be back in Denver and we enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Denver City Center where the staff was extremely friendly and so helpful.  They made us feel very welcome!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Large comfortable room, reasonable breakfast","Check in was quick and the staff member pleasant but they didn't tell me about any of the hotel facilities.  It wasn't particularly busy so this seemed like a bit of an oversight.  As a result, I don't know to this day whether the hotel had a gym or pool or even a bar.  I found breakfast in the morning by just following the crowd (it's down the elevator from reception) but it left a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth to be stumbling around trying to work out where things were.  Breakfast buffet was pleasant enough and the waitress was exceptionally attentive.  Room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable indeed.  All in all, a good stay which could have been graded excellent with a little attention to detail.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Perfect Days in Denver,"Perfect place to stay very central in Denver. Great breakfast in the Executive Lounge and I love the view early in the mornings. The inside pool is my highlight, warm, clean and you see the sky - the best start in the day!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,LOVED EVERY MINUTE!,"From the minute I stepped out of the car I was greeted by Hilton staff that wanted to help. The check in process was the BEST I have ever had. Ask for Lynzy. The rooms were nice, the food was excellent. Everyone cares about your quest experience at this hotel!!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beautiful views,Denver is beautiful and the hilton for city center was the center of the city. It was perfect location for the Rockies game. The room was large and comfortable. The bedding was comfortable and clean. I would stay here everytime.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Dissatisfied with treatment during stay,"I stayed at the Hilton for a co-worker's wedding. We thought the rooms blocked we're going to be beneficial, and we were sort of right; the room is beautiful, big windows, central location in the city, close proximity to stores and public transit, but the staff is condescending and unhelpful (excluding valet and cleaning staff). They wanted to upsell me on the complimentary breakfast that other wedding guests were provided, and charge a $49 daily valet fee. Bathrooms are not private, nor are they ventilated. We wanted a printed checkout copy, and they were unable to provide after promising. I am less than satisfied.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Clean rooms, good staff","Stayed at the property since it was located fairly close to a conference I was attending.  Room was clean and staff was very attentive during my stay.  TV was my only minor issue, it must have been a dish service since the picture and sound went out constantly.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent stay,"I stayed here for business the week of April 30th-May 4, 2018.  The hotel was fabulous and will be my hotel of choice during visits to Denver.  The gym is outstanding and the hotel staff was exceptional.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Aptly named hotel that is beautiful, clean, modern, and roomy","Hilton Denver City Center is aptly named as it is located in the heart of Denver Colorado. This hotel is beautifully modern in every nook and cranny, including my room, which in my opinion is the most important part of any hotel.The check-in process was flawless and manned by friendly people. The texting arrangement was nice.I appreciated the modern fixtures in the bathrooms with the shower head giving out plenty of hot water on command. The shower doors thick and heavy, made of quality glass, and the sink area nicely put together.The furniture and decorations in the room were modern, yet homey. Everything was super clean and attractive. The bed comfy, the desk workable. The TV and remote worked intuitively and the iron and ironing board were sufficient.I ate at the restaurant at the bottom of the escalator and found the setting to be quite beautiful and comfy - I set next to the fireplace and appreciate that location since it was cold and raining outside. The food was decent and the service, impeccable. Some minor things less than perfect:I wish there were more AC/DC plugs in the desk area. There was only one plug outlet. So, my laptop got that one and I was forced to plug my phone into one on a remote nightstand.Interactive map in the lobby that was supposed to be a concierge service that could recommend places to eat and show me a map of its location: it didn't work. The elevator acted up more than once, going up when it was pointing down and one time it frustrated a dapper looking gentleman I happened to be with to curse under his breath. (You had to be there - it was funny.)All in all this hotel is modern, beautiful, clean, well-managed and located right in the middle of everything. You could certainly do worse than staying at the Hilton Denver City Center, especially if you are a business traveler like me.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Awesome hotel, Awesome staff","We were assigned to the only room without an updated card reader, so the cards issued to us didn't work. We called the front desk ,so we didn't have to haul our luggage back down, and they promptly issued us different cards appropriate for our door and gave us a complimentary grande beverage at Starbucks! All of the staff was extremely helpful. The restaurant down stairs is top notch, and the room and location were both perfect. You're only a block or two away from 16th street mall. Highly recommended",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Location and Gym!,"My regular readers will know I usually rank a place by gym and internet. This place is a winner. The gym is large, and while not a GOLD'S (TM) it is more than adequate with no fewer than a dozen cardio machines, dumbbells to 75#, and enough machines to complete a workout. The internet (at least for HHonors members) has no limits, so I had both computers and both cell phones working. The location re: downtown Denver and the Convention Center is fine - a couple blocks walk, maybe, but who can't use that exercise. Lots of eateries within bow-shot, but don't neglect the hotel venue itself. The only unsettling thing: all the staff were very, very happy and friendly. In today's jaded world, doesn't seem right - always a smile and a greeting even on random connections, and helpful (saved me ten bucks on returning to the airport). I'd return in a heartbeat if my travels find me back in Denver. Oh - pet peeve avoided: the best shower seal I have seen in a long while - you know what I mean - leave the shower and have to put on a life preserver due to the flooding. This place was NOT that. Also, lots of plugs and USB charging positions. Note to Hotel - but a couple more by the desk.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,CMS/DITA conference,"The check in / check out process was quick and effortless. The room was clean, well organized, and comfortable. The locations of the amenities, such as rest rooms, conference rooms, ATM, etc. were very convenient.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Sleeping in a dungeon,I had to stay at this hotel due to a company event commitment.  All I can say is I hope you like the dark.  No natural light at all entered the room so for a 5 day stay it was less than ideal.  For five days I basically enjoyed the darkness of my room and then the darkness of the convention facilities - which are all in the basement in the dark.,2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hotel is good but you won’t sleep a wink ,"I’ll start by saying Hiltons are pretty good. I use them a lot and they’re reliable world over.This isn’t one of the best.  Sadly.Staff are great - let me get that out of the way, they really are good.Bar is good, food is pretty good, but there is no getting away from the fact that it’s a slightly tired old building.Yes the lifts are slow and generally awful, but you look past this.What I cannot tolerate is the appalling in-room air conditioning which roars like a pickup truck parked in the room with you.  You cannot turn it off or the room reaches silly hot temperatures.  When it’s on you get woken every 45 minutes all night when the pickup truck starts and runs....Seriously guys, the hotel is good, your service is bordering on excellent and I’d never stay here again because I’ve had the 4 worst nights sleep ever...I would never ever ever choose to stay in this hotel. I’m sorry, it’s that bad.  I just want to sleep and it’s impossible.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great bar on lower lever!,"Stayed for three days at this convenient Downtown location.  Room was nice.  The shower was excellent!  Unfortunately, housekeeping did not clean out coffee pod after last visitor - unpleasant - but the only ""downside"" of our visit.  The lower level bar served reasonably priced drinks and had a nice selection of appetizers.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,AWESOME!!,"Jonathan was great at check in, even got an upgrade! The executive floor is awesome, being that close to the breakfast was super handy.  Michael R. answered all of my questions any time I had one. Kelly found my jackets for me that were left when I had you hold my luggage for me when I went to lunch, which was very helpful not having to carry my luggage all over Denver!  Thor and Tory help me with luggage, so thank you!  And a huge shout out to Amair*?, valet service, who helped me find my car! My friend and myself had been looking for a while and finally I heard him telling me it was ""over here.""  He then also had me follow him out of that dang parking garage. Which was awesome. The hotel has amazing employees.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent conference hotel!,I am a Hilton Honors member but stayed at the hotel for a conference. I am very glad the conference was held in this hotel because it was in a good location and it is an excellent hotel. The hotel restaurant is quite good and I highly recommend the miso roasted cauliflower. Excellent!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,HIlton Downtown Luxury Convenient Location,Great downtown luxury hotel with free transports from train station and nearby spots.  Art museum is mostly under renovation for three years but there is an exhibit of Degas only held in Denver in the US.  Great location; expensive parking; don't bring a car if possible.  Terrific walk around location.  Great pool and exercise room.  Staff is welcoming and helpful.  Hilton honors members have a concierge lounge with snacks and good breakfast options.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing property!!,We stayed here for 2 nights in April. The staff was so friendly and attentive. They were happy to provide insight on fun things to do in Denver. The room was recently renovated and had great views of Denver. We were also delighted to find that there were several breweries within walking distance. We also loved the pool! We will be back!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hotel was ok,"I have stayed at a lot of Hilton’s.  Nothing about this hotel made me think wow this place is amazing. It’s a beautiful hotel. Rooms are clean. Upon arrival we were told we didn’t have a pull out couch, so I changed one of the rooms into two rooms, and it turned out they did have pull out couch. I didn’t get any vouchers for breakfast. It’s really not that big of a deal, just a nice perk. One of our rooms the shower didn’t even work. The rooms were very hot, I am  not sure if the ac was working.  We even called for help and they said it had to do with the outside temp? Never heard that before but it made us very uncomfortable.  I thought I was supposed to have executive level rooms, and for some reason we didn’t. Or if we did we were not told about them. The food at the restaurant was good, and one waitress in particular, Monica, was wonderful!!!!! This is a nice hotel from pictures, I prob won’t stay here again. I believe   there are better Hilton’s in downtown Denver.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A Denver Gem,"From the minute I arrived, they couldn’t have been more friendly. The front desk staff insisted on providing an upgrade to a suite that was both comfortable and luxurious. When I got on the elevator I ran into a couple of gentlemen who work for the hotel and asked how my stay was going and if there was anything they could do to help. Even though my room was on the third floor, it was very quiet as the windows were sufficient to protect from the noise from the street just below. I also appreciated the text message from the front desk manager just making sure that everything was OK with my room. I enjoyed a healthy breakfast on the 17th floor executive lounge, which was complete with a espresso/cappuccino machine, a perfect way for me to start my day. The lounge and restaurant below the lobby look nice although I didn’t get a chance to check out the food. Similarly I didn’t make it to the workout room. Or the pool. They do you have a hotel shuttle that will take you to a nearby place. Unfortunately it was booked when we needed it. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again at this centrally located Denver gem.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,decent value,"Very good location and helpful, accommodating staff. Room was on the smaller side, but that's OK if you do not plan to spend much time in the room. As to price, it was not over-priced expensive, but it certainly was not under-priced as well. About what you would expect from a downtown city hotel.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Best Bell Hop Ever!!!, Fabulous Service, Beautiful Hotel","Have you ever wondered if a real life, American bell hop could be in the Society of the Golden Keys, as portrayed in the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel?  Search no more.  Tom, at the Hilton City Denver, fills the bell hop role with absolute perfection.  I was at this hotel for a work conference in March, and Tom helped me and my colleagues, above and beyond the call of duty.  This type of meaningful connection makes a stay at a hotel especially memorable, and so many places miss the opportunity to connect to guests on this personal level.  That being said, all of the staff at the Hilton Denver City Center provided superb service, and Jason the bartender likewise merits mention, as he was exceptional in catering to guests and making their visit special.  The food was delicious, the hotel was in a great location, the rooms were very clean and comfortable, and I look forward to going back again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Exceptional ,"In Denver for conference and booked here as conference was being held here.The rooms are great - the bed and shower top notch.Food was always plentiful and of good quality - and reasonably priced. A special mention for concierge Richard - not sure what he gets paid - but it should be more - he is warm, knowledgeable, engaging and friendly.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very nice and accomdating ,"The staff was all very nice here and willing to help in any way .  They will give you a shuttle ride anywhere reasonably close .The lobby is pretty awesome multilevel with lots of places for people to sit, talk or just people watch. The downstairs bar is fully stocked and has multiple bartenders to take care of you .One downside the pool heater wasn't working.   The staff would shuttle us to the nearby embassy suites but wearing swim trucks around Denver in April isn't realistic either .  Also the card reader in the elevator wasn't working.   Nice to have that extra layer of protection in today's society",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business traveler paradise,"I stayed here for one evening while in Denver on business. I got a very good rate of $185/night on the Hilton website. My Uber driver from the airport told me that this had previously been a Marriott. I have stayed at several hotels in downtown Denver and generally try to pick whatever Hilton or Marriott brand hotel is the least expensive with full service. This hotel did not disappoint.The front desk clerk at check in was so friendly. He asked about my business trip and we talked about his dad, who is a ceramics engineer. He gave me a king bed room on the 14th floor. I'm sure the room was an upgrade, because it was very large compared to a few other rooms I peeked into that were being serviced by housekeeping. I also had a beautiful view of downtown and the foothills off in the distance. The room had a large desk area with plenty of outlets. There was a chair and floor lamp for reading. The bed was super comfortable. There were additional outlets by each nightstand. There were some nice touches like funky fixtures for the lights and a padded bench to use for a luggage rack (much more convenient than digging out the folding rack). There was also a mini fridge. The bathroom was small, but most downtown hotel bathrooms skew towards the small side. It's just the nature of the beast. I liked the walk-in shower and there was plenty of counter space for all of my stuff.The room was generally quiet, although no soundproofing can keep out the sound of sirens. Luckily, it was mostly a quiet night during my visit. There was also a pair of earplugs provided just in case.My room was clean and I found no evidence of slack cleaning anywhere in the hotel.There were 6 elevators, which is great for a high rise hotel. The fitness center (on the 2nd floor) is open 24/7. There were 7 Precor treadmills, 4 Precor ellipticals, and 2 bikes, along with weight machines, free weights, and all sorts of mats and balls. There were plenty of towels, water, cups, sanitizing wipes, along with chilled towels and fresh fruit. The elliptical I used worked great (even the TV!), as did the weight machine. I do wish there was a clock in the fitness room. The pool is adjacent to the fitness center and it was large compared to what I've seen in other downtown hotels.I used the executive lounge for breakfast and it had one of the largest selections of any Hilton lounge that I've seen. Several hot items, including bacon and scrambled eggs, along with an array of fresh fruit, pastries, bread, and cereal. There were also plenty of chairs and tables.I stored my bags after checkout and the front desk clerk again could not have been more friendly. The mall is only 2 blocks away, and I was able to walk to Apaloosa Grill for dinner. Loved the buffalo chili and buffalo pasta. There are countless bars and restaurants within a four block walk of the hotel.I had a drink in the hotel bar as a night cap. The bar and restaurant are located downstairs from the lobby. Again, the bartender was very friendly and crafted a cocktail to meet my mood. I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel on any future trips to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Our stay in Downtown Denver.,"The service and cleanliness of the hotel was very good.  The price was pretty steep, but if the company is paying, it's a nice place to stay.  It's definitely centrally located.  The wait staff was excellent.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Okay, Not Great.","The room had what we needed and absolutely nothing else.  The bathroom had the smallest hotel shower I’d ever seen.  The bed was very comfortable and the hotel was accommodating about providing a feather free room.  Never had any problems with staff or service people. That being said, the cleanliness of both the bathroom and room left MUCH to be desired. Most surfaces had evidence they hadn’t been wiped clean for some time. I was there for a conference and the hotel catering provided good vegan meal options.  Room service has very little that is vegan but there are good vegan restaurants within both walking distance or a short drive.  There’s a Walgreens a block away so bottled water and other items outrageously priced at hotel can be gotten quite easily.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful long weekend!,The hotel is in a great location & the staff was so helpful! We arrived very early and they had a wonderful breakfast suggestion that ended up being our spot the whole weekend. It is close to several car rental places so it was easy to take a day in the mountains-- We will want to come back again for sure!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice Hotel, Centrally Located","We arrived for a 2-night weekend stay over Easter weekend, We arrived earlier than expected and it was nice they did have a room ready for us.  However, when we arrived in our room, turned on the sink to wash our hands and it splattered all over my fiancé and the floor.  They did come up to the room within 10 minutes to fix it and apologized, he said he would mention this to the GM, however we never heard from anyone.  The room was a good size, we were in a King Executive room and it had a nice living area an had very comfortable raised king bed. Shower was nice size, however the bathroom was small. Housekeeping kept throwing away things we had off to the side (napkins and plastic ware we saved for our in room dining :) Very limited on towels too, so if you use more than 1 - you'll have to call and ask. The Bellmen were AWESOME!! Suggested some great places to go and eat and advised us not to Uber to a few places that the hotel has a SUV for the guests to be able to use - they will drive you and pick you up anywhere within 2 miles. Since this hotel is in a great location, this is a GREAT feature and very convenient to many popular places and restaurants.The front desk will always have bottled water for you to use, just ask...everyday we got 4-6 bottles and needed to keep hydrated, nice touch. Overall the hotel was recently renovated and visually is very nice, great upbeat music in the lobby, quick elevators. Service overall was good.  We are Diamond club members, and although they did not make mention of this - it was overall a great visit.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel; great location ,"Just had a nice one night stay at the Hilton Denver City Center. The staff, particularly the woman named Krista that checked us in, went out of her way to ensure a nice stay. The hotel was clean, safe and well appointed. Location us wonderful if you want to do anything Downtown or in LoDo.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Hotel for Downtown Denver,"My stay at HDCC was for a conference I was attending at the hotel.  This is a very nice hotel in downtown Denver within easy walking distance of many city attractions.  Is only about a 7-8 block walk to Coors Field and would be a great place to stay when coming into town for a Rockies game.  Hotel was mostly updated, and they were working on making further improvements during my stay.  Rooms were very nice, and the staff was very courteous and helpful during my stay.  The fitness center and pool are also nice, but note that the pool is indoors, not outside.  If I have any one issue with this hotel its that there is no on-site parking, so valet was basically necessary during my stay and this added about $100 to my bill, which I wasn't pleased about.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Stay somewhere else!!!,"I truly get no pleasure from writing this, but do NOT stay here. Rude front desk, broken elevators, and hair in bed and bathroom. Valets are clueless and there is trash all over the outside of the hotel. Keep in mind that Denver is a clean city. If you are debating the Sheraton, Westin, or any classy hotel in Denver, go with them. Location is solid and the TV was good. Other than that, look elsewhere.  PS they charge $75 for a late check-out. Their greed and lack of a service-first attitude will catch up with them. Sad to see Hilton sink this low. I would call it a low 3 star hotel.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Customer Service,"I stayed at the this Hotel On Sunday 03.18.18 and Checked out Tuesday 03.20.18 Very nice Hotel...Rooms are very nice... I have problem with paying 16 dollars a drink for a jack and coke in the down stairs lounge for a little rocks glass, but sometimes it is what it is staying in the heart of the city.On Tuesday morning, my room encountered a issue, it lost all hot water... and when its cold 30 degrees outside, that's an issue. I called twice to guest services and nobody was able to help.I ended up headed down and talking to the front desk, and the girl I was talking to was very sweet and professional, and I forget her name.She got me in touch with the Assistant front Office manager Michael Berlin.I would to thank Michael for Job well done in taking care of the issue and being very professional and Michael needs to be acknowledged for doing a great job and making things right.I will come come back to this Hotel and stay again.Thank you to the Hilton team",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great rooms!,To be in the city I never heard street noise. Great stay! Rooms were clean and staff was superb. Had a drink in the bar and it was equally enjoyable. Gym was nice and larger than most hotels i have stayed in.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,great downtown location,"Convenient downtown location, easy walk to public transportation, friendly service, clean rooms, good breakfast, didn't use pool or fitness area. No parking but valet service available or city parking garage across the street.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Quick stopover,"The Hilton Denver was a breath of fresh air after a late flight and a terrible hotel in NYC. The staff are great and the rooms well laid out and looked after. Pity we were only here for one night! Breakfast and lunch was nice, healthy and we were looked after well by Jenny on the restaurant floorXThank you",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice stay,We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Denver City center. As diamond Hilton members we received a room upgrade and access to the executive lounge.   The executive launch was a nice room on the 17th floor with good TV's and free non alcoholic beverages plus a nice breakfast evening appetizers and an evening dessert.  The breakfast was very good and the evening appetizers just OK. Parking was expensive so we park off site as I don't mind walking and I found parking at the greyhound bus station a 6 minute walk to work well if you don't mind some monkey business  O having to go after 12 hours and pay some more but much less and then vallet option at the Hilton.   We enjoyed the health club and the sense that is a quality place to stay in a great location.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Beautiful, modern hotel with friendly service",I stayed at this hotel with a volleyball for a tournament.  It was newly converted to be a Hilton after I made the reservation.  Didn't know what the expect.  The decor was modern and sleek; the room was spacious enough and bedding was comfortable.  Breakfast selections at executive lounge were plentiful and well replenished.  Loved that the hotel sent text messages to check in on anything needing attention.  All the requests were addressed by the very friendly staff.  It was an enjoyable stay.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not kid friendly ,"We travel all the time and I hate writing negative reviews so I will make it short and sweet!  We arrived after a long 8 hours of travel with a 2 and 5 year old to a hotel that was aesthetically beautiful inside and out. Everything seemed A-okay until we arrived at our room. A handicap room at the very end/corner of the hallway. REALLY? Has anyone ever tried to bathe a 2 year old in a shower that they can run in and out of?! Lol. But seriously, the room was over $300/night and it was tiny for the 4 of us with entirely no view and just low quality over all. So much for drinking a nice cup of coffee in the morning and relaxing with my hubby. We were so uncomfortable we were out as soon as we woke up. We made the best of it, but it was so obvious that this hotel was just not into family visitors.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient location,"Great downtown location within a block of catching the free mall bus on either 16th street or 18th street and the rapid transit train stop right on California at 18th. Hotel is your typical Hilton, there is a kitchen and a bar and a reception area with a fireplace.Beds were comfy, room very clean. We had leftovers from a restaurant and needed a microwave to re-heat, a young woman named Taylor was very helpful in providing us access to a microwave.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Customer Service is so Important in 2018,Disappointed with check-in/service at front desk - however the comfort of the rooms was great and the location was great to things in the area.  I initially booked this room because the property was a Marriott.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great new hotel in Denver,I am so happy to find this hotel.  Great place to stay!  We stayed here for our granddaughter's volleyball tournament and it was in great proximity to the convention center.  We will look forward to staying again next year!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great First Time Stay,"This was my first time staying at the Hilton Denver City Center.  I chose it based on proximity to 16th Street Mall, positive reviews, and because it is a Hilton (I am a Hilton Honors member).  Hotel has recently undergone a renovation and is beautiful.  Rooms are decorated in a contemporary style.  Bathroom in particular has a clean & modern look with a large backlit mirror that is not only stylish but provides great light for getting ready.  Staff is attentive and everyone I ran into greeted me, which left a very good impression.  I chose a room on Floor 20 using the Hilton app to help ensure a good view.  Upon check in I was told I had been ""upgraded"" to Floor 16, the ""executive floor"".  Oddly enough, the Executive Lounge is on Floor 17 with a direct access stair also provided to Floor 18, so I'm not sure how 16 is an executive floor.  Taking the elevator to get to the lounge wasn't a big deal but I would have preferred direct access.  In future stays I will choose 17 or 18.  Keep in mind when choosing a room that there are taller buildings surrounding the hotel so views of mountains or city may be limited.  The highest floor with hotel rooms is 20, but the actual hotel building is much taller than that.Executive lounge is spacious and has some nice city views.  Honor bar with a limited selection of beer & wine is provided Sunday - Thursday from 7:30 - 10:00 PM.  There was also a nice selection of Hors D' oeuvres from 5:30 - 7:30 PM.  Breakfast with a few hot items, fruit, cereal, etc. is provided every day.   Valet parking is available for $45/day but there are public parking garages adjacent to the hotel.  I chose one of those based on the outlandish $45 valet fee and also past poor (although older) reviews of valet service.  Garage across the street to the northeast is $17/day.  Many folks were using the valet, based on my observation during our coming and goings.Ear plugs were provided on the night stand but I did not find noise to be an issue.  If you are a light sleeper you may hear the light rail, which runs right in front of the hotel, and the usual city noises. Rooms have a transom window along the bottom of the main window that opens, something you rarely find anymore and a nice plus.  With the window shut I could barely hear city noises on the 16 floor The downtown/16th Street Mall area provides many bars and restaurants all within walking distance.  There is a free shuttle bus that runs up and down the mall, however it does get crowded during peak times.  We spent two nights here and never got our vehicle out of the garage once. Beautiful hotel with great service.  We will be back.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location friendly employees,"The location is great.  The rooms are nice and updated.  All the employees I spoke to were great and knowledgeable.  There is still some work going on but I heard no construction noise, I think most of the work is changing the locks so you can use the digital key.  The bar downstairs was also great.  I would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,In Town for one day on Business,"The staff was excellent, the room was very nice, clean and comfortable. I used their shuttle service a couple of times for local travel and that was great as well.It was cold when I was there and they have a nise fire place to sit by in the lobby area. Overall my stay was excellent.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good experience overall,"I went there for a conference. At the meeting, they were not (or slow at) re-filling the hot water for tea though. Event management could pay more attention and be more proactive about this and breakfast service. Otherwise, the service was good and personnel courteous. Regarding rooms, I could hear my neighbors and additionally there was a lot of creaking noise within the room. I wonder if they have bugs chewing their furniture and other wooden stuff. Although they provide ear plugs in the room, that may not provide the most comfortable way to sleep.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Change of ownership,"Decided to try this new Hilton property after staying at this former Marriott hotel over 10 times. Looks like Marriott did all their extensive remodeling over the last couple of years and then sold it to Hilton last Dec. Like the remodeling that was done though I miss my old Concierge level  amenities. Still a great location , only a block away from the 16h Street Mall and the staff was helpful and friendly. Rooms aren't very large but very comfortable. Only downside was the parking fee of $45/night which was high in my opinion compared to some other like properties there. Still will return in future.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very bad staff,"The staff of the front desk in this hotel needs to be changed. We were a group of 4 friends in 2 rooms and all of us had problems : room not ready at 4pm the first day, cleaning very late in the afternoon also, wrong bills mixed which made us loose time, lying when asked for a room in an higher floor, device for fire that was bipping loudly at 3am because run out of battery, and alarm of a previous client not turned off, waking us at 6am. Rooms are ok but ventilation is loud and windows are old, be prepared for traffic noise. Avoid room 432. Bathroom door is not a real door. Not great when you come for a conference and you share a room with a colleague. Poor wifi. Overall not happy at all with the experience.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business Trip in Denver,"I stayed at this hotel for a week during a business trip in Denver and it was a good experience. Executive room was comfortable, location was perfect (walking distance to famous 16th street), the executive lounge breakfast (and afternoon snacks, desserts,drinks) was excellent. My only complaint was the valet parking which I believe was overpriced ($45 a night). I received a great attention by all the staff so that also helped. Would recommend it for sure! It looks like they are working hard to improve the customer experience.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Work Related Visit,One of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in - slept like a baby every night!  The room was a bit small for two people but the climate control was great and made it even easier to sleep.  Room service was excellent and the water pressure in the shower felt wonderful.  Definitely recommend.  Staff were friendly and helpful!,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"You can do better - missing phone charger, shady staff","I don't take any pleasure from writing this review. I'm a Hilton Honors member and usually stick with the Hilton family when traveling and have a good sense of what to expect.  Overall the room, hotel and service was fine.However, when my stay was over, I accidentally left my phone charger in the room. I was checking out, but not leaving town as I was visiting friends. Less than 24 hours after leaving and realizing I had no way to charge my phone, I called the hotel and was transferred to security.  I described my charger and was told they didn't have any matching but was welcome to see what they had. I showed up a couple hours later and a man came to meet me holding what looked to be my charger, a white LG. He asked me to see if the plug fit my phone, I tried to look at the actual charger to see if it did indeed have the LG logo on it, he had his hand wrapped around it as if to conceal it, and he jerked his hand away and wouldn't let me look at it!!!  The plug didn't fit my phone, but he could have just switched it out by changing the cord. My phone has a C-type USB, so the more typical mini USB cord isn't going to fit. Conclusion: dude took my charger for himself. I don't have proof, but the whole interaction was so weird I have no other conclusion to make. Even if he didn't steal it, someone who works in that hotel did. In my experience, hotel staff holds on to these types of belongings for a little while to make sure no one claims them. Very disappointed, it's $30 to replace my super-fast LG charger and cord. Do yourself a favor and pick another hotel.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Standard Hilton ,"Was given room 1723 when first arrived, opened curtains to be facing office workers looking at me.... room changed to 1721 which was half the size bigger with lounge area.Executive room breakfast good and gym well equipped for cardio.Good location for main strip",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Better places to stay in downtown Denver,"The Hilton seems to be in a prolonged transition from its former life as a Marriott hotel.  There are many things that are just not up to the quality I expect from a Hilton Hotel.  The staff is very accommodating, but that does not make up for the many irritating issues, like the broken front door, broken card readers in elevators, broken TV in room, broken thermostat.  The restaurant is expensive as is overnight parking ($45 valet, with no option for self-parking).  I doubt that I will stay at this particular Hilton when I return to Denver.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A Good day for a Superbowl Afternoon.,Service in a very busty bar area during the game was excellent. Drinks were fast and correct. Munchies were hot and tasty. Wait staff really was on the ball for the entire 3 hour game! Not a dry glass or an empty plate to be found.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent property for business or pleasure.,"First stay at this hotel.  Excellent staff, rooms, common areas and location. Great for business as rooms have great work space, room size and lighting.  Clean, quiet and comfortable.  Definitely will return when in area.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Service!,"Room was very nice and clean!  Staff was attentive and friendly. If I looked like I was looking for something, staff was quick to ask if I needed assistance. I was there for business but would not hesitate staying at this hotel for leisure.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business in Devner,"While my over all stay was good, I was surprise there was no complementary breakfast. The staff was nice and helpful, the wake up call came with a back snooze call and a weather up. When something was not correct they were quick to correct it.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Exceptional Hi Rise in the heart of the city,Very comfortable room with an impressive lobby and open sitting area. We were visiting my daughter and liked the location downtown. We were able to get to most places easily by cab and my daughter picked us up to get in to the mountains and go to Boulder. Staff is very friendly! Breakfast buffet downstairs was excellent. Large workout room. Classy and comfortable.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, room perks...meh","Stayed here solo on a business trip and the customer service was extraordinary! Check-in was easy and they were very personable. Hotel location was wonderful, in the heat of downtown on 16th street mall (ish). The room was nice enough but no in room coffee and no room service. Seemed a bit odd for a higher end hotel.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Best Location, Best Service, Best Staff","Upon arrival we were welcomed by the Valet staff with a big and warm smile ( PM staff on duty on 1/29/18). The lobby of the hotel is beautiful, nice and clean. Craig at the front desk was very welcoming and accommodating, his uniform was clean and neat and he was wearing his name tag, he acknowledged that we were HHonors members. He went above and beyond to make our arrival experience was exceptional, he explained the hotel amenities and hours of operations. The bellman on duty ( I forgot his name) was very helpful and explained to us things to do around the area and restaurant recommendations. The room 1618 was very clean, sheets were clean and the bed was well made. Our view from our room was breathtaking, the room has a safe, huge closet with 2 bath rubs, a desk and a very spacious bathroom with all bathroom amenities by the line Peter Thomas Roth. In the evening of 1/29/18 we went to the Club Lounge located in the 17th Floor, upon entering we were not acknowledged by the gentleman on duty neither he told us that there were appetizers by the end corner of Club so we ended up ordering room service. The club lounge has a great view of the downtown area and perfect seating for a brief meeting or just to unwind after a long day, once inside the club please walk to the end corner were is the buffet located because at first you won't be able to see it. After leaving the Club Lounge we ordered room service but our dinner came in a ""Lunch Box"" i was very confused about it and I did not inquired why, i was expecting a table or tray at least in order to eat comfortable, quality of food was not that great and the burger over cooked. The Club lounge serve breakfast as well and is perfectly displayed and you have different choices my only recommendation is to improve in the quality of the food in overall in the Club. Next day we went to the gym and I was very impressed because they have everything you need for a great workout, the gym was clean, they had fresh towels and fruits. The indoor pool was warm and clean. We were exiting gym and we came across a staff member in the second floor, she was a lady very nice dressed and welcoming! She said: Welcome to the second floor and she was carrying box, she looked so happy, i wish i can recall her name but the fact that she acknowledged us even while working and carrying a box make a huge difference in our experience, we were very impressed. The hotel has a nice restaurant, we went to the restaurant and waited to be welcome by someone but no one came so we left and went to have lunch to a local restaurant. The location of the hotel is perfect if you are looking to stay in downtown. We walk to the main boulevard and we found several restaurants, pharmacies, bars, stores, attractions within walking distance. The hotel also offers a first come first serve basis shuttle service to take you anywhere within 2 miles from the property. The hallways in the hotel were very clean and overall the hotel maintenance and cleanliness is great, the housekeeping staff is very friendly and attentive. We tried to print our boarding passes from the computer located in the lobby but for some reason we could not found the airlines we were traveling with ( Spirit) so i approached Jonathan at the front desk and he helped me printing our boarding passes. Jonathan i believe was his name, was very helpful and professional, he made our check out experience smooth and fast, he thanked us for staying and invited us to come back. Retrieving the car from valet was fast even though I lost my valet ticket ( My fault) Tyler?? i think was the valet agent ? He was very helpful and fast. Overall is one of the BEST Hilton i have ever stay and i fully recommend this property, location and service wise is GREAT! GM you have a beautiful property and great staff! Great Job!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing staff.,Obviously the room was nice. That is to be expected from Hilton. What really impressed me was the staff. They were all extremely kind and helpful. Never once did I feel like I was putting any of them out by asking questions or requesting services. Definitely will stay again.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great hotel, exceptional fitness center ","Second time staying here, love this hotel. Modern, clean, convenient, nice rooms, excellent HHonors lounge with good breakfast. Fitness center is one of the best I’ve seen at a hotel, it’s large and has real gym equipment! Location is convenient to 16th Street mall and convention center. Staff here are SO friendly and helpful!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Top Notch,"I recently attended a trade show in Denver and stayed at the Hilton City Center. The hotel is excellently located, a short walk to the convention center and a number of excellent restaurants, close by. The service was top notch; as was the room and amenities. Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Staff,"I stayed for three days (conference).  The room was clean and comfortable.  Climate control was easy and accurate.  The staff, starting at the registration desk and throughout  my stay, was tremendous.  Pleasant and helpful without being intrusive.  In particular, we got excellent local advice regarding transport when a storm blew in on the day of departure.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"Needed a couple of rooms last minute for a night in Denver after Airbnb plans fell through. The hotel overall was clean and modern, although the standard rooms we stayed in were pretty dated. Staff was professional and courteous. Near 16th street and downtown. Great find for a last minute, single night stay, but would have been good for a longer stay too I'm sure.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,One of Our Favorites,"Having stayed here when it was a Marriott and now twice as a Hilton, I can say that Hilton’s refurbishments are top notch. The rooms have been beautifully updated and were such a pleasure for our stay. As Diamond members I was a bit disappointed to not have been offered a free upgrade upon check in and instead had to ask both times we stayed here in the past month. The first time we upgraded to a beautiful larger room with a king bed on a raised platform with an area for relaxing on a really nice sofa. This visit we asked for and were offered the same type of larger room but opted to remain in the smaller room as we were only here for a quick trip. Unlike when it was a Marriott and keeping with city Hilton properties, they also now have an executive lounge. I have been to many of these across the country and this lounge is on the small side but by far one of the nicest. For both visits the lounge was only open for breakfast on Fridays and Saturdays which I hope is just temporary. The only problem is that their eggs are the most unappetizing I’ve seen. It’s quite obvious that their scrambled eggs are made from some kind of a mix or pre-packaged liquid, and on our first visit were a bit watery. But this past visit they were downright undercooked and half liquid and half solid. Quite unappetizing. They also offered hard boiled eggs which although “real eggs” you could tell they came from a bag and were not boiled on site. Other Hiltons we’ve visited have had different types of eggs ever day, one day maybe quiche, the next day omelettes, then breakfast burritos, and other great options. Both visits here were the same sad eggs. They also had pastries, fruits, breads and spreads that were beautiful and beautifully displayed, and their coffee machine dispensed delicious lattes, cappuccinos and coffees. The attendant on our first visit was lovely, helpful and constantly replenishing food and clearing dishes. This second visit however was the complete opposite. The food looked old and there were dirty plates sitting for a while before being cleared. It was a disappointment all around this time. All in all I would recommend this Hilton as the location can’t be beat. Fantastically located a couple of blocks from the 16th St mall, their free mall ride it makes most downtown shopping and restaurants easily accessible. The downstairs bar was fun with great cocktails. As far as the Executive Lounge, I’m hoping that the management pays attention to this feedback and works toward improvement and we look forward to our next visit!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Perfect location for Quick Stop in Denver,Needed a night in Denver before heading to the slopes and this location was perfect for a nice night with the ability to walk to restaurants and bars! We enjoyed the comfort of the room and the staff were very friendly and helpful.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,National Western Stock Show,NWSS is always a busy time in Denver. The central location is a plus for easy accessibility to the events. Staff was helpful with transportation and food recommendations. All of the Cowboys & Cowgirls were welcomed.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Customer Service,The Hilton Hotel is a perfect location for all the city sights with great customer service and nice management I recommend this hotel  to any traveler.😊 I definitely enjoyed my stay.👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽  Comfortable and safe  atmosphere,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Modern, very clean and comfortable with a wonderful staff.  We loved how close it was to the 16th Street Mall!","The staff was very courteous, friendly and helpful.  We loved how close it was to the 16th Street Mall, which was just a short walk.  The beds were very comfortable and the entire faciltiy was very clean and well kept.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay!,"Check in was quick and the receptionist was very friendly. Great gym and nice indoor pool. Starbucks inside was great too. Room was clean and everyone was helpful. Central location. Overall, great stay!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good stay and location for downtown,"Great ambience and location near downtown. The executive lounge is located in the lobby temporarily which I think is better than the 17th floor. Breakfast selection was very good also and the meals in the restaurant were fantastic. If you can afford an executive level room the benefits are worth it. In comparison to some of the hotels in this category I would highly recommend this one, there are others closer to 16th st mall but I think this area is safer.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Needs improvements to staff and executive lounge,"Booked this hotel last minute as somewhere to stay and do some activities in Denver due to the fact that there wasn't any good snow in the Rockies to snowboard. Check-in: Got to check-in quickly, however, due to the line, they didn't thank me for being a Diamond member, I had to ask about the gym, pool, and then also about the Executive Lounge, which I was told that was under construction (was not mentioned on their website during booking) and that the Executive breakfast would be in an area sectioned off in the lobby which wasn't great by any standards. Need to tell people this stuff upfront when booking so they can make their own educated decision to stay there or not without amenities which we expect. Room: Clean, modern and updated. Only complaint is that there was guide or any literature on the hotel so every question I had I had to call down to the front desk for. Pool: As one of the other guests said, it doesn't look like the pictures online however it is rather large and is heated. They have music playing in there as well. Relaxed in there for awhile. However there was a bunch of construction materials and scaffolding in the corner of the pool room. Ruined the atmosphere of it a bit. Do they not have anywhere else to store that stuff?",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Horrible!!,No respect.. Would never recommend this business to anyone.. Was treated like a homeless person and wasnt given a chance to explain my side of the story.. Was thrown out and lost my keys at hotel due to the throw out and had to sleep in my vehicle. Cold and confused.. Me and my girlfriend..,1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Service not commensurate of Hilton brand,"We picked this location because of the vicinity to downtown activities, and I am also a Hilton Diamond. The check-in receptionist was friendly, but did not go over any Diamond amenities, pool, or benefits. He had to be prompted about executive lounge options (The executive lounge was closed during renovation). The room itself was clean, although housekeeping could have been more detailed. The lotion bottle was empty on the first night, and they did not replenish any shower gel on the second night. The ice bucket also had residual water from a previous guest. The pool was nicely heated, and a good size. It did look much newer in the photos than in person.The makeshift Executive Lounge was situated in the lobby area, and was poorly organized during weekend breakfast.  Hot food options were inconsistent (one day there were only scrambled eggs while another day there were eggs and bacon). There was only one employee who was responsible for verifying guest access and replenishing the food options.I would not stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Lovely stay for my first time in Denver,"My stay at the Hilton Denver City Center was a very enjoyable and stress free experience. The hotel was beautiful and the room was very spacious. The bed, comforter, and pillows were super comfy! The shower was relaxing, although somewhat narrow, and the lighting in the bathroom had different options which nice for getting ready. I stayed during a conference which was also at the hotel and that space was great for the event. Catering was amazing and the staff throughout all parts of my stay were friendly and helpful. As much as I enjoyed my experience, I am not sure that I would choose to or be able to stay at this hotel in the future because of the high price (due in part I’m sure to the great location downtown). I stayed at a discounted conference rate and was also on a company trip. If this hotel is in your price range however, definitely try it out!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Bad stay as Marriott,"Maybe the reason the management had no concern was the impending change. This review of this property is based on a stay as a Marriott. They had multiple elevators not working and some kind of military ball going on--so 10+ minute waits to get on an elevator. The lounge was closed, so lounge access guests got routed to a 'dining area' on the first floor, with budget hotel quality breakfast. The heat in my room only blew cold air, and when the clerk asked at checkout how my stay was and I told her, instead of any concern, the reply was 'thanks we'll check on that.'  Nothing good about this stay.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,EXECUTIVE floor guests don't have EXECUTIVE lounge access,"Do NOT waste your money on EXECUTIVE floor.  They refused service for EXECUTIVE guests to use their EXECUTIVE lounge.  They only allow their GOLD member to access any EXECUTIVE service.   They didn't even provide shampoo, conditioner and lotion when i arrived the first day. That's not the service you expected for 4 star hotel.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hotel & Great Location,"Came as a group for business. The hotel was very accommodating (as our group was very large) only ""complaint"" was the elevators took quite a bit of time during our rush peek times, but that is with any location. The staff was great, I was able to get early check-in, rooms were clean & nicely presented. The bar & food at the restaurant was excellent as well. Overall location has great proximity to shopping, restaurants, bars, transportation - I just with I had more time to explore!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Still working out transition kinks,"We stayed here the first night they transitioned to Hilton. Yes, there were issued. So I will give them the benefit of the doubt because they were still transitioning. The room was very clean, were tastefully renovated and TONS of adequate light in the bathroom for me to do makeup!! Beds were slightly hard. Wish the bathroom doors provided a little more privacy. You could hear what the other person was doing in there and see an outlining shadow. My main gripe was lack of requested items delivered and communication on it. We were celebrating our anniversary and no one recognized that. I wanted to do something special so had requested a bottle to sparkling wine to be sent up to our room while we went out to dinner. I was told no problem. I walked away from the front desk very happy and was going to recognize the girl who helped me by name on here - but alas we got back and there was no sparkling wine or even a voice mail that said they tried to send it to our room and to contact them for re-delivery. They didn't even try to come back. No big deal maybe they just forgot - the next morning I was shocked to see a room service charge on my room charges even though I had never received what I requested! The woman at the desk seemed a little annoyed that I requested to have it removed.  She offered a brief apology and said she's remove the charge. That was it....The folio that was printed was slightly confusing, so I hope that it truly did get removed.We ended up just going down to the bar and ordering sparkling wine. There was a gentleman at the bar who served us and he asked us if we were celebrating anything. We said our anniversary and he was very kind and ""bought"" my next drink. My boyfriend is in restaurant management and he was very impressed with the service we received at the bar. Very sad I didn't get his name. This property has SO much potential as a Hilton! Great location! I do hope they improve.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Horrible Stay,Bathrooms are filthy.  A/C does not work.  No security at the hotel.  We watched people from off the street come in and out using the bathrooms and no one stopped them. We stayed during the transition from Marriot to Hilton and we never received a bill for the Marriot portion.  We spoke to management twice on this.  The manager (Michael Berlin) said he would follow up and never did. Maid service only cleaned the room once during a 3 night stay.   Only received one bar of soap. The rooms are very hot even during the winter time.  Were  there in December.,1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver Downtown Hilton Hotel,Very nice hotel.  Convenient to shopping and entertainment.The room we stayed in was very clean and neat.  The hotel is within walking distance to shuttle that will take you up and down 16th free of charge.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Bad Stay - no longer a Marriott,"First of all, I booked this hotel a month ago through Marriott and only did so due to my rewards account and a promotion they had going on, however, when I showed up I was told that it was now a Hilton (as of midnight the night before) and was not notified of this hotel takeover (even though it apparently was bought back in October?). So strike one Marriott, but they at least made up with points.  As for the service under Hilton now, the only thing that was good was the Valet service - really nice guys. From when I checked in, the customer service from the Hilton team there to help with transition was not good at all.  They also gave me a room right outside the elevators that was dark and dingy.  That evening the TV just completely shut off and I wasn't able to turn it back on.  Being that it was late, I notified them in the morning and they said they would take care of it.  I came back late afternoon and still wasn't fixed so I called again and told them I would be out of the room at 4:30 so if they would fix it then.  Came back late and still not fixes - also maid service never even showed until I called to complain about the TV the second time (when at that time they sent maid service after I told them I was taking a nap and I didn't want it at this point). Not to mention that the room wasn't all that clean and left the coffee filters and trash with the coffee tray from the previous guest. Overall, I get that transitions are tough, but Hilton will definitely not sway me from Marriott and I will avoid them during personal or business travel at all cost and will make sure to warn my colleagues, friends and family as this is not the first Hilton disappoint.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Expensive but not very comfortable,"Although the hotel is nice and very close to Denver downtown, in my opinion it is not worth the price. Rooms are clean, large and comfortable but the bed mattress is too soft making your movements highly limited. In addition, the room heating equipment is very noisy but luckily it can be manually turned off.  Another thing I found very annoying was the group of elevators which seemed to not work together or being not synchronized. Apparently they work one at a time resulting in very long queues of people waiting to get into. The breakfast is served only a la carte.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,WAY over due - So far my go to,"I have to say this is my go to hotel in downtown Denver.  I have stayed in many and while there are some fantastic hotels, they have their own reviews from me, this has to be my favorite.  I will add pics to this later, but lets get started.Location is great, centrally located and easy to get to places.  Just blocks from 16th street mall, restaurants and businesses as well as the local train.  The one way streets can make it cumbersome to get to by car but the hotel can be responsible for when the city setup the streets.  Rooms, up to date and well appointed.  I have stay in a few different ones from a large room that had a sitting area with elevated bed and modern furnishings to standard rooms that were a great size and well appointed.  All times it was quiet and comfortable you could not hear much of the street and none of my neighbors. The beds are very comfortable and while I would like the AC to go lower it was good enough, I do like to sleep in arctic temps.  With that said the windows do crack, at least in my rooms so that was enjoyable. Amenities they gym was your standard hotel gym.  I did not go to the restaurant or bar, but they do have a starbucks, also skipped.  Right now they are updating so the concierge lounge is on the ground floor, which is not bad at all.  Perfect for getting a water on the way to your room after an evening out.Staff in a word outstanding.  Everyone of them has been friendly, accommodating, helpful and very professional.  The people at the front desk are enjoyable to speak with and always ask how the trip in was etc.  When you encounter other staff on property they always say hello and smile.Love this property.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Comfortable and Convenient,"I visited the Denver Marriott City Center for 4 nights in early November. I was in town for business and, as the review title suggests, found the accommodations to be rather comfortable and the location to be convenient to shops, restaurants, and the arts. I stayed in a regular guest room on the 16th floor. It was well-appointed and modern, but perhaps a bit smaller than I was expecting, particularly when contrasted with recent stays at other comparable hotels in different cities. I requested a ""mountain view"" which turned out to be a bit of a stretch. But, the windows let in good natural light and the overall view from the room was not displeasing. The room's aesthetic was modern and refined, the bed was comfortable, and in spite of my relatively close proximity to the elevator and housekeeping storage room (both across the hall from me), the room was fairly quiet. As others have noted, the staff (including the housekeeping staff) was super-friendly, and I found the Marriott app to be very convenient in a number of different ways. I dined once at the lower-level restaurant/bar - Prospects - and the food was solid. Obviously, there's usually better food to be found outside of the hotel, but this wasn't a bad option for weary travelers. The hotel gym was very spacious, but would benefit from some improvements. Specifically, the wall color and overall decor was drab and uninspiring, and most of the weight equipment (to borrow from Seinfeld) reminded me of a ""fitness museum."" All things considered, I enjoyed my stay at the Denver Marriott City Center and could see myself returning.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Central location,"Perfect downtown location. I was in town for business but could walk to everything. Lots to do nearby. Friendly and attentive staff knew the area well and made great recommendations. It seems like this is a ""business"" hotel with lots of meetings and conventions so everything is on the property- restaurants, bars, etc. But local spots are a short walk.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Best stay I've EVER had!,I was here for 5 nights for a work conference and it was hands down the most accomodating staff I have ever encountered. I was traveling alone and had recently found out I was pregnant and I was SO sick the entire time. I felt helpless when I couldn't keep anything down and resolved to go to the front desk and ask if I could order any strawberries as those were the only thing that I had been able to keep down in two days. The lady working the front desk (Gina Martin) came to my rescue! Not only did she get me the strawberries I had requested - she went on her break and bought me (WITH HER OWN MONEY) sea bands AND ginger gum as both of those had worked for her when she was pregnant. She refused to let me reimburse her for the items and insisted that she wanted to pay it forward as she had been miserable during her pregnancy as well. While no one else offered to supply me with sea bands - several other employees were so very kind. The rooms were great! Location was great!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good Overall Experience,"I ended up eating at the hotel restaurant multiple times which is unusual for me.  I was pleased with the service and food at the hotel restaurant.  Pretty unremarkable Marriott, nothing really bad to say.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great staff and location ,Very helpful and friendly staff at all times of the day. Good room and great shower. Note elevators had issues hopefully addressed already. Pool was also closed which we were not aware of. However good hotel all round.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good conference hotel,"I stayed here for an academic conference and found the hotel very good. Rooms are clean and comfortable, and the staff are helpful and friendly. Some small suggestions (not criticisms):1.  The lighting for the room cannot be controlled centrally, so it was a minor annoyance having to go around the room turning on and off the light switches for the lamps located in various parts of the room.  The hotel may wish to consider adding a central light switch when they renovate again.2.  Not enough power outlets in the desk area.  A power strip or multi-outlet converter would be helpful.3.  There was no safe in the room.  Again please consider in future renovations.4.  It would be helpful to add public transportation information in the hotel website. Currently the website just shows taxi fares (US$60+), valet parking fees and the forbidding warning that the hotel has no airport shuttle service, all of which give the misleading impression that it's not easily accessible by public transportation.  But in fact it's very easy to take the airport train to Union Station (US$9), then the free Mall Ride shuttle which runs every 5 minutes and stops two blocks from the hotel.  Adding this information would make the hotel more attractive to travelers.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Second time here. Never a disappointment ,"What do you want when you stay in a hotel? You want to feel that no one has stayed in your room before you got there. Boom. This place makes its mark every time. Also, a great concierge area for early breakfast and later happy hour. Walking distance to the 16th ave walking mall which is so very cool. Do not hesitate to book this hotel. You’re welcome :-)",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Deceptive practice! No longer a Marriott after 12/1/2017.  Now will not offer refund prior to arrival,"My wife and I booked this hotel on 10/31/2017.  Marriott's website made us (which was fine) pay %100 in advance and so we did. Also, my wife and I are Gold Elite and have been Marriott loyal customers for years. This morning 11/7/2017 I receive a lovely email that as of 12/1/2017 the Denver Marriott City Center will be changed over to Hilton Denver City Center. I called and confirmed with reservations (800) 228-9290 and it was confirmed. Also, after 12/1/2017 the hotel not honor Marriott Points or members.  I will be contacting the Denver Marriott City Center's (General Manager) to receive a refund...since the Gold Elite Marriott call center would not provide a refund nor would the front desk. Sad",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Downtown Hotel,"Stayed here on business for two nights.  Comfortable rooms, nice club level breakfast and evening snacks.  When we checked in at 4:30 pm, they only had one person checking in, with about 10 guests trying to check in.  Parking was about $45 a night.  They had a shuttle we took to dinner - they will go 2 miles from the hotel and that's it.  Our restaurant showed it was 2.1 miles from the hotel and they didn't want to take us.  Also had bad comments from my coworkers that the room service was subpar.  One ordered off of the dinner menu and it was brought in a brown paper bag.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great stay but too much fragrance sprayed in the air,Everyone was super nice and helpful. The food was good.  The room was good.  So why spray so much fragrance in the air.  Gave me a headache the whole time.  Please stop.  There are millions of people with allergys and asthma.  Not fair to us.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Stayed for five nights but could have stayed longer and here is why! ,"Business Conference trip (TCT) chosen due to close proximity to the Denver Convention centre about 4 blocks. Excellent check in with the most friendly staff EVER. Offering bottles of water due to the altitude, and for some unknown reason this helps 🤣The upgraded rooms are nice and I think as a Starwood member I got a larger corner room which was very nice. Ticks all the boxes, clean, well laid out, comfortable bed, toiletries, USB ports, coffee machine, iron, view, lots of clothes hangers, room service, laundry, good pillows. Negatives: air con too loud and on/ off trying to adjust so I turned it off and the room temp was fine throughout the stay. Shower too narrow although water pressure good. Starbucks on-site closes early and the quests were always too long for me to wait. Breakfast was included and ok. Coffee served was terrible. WiFi fine. All up a great business hotel with more to offer than most at a reasonable price. This is my second stay and I will be back Would recommend. Give me a thumbs up if you agree with my review or if you have any questions 👍🏻✅🙏🏻",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hung up in my face.... HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ,"Let me start off by saying I chose this Marriott because I’m familiar with the Marriott chain and I’ve always had a good experience. Which is why I’m so shocked with the service I received today... the check in was smooth but when I checked my credit card transactions I was a little taken aback by the additional charges since I called prior to arriving to see how much I would be charged including incidentals. I was told if I paid with a credit card, there would be no additional charges so I assumed that the extra charges were in error so I called the front desk and spoke with “Debbie” who I later found out her real name was Carol. She also told me  “Yea go ahead write it down” as if she were giving me her real name. I stated that I was calling about my room charges and if I could get a breakdown. I was immediately told that since I booked with Expedia I would need to call them. Even though I had given my card to the front desk and not charged my room through Expedia, she insisted that they (Expedia) are the only ones that can discuss our charges... This was weird since I never have had to deal with them when I chose the option to pay at hotel at checkout also on the Expedia website, it tells you to call the hotel for any issues or changes which makes perfect sense since they are the one’s collecting the payment. At this point I just wanted a break down on what I was charged and “Debbie” continued to tell me to call Expedia not letting me get one word in at all. After explaining for the 3rd time that I gave The Marriott my credit card she says hold on. After waiting for her to get back on the line, she says I’ll have a manager call you back because we have a line of people. I then told her that things would go a lot smoother if her attitude was better. She says I’m not about to sit here and argue with you and says a manager will call you back and hung up!! I went down and talked to the manager and all she could say was sorry and oh yeah she was able to give me a breakdown of the charges. Which was all I want to begin with. But instead I end up with my 1st horrible experience with Marriott!",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient for Conventions,"I enjoy my stays at the Denver Marriott City Center because it is always clean, the rooms are quiet, the staff is friendly and it is a lovely, easy walk to the convention center. A nice hotel in an excellent location.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very good stay during GABF,"On a recent trip to Denver to attend the Great American Beer Festival, we chose to stay at the Denver Marriott City Center because of its proximity to the convention center.We arrived on Friday near Noon. Our check in was smooth, inviting, and quick – in fact, our keys were already made. I expect the efficient check-in was made possible because the Marriott app has a feature that allows you to indicate expected arrival time. Our room was a corner unit which meant it was quite spacious and comfortable. The only downside to the room was the shower – we felt it was a bit cramped, but nothing that hindered our overall stay.We took advantage of the basement restaurant on our second day here. The ambiance was pleasant, and service was OK. The drinks were good, and the few food items we had were also OK. Overall, I’d say it was an OK experience. Since we popped in while our room was being cleaned, and after we had a proper lunch, I am not entirely sure if I left there mostly unimpressed because of that or because it genuinely needs improvements to food and service. Checking out was a breeze – again, I have a feeling the Marriott app made all the difference….we skipped any lines, and made it out in a few minutes. All-in-all, I’d recommend this hotel. It is located near plenty of downtown attractions, a lot of which are within walking distance. At check-in, the front desk staff seemed happy to help, and room service was quick and friendly too. I look forward to future stays here when we’re back in town.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Fantastic placeto stay,The hotel was great.  The room was clean and spacious.  They were very hospitable to us!  The concierge lounge served great snacks and breakfast.  The service was fantastic.  It's just a short walk away from the 16 street mall.  So many dining options within a short walk.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Downtown location,"Super location downtown, across from the 18th & California Metro station.  Very friendly staff. Sexy, remodeled room...I think ours was an Executive King. Concierge lounge was closed for remodeling which was a drag but they moved the lounge to their bar area during the remodel which was nice. Valet parking seemed quite pricey and it took quite a while to get our vehicle when needed though the staff seemed to be hustling and were always very nice. No hot tub but nice pool and very large fitness room.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Denver Marriott: Excellent Hotel, Service, and Location","No idea how this place has more four star than five star reviews, but it has been recently renovated so my hunch is my of those stars came when the hotel rooms were more dated. Room was very nicely redone. Wi-Fi and plenty of power plugs and USB ports all over. King bed had great linens, bathroom was solid with plenty of hot water. My only gripe is the shower seemed a little smaller than it could have been. Adding 6 inches in width would have been smart because of the accessible rails in the shower you could easily bump into. However, that is not enough to lower the stars. Service was awesome and they sent me towels when I asked for more, and were always helpful.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place for a conference,"Attended recently for a conference and stayed for a week. The hotel is really well located and is so close to great shops, restaurants and bars. The reception staff are relatively helpful whenever I stopped by. The facilities for the conference were great. Gym was also pretty good. Check in wasn't the best - never explained a large hold was going to be placed on my account. They asked for my card for hotel incidentals, it seems like it would be better to explain the function of handing over your card and the exact amount that would be placed on hold.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good find,"A large modern hotel in the centre of the City of Denver.  Situated on the junction of 18th Street and California Street, it is about half way between the Colorado State Capitol building and the Union Station.  Efficient and welcoming reception team.  The bedroom was spacious and a good size, not too big and not too small.  Furnishings were modern, as was the bathroom.  I assume that the place has been recently renovated and it shows.  Bar on the lower floor from the lobby and is good and spacious.  Car valet service was quick to return my car. There is a small Starbucks on the lobby floor, around the corner from the lifts.  Room service has converted to a modern box service, rather than an old lumbering trolley service and when used, was quick to deliver.A good find and I will use again when I am next in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,GREAT LOCATION. RENOVATED,"Great location. Hotel rooms have been renovated. Very modern and contemporary. However bath has been replaced by a walk in shower only. Ladies do not always want to wash their hair everyday so getting ones hair wet is impossible. Bathroom designed for the guys. Staff are lovely, friendly and very obliging. Air can good but a bit noisy. Blackout linings on the curtains. Great as a 6 hour time difference. Breakfast is great.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location,"Staff friendly, hotel clean, but the location is the main thing.  Just a couple of blocks from the 16th Street mall.  Restaurants galore in all price ranges within an easy walk.  Room was a little tight on space but fine.  Ask for a city view so you aren't looking at an office building like we were.  Would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Work conference,"Hotel is located in a good place and walking distance from many restaurants, bars and shoppers malls. Service is good and cordial. Didn't have any issues and would return for sure. Starbucks in the lobby and decent gym and pool.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great staff; central location,"If you are looking for a good hotel close to the heart of Denver, then this hotel would be a good choice. The breakfast has a good enough choice - I had the oatmeal which comes with a nice selection of chopped fresh fruits. The coffee is really good. The staff on breakfast were excellent. I had dinner there on my first night and it was fine - I had the gumbo soup for starter and filet steak for main course. The gym facility is basic but adequate. One area for improvement would be to provide direct access to the pool from the dressing rooms, rather than going through the gym. The wifi has is of good quality and strength but it appears to log out when not in use. A simple tap of the button restores the link but there should be a way around it.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent service!,"I stayed here for a conference this weekend. The hotel, facility and, most of all, the service was excellent.  Every staff member I spoke to was so willing to help. Very friendly staff made this a very comfortable stay.The location was convenient for doing other things - walking to restaurants, sites, etc.  The room was clean and the bed was so comfortable. My only suggestion is to add more lighting to the room.I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location; Nice Rooms,"My son and I were on a cross country jaunt via stick shift Wranger with an 8x5 U-Haul attached.  This was our third stop in three days, en route from Boston to San Diego.  After 10 hours of driving that day, we reached the Mile High City at dusk, only to be told by the valet that they could not accept the car since it had a trailer.  They pointed out a ""public"" garage across the street and we took 5 spaces (but the garage was empty since it was after work).  This led to more problems the next morning, but that is for another day.  The rooms we got were very nice and the staff helpful.  As a preferred guest, we were upgraded.  All went well.  Liked the upgrade and suck up...and the location was splendid.  Sorry about the screw up with the garage.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Place,Great location...great staff...great rooms. I will certainly stay here again. Very close to all the activities in downtown. Rooms are extremely nice. Good value as well. My next trip to Denver will include a stay here.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, friendly staff, small rooms","Excellent location about a 10-15 minute walk from the Colorado Convention Center. Front desk staff were VERY friendly. The lobby was very clean and well-kept. Our room was next to the elevator yet very quiet. Our room, on the 16th floor, was clean but very small. Although we had reserved a room for 3 people, they left us only with two towels. They were thoughtful and had bottled water available in the rooms. They had a smart TV which allowed you to sign into your Netflix account. Beds were very comfortable. Bathrooms were small. Closets were small. There was a safe in the room. If you have access to the concierge lounge, the breakfast was generous and the pastries were delicious. The fitness center was well-equipped and well-maintained. All in all a nice property, once you get used to how small the room was.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beautiful Hotel,"Was able to get a lst minute deal on this hotel, and it was very nice. Rooms were somewhat  small with 2 queen beds. but the view was beautiful, nice restaurant for breakfast, and close to the 16th street Mall and the convention center. Parking is VERY expensive- $45/day!!! But you can park right across the street for $6/per day if you do not mind dragging all of your luggage down the stairs and across the street.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location good services especially Marriott rewards members,I am a Hilton loyalist but this was a meeting location and they did a good job with all of that.  The rooms were good and I walked to a Rockies game. The best part is the executive lounge overlooking the main bar it is a great location and if they have enough people to service it you can get a drink and some nice deserts and appetizers.  I miss those in most Hiltons,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,went for work,"Lovely Property, customer friendly, great restaurant. Some of the best shrimp and grits I've had. Great location. only negative is valet is 45.00 a day, which is not bad unless you're staying for more than a couple nights ( 5 nights for me)",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Everything I Expect from Marriott,"This particular Marriott seems to have a fresh face - don't let the strictly business exterior fool you, it's great! Kind people all around. Large, clean, and very comfortable rooms.  Good desk space, good lighting, and a wonderful walk-in shower. Easy access to the 16th street mall for quick bites or forgotten items. Not right in the middle of the fun, but easy enough to get to it. Earplugs were kindly left on our bedside tables, but we could not hear a thing. Wonderful Executive Lounge breakfast, as always.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Stay,"Denver Marriott City Center was a great stay in LoDo. We opted for the valet & breakfast package (AAA). Breakfast was in the main dining room. You were able to select a beverage, breakfast & side - it was very nice. The hotel is clean and the pool is decent. The staff was very helpful and the location was convenient to all the Denver attractions. 16th Street Mall and the free trolley are really close. Most attractions are walkable or attainable via the free trolley.  - I definitely would recommend.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Premier property, and I'm an avid loyal Marriott patron","This is one of the premier properties by Marriott.  And I stay at a lot of them.  I was a few days shy of reaching my next level and they upgraded me anyways, without me having to ask.  GREAT customer service, they make everyone feel like a VIP.  Great rooms, upscale just like the lobby and restaurants, total wow factor all around.  Concierge breakfast was great.  Bar downstairs is nice and with friendly service. Location is awesome, only a block from the 16th street promenade, the heart of dt denver.   Parking was with valet, $45, fast and friendly service.  Overall, would stay here again.  This is a hotel worth bragging about",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,All around excellent!!!,"This a great hotel, located centrally in downtown Denver. Staff are super helpful and nice and courteous. They even have someone at the elevators during elevator rush hour (after conferences end) to ease the process (cause lines tend to get long).Starbucks on site, but if have access to the concierge level and can have breakfast and snacks (part of that level) you won't need Starbucks.Rooms are spacious and clean. Shower is rather narrow. Beds and room temp were great. Nice to be at hotel with plugs near the bed. If you ask for something they really try to accommodate your needs. I would recommend staying here for any type of trip that brings you to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Simply the best,"I have stayed at Five Star and/or Five Diamond Hotels like The Breakers Hotel, The Phoenician, The Four Seasons, The Ritz, and many more on multiple occasions. I also was responsible for training staff a luxury hotel that is now a Five Diamond hotel. Without a doubt the finest service-oriented hotel for which i have had the pleasure of staying was the Marriott Denver City Center. A great team of service professionals including;Ryan Todd, Courtney, Brendan, Agapita, Michael, Andru & Rich Zaccagn - without a doubt is the finest concierge I have ever known! A fantastic stay for any business traveller or leisure traveller who likes to be in the heart of the city.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good location,"Stayed here for 3 bites while in town to watch the Brewers play the Rockies.  Nice downtown location near the mall, bars and restaurants. They also have a shuttle. Staff was very accommodating and friendly. The only complaint I had was their computer for printing boarding passes wasn't working and there were problems with their alternative computer in the ups area.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location,"Recently refurbed city centre hotel, close to 16th Street mall, comfortable rooms, I had a king size bed which could easily sleep 4!!, Fridge and coffee making facilities in the room, decent views overlooking business district, generally quiet, USB port by bed which is handy for charging mobile phones etc.As with some Marriott's, the room service has been replaced with a trendy takeaway delivery type offering, menu is rather small and not very varied, so if you don't want to traipse outside or go al a carte, your food options are limited. Food arrives in takeaway box, with plastic cutlery etc, which is fine but sometimes you want to eat off crockery and have proper cutlery!!, Other than that, comfortable stay and will be back, perhaps order food from outside for delivery, more variety and will be cheaper",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Excellent location, excellent service","Excellent location for the business travelers, especially if you are attending an event at Denver Convention center - short and easy 3 blocks walk to the convention center.Nice clean lobby, somewhat on a smaller side, but probably appropriate for the downtown hotel; bar and restaurant are located downstairs.Good number of efficiently working elevators - hotel was sold out, but there never was a long wait for an elevator.Nicely appointed rooms, definitely after recent renovation, good decor, good styling, very cool bedside lighting fixtures, enough storage drawers (even though they arranged a bit weird). Room had a small fridge and the coffeemaker.If I would have one gripe with the room, it would be about power outlets. There is one single power outlet by the desk, and one USB charger port. One power outlet is not enough if you need to work and also want to make a cup of coffee. All the furniture in the room was recently installed - how difficult it is to have two power outlets and two USB charging ports by the desk? There is power outlet and USB port in one of the nightstands, and two more power outlets in the second nightstand - is that really necessary? I don’t understand how such simple things can be overlooked, especially when designing something from scratch - oh well…Nice and spacious bathroom, I liked the way the lighting was setup; shower tub was also large and comfortable.At the time of my visit (August 2017) the concierge room on 17th floor was closed for renovation so the concierge room was temporarily set up in the lobby. Reasonable selection of breakfast items and small bites in the evening.Excellent service in general and in the particular details - I needed to borrow a tablecloth for an event we were attending, and hotel had no problems to provide.I also have to mention a special touch - an automatic sunscreen dispenser at the entrance to the hotel - with the explanation about higher sun activity a the high altitude and recommendation to apply sunblock before leaving the hotel - definitely nice and thoughtful touch.All in all, a very pleasant stay, will be happy to come back.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Walking Distance to Convention Center and the ""mall street""","Another positive experience from another Marriott establishment.  In the heart of downtown Denver, this hotel offers business luxury for those who are working or visiting the city.  I was here on business attending a conference at the convention center, just a seven minute walk down the street.  As you are walking toward the convention center you will pass an array of restaurants, shops, and other places to stop and check out, including the shopping district/mall street. The hotel is clean, comfy, and welcoming as well as its rooms.  The workout area and pool are clean and comfortable, maybe a little outdated but they get the job done.  Hot water stays hot, cold water stays cold when you shower.  There is bottled water in the room but you have to pay $3 for it.  Next door to the hotel is a convenience store you can purchase water, soda, snacks, etc.. Restaurants are decent, check out the first and second floor of the lobby area. There is a Starbucks inside the hotel.  HOWEVER, if you decide to use the Starbucks app to order a drink ahead and you want to pick it up later, the Starbucks across the street is the designated location.  The Starbucks inside this hotel does not offer this service. I would come back here again if I do work in Denver down the road.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location!,"We were attending an event in Denver so this was the perfect place to stay.  Our room on the 18th floor was clean and looked like it was newly remodeled.  The staff was very helpful because  we had a lot of time to explore the city and surrounding areas. Rich, the concierge, was awesome!  (And he is a Jersey Boy!!).  He was so enthusiastic and gave us so many great ideas for hikes, restaurants and getting around the city. Anthony, a bellman, was also very welcoming and we took him up on his first suggestion to visit the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo and it was spectacular. The hotel also has a free shuttle which will take you anywhere within a 2 mile radius. Chris, one of the shuttle drivers, gave us a quick tour of the surrounding area as he was driving us to a ""B Cycle"" stop where we rented bikes for the morning.Finally, the hotel is about 2 short blocks from the 16th Ave. Pedestrian walk - a street  with shops and restaurants that is closed to traffic.  Thanks to all for your suggestions and we would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Easy access to city center and convention district.,"Staff nice and helpful.  Clean and mostly upgraded.Concierge lounge was being remodeled while there, but the 'loft' off the lobby was avail to platinum members as a temporary lounge including b'fast 7 days.Bartenders were awesome.Other minor probe included a horrible squeak in the handrail of the escalator which is being repaired along with the DARK elevator area on the 18th (I think) floor which had new decorative lighting which puts out very little light.  Some guests thought it was spooky.  Looked cool, but not very efficient.My room had almost total blackout - good thing for the jet-lagged.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Best place to stay in Denver ,"Very nice place, central and close to everything you need in Denver, 3 min walk to 16 mall street, the main shopping area, 5 min by car to union station, clean room with very helpful staff.highly recommend for vacation in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Disappointed ,"Prior to making a reservation I called the hotel to confirm they had full menu for room service at breakfast. I was assured they did. Wrong! I ordered and they wanted me to pick it up. I wanted it delivered. They did. It came in a paper bag inside a plastic box. Plastic forks and spoons and coffee in a plastic cup, ok maybe cardboard cup. When the occasion arises That I don't have an early morning meeting I enjoy breakfast in my room after sleeping in. I checked out a day early and left. Yes it meant that much. When my wife travels with me we both throughly enjoy it. I am a platinum member of Marriott's reward program. My last two trips I have stayed at HYATT. Great Breakfast ROOM SERVICE. See you soon HYATT.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver ,"The location of this hotel is Fabulous. ..the staff were extremely  helpful and pleasant.   Check in was so simple,  we grabbed a cab from the airport and we're in our room within the hour.  Great room, plenty of Space  there was lovely literature in the room with all the things to see and do.  It was 2 blocks to 16th Street with all the great restaurants  and shops.  They gave us a lovely  quiet room so as not to hear any traffic.   Will use again",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"great location, great service",i have been in this hotel few times in the past months. the hotel location is great and the  team is always pleased to help and very nice. the breakfast is great and the starbucks located in the hotel lobby is very helpful in early morning. the hotel lobby is very crowded in the busy hours. pay attention that unlike other hotels this once charge full price for packages which is big disadvantage.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Customer Service!,"I recently flew to Denver to attend a concert at Red Rocks commemorating Jerry's 75th birthday (TMI?). I got to the hotel early on a Thursday and was able to check into my room right away. Only made one room switch for a better view and the front desk staff was super accommodating (Shalomi, Michael, Darryl). Had a room facing a little garden with mountains far in the background. I came prepared for a noisy night (ear plugs, white noise machine) and I had 3 peaceful nights of sleep. The room was a great size and I loved the modern bathroom. Had a glass of wine and appetizer two nights in the bar on the lower level and the bartenders there (Nate, Scott and Jason) really make you feel welcome.Rich the concierge was fantastic! He really knows the neighborhood and was able to make great recommendations re: where to go in the city. He also found a yoga studio (Yoga High) which was literally a block from the hotel so I was able to take an 11AM call on Friday morning.The entire staff at this Marriott made me feel so welcome and I really appreciated the personal touch.The location is great - I was able to take a train from the airport and then walk about 10 blocks to the Marriott from the Union Station stop. There are also buses that run up and down the 16th Street Mall (about 2 blocks from the hotel) which you can take for free.All in all, I would definitely recommend this Marriott if you're traveling to Denver. The customer service alone makes them stand out from the rest.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not There Yet,"The Marriott is showing it's age, all while getting a refresh it seems. While some areas are done, others are not. The front desk staff was great, but the rooms look a bit beat up. For one, the doors look like termites have been feasting on them.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver Conference Hotel,"Trip was associated with a conference in the Denver Convention Center.  Hotel is located within a few blocks from the convention center and on the city light rail line and within 1.5 miles of the new Denver Airport Rail Terminal.  Hotel offers standard Marriott full service amenities.  I did not like the concierge lounge location, which is elevated and open in the hotel lobby.  The dining and bar are located in a lower level below the hotel lobby.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Recommend This Hotel,The hotel staff are some of the most professional and caring I have come across in the hospitality industry.   The hotel can handle large events and focus on individuals.  I recommend the hotel for business and personal travel.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good potential; stay focused on customer needs,"This hotel has potential--great location downtown, good staff (front desk), recently updated rooms.  Restaurant service was excellent; Nate the bartender very friendly and knowledgeable. The food was average--sliders were Ok, brisket was too tough.Workout room is fine with decent size and eqmt.Valet parking is $45/day, which seems to be the norm for downtown hotels.  Parking garage across the street is $6/day.However, mgr needs to stay focused on the customer experience and needs.  The room they sold us on the 15th fl did not have a bathroom door.  This room should not have been in the rental inventory until it was ready.  Instead of a comfortable armchair, the room was outfitted with a hard wood bench.  I defy anyone to sit on this bench for more than 5 minutes to read or watch TV.  The front desk tells me replacement chairs are on order.  This change needs to be done now, not over several months.The concierge lounge was being renovated.  Staff worked hard to set up the concierge breakfast in the lobby bar area, which worked fine. All things considered, I think my future visits will be back to the Residence Inn on Champa St.  This Res Inn gives you a comfortable and familiar experience.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful staff,"We stayed here to attend a conference.  This hotel is still working on upgrades so there is a bit of things misplaced, like the concierge lounge.  The staff went out of their way to accommodate us and others.  Greeting us by name, asking if they could do anything else for us etc..  Their restaurant and bar is downstairs from the lobby and they have a great selection of food and the beer was especially tasty!  The only issue we had was with the elevators, getting to and from a high floor with 500 other people took awhile and it didn't seem that all elevators were working.  We chalked that up to part of the renovations.  This hotel impressed me by the customer service and friendly staff, not just one person but everyone - hands down the most welcoming in a long time!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Why I would select this hotel again! 😀,"Appreciated the convenient location! We could easily walk to the 16th Street Mall to shop and enjoy a wide variety of restaurants. The state capitol, Civic Center Park, Denver Art Museum, and Denver Mint are also close by.When we stayed there in July, we appreciated the little perks that helped us cope with the summer heat. There was an automatic touchless suntan lotion dispenser by the main entrance and multiple water stations in the lobby area stocked with flavored ice water varying daily: cucumber, strawberry, etc.Prospect's Urban Kitchen and Bar had delicious food! I enjoyed a lunch and breakfast there. There's a small Starbucks off the lobby too.A colleague who stayed on the 5th floor said she could hear street noise, but I didn't notice it at all on the 14th floor. The hotel does provide complimentary ear plugs.My room had a spacious desk where I could set up my laptop, a cool couch to enjoy the view out the window, and a supremely comfortable bed. The rack of reading material about the local area was appreciated.Noticed that another reviewer mentioned the water situation. We experienced that as well, but a hotel letter explained that it was because of a city project that the hot water was turned off - not an issue the hotel could control. I agree that it was inconvenient, and I would have preferred to have avoided encountering it.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"No shower, no business!","Downtown Denver is beautiful with many great options! When my credit card was charged a $50 per night ""hold"" fee that was released five days after checkout and parking was priced at $45 a night, I expected certain levels of accommodations. Ice machines were broken on Floors 5, 6, and 12 (those were the ones I tried to use), and there was not a hot tub. Again, basic hotel accommodations were lacking. Here's the real kicker: There was no water to shower the last morning of my stay. Yes, there was a form letter stating there were water problems that would be resolved in the ""early morning hours"", but at 6:15 a.m. They were not ""resolved"" and there was no water. I certainly had the option to shower in the locker room, but I felt at $369 per night a locker room shower on a business trip was not appropriate. I've stayed in a number of downtown hotels in Denver and this was the worst. Stay in the wonderful city of Denver at a hotel that can at least meet basic needs.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place to stay WHSn in Denver!!,The Denver Marriott downtown is centrally located to all the hot spot. Walking distance to the convention center and lots of grreat restaurants. I spent three day there for a conference and truly appreciated the stay. The staff was very helpful as well. I will add this to my places to stay when I am in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Hotel,The hotel was very nice. It just underwent a major renovation and the rooms are nice. The hotel is centrally located in the middle of downtown Denver. I would recommend this hotel to all of my friends and family.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hotel - Great Location,"Hotel is a great place to stay within the city of Denver.  Convenient to downtown activities, restaurants, and the 16th St. area.  Hotel just recently went under a facelift in the public areas, rooms, and concierge level and it suites them well.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Short weekend in Denver,"Booked room through Marriott website, good deal on room. Checked in early with their app and requested 6 extra pillows. We didn't need 6 extra pillows but thought it'd be fun. We checked in early without notice and we were accommodated and given a nice and large king suite on a high floor.  Wish we'd have taken pictures because our room was nice, clean, updated, and comfortable. We also got the 6 extra pillow! The staff was great, Rich (or Rick) the concierge was helpful with recommendations and arranging an airport ride. Would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Terrible Customer Service & the Scent of Vomit,"As someone who lives in Denver, I could not be more disappointed that our friends staycation was at this hotel. The price was definitely a factor in why we chose to stay at the Marriott City Center, but I am certain every girl who came will not be returning. We had requested two adjoining rooms to be ready by 3:30pm. When we arrived at 4pm our rooms were not ready. We were told 30-45 minutes. After an hour, we were finally given access to the first room and it took us an additional 45 minutes to get access to the second room. Come to find out, the second room reeked of vomit so badly that a week after our stay my shoes still smell. They did comp our room so for that we are thankful, but we had to complain multiple times and make quite a stink about it before they obliged to help in some manner. It was honestly huge disappointment. When we checked out the manager was completely indifferent to the fact that we were upset and only commented ""Well at least you had a fun night!"" Despite the hotel, we did have a fun night, but it truly was in spite of the Marriott. I will never recommend it to family, friends or business partners coming to stay in Denver, which is extremely disappointing considering my fiance and I are typically extremely loyal Marriott/SPG Members.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Right in downtown Denver,"Nice, spacious, clean rooms. Even on 18th floor it can be noisy from the trains and traffic in downtown Denver. They even provide ear plugs if you choose to use them while you sleep. Breakfast, appetizer and desserts at Coinceige  lounge are very good. Easy 2 block walk to 16th St tram for free travel from Union Station",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Service and patience with a smile,I was just in town with my family for the World Series of Youth Lacrosse....my 13yo was representing our hometown club (and Canada) at this amazing event.  The hotel was over run by lacrosse players and their families - but the staff was ready for us.  There were 12 and 13 year old boys (and their parents at times) running around creating chaos but the staff was so patient with them - ensuring their safety at all times - being stern - but kind.  The location was phenomenal only a few blocks from downtown and the convention Center.  I cannot say enough about the staff here.  From the valet to the concierge to the front desk and above - everyone went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure we all had a trip to remember - no matter what happened on the field ;),5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,It's ok,Stayed here at the marriot for business and a convention. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Food is so so with a limited menu especially for room service. I was given a handicap room which was so so. Found trash from previous guest below the bed and cleaning was so so. In the long run I like the Hyatt regency convention or the Homewood Suites much better.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, bog standard hotel","Stayed here for a conference that was being held at the hotel so convenient god that and also convenient for local bars and restaurants. Everything about it was Ok, but just Ok. The room was nice and clean, the wifi worked, the staff were friendly and efficient - nice, but just felt like something was missing. This is a hotel that could be anywhere in the US - nothing to make it special to Denver or Colorado. The food was a bit disappointing - breakfast menu is limited and the room service menu was even worse. Plus they charged $5.00 to deliver it to my room - seriously........ not cool. So while I had nothing to really complain about, there was nothing to rave about either.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Marriott Excellence + Great Location,"We stayed for four nights @ this hotel and were very pleased with our room (newly remodeled) and the service we received from all the Marriott staff. The hotel is located about 1 1/2 blocks from the 16th Street Mall and is also centrally located close to the downtown attractions  (e.g., Denver Art Museum, Union Station, etc.). We did not rent a car and found we could either walk or take the free public transportation that runs the length of 16th St. Mall. Special thanks to Rich (Concierge) and Andru (Bellman) who were so helpful during our stay. The hotel was very busy during our stay, yet all the hotel staff kept things during smoothly. We will certainly stay again when we are next in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Very well located, excellent value!",My husband and I spent one night at the Denver Marriott City Center Hotel.  The room we had was very comfortable and clean.  Because we are premier elite members with Marriott a very nice breakfast buffet was included with our stay.   Every staff member we encountered greeted us and was helpful when we needed an answer to a question.  It is so close to 16th St. which is the pedestrian area with free shuttle passes running.  It is also within walking distance to other attractions like the state capital and the Denver Art Museum etc.  We would highly recommend staying there if you are visiting Denver.  We know if we come back to Denver that's where we'll stay.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver is Awesome,This hotel is situated in the centre of Denver colorado and is walking distance from pretty much everything that you want to see in the centre of town. They have a road that is filled with very cool bars and restaurants and they have the cheapest happy hour and the bartenders are willing to extend happy hour prices even shorty after the time runs out. Denver is a super chill place and everyone is very friendly.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Definitely earns my five stars!,"Stayed only for one night during our western road trip from Yellowstone to Albuquerque.  Arrived earlier in the day than planned but the young man at the check in counter still found us a fantastic room that was so luxuriously appointed, we gasped when we walked in.  Even my husband said ""this is more like it!"" upon entering -- after having a less than wonderful stay at a B&B the night before.  I should know better than to ever try anything other than a Marriott product when we travel, and this one certainly is high on my list.Despite the employee's efforts to save us money by telling us of other parking options, we valeted for convenience sake.  They had it parked by the door, all ready to go when we left the next morning.  And although they offered the shuttle to take us to the Rockies game later that night, we chose to make the easy walk to Coors Field and back.  When we returned that evening, we stopped in the lobby restaurant for dessert and tea/coffee, where we were happily greeted despite the late hour.  The carrot cake cheesecake was good but the banana creme brulee was heavenly!   The comfortable bed and quiet room caused us to sleep in the next morning so we were not able to take advantage of the breakfast package we had included, but a quick stop at the Illy coffee shop on our way out the door held us over as we made our way south out of the city.Stellar hotel, great location, wonderful staff and a good night's sleep.  Not sure when we'll ever be back to Denver, but will definitely stay here if we have the chance.  In the meantime, my sights are now on that new Marriott in Houston with the Texas shaped lazy river!   I love Marriott!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Valet Vanessa is amazing,"Vanessa always does an amazing job! I am a monthly parker and she remembers me every time, knows and understands my needs, and not only does she put me first, but I've also seen her put other parkers' needs first, too. Her customer service is unparalleled!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Short visit,"Excellent service and lovely atmosphere, quite impressed with the professionalism of the staff. A very welcoming attitude and overall a beautiful hotel.This is a perfect venue not just for business but for a honeymoon or family stay. The food is incredible and location perfect.  It is not close to the airport and yet it is very beautiful inside.  The rooms are big and have all the amenities one needs for one' stay.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hotel,"This hotel is going through a ""makeover"" and is simply superb! The location is PERFECT....close to everything! The staff was very Nice and the executive king room was AMAZING! I will definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"I stayed for an entire week at the Denver Marriott City Center and it was an overall good experience. I was in town for a conference held at the Marriott, so I spent quite a bit of time there. My room was really nice--we checked in late at night and they were still able to get us in a room with a beautiful view of the city and the Rocky Mountains, which was a perk! The staff were helpful. The food in the restaurant/bar in the lower level was excellent--I ate their twice and really enjoyed the wings and the burger! We really appreciated having a Starbucks in the building--that was great in the mornings.. Another nice touch we appreciated was the sunscreen dispenser at the door--so convenient to grab some as we headed out for the day. The meeting rooms were nice. Great location--easy walking distance to the 16th Street Mall and the free shuttle, which was awesome.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Comfortable and near activity,"Pleasant and well kept property within four blocks walk to convention center and two blocks to 16th Street shopping area. Very good restaurant with tasty food, great desserts, and wonderful staff. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Housekeeping is very accommodating. Concierge is friendly and helpful. Hotel is secure--need room key to take elevator to sleeping rooms.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center, Nice  Business Hotel,Here on business.  Great service.  This hotel has a courtesy cat and is very accommodating in giving you a ride to Union Station  to catch the train to the airport or to pick up a rental car.  Nice rooms.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A surprize,"Had to go to Denver for a conference. I knew we'd be a rather large hotel and we were. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The service from the front desk to check out was absolutely perfect. The rooms were very comfortable. But here's an example of service -- I don't drink ANY soft drinks except COKE products. Well, this hotel is not a Coke property. I ask the gentleman at the door where I could go get a Diet Coke and explained that I don't drink anything but Coke products -- his response was ""wait right here"". A few minutes later he came back with two Diet Cokes. It was a very nice experience from the time I got there till I left. I would stay there again next time in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location...wonderful service by staff,"Although I have not stayed at a Marriott Hotel in several years, I was very much pleased at this location due to the staff professionalism, and great location.  The facility itself was well maintained and the surrounding attractions were great.  The room as well as other accommodations supported a very relaxed five day stay.  I took advantage of the workout facilities and the cleanliness and safety of the area to do my running earl in the morning.  There were near by restaurants, movie theater,  shopping center and bowling.  After the movie, I asked for assistance in perceiving my left over popcorn and the front desk staff went to the trouble of getting a container from the kitchen so I could enjoy for the NBA finals on television.  The room service was great and the timeliness was very quick, making the food nice and hot. I will be back during the NFL season to attend the Raiders vs. Denver game.  Good show....Marriott!:-)",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Good Location, Slightly Noisy","You can't beat the location - take the train from DIA then hop on the free mall bus and walk a few blocks, it's definitely walkable. They were renovating the Marriott Member Lounge so breakfast was served in the atrium (elevated platform). You do get noise from the horn on the light rail train, etc so they give you earplugs - not a problem personally as location and on list of corporate hotels drove the selection but light sleepers might want to carefully consider.Staff are friendly and helpful. If you need Starbucks, it's in the lobby.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Luxurious ,"Loved this Marriott downtown hotel. Close to 16th street Mall, lots of shops and restaurants close by.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The bed was so comfortable. Breakfast at their restaurant was delicious. I also loved their bath products.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very Nice Hotel - Great Location,"My sister, husband and I stayed one night in this hotel. The room was very nice as well as the lobby. They have a Starbucks on the lower level which was really convenient. It's location is the best part - easy walking distance to the downtown mall area - so many restaurants, bars and shopping. The main struggle for this hotel were the elevators. I'm pretty sure there were only one or two working and there were LOTS of people staying. We had to wait several minutes for the elevator and then the elevator stopped on every floor. The elevator would fill up quickly so you'd have to wait a long time for the next elevator. To avoid this problem, we asked about taking the stairs and the hotel staff told us the stairs were emergency only - and we couldn't even find them to take them if we wanted. As long as the elevator situation is fixed (which I'm sure it will be) this is a good hotel.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Avoid this place,"The room was okay - nothing special, but at least it was on a 'renovated floor' - the clerk at check in assured me of a lovely mountain view - but they lie.  You'd never know there were views from this room.There was a cart with dirty linens and what appeared to be abandoned luggage outside my door for 48 hours - housekeeping services didn't both to come by the room until after 4pm.The best thing you can say about the single restaurant at location is that there are better ones nearby.Average at best - certainly not worth the cost.  I can't imagine what the rooms on the floors yet to be renovated are like.....",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Small charming room.  ,Check was easy but I did check in on the app.  The front desk person was welcoming.   Even had a person passing out wine and small desserts in lobby.                                                   If you are a family of 4 and share a room beware they're quaint rooms.  Air freshener smelled upon entering the room. Towels in bathroom looked as if they were quickly thrown on shelf (nothing major just messy) pics included.    TV is attached to wall uncomfortable looking at TV and sitting at desk working on computer.  Had an early dinner in restaurant.  The food was delicious and Jessica was delightful.  Food comes in good portions so go easy.  Location is everything other places to eat in near vicinity.   I would stay here again.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"Was in Denver for a conference May 20-24. Loved this hotel. Upon check-in they upgraded us to one of the newer suites (husband is lifetime platinum so I am sure that had a lot to do with the upgrade). The room was very comfortable and spacious. I am hoping in the little kitchenette cabinet space they plan on putting a microwave. The location is perfect to the conference center, shopping, microbreweries, restaurants, etc. We did not have a car and had no problem walking everywhere. Loved the fresh, clean scent when you walked into the hotel. The staff is phenomenal. The lobby is bright and beautifully decorated. I liked that the bar was downstairs so you were not bumping into lobby traffic while relaxing and enjoying a cocktail. The concierge lounge was not finished so they set up a temp location in the lobby which worked out perfect. Attendants kept the area clean and stocked. One touch that I really liked was the sunscreen station at the entry. Since most do not know the damage the sun can do in the thin mountain air. Overall I really loved the hotel. I would definitely stay here on my next visit to Denver. Hopefully for pleasure so I can explore more!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great Location, Newly Renovated Room",We recently went to Denver to run in a 5K and stayed at this hotel located downtown Denver.  It seemed to be in a great location that was walking distance to most everything downtown.  The staff was very pleasant upon check-in and they had a great breakfast area for their elite members.  The room we stayed in had recently been renovated and had a nice size bathroom.  Nice hotel and consistent with what you'd expect from Marriott service.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver Marriott City Center - the total package!,"I was at Denver Marriott City Center in connection with a conference. You first walk into the hotel and are greeted by this lovely fresh, clean scent.  I'm told the scent is proprietary to all the Marriott hotels and was developed specifically to make sure it didn't bother anyone's allergies.  I'd love to know what was in it!  The hotel has recently been remodeled, and it is gorgeous!  Every place in the hotel had the perfect balance of finishes (wood, stacked stone, metallic, tile, etc.).   Even the picture frames were perfect!  I would love to have their designer come do my house! :)  The room was equally lovely and the bed/bedding was comfortable.  Our room was right by the elevators, but we were never disturbed by them.  The only thing in the room I didn't like was the sliding bathroom door which didn't afford adequate privacy if you're travelling with someone.  I liked the lighting in the bathroom, particularly the low light beneath the mirror which made a great night light.  The shelf below the sink was a great idea and kept counter clutter to a minimum.The hotel is conveniently located a few blocks away from the convention center (10 minute walk), and even closer to the 16th street area with shops,free tram, restaurants, etc.We had the opportunity to make use of the complimentary car which will take you to locations within a couple of miles of the hotel (depending on availability).  It was a very nice perk that I and my aunt took advantage of.Perhaps the best feature of the hotel was the staff.  Everyone is friendly, helpful and accommodating.  Congratulations to the Denver Marriott City Center -  the perfect package!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver Marriott City Center - May 10-13,"I must say that I truly enjoyed my visit to Denver and to the City Center property.I arrived with a co-worker for a work conference recently and was generally pleased with the appearance of the property.  In particular I want to acknowledge two Marriott team members - Tony Tiger who helped us with check in and answered a variety of questions about the hotel.   He was warm, helpful and genuinely interested in answering our questions and directing us to the right location within the building.    He's a great person to have up front when guest arrive.    Our rooms were on the 18th floor.   We were disappointed to learn that the Marriott Elite lounge on that floor was closed for renovations, but the hotel more than made up for the temporary closure by providing access to an Elite member area just off the lobby.  The renovated rooms on 18 were just the right size, with modern and spotless bathrooms and very comfortable beds.   The only down side for some-  but not for me- was the size of the TV screen.  I generally don't watch much TV when I'm on the road but I noticed the TV set had a very small screen compared to what is generally available in many rooms.     Not a negative for me.I liked that the HVAC controls actually seemed to work and I was able to set the room to a nice temp for sleeping. the meeting rooms on the lower levels were well sized and clean and bright.  The temp was too hot after we filled it with 25+ guests  - a minor complaint.As it was my birthday during my visit, our group visited the lounge for a small celebration after dinner.We encountered Naomi whom we had met the previous night when she was working in the Elite lounge.  She was again warm and friendly when she learned it was my birthday she arranged for some chocolate cake to be delivered to our table.    Delicious!Following my visit, I did have a nice email exchange with the general manager who was genuinely interested in my comments and my praise for his staff.I would be happy to be a guest at this property during my next visit to Denver and would recommend it highly to others.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business trip,"What a great facility - perfect for our meeting.  With the location not far from many restaurants and many amenities, it was a neat place to be.  It had everything we needed, where you could have breakfast lunch and dinner in the hotel if you needed!  Rooms were comfortable and clean!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Girls weekend stay at the Marriott. ,"We had a girls weekend downtown and stayed at the Denver Marriott. Our hotel room was so beautiful and you could tell that our room was newly renovated. We had the kindest valet, Vanessa so was so upbeat and friendly! We did run out of towels though, but what do you except with a whole bunch of girls! So I would recommend more towels in the rooms but other than that we had such a great experience during our stay. I highly recommend this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Very nice people, but I wouldn't choose this hotel again","I am typing this review in my room at the Denver Marriott City Center. I've been here for four days and will leave tomorrow. I was here for a meeting.The hotel's location is very good, just a block from the 16th Street pedestrian/ shopping mall, and an easy walk to several good places to eat, and just a little further to Coors Field (MLB) and the famous Tattered Cover bookstore near Union Station.I should begin by saying that all of the staff here have been very pleasant and kind, and that counts for a lot, but the hotel itself has been a disappointment on several fronts.I got a renovated room, with excellent electrical outlets and even USB outlets in the walls, and a big flat screen TV on the wall opposite the bed. But some of the channels aren't digital! So on that big beautiful TV the channels are all fuzzy and stretched. The big beautiful king-sized bed is not very comfortable, more than a little on the hard side, and the first night I had a lot of trouble getting any rest. On the second night I started taking Advil PM before bed and since then I have slept much better.  The pillows are plump and beautiful but a little too thick to be comfortable unless you sleep on your side (luckily, I do). More importantly, the bed itself and the nightstands rest on a platform that is elevated about 6"" above the rest of the room, so I have gone to bed every night terrified that I will get up to use the bathroom at 3 am and break my ankle when the floor falls away underfoot about 18"" past the end of the bed. (So far I have not done this but one of my fellow group members told me that he scraped the back of his heel very badly in the middle of the night on his first night here.) It seems like an unnecessarily risky design choice to make in the renovation. There is available lighting under the platform but the same switch also turns on lighting near the ceiling, so it is not suitable as a night light. I will attach photos.The other thing about the room is that it is so BROWN. It is depressing. Everything except the bed is in shades of brown and tan and other earth tones, including some very bad beige faux woodgrained surfaces, and even the wall decor is slices of petrified wood (I am not making this up). No color. The light fixtures are OK, if not very attractive, but like many hotel rooms there just isn't much light except right under the lamps. The bathroom is nice and bright though, and the blackout curtains are excellent.The maid service was spotty in terms of timing, and I never knew coming back to my room whether I would find a made-up room or whether I'd have to go away and come back in an hour. The hotel provides only two towels by default, which is annoying even for a person traveling alone, although they will very cheerfully give you more if asked. Yesterday, after two days of coffeemaker use, I realized that my coffee station had not been refreshed during the maid service, and I had no clean cups, no creamer, no stirrer sticks, and no Equal or Splenda, and all the trash from my previous coffee making was still on the tray. I called the desk and they sent up fresh supplies immediately, which was appreciated.The renovation included dual-flow toilets, which is great, but these toilets use so little water that when they flushed they did not remove all the soils that had been deposited (I'm trying to say this in a delicate way) on the downslope of the bowl. This was embarrassing. In Europe where toilets like this are common there are little toilet brushes available in all the public bathrooms,next to the bowl, so you can brush away anything that remains. Perhaps the hotel should consider that.I ordered room service for dinner one night. This Marriott's room service can best be described as delivered carryout. Everything comes in plastic boxes inside a shopping bag, with plastic cutlery. The delivery charge is $5, and nobody thinks to include ketchup or mayo when you order fries. The food was pretty good, though, and it did come quickly (maybe 20 minutes). And there's no giant cart to deal with, so that's a plus, I guess. But when my plastic fork tine broke I rather longed for real metal flatware.I haven't enjoyed writing this review because the staff I have met here have all been delightful, and I don't want to make them feel bad (especially about things they have no control over, like the ugly brown rooms and crazy dangerous bed platforms). But this review is for the benefit of other travelers, who need to be aware.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great service and clean!,Vanessa helped us with valeting our car and was wonderful!  It started our stay out on the right foot. I highly recommend staying at Marriott City Center! The rooms were very clean and there staff is outstanding!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Good location, poor customer service - will not stay here again","We stayed here for my friend's 30th birthday with points she had from staying exclusively at Marriotts in the past.  The location was nice, central to downtown, however the customer service was lacking, which I will get to momentarily.  The room we stayed in was on the 17th floor and though I realize they are renovating the building, the doors on the rooms I saw including our own were severely scuffed.  The interior of our room was clean however.We needed an extra set of towels on our first of two nights there and had called the front desk for them.  First call, was told they would be coming up.  Second call 15 minutes later, was told to retrieve them from front desk.  Third call 15 minutes later, was told they would come up with the towels as my friend was turned away from the front desk when she approached them for towels (they said they had none there to give.)  Fourth call 15 minutes later we finally get the towels delivered to us and ask for some sort of accommodation for our inconvenience.  We were offered a complimentary coffee.  Yes, a coffee.  When I expressed my surprise/disgust, Kevin (who stated he was an assistant manager) on the phone with me clarified, saying it was a Starbucks coffee.  Oh, pardon me.  He asked what we would like instead and I requested a breakfast voucher for the remainder of our stay (2 days).  Was told this was not possible and that usually towels take 30 minutes to come (though we waited over an hour along with being provided misinformation about getting them from the front desk).  I stated that it was duly noted that valued Marriott members were treated in such a way wherein we had missed a prior appointment for this inconvenience.  There was more back and forth before I hung up dejected.  Not 5 minutes later, Kevin had called back and apparently the breakfast vouchers were suddenly available for us.  The breakfast area by the way is nothing fancy.  Scrambled eggs, a meat entrée like sausages, pastries and fruit were not what I was expecting, given the amount of resistance we received from Kevin for our accommodation.  On principle I did not eat anything and took one bottle of water.  The second day we went to breakfast, we were stopped by a gentleman guarding the breakfast area, stating we could only have one of our three guests eat, the exception being if we were family.  This was not true per Kevin's vouchers discussed the previous day and was further aggravating.  He promptly went to check with management before coming back to say it was ok.  Note: It is fine to have your procedures, but please realize if a customer tells you that they have been told they have access, all you need to do is say you will check.  Do not start arguing as it does no one any good.  Overall horrible experience and will not be staying at this Marriott again, possibly not at any Marriotts.  This experience has tarnished the brand in our eyes.  It will be interesting to note how management responds to this review, if at all.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location and hotel,"Recently stayed at the Denver Marriott City Center for a conference.  The rooms were updated and very nice, a bit on the smaller side but not a big deal.  The staff were just excellent and extremely helpful.  Great stay!!",5

"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hotel Located in the Heart of Denver,"My husband and I recently stayed three nights at this property.  It is located in downtown Denver near the 16th Street Mall.  Excellent location and excellent staff.  Rich, the concierge, went out of his way to help us.  Rich booked several tours for us and made sure the tour bus arrived on time and that we were properly greeted.  The staff in the concierge lounge were cheerful and always ready to help us.  We were disappointed in the housekeeping staff, but that was our only complaint.  One day it was 4:00 p.m. before our bed was made, and that was after we called the front desk to ask for someone to clean our room.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hotel Located Heart of the City Center,"Hotel located in downtown Denver is very close to all the major shopping areas and restaurants. Everything is located within walking distance. As with most major downtown hotels, the rooms are quite small. But the rooms are quite modern and clean. The rooms offer a refrigerator and coffee machine with plenty of coffee in stock. The hotel also has a good bar and a restaurant. Also located in the lobby area is Starbucks Coffee shop. Right next to the hotel is also a corner Bakery. So there is plenty of food options for the guests. The hotel does not have any parking at all. There are only two options for the guests, one is to Valet the car or to park in the parking garage across the street. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Overall it’s a good hotel located in the heart of downtown Denver.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,WOW,"I went to the Marriott to visit my brother who had told me there was a starbucks inside! When we ordered our drinks Bailey helped us and she got our drinks out super fast! which is awesome because any experience i've had with a starbucks theyre usually slow. When my brother went to get his car we forgot to call for it but Vanessa the girl outside was so sweet she said it wasn't an issue and shed have it out for us in fifteen minutes. it took them maybe 8 minutes to get our car, it was a gentleman with a black jacket on and a black beanie i didn't catch his name but he offered us directions outside of the hotel! out of any place i have been ive never been asked that and i thought it was cool. i felt it was a ""Fancy"" experience. which was incredible. When we came back the same girl, Vanessa was there! i asked her if she got a break and she kind of chuckled and said ""Yeah im just working a double today"" and i would have never known because shes so upbeat and so nice! needless to say i had an awesome experience with Miss Vanessa and Bailey! And my Brother!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Valet,"I was recently at a conference hosted at the Denver Marriott City Center. The conference organizers communicated a valet rate which was grossly incorrect and wouldn't get involved to make it right. I had planned my trip with my vehicle based on the organizer's misinformation. My valet Vanessa had heard this comment from other attendees and understanding the situation, honored the rate for me. Reasonableness and responsibility are often lacking in today's society and Vanessa and the Marriott ""did the right thing"" when the conference organizers hid from their mistake. Thank you Vanessa for doing the right thing for your customer!",4

Plenty of pubic spaces split over three floors giving room for large groups or hiding in a corner.....but the staff is everything: universally caring, helpful beyond expectation... just simply nice people doing a great job.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing people!! ,"This was a great hotel! I travel at Marriotts often and this was another wonderful experience. I love when everyone at the hotel is so kind. I was rushed to get to the airport for my flight and valet was crazy busy... the woman who I came down and spoke with, Vanessa, made sure I was taken care of immediately and I'm so thankful! Thank you for having such a great team! I will be back!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Changes to Mariott...not necessarily good,"This location has some of the nicest employees you will ever encounter. Customer service is strong and they are very kind and cordial. They want to make their guests happy. It's refreshing. The sad part is beyond their control. I intentionally booked at a full service Marriott andwilling to pay the extra amount vs  Courtyard or Residence Inn which is right around the corner. I don't like to eat out alone so I use room service a lot. I ordered dinner one evening and they told me the service charge for room service was $5.00. Ouch but ok. Then when delivered and I opened the door, there stood this nice young man with a box in his hand. A cardboard box fastened at the top. Sooo disappointed and didn't order again. I had paid $5.00 plus cost of food for someone to deliver in a box.  Food just sloshes around in  the box. Upon check out I remarked that I had expected  the bill  to be slid under my door during the night for quick and easy check out. He said they didn't do that anymore because they are ""going green"". Is this not an oxymoron? Going green so no paper bill but I'll bring your food in a cardboard box? They said it's their new system. They have a shuttle which is really nice and will drive you within 2 miles of the hotel. Getting them to take you somewhere is pretty easy. Getting a pick up to come back to the hotel is basically impossible. Tried on 4 different occasions and each time there was some issue. But even this department was very kind. The hotel is being renovated and I was in one of the newly remodeled rooms. It was lovely and clean. The cost per night to park your car here by the way is $45 per night.  I parked a few blocks away to get a little better rate. I had not checked ahead of time and should have. If you don't mind the couple minor concerns mentioned above, you will find this staff some of the finest you will encounter in a hotel. Excellent customer service.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Comfortable Stay - Great Restaurant,"We found the hotel employees to be some of the friendliest we've encountered during our travels.  The  hotel rooms were remodeled with comfortable beds, great lighting, upgraded bathroom features and ample outlets for USB charging & electric devices.  Most notable was our wonderful experience in the hotel restaurant, Prospect's Urban Kitchen and Bar.  The Restaurant Supervisor, Naomi Kniep, was so welcoming and kind when we met her in the Concierge Lounge that we were glad we tried the hotel restaurant the first evening of our stay.  One of the servers, Scott, was so fun, upbeat, helpful, and professional!  We had 3 great experiences there due to the comfortable space, the fresh and flavorful cuisine, and the great choices with both small plates and nice meal options.  Kudos to the head chef for nice preparation and selection.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent Hotel,"I was here for two days attending a conference.  Hotel is clean, service is exemplary.  Room was spacious with two queen beds.  Public transportation is conveniently nearby.  Highly recommended.  I would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good,"Very good downtown, with refurbished rooms, comfortable beds great pillows, fast internet but no buffet breakfast which is my favourite thing. Maybe others thought the same as the restaurant was empty.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Modern Comfort at Marriott,"When I checked in at the hotel I was greeted very pleasantly by the front desk. I learned that the hotel was undergoing renovations and I thought... oh, no,... noise, dust, incomplete room furnishings. Well, I was MISTAKEN... the room was really well decorated, bed was very comfortable, big fluffy down pillows (and if you prefer, foam pillows are available), and beautiful bathroom... nice floor to ceiling glass shower with full rain shower head!!  There was a large size flat screen TV, small frig, in room safe, and plenty of USB and electrical outlets for charging mobile devices and other equipment. My business trip was sort of a little vacation. Here is the downside: Food... there are not a lot of selections of food at the hotel. If you want a variety of food choices, you'll have to walk a couple or three blocks to the 16th Street Mall. What few selections Marriott has, and food quality was decent, but very expensive... not really worth it to me. I asked the Concierge where to go and I got a great recommendation for a restaurant in the 16th Street Mall called Earl's. There are other chain and local restaurants down there too. It's a short walk, so not so bad.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good location and recently renovated ,"Took light rail from airport to Union station, where hotel picked me up.  Nice newly renovated room, with EXCELLENT bed, bedding, and pillows.  Nice concierge lounge in the lobby loft area.  Employees very responsive and friendly.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Valet Disaster,"The valet service crashed my rental car and said they would take care of everything with the car rental company. Six months later I now have a debt collecting company seeking money from me as Towne Park, the valet company, is stating it is not their problem. This will be a hotel stay that cost me way more than I wanted it to. Turns out the free room they gave me at the time was just a cover-up...",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,newly remodeled rooms,I was in a newly remodeled room and it was very nice.  I like the reading lamp on the bed (how do I get this at home?)  I needed to receive a package and they were very helpful with the arrangements.  I have a nice view south.  Mainly building but some mountains as well.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good Choice In Downtown.,I recently spent 4 nights here while attending a conference at the nearby Colorado Convention Center. The hotel is undergoing renovations but it was hardly noticeable. My room was comfortable and relatively quiet. The concierge lounge is under renovation but they  have temporarily moved it to the lobby area. I thought the service at the hotel was very welcoming overall and the location is very good for anything in downtown.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Bring your noise-canceling headphones,"Light sleepers, beware:  The noise from every train whistle, police siren or loud truck in downtown Denver will penetrate your window as well as the ear plugs that the hotel provides. We stayed two sleepless nights in March 2017 (on a high floor, even) and had to leave a day early.  The hotel was undergoing renovations, but we actually heard only minimal noise from the construction work (and most of that was after 8 a.m.)  This Marriott apparently has no soundproofing whatsoever.The other major disappointment was with the bathroom in our room, which surprisingly had already been renovated.  The redesigned bathrooms feature a sliding door, rather than a traditional door.  With the 1- to 2-inch gap between the door and the opening, every noise made in the bathroom will be heard throughout the entire room.  If you're traveling alone, that's likely no problem.  But if you're with your spouse or significant other, be prepared for zero privacy in the bathroom.  I have stayed in many Marriott properties and have never seen a bathroom design quite like this.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Gorgeous, intelligent hotel","Someone with an eye for detail has designed/ renovated this gorgeous hotel. Arriving late in the evening I was simply overjoyed with the check-in experience and with my room. Spacious, calming decor, elegant and then ... Than toiletries, you are kidding me? How wonderful! A robe and good quality herbal tea. That ticks my essentials! I have eaten breakfast in the restaurant, the meatlover's omelate is perfect and the in room dining chicken cobb salad fresh, with plenty of avocado too. The conference facilities have worked very well for our meeting too. the conference food, so often a let down was top notch. A short taxi ride to Cherry Creek Mall (more on that in another review). When can I plan a return visit is my next question.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing Prospect Restaurant Staff and Concierge,"A large group of us stayed here for a conference and was treated like royalty.  Our Kentucky Wildcats were playing in the NCAA tournament and Jessica and Zach in the Prospect Restuarant made sure we had the best table in the house reserved for perfect viewing of the big screen!  They reserved the table for us for both games and it was the best place in town to watch the Cats.  Upon learning of my love of the local Boulder Hot Sauce that was served, Jessica hand delivered 2 bottles of the hot sauce and a bottle of the spice rub to our room for us to take home! Talk about going the extra mile, Jessica definitely did that!  The service at every meal in Prospect was over the top and the variety of the food served was excellent.Rich, the concierge, was also phenomenal!  He helped us immensely from before we arrived until we got back to the airport.  He checked on our group many times ensuring all our needs were met.  Rich also set us up with transportation and tours that we really enjoyed.If I ever return to Denver, this is the place I will stay!  Of all the hotels I have stayed, Denver Marriott City Center is at the top for Service!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Recently Renovated ,"This hotel is a very nice location with renovations  ongoing.  The renovation construction didn't interfere with my stay at all.  I stayed on 20th floor in a renovated room. Very nice  and modern but it wasn't as clean as I'd expect.  The bathroom counter had some stains. Staff was very friendly and accomodating.  Overall, very nice hotel with great lobby and restaraunt.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Birthday & Conference staycation,"We just spent two nights at the start of our children's Spring Break at the property for a Staycation we only live 30 minutes away but do not visit Denver enough. We were in one of the freshly renovated rooms on the top floor. Awesome service from Rich Z the Conceirge at the Marriott to provide a special bday surprise for my Husband who was celebrating his birthday Thurs 3/23 when we arrived. Rich had balloons & bubbly in the room for us and a couple Pepsi's for our children. He consulted for me with the chef who made a festive piece of chocolate cake that was in the room when we arrived. I am platinum elite so the beverages were complimentary. I only had to pay for the cake. Thurs evenings happy hour in the lounge had hearty appetizers. I enjoyed the fresh veggie selection in small mason jars too.Breakfasts were standard Marriott fare in the lounge. Kids enjoyed the pool since we woke to a rainy, chilly morning on Fri & my husband had a conference to attend at the Convention Center which is a quick walk from the hotel.Rich had also sent me a list of non touristy restaurants. We walked to 5280burgerbar a local family owned restaurant in the Denver Pavilions which had amazing ice cream in addition to good burgers.We were able to take the courtesy car a couple times and enjoyed the Star Wars Costume exhibit at the Denver Art Museum.I am sure the property will be nice when renovation is complete in approx a month but we were not bothered by construction noise. It will just be nice to have Conceirge lounge back on the top floor. And have access to beverages all day. My only complaint is $45/day for valet is steep. If we had not had to get to events on Sat. Early We would have taken the bus & used the courtesy car to save money since we never used our own vehicle the 2 days we stayed here. Overall a really nice property & centrally located for convenience.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location,Really nice and modern hotel. Typical of a Marriott and very well presented. I like the onsite Starbucks! Staff are really helpful and knowledgeable of the local area so can advise on where to go and what to see in the local area. Great location for shops and restaurants as well as tourist attractions and very clean hotel!,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Fantastic service!,"Stayed in a freshly renovated room. Everything about the downtown Marriott seemed fresh and new. The concierge lounge was temporarily set up off the lobby and the offerings in the evening and for breakfast were excellent. Evening wine and spirits for a modest fee and healthy, fresh snack options. I would not hesitate to return to the hotel, especially as a Marriott rewards gold elite member with lounge access. We were also given late check out which came in very handy for our weekend plans.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Mom,What a wonderful experience from the time I walked in.  Everyone is so helpful and friendly.  This has made my first visit to Colorado warm and inviting.  The staff was extremely helpful on hot spots that fit any of your interests including local cuisine.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Wonderful, well maintained hotel!","Stayed here for a volleyball tournament with my family and my niece's team. There were many teams staying throughout the hotel and on our floor but I never heard any of them! When you are in your room it is quiet! There was some construction going on while we were staying there but the front desk was very upfront about when and where the construction would be and even provided earplugs in the rooms if you needed them. I never was bothered at all. Our room was beautifully updated, the beds were very comfy. It made it hard to get up and head to those early morning games! We were in walking distance of the convention center, 16th street, and any place else we needed to go. The bar downstairs is a relaxing treat after a day of games. You will love this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,The refurbishment detracted somewhat.,"We stay here on a regular basis. A little more expensive than some, but the location and consistency of service brings us back.  The refurbishment caused some noise, but was not the problem. The concierge lounge was closed so that breakfast and other activities were in the main lobby.  We choose the Concierge floors, at a premium price, not to sanve the cost of breakfast, but rather for the convenience of its location.Should have warned us that the Concierge Lounge was closed.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,On Way to Excellence ,"In midst of renovations, but really did not hear much or was disturbed.  Would love it if the M Lounge remained on first floor - ideal location!  Concern has to do with F&B and housekeeping.  Food service items remained in hall for DAYS!  Housekeeping carts blocked movement in hallway - why can't Marriott be cutting edge and develop or adopt Asian hidden housekeeping?  Finally, it seems as though if the hotel strategically places tip envelopes for housekeeping staff why not for other employees?",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Comfortable and Friendly,"I was in Denver for a trade show at the Convention Center and this hotel could not be in a better spot.  Even though the hotel is undergoing renovations, I did not find it to be inconvenient, especially as most work was done while I was working at the show.  The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly and are always smiling.  They offer a local shuttle to get to and from restaurants or the Convention Center, or any place that is within a close range, this is an added bonus for a downtown hotel.  I was able to get an upgrade at check in and they moved me to a renovated room.  They did a great job with the new style rooms and I look forward to returning again to this Marriott property.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Valentines night,"Hotel is under some construction for updates. We were informed of this when we booked and when we arrived. We stayed in an updated room - it was lovely. Staff were polite and friendly. Easy to walk to excellent restaurants. No parking apart from valet, which was a bit pricey but very convenient. Overall a pleasant experience and has put my faith back in Marriott hotels.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Under construction ,The hotel is located in downtown Denver close to the 16th street mall and all the other downtown attractions.  Easy walking.  The hotel is under renovation so be aware of noise during the day.  Valet gets back up when large groups are hosting events. Food is ok. Service is ok in the restaurants and great at concierge.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Perfect location, bathrooms need an update","The location of the hotel is great, The rooms are comfortable but a little dated, the bathroom as well as the ceiling need an update. Having a Starbucks in the hotel lobby is very convenient. The service at the reception is exceptional!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Conducted a national conference here for 3 days,"VERY nice venue, with great staff support. Beautiful food and drink (lovely ice-water dispensers with citrus slices floating in them), and very responsive and friendly service. Even the porters and valets were excellent, and fun! Plenty of different spaces to have panels, talks, meeting, drinks or meals, and central to a great part of the city.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Denver Marriott City Center,This modern hotel is conveniently located in the center of Denver and about 30 minutes by car from the airport. Checkin was fast and efficient.  The room was of a reasonable size and had all of the business amenities.  WiFi was fast and reliable.  Service in the hotel was excellent.  Their elite lounge is somewhat dull but the hotel has a nice restaurant and bar.  I am not sure why but taxi drivers had difficulties to come to the hotel so allow some extra time when ordering taxis. There is nothing interesting around the hotel but office buildings and parking lots.  Overall this is a good choice for a business stays in Denver.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business,"Somewhat older hotel, now under restoration, price is high but normal for being in the city center, nice bar and good restaurant with Belgian chef.Rooms are spacious including the bathroom. Some noise from the elevators are coming in, as well as the closing doors from the other rooms. The air-conditioning can wake you up at night by starting  the ventilation for heating/cooling.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convention Stay,"We stayed here for a convention, the first night they were out of rooms so we had to stay at the Renaissance Marriott, which was just a few blocks away, and a much nicer hotel.  The room and bathroom was very small at the City Center Marriott...  The convention food was ok, I have had much better at the same convention.  The drink prices were expensive at the bar, but that was to be expected at a downtown Denver hotel bar.  We did eat breakfast twice, and it was very good...as long as it was not busy and you could get service.  We tried to eat dinner, and ended up leaving and going down to the 16th street mall because after waiting 45 minutes with a menu...no one came to take our order.  Would not spend the money to stay here again in Downtown Denver.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Close to 16th St!,"The best thing about this hotel was the location. It is right at the end of 16th St (very popular street with many small businesses, shops, places to eat, etc. So having all of that within a couple minute walk was very nice. Inside, the hotel was nice, a little cumbersome to figure out how to get around since the hotel is comprised of two separate towers. Other than that, our stay was great!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Phenomenal Stay at the Marriott with Service Way Above and Beyond!,"I'm starting to see a pattern when staying at a Marriott hotel.  First, the customer service is exceptional.  Second, the food is DELICIOUS.  Third, the hotel and the rooms are well decorated and comfortable with an excellent blend of technology and character reflecting the hotel's history.  I've never had a bad hotel experience a the Marriott, and all the other things I mentioned above have always been excellent.Our family was here for a seminar and a lifetime achievement award for my step farther-in-law.  When my wife and I travel it's not always easy for us.  My wife has food allergies (Celiacs and dairy plus others), but the Denver Marriott and their staff didn't look at that as a problem, they looked at it as a new chance to serve.  Our servers Monika Krause and Scot Corbin went way above and beyond to make sure my wife, and I had delicious food to eat.  Their manager Zach Dimmitt supported them at every turn.  Every request and question was met with kindness and enthusiasm to find a solution to our needs.  It felt like we were long time friends and not just patrons at the hotel.   Monika, Scot, and Zach couldn't wait to surprise us with solutions to the obstacles we had.All this fantastic service took place in an immaculately decorated hotel.  It felt like I was staying in a luxury home instead of just a hotel.  As you can probably tell, my wife and I had a GREAT stay here.  I would happily and enthusiastically recommend the Denver Marriott City Center.  I would also like to express my sincerest gratitude to Zach, Monika, and Scot for making our stay so great.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Misses the mark on many details,"The hotel is conveniently located and well appointed, and the staff friendly and helpful but  that all goes to set an expectation of excellence that is not fulfilled again and again.A room with one king bed is laid out pretty much as every other room of its type is but as you try to use the room and its amenities you are often disappointed.The bathroom is small.  The door swings in and there is almost no room to stand to close it behind you.  The light switches and door knob are oddly high so that fumbling in the dark in the middle of the night they just aren't where you expect them to be.The iron has adequate heat but the face seems almost sticky and doesn't slide easily over clothes.  But you may not want to iron anyway because the lightweight ironing board has a very thin cover so you end up pressing the waffle pattern of the board into your clothes.  And the only place to plug the iron in is the bathroom so you end up not being able to close the bathroom door and having the cord draped across the door to the hall.The bed looks enticing but is uncomfortably soft, as are the long, narrow pillows.  The only cover is a sheet-wrapped duvet so if you are hot during the night the only recourse is to throw it all off.For a business traveler, the desk makes promises it can't deliver on.  To the left is a panel of a/v inputs and to the right is a large TV with a thick wiring harness on the back.  It seems obvious one should be able to connect the output of a laptop to the panel and use the TV as a second monitor.  Nope.  The panel is from an old TV provider and serves no purpose other than to frustrate tech-savvy guests.  The chair is fairly comfortable but that's all I can say positive about trying to work in the room.  (Though the desk and chair are positioned so using the desk blocks off access to half the room should you be traveling with anyone.)And don't get me started about the horrible Wi-Fi service.  It is difficult to get an initial connection, resets and required reauthentication whenever your device hibernates, and cuts out for no apparent reason and the least convenient times.  While it was included in the special rate I got they usually have the chutzpah to charge for it!  The hot spot on my phone was much more reliable.The high point of the room is the single-serve coffee brewer.  Not that it is particularly remarkable but the coffee in the restaurants is so undrinkably bad that the in-room service is your only respite.The Fresh Bites in-room food menu is nice and doesn't seem to have predatory pricing.  You can call down and have something prepared for pickup or have it delivered to your room for a flat $5 fee.  Nice.  The selection and quality are fair (except the same bad coffee from the restaurant) though the execution lacks a bit; My wife and I ordered medium well burgers and got one well and one medium rare.  They have a nicely designed set of boxes and containers which fit in sharp delivery bags.  Too bad they didn't consider that french fries get soggy when you trap steam in the box.I had lunch in the restaurant and asked for some bread to go with my Caesar (""Julius"") salad.  I got warm toast and rock-hard butter, always a tell-tale of weak hospitality.  The salad itself was fairly good.Breakfast the next day was supposed to come with maple syrup for my waffle.  I got maple-flavored corn syrup.  I expect that and rarely order waffles out for just that reason but they promised ""maple syrup"" and I took a chance.  I lost.I know the hotel is being renovated but most of the problems I encountered can't be addressed with fresh wall paper.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice staff, but hotel is tired & noisy ","The title sums it up. A very welcoming and friendly staff. Unfortunately, the hotel is quite dated. They are in the process of renovating (which is much-needed). But, because of the renovations, there was very loud construction noise. Coupled with noise from the streets below, this is not a place where you can expect a restful night's sleep. In my opinion, the hotel should inform guests that floors are under renovation/experiencing construction noise at the time of booking. It is an unwelcome surprise after a day of traveling. Signs in the lobby say that the new rooms will be ready ""early 2017"". So, hopefully an end is in sight for the construction noise. One final note--cleanliness. If a room is tired/dated, can it at least be clean?! Few things are a bigger hotel turn-off than finding hair that isn't mine. There were hairs on the bedding, in the tub/shower, and on the bathroom floor. Also, the toiletries were half full at best, with the hand soap being completely empty. Oversights like this tell me that very little care is taken to prepare for guests. With so many options in the area, I'll be skipping this hotel on my next trip to Denver.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Fantastic Hotel,The people that work at this hotel make you feel like a king or queen.  They are so interactive and they seem to appear just in the nick of time when you need something.  They will bend over backwards to make you happy.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Staff is always excellent at this Marriott,"Room renovations are now taking place at this City Center Marriott, but the service from the staff is always excellent.  We were there last week attending the National Western Livestock Show.  The hotel helps to sponsor a bus that runs between the hotel and Livestock grounds.  They have done this for years and the bus scheduling has always been good, but this year it was exceptional.  Thank you Marriott!!!   We are looking forward to seeing you next year and anxious to see those room renovations.  We are hoping you can get that great breakfast buffet back in your hotel.  By the way, your concierge was fabulous.  He gave us wonderful advice and sent us to several excellent restaurants.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great Hotel and location, shame about Fresh Bites Room Service","Lovely location and nice staff at this Marriott. Room undergoing renovation and the plans look good. However I was in an old style room which to be honest was lovely and cozy, clean and comfortable. No complaints about this property except the now unavoidable Fresh Bites room service which really doesn't meet my needs. If I want basic ""fast food"" style burger I will order one in or dash out to one of the many fast food places locally (for a better price). When I am in a good hotel, tired and wanting to spoil myself I want china and a menu with choice, and proper cutlery not someone arriving at my door with a paper bag and a bottle of water (no ice available). With Fresh Bites Marriott has truly lowered the star ratings of its supposedly ""full service"" properties. Such a shame because I love Marriott, but this change alone will influence my choice for the future. This platinum lifetime member is not having his needs met so when I have a choice I will be staying somewhere that offers a better option for room service.Concierge lounge under renovation and the temporary one is dark, windowless and a dreary but the breakfast was fine. Hopefully when the new one opens it will be better.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Horrible experience with a marriott!,"As a platinum premier member and a loyal costumer to the Marriott brand this was the worst vacation that we have ever had! This Marriott has definitely let us down. The new lobby gives you a false sense that the rooms would match. The outdated tiny rooms have awful yellow wallpaper and a tiny cramped bathroom. The AC/heater unit is very noisy. The worst part was the constant noise of jack hammering from above the room. We were not warned about construction at the hotel during reserving it or checking in. Very thin walls. We could hear whole conversations from guests next to our room. We found out we could not order from the resturant and have it delivered to our room. The new menu ""fresh bites"" is a joke. Very few options. Where did the huge room service menu go and no room service cart! They brought our food in plastic containers like a delvery service. Oh and don't forget that you will get charged $42/day for valet parking! They do not give you an option to self park. This Marriott did not give the same service that we were used to. Having the platinum primer status, I have have lived in Marriotts for many years and I am very loyal to the brand for their amazing service. This particular Marriott is on the same level as a super 8 motel. Will never return to this Marriott! I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. We left this hotel feeling very tired due to not being able to get a good nights sleep.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Bad experience at what should have been a very nice hotel,"I can tell that normally this is a nice hotel with well trained staff that are there to make their guests feel welcome. It's pricy enough that I expected to be treated well. However, my stay there didn't make me feel good at all. Right off the bat the valet lost the keys to my car and it took several hours to get that issue resolved with me calling them several times and them seeming to not know what was going on. Then we asked for housekeeping to come to our room the second day and no one ever came. We had to call down 3 times before someone finally gave us some fresh towels at least. Then on our last day our bill was slid beneath our door and to my shock it was 330 dollars more than it should have been. They triple charged me for valet parking AND charged me a 250 dollar smoking fee. No one in my group even smokes! No one ever came to our room, said anything, called up, nothing. It took me 30 minutes to clear this up with the front desk when they finally discovered it was the room next door that had been smoking. They treated me like an absolute burden and nuisance. I'm glad they finally found my car and keys so I could leave and never come back. I'm still waiting for them to reimburse me the extra 330 dollars that they charged to my card before even telling me about these supposed offenses. Bad customer service! You failed Marriott.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Location, Location, Location","Nice hotel, very clean and modern.  We had a great upgrade as we are reward members. Within walking distance of many restaurants.  I thought the valet only option was too pricy - $52 per night.  Very friendly staff.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Perfect Location in Downtown Denver,"This hotel truly is conveniently and perfectly located in the heart of down town. It's easy to get anywhere from here. The room rate was around $120. Valet parking was the typical $20 overnight fee, but some downtown parking in the decks can be expensive.   We were able to walk so many places from the hotel, so once we parked the car mid-afternoon, we walked to shops and dinner.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not Impressed,"As an Elite Marriott member, I've experienced the good  and  bad of what Marriott has to offer. Unfortunately, Marriott Denver City Center is on the lower end of the spectrum - failing to meet expectations in multiple areas. Images of the newly renovated lobby create a sense of false hope, as my overall impression of this hotel is that it  desperately needs a face lift not just aesthetically, but more importantly as it pertains to customer service. In all fairness, my family interacted with a few professional people, but most left us feeling we were a bother as opposed to a guest. If this were a business trip, I might not be as critical but it was a family holiday vacation planned for months. For a family of 4 the rooms are far too small. Also worth mentioning is the subpar valet service. At a cost of $42 per day, I reasonably expect better customer experience. I was transferred multiple times just to have someone confirm that the car would be brought around within 20 min. Lastly, with no explanation from the staff the 17th floor Concierge Lounge was relocated to the lower lobby. The service was not bad, but it's temporarily located in what feels like a basement. Prior to booking I strongly debated staying at the JW Marriott in Cherry Creek; hindsight is 20/20. Proceed with booking this hotel at your own risk! I will not repeat the same mistake.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,No sleep,"Am here for work purposes 24hour stay. Arrived late, noisey neighbours in room next door until 3am, then housekeeping slamming doors all day and knocking twice on the door even though do not disturb outside. Breakfast staff lovely and food very well presented, but leaving Denver totally fatigued.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, good for biz travel!","Nice hotel with all the amenities in downtown Denver. I was on the 18th Floor (concierge lounge is on the 17th Floor and is accessible by stairs or elevator from the 18th). Rooms were spacious and clean with free wifi, coffee maker, and decent hairdryer. Note for women travelers: when I opened my room door, it was pitch black with no switch in sight. I had my phone out and used the flashlight feature to find it - very unusual to have a switch so hard to find. They offer a courtesy vehicle for drop offs within 2 miles of the hotel, which is convenient if the timing works out - I had to be somewhere at 8 a.m. and did not have time to wait 15 minutes for the shuttle to return. But the bellman quickly got me into a cab. The concierge lounge is very nice - heavy snacks (enough for a meal) and desserts in the evening with an honor bar and a nice big breakfast with lots of choices for vegetarians, meat eaters and healthy conscious diets alike. I would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hotel but the Staff Knocks It Out Of The Park!!!,"I travel nationwide for business up to 40 weeks a year. I always say that a Marriott is a Marriott (meaning this in a good way). The rooms are clean, well proportioned and nice all the way around. The differential in any place is the staff and This place takes service to the highest level and the person leading the charge is the concierge Rich Zaccagna!  This guy is AMAZING!This is only the 2nd time I have ever stayed here, in fact I didn't even realize that until I walked into the lobby. I asked the concierge where to grab a quick bite of lunch and he not only tells me a great place, he looks up, shakes my hand and says ""welcome back, I remember you from last year"".  From check in, to setting up dinner with some family while in town he is incredible. When we arrive for dinner, he has us a quiet table reserved by the fireplace and had set it all up for me without me asking. Then when I get back to my room a welcome home not and refreshment pack in the room just really knocked it out of the park!!! I've stayed in the Marriott flagship property in Times Square. Marquis hotels in Atlanta, DC, Dallas, and San Diego and even Ritz Carlton's in VA and Philly, but not one of them has ever come to the service level I have received here.   Couple the service level with location and proximity to things to do and You get a place that is a home run!!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Prospectors ,"The restaurant was great!  Had A bowl of chili, the bone in ribeye and the chicken entrée all was done as requested. I'll eat that again! The service we got was fantastic. I can't  say the rooms were as good as the food and service we received.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great lication,Just a few blocks from free 16th street shuttle. Very lively area with tons of restaurants and entertainment. My daughters favorite hotel pool and we've been to a lot of hotel pools. Not far from Union Station either if you are taking Amtrak or airport train,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Few days in Denver ,"We chose this Hotel because  of its position..just 2 blocks from 16th Street.  Our arrival  from the Airport  (make sure you get set fee in Cab) was smooth  and the reception were very efficient.  We had a very nice room, 2 queen sized beds.  The Bathroom  needs updating  but everything  worked OK",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very nice conference trip and stay,"Very good hotel in close proximity of convention center, mall, and other downtown attractions.  I have no complaints about anything.  Concierge was very helpful, room was clean and comfortable with a city & partial mountain view.  Exercise facility was large and clean with plenty of good equipment.  Watched the last game of the World Series in the downstairs bar and had some good beer and delicious pretzel bread with beer cheese.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,New and efficient - Great location - loud aircon.,"Checked in to attend a conference in the Denver Convention Centre. This hotel is a pleasant stroll away from the Convention Centre and one definitely need no cab to get there. Rooms are ok, but aircon/ ventilation is noisy and lowers sleep quality. Internet is working well. Rooms are well equipped to normal Marriott standard.Calling for the front desk took me 3 trials as they just did not want to answer the phone at around midnight when I wanted to change rooms because of the noise form the aircon. When the finally answered they could not offer another room as they were fully booked. Luckily I only stayed one night...At check out they offered some minimal Marriott Reward points as compensation... So all in all a very mixed impression.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,In the Heart of Downtown Denver,"Came downtown for company office party and stayed overnight. Comfy beds! Lots of pillows and warm bedspread. Why have hotels done away with a ""real"" bedspread and blankets? Not the Marriott. Loved the thick comforter and lots of pillows!! Great nights sleep. Enjoyed the valet parking but was surprised to have to pay for wi-fi.  Nice to wake up to an in-house Starbucks in the building .",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Heart of Denver Hotel,Hotel is in the heart of Denver.  It very busy and very clean.  The staff were excellent and ready to help with navigating Denver.  Rooms are very clean and a standard hotel room.  Some of rooms have a great views from the upper floors.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Clean / Crisp / Comfortable,"My second visit to this hotel was uneventful. Seems a bit negative, right, well as a frequent traveler, simple and uneventful rocks! No drama, exceptional service, super clean...like I said uneventful. This Great location is close to 16th street, fabulous restaurants and easy access to the mountains. Booking here is a great start to a fabulous time in Denver. Cheers!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A night downtown,"As a hotel that is categorized as ""luxury"", our overall experience was mixed. Our interactions with the front desk and concierge were fantastic. Both employees were responsive to the needs of my two friends and I. They took the initiative to go above and beyond to serve our unmet needs. The Front desk agent predicted that I may need to service the room and thus added my name to the reservation which previously had just my friends name. The concierge was able to learn about our stay and not only offer car rental places but also make us a dinner reservation on the spot. These interactions made  my friends and I feel cared about and certainly taken care of. The room, while equipped with lots of amenities, was not all that clean. It looked like someone had done a brisk and careless job of cleaning the room. Dust in multiple places and hair left on the shower wall. All we were asking for was a well-groomed room.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Ok hotel in downtown,"When SPG and Marriott merged I was very excited.  I have to say moving from the Sheraton (which usually are marginal) to the Marriott, I expected more.  The room is marginal, bathroom is similar to a laquinta, and their night menu ends at 11 but they will ""run up"" menus.  I wont be here again for sure.  the door to the room looks original, maybe circa 1970?  please stay somewhere else",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Mr. Toads Wild Ride For No Good Reason,"My issues with this hotel started before I arrived.  I was landing early and wanted to see if it might be possible to check in and be on the concierge floor.  I called the night before and was told that at 6am the next morning someone would review the inventory and assign rooms.  So when I called in the morning the woman who answered the phone was totally uncooperative.  She wouldn't tell me if I had been assigned a room, would be assigned one before I arrived and whether my status qualified me for the concierge floor.  This last was definitely strange as not sharing.  I finally called the 800 number when I landed and they told me not only that I had been assigned a room but that I was on the concierge floor.Well things changed when I checked in as Jammie checked me in and not only was she a blast of positive can do energy she covered all bases about the hotel.  You definitely felt that she was invested in you having a great visit.  Thanks Jammie and I do hope you win the Employee of the Month/Year or Ms Hospitality as you know how to make a person feel welcomed and informed.Well by Day Two we were back to strange behavior as I arrived back to my room around 9 with an intent to get to bed early, watch the world series and enjoy a bowl of strawberries.  I walk into my room to discover nothing was done, beds unmade, towels not refreshed, nothing (remember I am on the concierge floor).  Exhausted as the day before I was up at 3 am for a 5 am flight and out late the last night, had to sit down in the bar and wait for the room to be cleaned.  Management offered a drink but too tired and had tea, watched the CUBS win and decided almost a hour had passed and all should be well.  I return to the room only to find that they were still in the room which meant they did not start as promised right after I called the manager.  The bad part was they told the manager they had finished the room.  In general the housekeeping services were mediocre, beds were never tightly made, despite there being two of us we could never get more than three towels and two face clothes (asked).I was told that someone from management would contact me.  While I found a note and some cookies never heard from the management.  I was given some points by the manager who took the call when I reported that my room had not been cleaned.  Was even asked if someone could follow up by email and so far (this is the next day no email).  The housekeeping staff also sent me water and chocolate and a note of apology.  They indicated they had a meeting to discuss how not to have this happen again.  Note sounded sincere.In the room the panel for the electronics was broken so we scrambled to plug things in at night for recharging, again it was a mistake to tell the housekeeping staff as nothing was done about the requests.The staff in the concierge lounge were great.  The food was fresh lots of ripe good fruit each day.  The staff were quick to remove dishes, always inquired how you were just, it set a pleasant tone in the place.  I really liked the weekend crew who made the oatmeal and it was just like I like it,  not soupy!  There is a computer in the lounge where you can print out your boarding pass very convenient.A great thing about the hotel was the pool which was nice and warm.I came tired and left tired.  I purposely didn't stay at a cheaper hotel as I wanted the extras as I knew I would be conferencing from early morning to mid evening.  I wanted to come back and relax but between waiting for a room to be cleaned and recharging things needing to be plugged by the bed came home tired.Hope this helps you navigate.  I would suggest you find Jammie if you don't want Mr. Toad's Wild Ride!",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Denver Hotel,"I spent five nights here while attending a conference. Check in and out were both fast and easy, my room was very nice and all of the staff I interacted with were friendly. I ate in the restaurant/bar a couple of times and the food was very good, they also had the World Series on which was great. I like this hotel which is two blocks from the 16th Street Mall and four blocks from the Convention Center. It is also walkable (10 blocks) from the train station so the new train to and from the airport is a great option.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good location and good service,"The hotel is located within walking distance of the main shopping area and office buildings. The lobby and restaurants are already refurbished while the rooms still lack a modernization. However this is announced to be done next year. But even if the furnitur and carpets look a bit outdated in the guest rooms, everything is tidy and well prepared by the maids. The hotel features a well equiped gym and a pool. Breakfast is served in the basement restaurant. The service was very good and the choice of products was reasonable, only having breakfast in the cellar without any daylight is a bit odd for me.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very nice hotel and great staff,"I was here with a friend of mine to spend Saturday night. The check-in was quick and easy, they had to change my room from a king to 2 queens and it was no problem at all. The rooms smelled amazingly, everything was very clean - what I expect from a Marriott. It was pretty spacious. A/C worked great. Had breakfast the next morning in the restaurant - we ordered a la cart instead of the buffet and had to wait a long time for our food. The server was very nice but we constantly had to ask for more water. Overall experience was very nice!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Rocky Mountain High rise,"The Downtown Denver Marriott is a high rise hotel but doesn't have the feeling of a big hotel. The staff is as friendly and accommodating as you will find anywhere. The rooms are small but nicely furnished. There is a small refrigerator and coffee service in the room.The lobby is small but there are several seating areas and a fireplace. The parking options are limited and valet parking is expensive.  We used it, but never got our car out during the three days that we were there so unless you know you want your car I recommend the self-parking which is slightly cheaper. Denver is a walkable city with several public transportation options and fast and efficient Uber or Lyft.  Concierge Floor on 17th floor is nice and may be worth the extra cost. There is a Starbucks on site. WiFi is free to Marriott Rewards members.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel,This is a great hotel. The fact that the windows open enough to let in the fresh air was amazing. Loved the great friendly staff. Check in was amazing and they were very appreciative of their customers loyalty.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Noisy but great staff,"I was here on a Monday through Thursday, everything went well. Check-in, easy. Room was fine, I liked the fridge, bathroom was okay, bed is adequate and not too hard. The thermostat doesn't really do anything to change the temperature, I like it a little warmer and it never really got there even when set to 74, was more like permanently 70. I was on the 3rd floor and it was pretty noisy, I would recommend a higher floor.  Had dinner at the bar twice and was super impressed with the food and the service there. There's a 7-11 a block away if you need anything. The valet parking is expensive but you're downtown so once you're there you can walk to most anywhere. When I called for my car each morning it got there within 15 minutes every time.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Comfortable, clean conference hotel","I was pleased with my stay here, which was for a conference taking place in the hotel facilities. My room was very clean, aside from the shower curtain, which had seen better days. Beds & rest of room was fine, though! Everyone I interacted with at the hotel was very professional and kind. I ordered room service one evening and ate in the bar another evening and had no complaints--standard fare, but well done. It is a shame that there isn't free wifi in the rooms, but we had our fee waived due to the conference I was attending; this seems like the only potential downside of this place, however.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Outdated. No free wifi,"Outdated hotel for a downtown hotel. Popcorn ceilings and old furniture. No free wifi, and the business center will nickel and dime you to death. Printed 8 tickets for the broncos game. Cost $18 Terrible breakfast experience. Cold coffee, took 10 minutes for someone to take our order (restaurant was mostly empty) food tasted badRough showing at the downtown Marriott",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Has all that's expected from Marriott plus a good location,"Attended a meeting at the Convention Center in Denver.  Rooms are fine, nothing special but clean with all the necessaries.  Bed, for some reason was not the most comfortable - but could have just been my room.  Hotel restaurant offers a local accent to the usual Marriott food offerings, Starbucks on lobby level, Concierge lounge open for Breakfast and evening ON A SATURDAY!!! Walk-able to Convention Center and many local bars and restaurants. No house-keeping or staff problems to note.  Took the A line from DEN airport to Union Station ($9) and Uber to hotel (~ $8).  Effortless, clean and comfortable transit for what is normally a $75 cab ride.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, nice hotel!","We stayed there for a couple of days over a weekend! The hotel is quite nice and clean with lots of amenities. The service was excellent. The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. The location is great and you can walk to most downtown attractions and areas of interest. If you cab it or Uber it, it is $5 to $10 to most place around.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place,"Super nice staff, I was in town for a meeting  and this hotel was directly across street so I booked it.  Even with an employee  discount  I still payed 190 a night but it was well worth it.  Once they remove the guest rooms this place will be the best hotel in the city center!!! Walking distance to Union Station the 16th St Mall and everything  u need.  They gracusly  gave me a 130 pm late check out for free and all the staff where great.  I would return  in a heartbeat.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Quiet nice room centrally located,"Expensive, but average for city center. Lower level restaurants and taverns. Secure (you have to use room key to use elevator. Try the Corner bakery restaurant next door for breakfast. Parking is valet only.  Being a platinum level member, meant special 17th floor dining room with excellent breakfast , latte machine, Seattle best and Starbucks coffee bars and evening appetizers and later desserts. Very nice warm large indoor pool with both men and women's locker rooms to change and shower. Rooms are being modernized.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Loaction!  Right where we wanted to be!,Visited Denver and wanted to be right close to everything.  This hotel fills the bill.  This was our second time staying here.  Everything was at our fingertips.  Comfortable room.  Clean.  Great staff.  What's there not to love?,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Dated rooms, needs renovation","Stayed here for a weekend visit to Denver. The lobby is nice and looks to be of recent vintage. It's a bit odd layout, with a seating area 1/2 floor up from the entry. Front desk personnel were friendly. The rooms however are another story. Still sporting the Marriott corporate look of the early 1990's. with buttercream walls. The bathroom is small, and includes wallpaper that looks like it is from the original opening in 1982. Also note that the windows are somewhat small and the room was dark. Considering the prices charged, you may find more value in other properties in downtown Denver.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location!,"Quick overnight before flying out of Denver airport but all was as expected, staff helpful, room clean and comfortable!  Other reviews mentioned street noise but didn't bother us.  Lobby lounge happy hour menu was good value and great food!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing Food!,"OMG! The new menu here is incredible! I had the pleasure of sampling some of the new items. The sliders are a definite hit! Three different sliders per order. Bison meatloaf! Another one with bacon jam and blue cheese! And the last one is a braised short rib slider! Kudos to sous chef, Jay Donohue! Be sure to try this restaurant when in the downtown Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Good Place, Nothing Spectacular.","Rooms are expensive, but its City Center. I had Club Level. Room was like any place, but a few things where dirty. They need to wipe the bathroom door down. Mine had a hair stuck on it along with a few years of hairspray. Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. Carpets could stand a serious shampoo job. Easy internet access and speed was not a problem.Club Room - breakfast was good and food was warm. Nice selection. Good coffee and tea selection. Plenty of seating, but not many places to plug into if you need to charge your phone or PC while there. They close at 9am, so don't show up at 901 and expect anything. I have never seen a crew work so fast at closing. They must get off at 915 and don't want to be late clocking out. Water/coke during the day and a good selection of alcohols in the evening. Closes at 10pm.Dining - nothing fancy that I saw.  I ate at the bar and they made a custom salad to my liking. Very kind staff and more than willing to get what I really wanted, so I do appreciate that.Car rentals places are a couple blocks away, so its easy to rent a car after you get here and not deal with the airport. Taxi to the airport is 55.00.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Too noisy,Any hotel with ear plugs next to the bed is bound to be noisy.  There were so many street sounds along with paper thin walls that I changed hotels. The hotel is in such need of a makeover that at breakfast a guest said it reminds them of a cheap Las Vegas hotel.,1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very comfortable hotel for business or leisure,"I soent two nights here and was very happy with my room: it was spotlessly clean, quiet, spacious, and comfortable, with fast wi-fi. The Concierge Lounge is nice, with better than average breakfast foods. The location is great, downtown and two blocks from the big 16th Street pedestrian mall. Parking is on the high side ($42 per night for valet service). I'll stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beautifully appointed and gracious people,"During a family get-together, we had the opportunity to stay here, and enjoyed a beautiful room and truly gracious and warm staff. The concierge level was wonderful, and the additional amenities afforded to us were lovely.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel to stay at,This is one of the nicer marriott's I've stayed in. Valet parking isn't worth it with a nice parking garage right around the corner at ~15/day. Great staff upgraded our room to one with a view. A good lookout of the city from the 20th floor. Restaurant was good if a little pricey. Would stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beautiful Marriott,"I have been with Marriott for over 15 yrs. Thus is one of the best hotels they have. The front desk personal were extremely frienday and professional, waiting time to check in was less than 4 minutes, luggage arrived also within 5 minutes of entry into our room. Order room service. Food was hot and delicious.We ordered at 3:45 pm,was told about 30 minutes, arrived in 15 minutes. Just GREAT service. Would recommend this Marriott property. BILL MILLER,Platinum Member.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Pretty hotel lobby, nice stay.","The rooms we had were small though connecting which we requested. Really pretty entry way with a fireplace, and bar area. Starbucks downstairs is a nice feature. The pool is nice too, which there was a hot tub though.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location & Super Staff!,I recently stayed at the Denver Marriott City Center for the NFL Kickoff and enjoyed my stay very much! The staff is super accommodating and there is a full Starbucks in the lobby -- what more do you need! The rooms are nice and there is a good restaurant on the lower level too. The banquet food was good too. Great central location in downtown Denver!,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient location,"This is the 2nd time we've stayed here; the really great part of this hotel (if you get a ""decent"" price) is their proximity to the light rail.  They are at the 18th and California stop, be aware that the ""F"" line doesn't run on holiday's but you can take the D or H line and transfer to the E line at Alameda.  The hotel is within walking distance to the 16th street free shuttle, and some other shuttle bus that goes to Union Station (also free) but runs only during rush hour.The bed itself was so-so; we were able to cool down the room to an ok temperature.The staff is always friendly, and room service breakfast (the last time we were there) was wonderful (but pricey).  We didn't explore the hotel too much so I can't tell you what other amenities they really have.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Enjoyable stay...,"Our stay was 'as expected' for a full-service Marriott.  We enjoyed our weekend.  We liked the location, and we liked that it was a larger property with platinum amenities on the weekend (the lounge was actually open on the weekend).  Our only though is that while the rooms are immaculate and the furniture is in good condition, they are outdated and there are not enough plugs/outlets in the rooms.  The rooms are spotless (and I am picky).  The hotel is actually the process of renovating the rooms, so we are excited to visit again and see the renovation. The staff was friendly.  Rooms service was great.  Housekeeping was fantastic.  Will visit again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beware of Valet Parking,"I recently stayed here while in town for business. Overall there is nothing to write home about or even on TA about this hotel. The lobby is average, the rooms are average, the amenities are average. It is in a good location for Denver. The price was okay. My best experience came when dealing with the Concierge. Very well connected in town and had some great suggestions throughout my stay. The one thing that you need to be warned about is the valet parking. It is totally not worth it. You are better off parking across the street in the self park because they themselves do not park the cars on property. They park them down the street at a garage and so it can take them up to 30 minutes to get you car to you.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good location and decent overall,"Great downtown location.  Our main reason for staying here was to be able to walk to Coors Field to catch a Rockies game.  That worked out great - only about 10-15 minutes walk.We got put on the 15th floor with mountain view.  Not bad, not bad!  Had our baby with us and they provided us a 'pack-n-play' free, with clean sheets and baby blanket, so that was a bonus.Popcorn ceiling (didn't bother me at all) was a good indication of the age of this hotel, but I didn't have any issue with anything at all.  Overall, I would recommend this place and would go back again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Decent,  rooms are good.","Hotel is not in newest shape, once you get to residential floors. Carpet, bathroom was all outdated. Lobby, and all downstairs is brought to modern, though. Location is quite good. You are 2 mins walk from famous pedestrian mall, taking a long stretch of area.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Don't Valet Park on the Weekend ,"Parking is only $6/24hrs versus $42/24hrs to valet park on the weekends.  It makes sense on the weekdays to valet because the price is only slightly less expensive at the nearby lots but not on the weekends.  Also the Pioneer Pizza flyer in the room is actually the in house restaurant as after 11 pm the number dials to the front desk.  Still ok greasy cheesy pizza though.  Overall I liked this Marriott as we were able to walk to Larimar Sq, the Tattered Cover, Rockmount Ranch Wear, Denver Pavilion, and Union Station.  The workout room and pool were large and not busy.  They had local beers at the bar.  Starbucks in the lobby was nice.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place for a conference.,I recently attended a conference at this hotel.  The accommodations were outstanding.  This is an older hotel but has done a great job of remodeling both the rooms and the lobby.  The location is excellent conveniently Located on a light rail stop and just a block from the 16th street mall.  This was a great place for a conference.  The rooms were comfortable and the AV services were flawless.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Hotel; Expensive Bar Food,"This is a large hotel in south downtown Denver about 1 mile from the train station coming from the Denver airport.  There is a free bus down the sixteenth street mall which takes you a block from the hotel, but it was really crowded on a Thursday afternoon.  Hotel shuttle took us back to the train station when we left.  It's a typical Marriott.  We were tired when we arrived so stopped in the bar for small bites....rather expensive for bar food (caeser salad with chicken $14).  There is a Starbucks in the hotel, but the one in the next block was less crowded for breakfast.  The hotel shuttle is strict on the area range in which they will transport you.....we wanted to go to the Botanic Gardens, which was slightly out of its range, so it dropped us in a neighborhood with inaccurate directions to walk to the Botanic Gardens.  Take a Lyft instead.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great service overall,"We stay at a lot of Marriott Hotels for biz and pleasure.  First time at this one for pleasure and it was overall a very good experience.  The front desk staff was very pleasant, the lower level bar/restaurant had excellent service, and the valet service was INCREDIBLE.  Very prompt and courteous, very professional.  Only challenge we had on our stay was the laundry service in the room (towels, etc) got skipped one day - more of a miscommunication at the front desk thinking we wanted points instead of a room cleaned, but it was straightened out quickly.  The Concierge club level is very nice, good food and selection.  Also, the pool area, exercise room is spacious and inviting.  We loved the location of the hotel close to the downtown mall area with shops/restaurants and very easy in/out access.  We would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"The stars, nor moon ,nor sun shine on this hotel","Odd, a hotel that highlights their business connection does not have an accessible computer terminal nor printer after 3 PM on a Saturday. Odd that the front desk clearly knew they couldn't help me and offered no solutions.  Odd , that when I asked the bell desk for a cab to suggest a location with a working terminal and printer that they had no input.   Rooms are less than standard: no coffee or tea,  one towel , and washcloth.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel,The accommodations were as expected for a Marriott.....the lounge served great food and drinks on an honour system....the gym was clean and lots of equipment.....close to local attractions...staff were very friendly,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Typical Marriott.  Nothing more, nothing less.","Once you enter your room at this downtown Marriott, you could be at the Detroit airport Marriott or the West Palm Beach Marriott. It has the old carpet and fixtures, but comfortable bed with white duvet and practical desk that I expect at a Marriott. It's within walking distance of lots of good restaurants, and the Club is even open with free breakfast on the weekends.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Just average and needs the scheduled facelift!,"We stayed a couple of nights here. Just average with dated rooms and ok service. The valet parking was a nightmare and could take 20 min to get the car. Nice guys but the entrance is very congested. We were first ""upgraded"" to a 19th floor room but it was a hospitality suite with only a Murphy bed so we went down to the 4th floor. Nice at-your-service people.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Standard Marriott,"All the standard blandness you have one to know from this chain.  The common areas have been re-done according to the current Marriott design format.  The rooms are still in the early-00's decor (with the red glass lamps) and are beginning to have a worn look.  Was here for a conference, which was well-run with standard Marriott banquet service.  No accommodation for children.  Stay here only for conferences.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hard to say but better than the JW Cherry Creek...,This hotel really surprised me. It's in a great location near 16th Street Mall and other upscale restaurants and business. The concierge staff and I'm so sorry I forgot his name I want to say rich was so friendly and helpful and made reservations right as soon as I walked in for the Capital Grille last minute and I was very impressed. The front desk staff was also very friendly gave me a great room with a nice view and the room was smaller than the Cherry Creek JW however it was clean and still very nice. I did not eat at the restaurant but the restaurant area looked very nice. The only issue I had was with the valet staff. It was absolutely insane and horrible. They have no clue what they're doing they are completely under staffed rude and get ready for a long wait even the communication between the front desk and valet is completely messed up if you call down to the valet desk and they don't answer their phone and you call the front desk for your car there is somehow no communication with the ticket that you give to the front desk and the valet stand and when you get downstairs to find out that your car hasn't been pulled up yet it becomes very frustrating especially at almost $49 and up per night for valet parking absolutely not worth it the car should be there within minutes.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Centrally located ,"The downtown Denver Marriott is a centrally located hotel in the heart of downtown.  The rooms were good and the gym had plenty of equipment.  The ambiance and service were up to Marriott standards.  I spent a bit of time and the bar and he bartender was very informative and made a great old fashioned.  A downside is the parking.  As with any downtown hotel, parking is expensive and I opted for valet due to some tight appointment travel times and they were very attentive and expedient.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Quality, comfortable, attentive service in a good location","Realizing this property has been around awhile, that sometimes can be a caution, but since this was a convention hotel, I booked and was pleased by the attention paid to the details, great upkeep, and overall high quality of the product. The beds were extremely comfortable, staff very well trained and focused, and food service and convention staff excellent. It is really easy to get to most places downtown from this location either walking or using the RTD.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good location downtown.,"Clean rooms, nice pool, and comfy beds.  Within walking distance of Mint, downtown shopping and restaurants, and other attractions.  Parking costs are pretty steep though so be prepared.  We can in three vehicles ($$$)  Otherwise, a great stay.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location!,Great location... easy walking to local attractions & restaurants.  The check-in staff and concierge were friendly and helpful.  Our room was above standard and our bed was very comfortable.   The lobby area is large and welcoming with many sitting areas.  We used the valet parking and they had our car ready for us at 4:00 AM the morning we were leaving for the airport.  No complaints at all!,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not up to Marriott Standard,"Upon driving up to the Denver Marriott City Center after being on the road for 8 hours, the valets kept rushing us.  All we wanted to do was get our things from the car in an organized manner.  Then we had to wait at the registration desk for 15 minutes as there was only only one person checking people in and that person was having a good time chatting with a few folks (not checking them in).The room was ok.  But the HVAC did not work properly and we could not get the room to cool off and stay comfortable.  Although the engineer came up when we arrived and said cool air was being generated, it would turn off well before the room cooled off to a comfortable level.  We kept the thermostat at 63 degrees and felt stale air all night.  We did complain and the manager removed the parking fee and awarded me 2000 extra points to accommodate (pretty nominal since a level one room is 7000).  Also, wireless does not require a password, so I am questioning how they make this a secure wireless...  Not a good practice for a major hotel.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent as usual,"I stay at Marriott locations when I travel and this one ranks up with the rest of them. You get everything you'd expect from a Marriott hotel. My only complaint is the concierge service was average. There was no hostess, limited drinks & snacks and no alcohol.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location but noisy,"I had a business meeting here for a couple of days.  I give the room 3 stars and the conference room 2 stars.I was on the 15th floor but I could still hear the street noise and train.  I didn't sleep well as a result.  The bed was comfortable and the location was great.  I was surprised that my flat screen was a 32 inch and not 42 inch.They really messed up with our conference room and gave us a much smaller room than we were sold.  To make matters worst, they had no A/C and we had to ask for fans.  It felt like a sauna and I was wearing a suit.  The food wasn't that that great either.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good stay ,The lobby of the hotel was very nice and was pleased that the staff was able to accommodate a 9am check in. Although not a guarantee that is a nice perk. The executive lounge was very nice and overall the facility was good . I would stay again for sure .,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent Location,"Good basic service, decent breakfast buffet, rooms a bit dated. Your average Marriott... I would opt to stay at the Brown Palace next time and regret that I had not researched hotels more thoroughly when I booked to attend a national conference. Though they had shuttle service, they were not always available when I was there. It was sporadic... My room was left uncleaned twice though a large conference was in town so that might have been happening at other hotels as well.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great Location, but rooms need updating.","I'm a big fan of Marriott.  This property has a great central Denver location and the lobby area has been nicely updated.  The rooms have been somewhat renovated, but still have a very ""dated"" feel to them ... low ceilings, bathrooms in need of better lighting, etc.  On the upside, the staff are very friendly and helpful, the linens and bedding are awesome (I'm a stickler for nice sheets!).",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Aging hotel with maintenance issues,"Not a bad hotel, not a good hotel.  Just an average Marriott and thus very average.  My room had maintenance issues with a leak and stuck toilet in the bathroom.  As we all know when traveling on business you expect things to be working properly. The hotel is about 15 minute walk from the primary restaurant and shopping on Larimer street but there are some good restaurants close by.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Center City Marrriott,"This hotel is located just blocks away from the Downtown area of shops, restaurants and street performers.  The hotel is big has 5 operating elevators yet you always have to wait for one.  The standard room is okay but the entry to the bayjrrom is tiny and the bathroom is very cramped. The concierge lobby on the 17th floor is nice, great views and offer a good variety of food every night.  The coffee maker is challenging to use and they usually don't have enough coffee in thermos for the peeps who just want a regular cup of coffee.  at least 4 out of the day stay, I could smell sewer in my room and outside the front door walkway.  The UPS store located in the building is very nice and convenient.  It took 3 days to get a copy of my bill as it did not come in under the door morning of departure.  I checked out 5 days ago and I am still waiting for the charges to be adjusted for a corporate rate.  I am a true Marriott member however I will not stay at this particular hotel again.  I will one of the other Marriotts in the city.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Location, Location, Location","This hotel has great service (Thank you, Jamie!) as do all the Marriott brands however, the rooms are dated.  Location cannot be beat.    Check in was smooth and easy.  I checked in via the Marriott app.  We got to the hotel around 10am and expected to wait till normal check in time before getting our room.  We checked our bags with the concierge and started our day.  Within 45 min Marriott text me that our room was ready!  Jamie at the front desk was amazing!Room location was awesome, corner King on the 14th floor.  Minimal noise from the city and no noise from other hotel guests.  The room itself was very spacious.  Husband and I had plenty of room to sprawl out.  King bed linens were noticeably worn and the mattress topper kept coming off.  The bathroom was so SMALL.  The door to the bathroom was even small.  Only one person is getting ready at a time, barely enough room between the toilet and the shower.  The shower/tub was leaking causing mildew around the water spigot.  It was a shower experience where you want to not touch as much as possible and get in/out quick.  If it were not for Jamie and the excellent customer service (and my AAA discounted room rate) this would have been a three star rating.We ordered room service one night.  Everything came fast, hot and yummy.  Also requested extra towels and those were delivered within 10 minutes.  I would stay again for a reasonable rate.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Marriott right downtown!,"We visited Denver to attend a Colorado Rockies game against the Atlanta Braves.  We stayed at the Marriott and it was within walking distance of Coors stadium, plus the hotel had a shuttle that would take you there if you wanted to do that.  There was a parking structure just down the street that cost $6 rather than $42 valet parking.  The hotel staff gave us this information.  The room was clean, bed was comfortable, good shower and we were given a concierge card.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wish I could stay for more than one night,A very clean and comfortable hotel in downtown Denver. The desk personnel were nothing short of excellent (work with Tony if he is available). The rooms spacious (1502) and clean. Enjoyed the concierge lounge - well stocked with a variety of food (both snacks and breakfast) and a top-shelf self-pay liquor assortment to satisfy most taste. Rarely do I leave a hotel and actually self-comment that it was a nice experience as I was not on holiday - in Denver for a business meeting. Only drawback is that parking is rather expensive by most standards.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Casinon Night at the Mariott.,"I dealt Poker at the hotel. I noticed the help were all dressed  and took pride in their approach to customer service. I managed a few restaurants when I was younger and still tend to notice how things are run. The rest room was clean and well stocked. I was impressed by the servers, they responded swiftly to the needs and requests of the guests. As the  evening moved on the music was entertaining and all the people on the dance floor seemed to really enjoy themselves. I could say a good time was had by all.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Service at the front desk,"We were at this hotel for 4 nights.  We utilized the front desk services often, and were extremely fortunate to have Ms Jamie Orgill assist us.  She is very knowledgeable and helpful.  And she does it all with a friendly smile.  We would go back to this hotel for service like she gave alone, but the location was excellent, too.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Tired and missing on Marriott experience,"This is a very old Marriott property. Although they refurbished the lobby a few years ago you will find the rooms, the guest floors and many of the amenities to be tired and dated. As a longtime loyal Marriott person I was surprise to find the service during our stay to be below normal standards. Front desk staff and housekeeping were notable disappointments. In Denver I would recommend making the upgrade to the Renaissance over the dingy and dated rooms of this property.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"The Lobby is Stunning, The Room was Smelly","We just wanted a nice evening away and a little bit of pampering in a swanky hotel. The lobby is lovely. The room, while spacious, was smelly. The bed was not comfortable. The ceiling is the popcorn ceiling. It smelled like it was once a smoking room. Very disappointing. For close to $400 for the night, we would have done better at a Holiday Inn Express. FYI--parking was $42.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Super location,Great location! Super staff and very comfortable rooms!Would stay here again!Conveniently located near the convention center. Great place for breakfast!!Beds were comfortable and rooms were very clean and modern.Can self park or valet.. We used both and found it easier to valet for just a little more money.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location and great staff,We stayed at this hotel two nights. Very friendly staff. Great location. Hotel parking was expensive but you can park one block away for 5.00 on the weekends. I would stay here again based on location and staff.  Short walk to 16th street and fun.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,The Best Moment in a Terrible Day of Travel,"I had an awful day of traveling with the airlines and ended up having to spend the night in Denver, CO. Dan at the desk gave awesome directions to the airport shuttle and then provided my group a comp upgrade when we checked in at 2am. Thanks Dan for turning a terrible day into at least a good nights sleep and being so nice at 2am. The room itself was well appointed and was very clean. It's nice to know that I can always get quality when booking with Marriott. Would highly recommended this hotel to anyone.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent full service hotel,"Super friendly and helpful staff at every position. Nice rooms and central downtown location next to the outdoor mall. Couldn't ask for more. Valet parking at $40 was a shock for Denver,but the self parking near by is a pain so it ended up worth the extra $20.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Small beds,"Our family is in Denver for a Rockies game, we decided to stay at the Marriott. First off the parking is 45 dollars a day, plus three bucks more due to driving a Truck. Second and most important the beds in our room are slightly bigger the my college dorm room bed. Stay out of down town and from the Marriott. It's not worth the money.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,No frills hotel,"Hotel was fine but nothing special. My room was small but served the purpose. The fitness facilities are adequate and contain all of the equipment you need for getting in a good workout. The hotel is in a convenient location in downtown Denver, very close to restaurants and shopping. There is a ""Corner Bakery"" directly outside the hotel with inexpensive breakfast options. The rooms are a little outdated but I think a renovation is coming per a handout in the room and it looks like the lobby areas have already been updated. If you're a light sleeper, I recommend bringing earplugs. The downtown location is great but the sounds of sirens and trains are ever present!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel and staff,"The rooms are ok, not memorable but worked perfect for a business trip. Staff and location are great. Easy walking distance to restaurants and ballpark. The meeting space is older with lower ceilings and banquet staff is not as friendly as the remaining staff throughout hotel.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Courteous staff,"We got stuck in Denver for an extra 2 nights, when our flight out was cancelled due to storms.  We were exhausted & cranky when we arrived at the Marriott, only to find that we had made a mistake in reserving a room.  The front desk staff were gracious & helped us problem solve.  They gave us access to a concierge lounge, even though we are not any sort of Marriott Rewards members.  This meant we had free breakfast, a place to conduct business with a great view of the city, free appetizers before dinner, an honor bar, & free desserts at night.  This made up for not being able to make it home!Every interaction with staff was incredible.  Everyone went out of their way to make sure that 2 people in a hotel of hundreds were happy.  There is even free laundry, with free detergent & fabric softener.  While we were there, the hotel was the host hotel for a lacrosse tournament, and the staff handled rowdy boys (& inattentive parents) with patience & grace.  This place gives new meaning to service.  I usually don't stay in chain hotels, but I am now a fan of the Marriott.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A very nice Marriott in the center of it all in downtown Denver.,A very nice Marriott in the center of it all in downtown Denver. I'm a Platinum Marriott Rewards Member and we were evaluating the Marriott for a meeting in 2018.  Ended up in the Presidential Suite.  The hotel is undergoing a renovation over the next year+.  The areas that are finished are great.  The Prospect’s Urban Kitchen & Bar had great food and outstanding service.  We picked the Marriott over other hotels in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel... the excellent staff really stood out,"I just stayed at the Marriott for 3 days while attending a conference.  The location is great.. right downtown, easy walking to everything. The 16th street mall which has free bus service every few minutes is just a couple of blocks away - which easily expands the places you can visit without a car.  My room was fine.. modern and clean.  What stood out was the extremely friendly and guest-focused staff.  Every time I had an interaction with someone it was a nice experience. I could tell that the staff really cared about the guest services they provided.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Good location, friendly staff, rooms are a little outdated","While the Marriott is in a great location (close to a number of stores/restaurants), the rooms are rather basic looking, and could do with refurbishment.  The staff were friendly, and food was good.  Wifi worked well.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Overpriced hotel, not really living up toi standards of a Marriott","I stay at Marriotts frequently. This one was very forgettable.   Paying a full rate for a Marriott in a big city, I was expecting more.   I reserved a room for three, and was supposed to get a pull out sofa bed for third guest, but that wasn't included.  The hotel is rather drab, and the rooms small.    For Denver, I was expecting better.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Marriott Location is Great, Rooms Are Expensive and Shabby",From the beginning the valet parking and baggage bellman assistance was disastrous. The building looked great but getting in was a hassle. The check in process was ok.  The room was small and the bathroom was slighly bigger than a phone booth. I suppose Marriott will offer great locations but downtown Denver needs to served by a different approach to room design. Food was similarly expensive but the fare was nicely prepared.  The Sunday Brunch was satisfactory.I would look elsewhere next time.  The Bellman service and valet parking was slighly worse than arriving.,2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel ,Great location and very friendly staff. I was here for a conference. Meeting rooms were nice and food served was good. I used the business center which was great to have access to. Close to downtown resturants bars and shops..about 2 blocks.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business Trip,"Stayed here for a 3 day conference. The hotel location is great. Within walking of many sites.The staff was friendly and helpful.While the cleanliness of the hotel was good, it is tired and in need of some updating. A lot of wear and Tera is starting to show. Since it's right in the heart of downtown you can hear a lot of street noise. They even give free earplugs in the room for the noise.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Location, Location, Location","Don't get me wrong - these rooms are extremely nice and the common areas are generous and well-appointed - but location is key here. If it isn't walking distance from the Marriott, you may not need to be going there. The only drawback I'll mention is the cost of parking. We had Friday and Saturday night stays, and there are several excellent (less expensive) options right across the street. Not sure if the situation is the same on weekdays. If you need assistance or would otherwise enjoy the fine valet service here - by all means. If not, I believe you have options. Enjoy this fine location!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great location, near to everything, yet away from the crowd","For a Marriott brand, the quality of the rooms and the service befit my expectations. Spacious room, king size bed, near to the heart of Denver, easy access to food places, yet away from the crowd. The only disappointment is the absence of a kettle and a mini fridge, which I genuinely didn't quite understand. I have visited so many hotels, and this is the first without any of the essentials. Puzzling. Perhaps Marriott would wanna enlighten...",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel / So--so Executive Lounge,"Nice hotel. Good location. Easy access to 16th Street Mall, restaurants, public transportation, and convention center. Excellent breakfast in the executive lounge. If you are used to lounges in Asia, Europe or Latin America, the evening reception in the lounge is going to be a major disappointment. Limited food items and, of course, the infamous US-style ""honour bar.""",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Conference,Stayed here for a conference in the hotel.  They did a great job and he hotel was top notch.  The concierge breakfast was fantastic and the staff was excellent.  My only complaint would be the elevators.  There are four but for some reason the wait times after calling an elevator are unreasonably long.  Small complaint over all.  Great hotel!!,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Relaxing Trip,"We really enjoyed our stay-great location and renovated property. I was very happy with the service as well! Comfortable beds and again, location, location, location!We did not eat in the restaurant because our Marriott Rewards status allowed us to use the club suite-continental breakfast that was good.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very good.,"Excellent location in downtown Denver, everything one needs is within walking distance. The lobby area is spacious and has loads of sitting space with lovely decor and a cozy fireplace. The staff is extremely polite and friendly, they can't do enough to help. I was assigned a newly refurbished room on the 15th floor: wooden floor, new walk-in shower, great lighting, a handy L-shaped couch which gave the room a ""mini-suite"" kind of feeling: great improvement. Room service was quick and the food was excellent. Good breakfast buffet on the lower level at a reasonable price.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Stay,"I stayed here with a small group meeting for 2-nights. My stay was great. It is what I call a ""standard"" Marriott, very similar to the rooms your find in Salt Lake and Portland. Might have been built during the same period of time. I was upgraded to an executive suite on the 19th floor and had more than enough room. The bathrooms are a bit small but they are fine. The best part of this hotel was the service. Everyone I dealt with, from check-in to meetings was very helpful and professional. Made my stay more enjoyable. The property is in a good location, walking distance to many restaurants and shopping. Gym is nice and there is an indoor pool. Our meals were provided with our meeting so I didn't actually done on site. The other bonus is that the concierge lounge is open on the weekend. Limited hours, but open. I would definitely go back.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Marriott Denver City Center,"The Marriott is centrally located to many popular tourist and business traveler destinations from 16th St. Mall to Elways Restaurant in the Ritz.The hotel has all amenaities one could ask for. Friendlyand spacious  bar/lounge; great restaurant, very friendly checkin/out staff. Bell men are at your service. We love the car that will take you to any location within Denver proper. We usually head to the art district/ or the new Union station area. You will not be disappointed in this Marriott. Rooms are spacious, not always the best views, aka mountain view, but still good.Great for walking to many areas in downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Fab location, good room, great facilities","Stayed for two nights, arrived really late about 0030 but everything was ready as I had used the Marriot app and let the hotel know I was late. All was noted.  Easy to get to from DEN airport - take the light rail train ($9 one way) took 40 mins to Union Station. From there I took the free mall ride bus (5-10mins) and then a 5 minute walk to the hotel (2 blocks).  Cost in a taxi would be $55 - $70.   Hotel was great , the gym  was really well equipped better than a lot of hotel gyms i've been too...notably in Vegas.  Pool was good too - 5 ft in the deep end and was fairly warm. Never had breakfast and got free wifi as a Marriot member.  Room was fairly big lots of storage space and a large safe which easily fitted my 15'6 laptop. Hotel is really well located on 18th and California and near so many restaurants and bars. Also does a free shuttle in two miles radius I believe but I never used it Found it really easy just to walk everywhere and there was coffee/tea making facilities in the room. Definitely stay again if I'm ever in Denver .",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Comfortable Stay,"Arrived to the hotel and they were able to accommodate an early check-in which always wins major points with me! The hotel lobby is nice and has a Starbucks - always helpful in the mornings.The room was clean and perfectly comfortable. Room service menu is limited but looked like it would have been good (I ate out each night). Water temperature in the shower fluctuated drastically from time to time, but overall this was a comfortable stay. Nothing super memorable, but pleasant enough.Location is great - close to the bustle of 16th street and the convention center. The only thing I found a bit dated was their lack of free internet. C'mon Marriott - it's 2016. Who makes customers pay for internet anymore??",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Perfect Location, Comfortable","I stayed for 2 nights when in town for business. The location was perfect, just a short walk to everything, including Union Station. I was on the 14th floor, away from traffic and the sounds of emergency vehicles. The bathroom is large, I like that the sink was separate. The shower had good water pressure and the towels were thick and plentiful. I'd definitely stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Adult oasis for the long term business traveler.,"Work travel required me to take several 2-3 week trips to Denver.  The Marriott City Center is the best place to stay.  One block from the courthouse and government buildings.  One block from the 16th St Mall which is close enough to enjoy all the stores/restaurants but just far enough to avoid the noise/partiers/home-less at night.  The hotel has one of those bike share racks right out front which comes in handy for exploring on the weekend.  Free shuttle service to anywhere within a one mile radius which makes it handy if you take the new metro back and forth between the airport and Union Station. On the third floor is a free washer and dryer with free soap and softner; since most people don't stay long enough to do laundry, I never had to wait.  The wifi is fast.  No problem streaming a movie even using their standard wifi.  The free concierge lounge (only available for marriott rewards members) is perfect for a quick breakfast: eggs, sausage, toast, oatmeal, juice, etc. and Starbucks coffee.  In the evening the lounge serves free appetizers and desserts and has an honor alcohol bar.  The hotel restaurant is better than most (although the service sucks at peak times) and good for when you are too lazy to go anywhere.  If you're there for a long stint, ask for a corner room.  They are bigger and have a mini fridge.  All in all, the perfect place to stay for a long trip.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Service and good location,Stayed two nights over the weekend. Service is very friendly and very helpful the location is great it is almost walking distance to most places downtown and very close to the public transportation. If you fly in to Denver try to take the new University of Colorado Train to Union Station and from Union station it is only 20 min walk or you can take a cab for $6 excluding tip or Uber or Lyft which I mostly prefer if there is no surcharge. I suggest not to valet your car at this hotel it is $42 a day which is outrages. To the GM:  lower your valet prices or educate your hotel guests that there are cheaper parking around the area.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Mixed Bag!,"I recently stayed at the Denver Marriott City Center. My stay could be best described as a ""mixed bag"".As a Marriott Rewards Platinum member, I arrived to the lobby and the gentleman at the front desk for Elite Members had trouble registering me. Although I had changed my date of arrival in Marriott.com and received the appropriate confirmation, there was a glitch with the hotel's system and they still had me arriving the following day. As the gentleman could not solve the issue, he called the Front Desk Supervisor who was extremely kind and professional, even offering a room upgrade.The Executive Lounge had one of the coffee machines broken and the computer was also broken. As I needed to print an important document and the UPS Business Center does not open on weekends I faced a challenge. The front desk supervisor arranged with the Concierge, Rick, so that he would allow me to print my documents in his computer. Rick was fantastic, friendly and highly efficient!If it was for the Front Desk Supervisor and for Rick this hotel deserves a 5 star rating.The lobby also looks very nice and modern.With respect to the rooms, I feel they do need a makeover. Additionally, the upgraded King Executive Room I was assigned had perhaps the tightest bathroom I have ever seen. Barely the tub and the toilet fit under the tightest spaces.I also found the food does not hold up to the Marriott standards.In summary, if it would have been for the service, especially the Front Desk Supervisor and the Concierge, I have given the hotel a 5 star rating. On the other hand, based on the room, the Executive Lounge and the food, I would have given the hotel a 3 star rating.Considering the average of both is why I am giving a 4 star rating to this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location,"Great friendly service.  Walking distance to public transportation and close to restaurants and convenience stores.  Valet parking though was over priced.  If you drive around there are way cheaper alternatives.  I was disappointed that there was no complimentary bottle of water or refrigerator in my room, but there was a small safe for my valuables.The room seemed smaller than another downtown hotel that I had previously stayed.  The front desk was very helpful in recommending transportation and nearby restaurants.  I did not get to use the gym but when I peeked in it was comparable to other Marriott sites that I have stayed.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not the usual Marriott excellence,"I stayed 3 nights here for a conference. I thought the US359 per night plus tax was unjustifiable. Usual good room (2037) which was a corner room which may have something to do with it. But, the air conditioning is clunky and noisy. No safe in the room. Bath tub very slippery but no shower mat. Only one small bottle of complimentary water for the entire stay. The bedding is Marriott exquisite,  and a good work area. Did not justify the price tag in my view. Be careful, Marriott! You still have to worry about value for money.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Superb location, helpful staff","The hotel is in a very central location, so everywhere I wanted to go was within a 15-minute walk. The room was very well appointed, and I was disappointed that a refrigerator wasn't available in such a nice hotel. However, a sign in the room indicated that if I wanted a fridge, I could request one, so I picked up the phone to do just that, and it was delivered within the next 30 minutes. How's that for service?From check-in to check-out, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. I'd definitely recommend this hotel if you're looking to stay in downtown Denver.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"A beautiful hotel in a great location. The concierge lounge had a nice breakfast and evening appetizer selection.  Our room was nice with a great view. The front desk conceirge was very helpful and knowledgeable of the area.

"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Top Notch, exceeds","I visit this location at least 2-3 times a year and they never disappoint. This last visit was a challenge as the hotel was sold out for a few conferences but I wasn't a part of the conferences and checked in with no rooms on the concierge suite (which I qualify for).  The front desk associate worked hard to find me a suitable room with the sold out scenario.  My room was just fine on floor 11 and her service level was appreciated, although not on level 17 but access was granted. The restaurant downstairs is awesome, had the best Salmon and the best Service.  This is my go to place, they make you feel welcomed and the service is top notch.  Well done Marriott!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great central location,The staff here were great.  All very friendly.  Room was clean as were the common areas.  Concierge lounge was a big hit with my three year old as he loved that it had stairs - and cheese.  Nice views from higher floors.  I was here for a conference and thought the meeting spaces were very nice with good temperature control.  They have a free shuttle for stops downtown and are located very close to a light rail stop.  Overall very good stay.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Society of Exchange Counselors marketing meeting,Very nice hotel in Denver's central business district.  A little pricey but right in the middle of a lot of the action in Denver.  Rooms were nice and comfortable.  Service is great.  The employees seem to be empowered to make some decisions which translates to they really can and try to help you if you need something.  Thats a big deal to me because it not only enables better customer service but shows managements commitment to it as well.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location and new clean room with great breakfast,"Great hotel with respect to location, service, room and the executive lounge.

"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beautiful view ,"Very cozy hotel, walking distance from the strip mall, museums and food places.

The staff was very friendly and helpful, they also have a shuttle that takes you anywhere within a 2 mile radius.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Exactly what I hoped for,"I am not a frequent user of Marriott properties and usually find the experience just average. I stayed at this property for 3 nights earlier this month on a business trip and was very pleased upon arrival. There is limited space for cars out front of the hotel but the valet staff was moving fast. The lobby was nicely set up and at first glance seems a little small. The desk staff was very efficient in moving people along quickly, so lines never seemed to get unreasonably long. A lounge was located one level down (via the escalator), so there were not a lot of people lingering.I was placed in a room on the 18th floor and even though it was steps away from the elevator, I heard very little noise during my stay (which included a Friday and Saturday evening). The room was standard but was slightly larger than I expected for a Downtown property. The view at night was actually of the sky and not of other buildings.The best part of the property is the location. It is less than 10 minutes to 16th street and a short car (or train) ride to so many other worthwhile areas. I found it to be a true walking area and worth exploring.I am not sure what standard rates are for this property but if reasonable, it is not a bad place to make home base for your stay.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great for pictures,"The hotel was just ok. If you can find a deal go for it. Its close to 16th street shopping. The hotel also has a shuttle. The staff was nice, but it is a run of the mill Marriott hotel. The lobby has a beautiful fireplace.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Marriott Denver,"We stayed at the Marriott, California St., for four days last week.    We are MarriottElite members,   so have access to the Concierge room and free wifi,   which is nice.Breakfast was good in the Concierge Room, 17th floor,   although Gluten Free optionswould have been appreciated.         Some Marriott locations have a designatedtoaster/cereals etc but not this one,    however,  fruit, coffee etc were good.The lobby was warm and welcoming,  as were the staff.           However,  we weredisappointed with our room, on the 12th floor.     It had a king bed,   overall,  the roomwas dull and dingy,       dark and outdated.     It had a brown carpet,   brown walls,just drab and it had a tiny bathroom.        It was also noisy,   every time a guest closeda door to their room,    it woke us up,   with a slam,    so we did not sleep well,   asthis happened quite a bit.,  each night.Overall,   we stayed for a conference,   location was convenient,   but we would not berushing back for leisure,     as it also costs top dollar,",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convention,3 blocks from convention center but easy walk and well located to restaurants and attractions. Your typical Marriott experience. Didn't use to the facilities there. Was a relaxing stay and even got an extra 500 points each night not having them make the room up,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Excellent location, nice staff ","Spent only one night. Check in was quick and very polite. Questions were answered properly. Room are typical Marriott, right what you expect. Huge bed, desk, chair. The rooms have carpet. I had a room towards the street where the trains were driving. Noise level as ok, but not perfectly quiet. I personally miss a fridge for personal food (fresh fruits, yoghurt). Something I don't like is when housekeeping has their carts in the corridor that you can barely get past them, especially with luggage. I didn't use any other facilities of the hotel, so cannot say anything about them. Check out was quick and nie staff. Thanks.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent Service!,"Our room was fine. The help we received from the front desk staff, especially Tony A, was fabulous. I booked the hotel for a short visit so my daughter could attend new student orientation at CU Denver. The campus is within a comfortable walk although the hotel offered the first-come-first-served shuttle since the Auraria campus is within their 2-mile radius limit. There are also many dining options within a short stroll for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We recommend using the free city bus to travel end-to-end on the 16th Street Mall. Returning to the front desk staff, my daughter and I were very impressed with their willingness to assist and their knowledge of the area. Thank you for making our stay so comfortable.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Good, but not great","My stay at the Marriott City Center was during my third trip to Denver in as many months, and the third hotel I've tried there.It's in a good location for me in that it's next door to the offices of the client I was visiting. The staff I interacted with were friendly and efficient. I ordered dinner and breakfast through room service, and both were good. The bed was comfortable, the shower was good, and there was a nice selection of toiletries, which the last hotel I stayed in did not offer.However, the room wasn't as comfortable for relaxing or working as it could have been. I wanted to sit in the easy chair so I could go through emails while watching TV, but there was no outlet next to the chair. I had to pull a heavy nightstand away from the wall to get at an outlet on that side of the bed, because none was provided on the bedside light, like on the opposite side of the bed. The easy chair also was small and had no ottoman, so it wasn't a very comfortable place to sit and relax for more than a couple of minutes. The remote for the television wasn't very responsive, possibly due to nearly dead batteries or just over-use.Overall, I will mostly likely stay here again if I need to make another visit to the same client, due to the proximity to their office. Otherwise, there wasn't anything particularly out-of-the-ordinary to distinguish this hotel from the rest.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Glad I booked it,"This was another one of those hotels where I worried since there were so many mediocre and poor reviews. Our check in was very good by Melissa. The lobby is gorgeous. Yes, rooms old Marriott style, but very nice, clean, and large. It's located in walking distance to do many places. I recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Overnight for conference,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel on a weeknight for a conference that he was attending at the hotel.  Check in was smooth and hotel workers were friendly.  The elevator was a bit tricky, it was one where you have to put the key card in to access higher levels… now I've totally done these before but for some reason I had difficulty getting the combo of card in/button pushing correct.The room was clean and nice, although the bathroom was small and the shower head didn't work quite right, a small portion was just running out instead of spraying out.  I had also forgotten my hairbrush and the front desk did not have any combs.  But the pillows on the bed were fantastic!  Be advised this hotel does not give complimentary breakfast and does not have complimentary wifi.  We valet parked (also not included in the price of the hotel)… make sure you call down in advance of needing your car, as it takes approximately 10 minutes to get to you.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,We came to visit Denver and love the location of this hotel. Easy to get to 16th street mall and its free bus as well as many shops and restaurants without having the noise and chaos of the direct nightlife Sceen,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Best staff! Thanks for the great service!,I traveled here for work and the staff were very focused on making sure my stay was good. They were customer service focused and were extremely friendly. I found everyone in Denver friendly though. I really do not have anything to say negative. I think the rooms were nice and comfortable.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Average, uninspiring and outdated rooms ","It has been my experience that many Marriott full-service branded hotels are in need of renovation.  The Denver Marriott City Center is one of them.  For a hotel chain which markets itself as a reliable experience, the inconsistency among Marriotts has me looking elsewhere when possible.  The Denver Marriott City Center had a terrific valet and front desk crew which counts a lot as a welcoming, first impression.  The conference area was serviceable and the employees pretty much stayed quiet and out of the way which I guess is what we wanted during our conference.  They got the job done and did not distinguish themselves good or bad.  The room was just passable with outdated and tired furniture.  The Internet in the room was slow.  There are no easily accessible plugs for cell phones or tablets on one side of the bed, no furniture that has plugs where needed, let alone USB outlets or other modern conveniences.  The shower was just adequate.  The drain was stopped up.  The only reason I stayed here was for a conference and I suspect that it is the main revenue and reason that this hotel can compete at all in a city of far better alternatives.  One week later, tonight, I find myself in another Marriott, also not of my choosing, but this one is better though still not up to snuff.  Get it together or become known as the largest hotel chain that no one voluntarily chooses.  One good thing about both hotels --- comfy beds and good staffing.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Conference Hotel,"Of the last 25 conference hotels I have visited, this absolutely had the best elevator service.  Fast, courteous check in and out, well appointed, clean rooms.  There could have been a few more electrical outlets.  Every staff member seemed happy to be there and anxious to help, from the waiter in the bar to the concierge who made great suggestions and found us a nearby fantastic restaurant on a Friday night on very little notice.  Kudos to Steve of A-V.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Hospitality was Top Notch!,"I have been staying with the Marriott hotel chain for quite some time now.  The hospitality/friendly attitude/can-do spirit/smiling faces/Top notch service has been phenomenal in the Restaurant/bar area.  The ""Best"" I have experienced in my 28 years of traveling around the world.  Most notably, Jason/Frank/Nate (Bar area), Scott/Jessica/Rachel (Services), and the leader Andrea (Supervisor).  These are the professionals that other Marriott hotels and other Hotel chains should emulate.  It's the small things that make a huge difference, and they make it happen.  I will continue to stay at this hotel as long as I am in Denver.  Once you meet these professionals, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Like the Hotel, Rooms could use an Upgrade","I have stayed at this hotel a couple times over the past few years and I like the changes they have made to the internal lobby and restaurant areas.  Looks great!  Unfortunately, the rooms could use a similar upgrade.  Hopefully that is on the list for improvement.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Good job, considering...","We got snowed in while passing through Denver while going cross country. This place had a room and it was nice. The concierge lounge was decent but due to the weather they were short staffed. They did not put out desert and breakfast was not available. They made up for it by letting us eat in the restaurant. Aside from the fact it was a blizzzard, the staff on hand did a nice job. The hotel itself is in a great location downtown, but most stuff around was closed due to the storm.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place  for a high school reunion,"Just had my 50th High School reunion there and it went great. Great location for people coming back to Denver or those  living in the Metro area. Worked with wonderful people who helped our committee with every thing we asked for and more. The food was great, the bar was great and service was wonderful!!!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Awesome Hotel - Great Staff and Restaurant,The lobby area is wonderful and I had a great experience at this Marriott. I really enjoyed working on my laptop in the lobby during the snow storm. The staff was very accommodating and very on top of the up-to-the-minute news on the storm. They did everything they could to accommodate me and other guests within their power. Thanks to the staff - wish I could've stayed longer. Great Experience.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,My visit was great mainly due to the attitude and help from the staff,"I would like to express a SPECIAL THANKS  to all the staff at this hotel, especially to the person who is going ""above and beyond"" all expectations every day - Jamie.The customer service she provides with a pleasant and happy smile, her positive attitude and willingness to do everything and anything possible to accommodate a guest is truly amazing. I have not experienced anything like that anywhere yet (and believe me! I have been around!) :-)",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business stay,"Large modern hotel, comfortable bar with great food.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  I enjoyed using the gym and the pool, great facilities.  The gym was particularly good.  Nice modern room.  Choose a room above the 5th floor as the lift then needs room key access to get to these floors",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent and City Center but Pricey,We stayed here for a conference and found everything was good. The staff were friendly and the housekeepers on our floor went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. The conference facilities were good. The kitchen was wonderful with my wife's allergy and all the banquet meals were good and had no onions. Very convenient to the 16th St mall and everything downtown. They have a Starbucks right in the hotel but check the hours as they are not typical. We did have a way undercooked burger on our last night that came out raw when it was ordered well. They did replace just the burger and didn't charge but still that seemed like a huge error. We would stay here again.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"Big modern hotel. Good rooms, clean & comfy. Usual hotel facilities Good bar. Happy hour 4-6. Fab value drinks & food at this time. Wine $5 food the same.  Perfect post flight snack. Friendly staff happy to help. Friendly bar staff!Hotel well located for down town. Easy to get to shops bars etc All round good standard hotel. Tea/coffee in room. Good wifi.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very central ,"They renovated the lobby since my last visit here, it looks very nice. The staff is very friendly helpful and attentive. The rooms did not get a renovation, but the would really need one. The gym is not well equipped, it get's  quiet crowded in the morning and then there is no space at all. The location of the hotel is very central and you can walk anywhere in the centre. It is a nice hotel with very good staff, if they would renovate the rooms and upgrade the gym, it would be very good.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Average Marriott,The hotel was a standard Marriott. Nothing memorable. I did have an issue with valet the morning I left. They warned it could take 15 mins to get my car down. So I planned accordingly. But the day I left it took 22 minutes. Since I had to take someone from work to the airport this was totally unacceptable. There was only one single valet workers in the morning on a day when hundreds of our group were leaving. I almost lost my job over this. Definitely need to fix this if you expect business travelers to stay here.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful experience,"Just returned from a long weekend at this hotel. Very impressed with the atmosphere created by the staff of a genuinely friendly and helpful place.  Everyone I encountered couldn't have been nicer.  The room was clean and decent sized. The sound proofing is good as I couldn't hear anything from the rooms around me or from the street below.  The woman who brought up my room service breakfast was very nice and the tray well appointed.  Well located a few blocks from the shopping street, mall and Convention Center with plenty of restaurants nearby.  If you join their rewards program in room WiFi is free.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Convenient location, friendly staff","Located just blocks from 16th street mall and convention center. The lobby is beautiful with stone walls and large gas fireplace. Rooms are average size but immaculate. Beds and pillows are very comfy. Reading lights by beds and plenty of outlets to charge electronics. Expertise easy to control. In-room coffee maker with liquid cream. Good size vanity in bathroom with plenty of toiletries and soft, absorbent towels. Friendly and accommodating staff.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location and Nice Rooms,"Hotel is clean with a very friendly staff. The rooms are large and we'll maintained, but no fridges. Had some food and drinks at bar, with the drinks tending to be pricey.  The bar staff was generally attentive, by on a Saturday evening, the waitress was very slow and overwhelmed. She detracted from a overall pleasant stay at the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Check-in much better than Check-out,"I'm a Marriott Silver Elite member so when I arrived, check-in was great.  I was offered a bigger room.  He offered to assist me with any dining and sight seeing needs.  The room was nice.  It was spacious and I had a great view.  My first issue with the room was that the walls were paper thin.  I could hear the couple in the next room when they would talk, cough, turn on the TV, etc.  It was uncomfortable hearing some of the stuff I heard. My second issue really wasn't the hotels fault, but due to the high winds during my visit, the internet connection in the hotel went out.  Since it was late at night when it happened, I'm sure it didn't affect that many people, but since I was doing some work for the next day, it was an issue for me.  I did call down to the front desk and I was told the internet was done and they had no timeframe when it would be back up.  I decided to go to bed and lucky for me it was up again the next morning.  My third issue was with house keeping.  My room was cleaned in a timely manner, which I enjoyed, but they did not leave any towels and took the body wash.  I had to call down to the front desk later to request those items.  When housekeeping arrived, I was told that the text message sent when the room was cleaned requesting that new towels and body wash be brought up to my room was never received and they were sorry for that.  My fourth issue occurred during check-out.  I had an early morning flight so I went to check out and got my bill.  My rate included parking but I was charged an additional parking fee.  I told the gentleman behind the desk that parking was included in my rate.  He did not look it up. He told me that parking is never included in the rate at this location.  I told him that I booked my reservation on Marriott.com and several packages were offered including a breakfast package.  He stated that the hotel does not offer packages.  I pulled out my phone and showed him where my reservation stated ""Parking Package, included valet parking.""  He then stated that he was not sure if he could remove the additional parking charge.  Guess what, he was able to remove it.  My advise to anyone booking a package with this location, double check your bill at check-out.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Good service, dated rooms","We loved our stay here for 4 days. It is in a great location close to bus routes and 16th Street mall. The room our family of 4 stayed in was definitely outdated but comfortable enough.  If you want a fridge in your room you have to ask for one. The thermostat had a hard time staying cold but still worked ok. Beds were clean and comfortable. All the doors on at least the 5th floor have a pretty big gap at the bottom, so you can really hear a lot. The lobby is fantastic and the pool was good.The restaurant serves great food but is definitely overpriced. I can't say enough about the service here. Everyone has been super helpful and nice. I'm sure we will be back eventually and will probably stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A very good hotel in downtown Denver,We enjoyed our visit at the Denver Marriott City Center.  A very upbeat hotel with a nice lobby.  Our room was very comfortable.  The staff was friendly at check-in and helpful in all our request.  We had breakfast in the concierge lounge which was good.  We booked at a great price.  Overall we enjoyed our stay and will be coming back.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"The hotel is great and has most everything needed.  The only issue I found was it didn't have a little store.  For example, I needed contact solution and they don't have a store on premise (or one that carries it) and I was directed to a CVS a block away.  Mind you this isn't bad but it was very cold and that just didn't sound very easy.  The food at the hotel was great and the concierge lounge was always full of great treats or snacks.  Would certainly return to this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel with great lobby area but rooms are dated,"The lobby and restaurant areas of the Denver Marriott City Center are top notch, both visually appealing and ergonomic.  There are plenty of elevators and we never had to wait more than 30 seconds for one to appear.  The restaurant is top notch with good food and friendly service, including a great Sunday brunch buffet.  Linens are high quality and comfortable, though I'm really not a fan of the bulky Marriott all-weather duvet.   My primary complaint is that the rooms are a bit dated, with electrical plugs behind the bed rather than up on the night stands for easy access.  Also, the coffee makers are inside the credenza and have to be removed and plugged in to the wall and none of the rooms have a refrigerator built in (they will send one up to the room at no charge on request).  The parking fees are outrageous, though that's pretty standard for downtown hotels, but the valet service was quick and efficient with a dial-in automated attendant.  Overall, it's a nice upscale Marriott hotel that I'd recommend to downtown business travelers.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel,Basic Marriott.  Clean nice lounge for premier members. Vallet parking $37 or park yourself block and half away is a nice option.  Has Starbucks in hotel do bonus for me.  20 floor high rise.  Free shuttle is great accommodation.  Our driver was awesome sorry I didn't get his name.  Price comparable to other hotels in area.  I would stay again,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing Service!,"I was in Denver on business last week and really enjoyed my time at this hotel. Most importantly, the entire staff at the bar/restaurant. Frank, Jason and the crew made my experience the best possible. Marriott would be wise to elevate every single member of this crew to a corporate level. Go Hawks;)",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,They care,"My family and I stayed at the Denver Marriott City Center for 3 nights while moving my son to Denver.   Each day, we were exhausted from the move, and returned to the hotel for dinner.   On Saturday night, we wandered around the hotel restaurant looking for an open table.  This was the night of the football playoffs and the place was extremely busy and full.  We must have looked tired and disappointed that there were no seats.   Suddenly, the manager (Zach Dimmitt) quickly approached us and told us he'd set up the back room for us...TV and all to watch the Packer game and have dinner.  Zach was so very perceptive, professional, kind and helpful.  He checked back in with us often during dinner.   Zach had total control over the very busy restaurant and bar area and treated guests with the utmost care.   Less than 12 hours later, Zach was overseeing the Concierge Lounge at breakfast - greeting guests, cleaning tables and ensuring each of us were well cared for during breakfast.  As a business person who travels often for work, this type of care is noticed and greatly appreciated.  If you stay at the Marriott Denver City Center, I hope you get to meet and experience the leadership of Zach Dimmit.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Stay,"Stayed at the Denver Marriott City Center over New Years and couldn't have asked for a better facility. First the location is excellent, second the staff were incredible. Every time and talked or asked for help the people working were there to help and seemed to really care about us a customers. Seems like a strong working relationship. I felt comfortable asking the stupidest questions about a city I had never visited before.Tony on the front desk was friendly and answered all of my questions in a manner in which I felt comfortable and not being judged. He took the time to look up things such as transportation around the city or restaurants close at hand that would be suitable for my wife and I.The halls might look a little dated (carpet) but the room was comfortable and had everything we needed.The exercise room and pool were well maintained and had all the machines one would want. The pool was clean and did not smell too much like chlorine like other places I have been.We ate breakfast at the restaurant on the lower floor and it was really good. A buffet for $20 which was well stocked and had a good selection. I didn't eat for the rest of the day.Overall we were very satisfied with our stay at the Denver Marriott City Center. We will be back.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Terrific Hotel,"I would have given this review a 5 had there been a frig in the room.  I was there for a week for a conference -- plenty of space, comfortable beds, great view of the city, easy walk to restaurants and shops.  I was on my own the last night and too tired to go out, so enjoyed a delicious meal in the hotel restaurant.  The front desk staff always informative and accommodating. Free wifi with Marriott rewards. I would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not as nice or accommodating as other Marriott's,"Stayed here for a conference.  No shuttle from airport (not surprised, airport is far from Denver, actually), lobby is very scant in amenities and trying to figure out where to go for dinner (other than their restaurant) was challenging (ended up on 12 St Mall every night).",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent and Convenient,"the Denver Marriott city Center is clean, convenient and very close to shopping, restaurants and bars.  The food and customer service at this hotel is excellent!  The rooms are clean, consistent with the Marriott hotel chain and the staff is extremely accommodating.  Stop in the lower level lobby for an after work cocktail.  You won't be disappointed as the staff is very friendly!  By the way, if you prefer foam pillows versus feathers, housekeeping will accommodate this request. :)",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Started poorly but some redemption by the end,"The Bad: Several of the front desk reps were condescending and rude. (I recently reviewed JW Marriott and the entire staff was empecable, it's interesting how inconsistent these hotels are.) We had an issue with billing that wasn't resolved and the room was dingy and dirty, and is need of a renovation, certainly not luxurious has the website claims, the pool is motel 6 qualityThe Good: The lobby had been renovated, as well as the restaurant, they were great. The food at the restaurant was delicious. The hotel did send up chocolate covered strawberries and Evian waters as an apology for the dirty room, and most of the staff was great, the gym was large and had a variety of weights and machines, we upgraded to the concierge lounge, service was lovely and food was good, it could use more snacks I. The middle of the day as they just offered chips  If you are planning on planning a trip to downtown Denver, I would recommend the Westin or The Ritz, we've stayed at both properties and were very pleased",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hotel & Service,"This hotel was incredible. Our room was spacious & clean with a great view of the city & mountains. We had the best service from Jeffrey, as well as the other staff. We were only there for 3 days, but it is a great hotel & highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Dreamy Nights and Delicious Dining,"A firm recruiting me had me stay a couple of nights at the Marriott Downtown City Center. It was a standard room, but beautifully appointed, and the bed was adorned with silky soft sheets and a dreamy memory foam mattress. The in-house restaurant and catering offered the finest meals and desserts. I didn't take the job, but I'd go back to the Marriott any time. Fabulous.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Solid 4* hotel,"I had a very short stay at this hotel - less than 24 hours. So, I can't say much about the dining/entertainment options either within the hotel or nearby. However, the lobby was very nice and staff friendly at check-in. Rooms were fine - exactly what you'd expect from a Marriott in the city. Maybe a little small, but comfortable and nicely appointed. Nice VIP lounge with sodas, infused fruit water, snacks, honor bar at night and breakfast in the am (check out the oatmeal bar with tons of toppings!)Make sure you check your bill - there was a parking charge added for $35 on mine (even though I didn't have a car). Overall, a quick but pleasant stay.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice property in the downtown area,"I've stayed here quite a few times over the last 3 years and this place keeps getting a bit better each time.  The rooms feel a bit dated, but that's the only complaint.  The lobby area has been updated and the lounge is always a nice option with great views.  I'll continue to use this as my Denver base with easy walking access to many great restaurants",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent Customer Service,"At check in Jeffrey assisted us at the front desk, he was very knowledgeable about the are and knew exactly where we should go to ensure we had a good time while staying there. They had us blocked in rooms that met our requests but when i asked for a higher floor Jeffery went above and beyond to accommodate my group. I really regret not remembering the name of the Server in the morning for breakfast and the valet man who brought us our car and assisted with our luggage. they were full of energy and a delight, they gave us the morning push our trip needed. from beginning to end our stay was perfectly delightful thanks to the staff, great location and beautiful hotel.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,The usual great Marriott service ,"Stayed for business 3 nights, great service & beds. Room is a bit outdated but clean & everything was in good working order. Great food at the bar ate there 2 out of 3 nights. Would stay again & will ....good rates & great location . The elevators are frustrating though needing a key to access 4-20.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Dark and outdated good service,The service was good at check in and check out. The room was too small and dark. But it was clean. Good distance from the main activities and convention center. Getting tired of the old Marriott look. Parking for friends was hard and expensive. But that is Denver,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent especially accommodating for Gluten sensitivity!,Great hotel and very convenient to the convention center and all the downtown has to offer. The concierge lounge staff were GREAT and very accommodating for my gluten allergy. Could not ask for more. Will definitely be back.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great spot downtown,Perfect location in LoDo if you are visiting for business.Nice concierge lounge on the 17th floor.  The room was small but this was a last minute trip and was not able to get an upgrade.   Really enjoyed drinking wine by the fireplace.  Staff are the best.  Everyone I encountered was uber friendly.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Conference Visit,"I was here for a conference in December of 2015 for a 2 night stay. They put me in a double room which was fine because I was the only on staying. The room was great. It had a fridge and coffee service. Others had pointed out no fridge. Maybe I was lucky? The hotel lobby was very nice as well as the conference amenities. Food was great during the conference minus one small hiccup due to a nut allergy. The overall service was excellent. The restaurant on site was great! Loved the food and the service was excellent. It's a very laid back place. They do breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Great stay during my short time in Denver!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,good business hotel for downtown meetings,"hotel chosen by meeting organizer.  well located: you can walk pretty much anywhere and especailly to the 17th St pedestrian mall.  room are well appointde clean and quiet.  They do respect the water saving, towel hanging Policy (something that i see rarely).  friendly front office staff with good advice re taxi et al.  lounge restaurant is good too. greta to ahve starbuck on site and open at 5h30 (for easterners...). Wifi has decent speed.only point to improve may be meeting room on second floor: No window an decor a bit drab",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Overall Decent Property with a Couple Minor Disappointments,"This property was often sold out in a bunch of the weeks I visited Denver.  That was probably the biggest annoyance along with points not posting fully during one of my stays.Otherwise, the property meets the standards you expect of Marriott.  Out of 3 hotels in Denver downtown, the rooms fell in the middle in terms of size.  They were appointed well, had a safe and fridge, and good wifi.  I was always put on the concierge lounge level without asking which as super nice.The concierge lounge had good breakfast offerings and evening hors d'oeuvres, but dessert was consistently lacking.  The dessert offerings would look pretty but tasted pretty bad.  Also dined a couple times at the hotel restaurant on the lower level.  Definitely a good looking place and food was decent but not memorable.Also appreciate that the hotel participates in the Your Choice program.Lastly, hotel is in a decent location but not necessarily right there in the middle of the hustle bustle.  Aside from Guard and Grace which is a nice steakhouse right next door, restaurants and shopping will be a few blocks away.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Perfect,"The Marriott was perfect for our weekend with kids in the big city. We booked here cause it was close to the parade of lights. It allowed us a great place for dinner prior to the parade where the food was spot on, service was over the top and people watching did not disappoint. Next time you visit Denver, you must stay here",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Comfortable, clean, hospitality",Accommodations were excellent.We stayed in a beautiful spacious suite. Staff was friendly and helpful. Concierge Rich was helpful. Business trip with nice ambiance.  Hotel is clean and well maintained. Close to all in the city of Denver. I would recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great hotel for business,"Attended a conference at the hotel in November and it's a great place to stay. The conference rooms were roomy. It's in a great location with many restaurants to choose from within walking distance. It rained/snowed during one of our days and the staff was nice enough to let us borrow umbrellas.Our room was a bit cozy as the desk and chair were right up against one of the two full sized beds. I did like how the room had a port to hook up a laptop with the TV through an HDMI port. If you pay for wi-fi, you can stream movies that way.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Helpful staff and good rooms,"Was here to attend a conference in mid November 2015. Had to make two reservations because of the length of the stay; but this was a booking error on my part and was easily combined into one continuous reservation by very helpful staff upon my check-in. The bar staff at the downstairs bar were also courteous, prompt and had a great memory and lots of patience for when my friends and I were often the last ones in the bar and calling last drinks on us. Only one uncanny moment late on Wednesday night on the third floor where there was an unusual amount of slamming of doors about 2am. Not sure what was going on but did notice that my door did not have a soft-close feature, so figure another guest had the same thing and wasn't considerate enough to open/close their door thoughtfully. Other than that, no worries with the place!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Pleasant stay,"Good hotel in excellent down-town location. Very comfortable beds, good desk for working and well equipped bathroom. The only thing that could have improved my stay would be a fridge in the room. Reception staff excellent. All in all a very pleasant two night stay.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great for business travel in downtown Denver,"I stayed here only for one night but everything was perfect for a business trip.  Location is  right in the heart of downtown, restaurant onsite is good and there are plenty of other dinner options within a close walking distance.   I checked in online and my room was ready when I arrived at noon.  The accommodations are typical Marriott but totally met my needs.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Quiet & centrally located!,"Friendly, welcoming & professional reception staff. No wait to check in, fast & efficient. The Bellman at the front door always greeted us on leaving or arriving at the hotel (on foot). They were helpful on providing local knowledge of the surrounding area too. Modern & contemporary lobby area which is ideal for quick business meetings.Great security at this hotel too - your room key only gives you access to your floor & the gym/pool area. Had a standard room on the 6th floor; it was spacious & quiet with two double beds, small bathroom but adequate with a powerful hot shower. Only downside: Not many bathroom amenities offered but of the ones that were, lovely aromatherapy style products. Towels were clean but well worn (thin as paper!) & could have used some fabric softner.. When I asked to refresh them the maid was lovely & willing. Not the maids fault but the fresh towels offered were unfortunately similar..!A large but quiet hotel well situated to business offices & the shops/restaurants on 16th St. Only a short taxi/bus ride to the big Cherry Creek shopping mall. All in all I wouldn't hesitate to stay again - a lovely, peaceful & comfortable hotel with lovely staff right in the heart of the city centre.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Reasonable Marriott Hotel in downtown Denver,"The city center hotel was a typical Marriott.  Lobby is very nice and staff friendly (although music wayyyyy too loud).  Rooms were fine, no significant issues to mention in the room other than the a/c unit was pretty loud.   Otherwise it was a standard Marriott room.  It was within a few blocks of the convention center so makes it convenient and a block from the pedestrian mall.  Loved that there was a Starbucks present on site and the  work out room was nicer than most.   This is certainly more of a business hotel.  I last stayed at Hotel Teatro on my previous visit at Denver; it has amazing rooms and would recommend that if you've got the funds and still want to be close to the Convention center but want that extra touch of luxe.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Needs updating,"Older hotel, smallish rooms, noisy heat/air vents, tiny bathroom with running toilet. Good location - walking distance to the downtown shopping district. Nice lobby and comfortable bar and restaraunt area. Good hotel for conferences. Staff is friendly. Overall a good hotel just needs remodeling.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Modern Lux almost.,"This is a modern urban hotel, staff are friendly , good location for downtown business. There is good dining and conference dining is very good.  But for the cost  the rooms don't make the grade. I requested a king bed when I reserved. I ended up with 2 queens. The  room is cramped I don't know how a family or even a couple would navigate around the room. The beds are nice lots of pillows but one bed is 6 inches from the wall. I'm sure the maids hate making this bed.  The bath is very small. I'm small 5' 140.  I have to do a dance around the door and toilet to shut the door. It's easier to leave the door open when using the toilet. If you have large people you better get a suite. The wifi is 9 something a nite at this price it should be free. Then there is the carpet, but all hotels have grungy carpets. Oh and for some reason some wallpaper in the hall is off the wall and laying on the floor. Ok for being at a convention in this hotel that was convenient but I wouldn't stay here if I was doing tourist stuff in Colorado for the same price you can get into the mountains.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent service,"From the minute I pulled into the drive I was welcomed and met by friendly, efficient people everywhere.  I recently was a guest at a luncheon held at this hotel.  The valet service was quick and friendly; even giving me advise on how to get to the interstate.  The food was SO GOOD!  The wait staff was friendly and quick to meet our requests.  It was a great experience all around.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good place to stay,"The staff made my stay very pleasant. They were friendly, helpful and quick to assist. Beds and rooms are comfortable. Location is close to the convention center,16th street shopping, downtown museums, etc. Highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Never had a problem,"The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, the lobby was nice, there's a Starbucks right outside the elevator(LOVE), the location was great, and the staff was patient. I would stay here again. My friend had a concierge level pass and we had the breakfast and a couple snacks from the concierge level. It was very nice and helped a lot when we were in a rush to get some food before leaving. My entire group enjoyed themselves and the hotel was very patient one evening with an intoxicated friend.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"No heat, expensive wi-fi, noisy even on the 19th floor. $189/night.","The good:Exceptionally comfortable bed. Spacious. Clean (although the carpets are long overdue for shampooing). Francisca is an excellent housekeeper. 2 blocks from 16th Street Mall. Convenient to attractions.The bad:The heater didn't work. Others at the conference I attended there said the same thing. The fan blew cold air and only spit out heat briefly in the middle of the night, which cooked me. Then it stopped working.Wi-fi pricing starts at $10/day. The tv didn't work. I don't watch tv, but I still expect it to work so I tried it.No free breakfast. Only beverages in vending machines, no snacks.Poorly sealed windows admitted cold drafts and noise.Hallway noise came right into the room. Truly geared towards expense accounts. Thankfully, I had one.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great staff,"Good location and central, staff were very helpful both on the floor and in the bar/restaurant at all hours. Internet was good and never lost connections. Room (6th floor) was a little dated and worn, but served my needs for business travel that week.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not a bad hotel just needs updating,"I stayed here for two nights and evem though nothing went wrong nothing was spectacular either. The lobby, lounge, curb appeal, and location are fantastic. However the room is starting to show its age and the shower has low water pressure. The customer service in the lobby, valet, and concierge lounge is what you would expect from a downtown hotel... fantastic.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great service, rooms could use a little love","The hotel can't make up for the fact that they need an update of the rooms and above all the mechanics of the hotel. The rooms, however, were just fine! They just start to compare unfavorably to other renovated Marriotts. The mechanics were a bit troublesome as the HVAC was supremely loud and would ""kick in"" and define the word kick in the middle of the night. What made up for it was the staff and management who really did their best to accommodate requests and look out after the guests. The lounge, for example, is oddly laid out and a bit tight, but the staff there was great and the food was way above normal quality.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location and good service,"While I agree with the comments about the dated decor and I must admit it took a bit to figure out the ac situation, for the most part I enjoyed my stay.  I was traveling for business and to me the most important things are a quiet room, nice breakfast accommodations and a helpful staff.  This Marriott delivered.  My room was quiet and the bed was comfortable.  They have a nice breakfast buffet and were happy to provide a go cup of coffee -- the price was a bit steep but was consistent with what I've paid elsewhere.  The staff were friendly and helpful even in situations where they didn't need to be.  I would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice lobby doesn't disguise dated rooms,"I'm a business traveler who is on the road most of the time. I look for hotels that are quiet, comfortable, have stand-up showers and cold a/c. How I rate:* - I left the hotel and went elsewhere** - I stayed, but wouldn't return*** - Would return if I had to**** - Enjoyed the stay***** - Hotel of choice in the areaPros:Nice lobbyRestaurant is goodCons:Rooms are dated/oldNo fridgeTowels have the ""gym smell""Staff can't get requests handledSpent three nights in this hotel. It's the usual Marriott disaster of a recently renovated lobby with old rooms. I always feel like a bait and switch happens when I get tricked into staying in one of these dumps much less paying the rates Marriott expects for them. My advice is stay away.  I called twice to have my ac fixed (the fan just blew constantly) and to my knowledge the promised engineer never came up to my room and did anything. When things like this happen I expect the hotel to compensate me for my trouble. If Marriott ever wonders why I'm platinum with starwood and hardly gold with them, this is why. A nice lobby doesn't make up for old rooms and service promises that aren't kept. Stay away from this hotel.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,New lobby but the rooms need upgrades,They're in the middle of a remodel of the lobby but this is an older hotel. I think the rooms need to be updated.The beds are pretty standard but the bathroom shows the typical ware and tear of an older hotel.The staff as a whole were friendly and responsive. The members lounge is really nice and offers a happy hour on weekdays with nice snacks.However for the price(if you're not concerned with member points) you can get more of a modern hotel.The gym is very small with older equipment. It's never been busy when I've gone in the evenings.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great service,"Always a great stay, as I'm a flight attendant we never get the most updated rooms so decor a bit tired, but always clean, big comfortable double bed instead of 2 small doubles, all amenities . Air con a bit noisy. Staff are always so polite and helpful. Room service quick, menu could have a bit more choice. 2 Starbucks in lobby. Shops are 5 minute walk and lots of bars restaurants. Always a great stay :)",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Don't let the fancy facade fool you - you are better off at a Fairfield,"Where to start?  Start by pulling into the entry drive and parking long enough to check in.  You will be quickly run off by the valet guys or even the valet manager as we were.  You beg to park long enough to sprint in and get some room keys.  Then you pay $37 a night for parking there - so they can lose your keys at check out.Once you have handed over your car keys, you go to your room and arrive to one that seems a bit dated at best - old drop ceilings tiles, questionable odors, etc.  Take a deep breath and smell the cigarettes of days gone by.  Might be 30 years worth, or perhaps it was somebody from the day before.  All you know is that your sinuses and throat start to get sore from inhaling the strong echoes of many a Marlboro.  By then you request to move to a different room but no can do - they won't be able to accommodate you for at least two days.At least you will get a good night's sleep - well, you would have if you had stayed at a Fairfield Inn for 1/3 of the price.  Because in this room the climate control is as dated as the rest of the room and even setting the thermostat to an icy 60 degrees nets you a lukewarm breeze.  It was cooler in the hallways than in the room.  We finally opened the tiny, screenless bottom window and quickly found that bugs (including mosquitoes) will travel up several stories to bite your butt.At least the breakfast in the concierge lounge was good.  Oh wait, everything was pretty much gone by the time we arrived at 8:25.  No juice, no eggs, no fruits - nada.  We tracked down the attendant and she rolled her eyes and said ""we are closing soon.""  ""Soon"" was at least 35 minutes away and several people arriving around the same time as us were equally unimpressed.  She finally relented (after much huffing and puffing) and started to replenish the breakfast wasteland.  The lines for each food/drink area were 4-6 people deep by that point.So on that second-to-last day they say they SHOULD be able to move you.  You go to the front desk and wait for a half hour, only to give up as you need to get to a meeting.  They call you three hours later to say that ""an unexpected group just booked"" and they can only move you on the last day of your stay.  You throw in the towel and move yourself - to another full-service Marriott in a nearby city.  Free parking, new decor, working A/C, and the friendliest staff you can imagine (Westminster, FYI).And you then get a nice note from the Platinum desk at the crappy Marriott that says, ""I was off yesterday, but I understand that you have already discussed this with my manager.""  Nope - never talked to a manager of any kind.  Tried, but gave up on that too.  Well, other than the rather brusque greeting from the valet manager when we first arrived.  Ironically, we had the message-waiting light going on our phone on what turned out to be our last night there.  It said we had a gift and to call the front desk to get it.  It was 10:30 at night and we simply wanted to go to bed.  And then the phone started ringing.  We ignored it.  A half hour later and it started ringing again.  I finally answered and it was the front desk wanting to know if they could deliver a gift.  At 11:00 at night.  The answer?  No.  So then the phone starts ringing again the next morning.  And ringing, and ringing, and ringing.  Care to guess who it was when I was finally able to answer it?  Somebody that was struggling with their English but managed to get out ""free gift delivery.""  I explained we were checking out and had no interest in any gift.  She then asked when they could deliver it.  I explained we were leaving the room immediately (only to find they lost our car keys), so she then asked if they could deliver the gift that afternoon instead.  I very politely thanked her and hung up.Speaking of the valet - one last thing: We were already suspect our car got some extra miles on it when it left - the radio station was changed and quarters were missing from our coin holder.  But we honestly don't know if it was taken anywhere but the garage.  What we DO know is that it reeked of cigarette smoke (100% non-smoking car) and wet paint.  Why?  Well, when they lost the keys to the car they parked it right next to the curbs that were getting painted (white car, red paint). And despite the ""NO SMOKING IN THIS AREA"" sign, all three painters were smoking right next to the car (yep, we took pictures).  We drove for a few miles with the windows down just to try and air it out. So was there a bright spot of any sort?  YES.  The attendant at the concierge lounge that first night was fantastic.  We had to get out of our very smokey non-smoking room and the lounge seemed pretty safe.  The guy there was super nice and even offered to find a couple ice cream bars for us.  So shines a good deed in a weary world...",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Comfortable Stay,Nice comfortable rooms. Clean with very helpful and friendly staff. Centrally located and in walking distance to several restaurants and shops. Downside no free wifi in the rooms. Wifi was extremely pricey which was disappointing considering that my 3 day stay cost $1224. In addition no free breakfast.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Friendly Staff, Great Location","I stayed at this hotel because it is where the conference I was attending was held. From the moment I walked in the door, every staff member I encountered was incredibly friendly and helpful. The conference facilities were great and every meal served was tasty and filling. The room itself was smaller than expected, but comfortable and clean. Plenty of restaurants/attractions were within walking distance.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Starting to show its age, but still a good hotel","I've been staying here every year for GABF for over a decade, and I've watched a lot of changes. Unfortunately, they haven't all been for the better. Everything about this hotel is beginning to show its age, but I have to say it still works for me in terms of location and overall comfort.The hotel staff obviously tries hard to get a difficult job done, considering the size of the various groups they host, and it's honestly appreciated by most of us.Valet parking is still terrible, even after all these years (expensive and unresponsive), but that's really just one problem. There are a lot of other things they do well.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Terrible room service,"Stayed 18/10/15. Checked in to my room at 8pm and tried to call room service, I was on hold for over 3 minutes. When answered was told the wait for a chicken salad was 45 minutes. I ordered and 45 min later no food. Called room service and was told it's there and will be delivered in 5 to 10 min and I won't get charged. 10 min later no food. I called guest services and room service( on hold again) still no food. I went to reception and was told they will send it up. I cancelled and had to go out to find food. This was after a 14 hr journey to get to Denver. At no point did I receive an apology or explanation.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice stay!,"I had a very nice stay here while attending a conference at the hotel. The room was nice, and the WiFi was excellent. I used the gym several times and found it to be very convenient and fully equipped. The service was also fairly excellent -- the maid even left me some toothpaste (without my asking) when she saw I was running low.I did experience some of the noise that others here have complained about. I noticed it as soon as I entered my room -- but all I had to do was ask for another room, and they happily obliged. (And I heard no noise in that room.)The one negative was the location. It is near the 16th street mall, which was nice to walk along and had several restaurants and shops. But in any other direction, the neighborhood seemed dead. I was not able to find a restaurant nearby that I wanted to go to besides for a few pubs.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Pleasantly surprised!,"We stayed here for a week while I attended a conference offsite. We were warmly greeted by the valet and then by Jamie at the front desk. She was very cheerful as well as helpful in answering our questions. Our room was large and spacious with 2 comfy queen beds. Everything was clean and well maintained. As I'm an Elite Marriott rewards member, we were able to use the lounge on the 16th floor. We had an excellent breakfast there everyday with nice views out across the downtown area (no mountain views though). They also had heavy hors d'oeuvres every afternoon that were quite nice.  The valets were quick to get our car and always willing to give directions. We really enjoyed our stay in Denver and I'd definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Light sleeper?  Get a room up high or away from Stout St,"The rooms are great.  Spacious, comfortable and pleasing.  BUT, if you are a light sleeper and are low in the building and facing Stout St you will hear the bells of the light rail system every time they approach the intersection with California.  Ask for a room away from that.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,The friendliest hotel on earth!   (Oh and the rooms are nice and the food is good too).,"I stayed at the Marriott earlier this month, attending a conferrence.   From the moment I got out of the cab, where there was a literal receiving line of smiling hotel employees welcoming me, to the front desk clerk (who actually came out from behind her desk to finalize the paperwork), to the room servce waiters, to the management, it is clear that this hotel's training program in customer service must be award winning.   Everyone--including the maids at their carts in the hall--asked how I was doing, told me to have a great day, and possessed genuine smiles.   The food served (conference style buffets for the most part) was incredibly varied, delicious and (unfortunately for my waistline) plentiful.     While the room was a standard first class one, the beds and pillows are dreamy.        Although this trip was business, I would come back here on a pleasure trip any day.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Stale smoke smell,"The rooms here are pretty average -- similar to what you'd expect from an outdated Holiday Inn. In contrast, the common areas are new/modern/nice. The bathrooms are, indeed, small, though that doesn't bother me. The reason this gets 2 stars instead of 3 is that the rooms have a stale smoke smell. I thought it was just the first room I checked into. But they moved me to the other end of the hall and the new room had the same smell. My best guess is that this hotel just hasn't had a full renovation since people were last allowed to smoke in these rooms.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Staying in Denver,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for three nights. The hotel was very nice. The room did not have a mircowave or a refrigerator in it. It said on their web website that you could ask for them but, they didn't offer either. The cleaning staff wouldn't leave extra towels unless you left them a note, then they would. We had breakfast in the room one day and it was excellent. Overall the room was very nice.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Positively surprised,"I am visiting a conference which is organized in this hotel. I saw not very good ratings, but yet decided to book my room here, as it is much more convenient to stay in a conference hotel. Apparently it was a good decision, as I like my stay here. I have a nice corner room on 19th floor with a spectacular view (see photo attached), the staff is gentle and fast in fulfilling all my requests, food is very good (though supplied within the conference package, so I cannot say anything about standard breakfast), and the price is also very good (thanks to a special conference rate). The hotel has pretty much standard sport facilities  -- yet sufficient for most visitors. There are plenty of restaurants and pubs in the walking distance, and I would also recommend the bar in the hotel itself.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Tired and Oh So Yellow,"OK, yellow is not a bad colour but everywhere?! I stayed for four nights at $219/night for a large-ish but mostly empty room.  Main likes: location,  comfortable king-size bed.  Main dislikes: spartan furnishings (+ no minibar), crazy access to pool (dripping wet through fitness centre), generally tired décor, street noise (bring earplugs), no free WiFi (slow in any case).  Lots of better options.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Rooms need updating,"Spent several days in a standard room with the wife - her business, my pleasure.  The rooms are small and really in need of a total re-think - not just new paint and linens.  Bathroom size is woefully inadequate.  A real turn off.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Awesome Services and  a Great Marriott,This is a class apart Marriott. It could well be as good as the JWs. I travel every other week and this Marriott is exceptional. The lobby is very stylist. The rooms are very nice with standard bathrooms. The restaurant in the hotel is very good and reasonably priced. There is also a starbucks within the premise and a corner cafe next to the hotel. The location is one block away from 16 street mall. They have a cadillac 4wd shuttle free for any place within a few miles of the hotel..that was awesome!!! No other Marriott here offers such service..pretty unique. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping at 16 street mall. The neighborhood of the hotel is pretty safe. Service is exceptional. We also got an upgrade while checkin. I would definitely stay here next time we are in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Really Friendly Staff,"I have stayed here a few times in the last few months, and continue to be impressed with the staff and the level of service. The hotel is decent, but the friendly employees make it the right place to stay down town.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Average Marriott,I stay in a LOT of Marriotts.  This one was average.  It has a good location downtown.  The front desk staff were VERY friendly.  The valet were also good.  Workout room was nice as was the pool.The rooms could use a redo.  They are clean but getting old.  The lounge needs the carpet replaced ASAP as its quite nasty.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,The Staff is What Makes This Property Special,"The hotel itself is great - centrally located in the heart of Denver, fantastic restaurant and bar, with great food, drinks and craft beer selection, and clean, quiet, comfortable rooms. That alone would garner this property at least a 4-star rating. But what takes it over the top is its people. They are, without flaw, some of the nicest, most accommodating, helpful and hard working people I've ever encountered in hospitality. Stand-out and exceptional, even for this crew, was Ryan Connor, who I found to be personable, a real-world, practical thinker and hustler - always moving, assisting and tending to guests' needs with a smile and laugh. As a businessman, if Ryan lived near me and I needed staff, I'd steal him away for my company! Great hotel.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Helped by Mikhaila!,Was there for a conference recently. Just wanted to say that Mikhaila took some extra time and helped myself and two other ladies by showing us how to use über! She was fantastic! The hotel is very nice. Too bad they don't offer complimentary coffee or tea.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Staff went out of their way to meet and exceed our needs!,"We've stayed at Marriott City Center several times over the years and have always had good experiences. On this last visit, the service was truly exemplary. EVERY single staff member we encountered over the four days went out of their way to be helpful, polite, and address all of our needs with a great attitude. We highly recommend them.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Lovely accommodations in a great location,"Facility was in a great location - close to light rail, 16th Street Mall and great restaurants.  Room was clean and quiet (12th floor).  Starbucks on site and Corner Bakery next door.  Conference rooms and food were outstanding. Staff friendly and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great for Business Travelers ,"This hotel is great for business travelers that have work in the area. Very easy to catch a cab, close to the train stops, plenty of restaurants catering to office workers (quick and tasty). The downside is not much is open past 6pm in the immediate vicinity. So if it's nightlife you're after you might want to check another area. Although the hotel has a spacious bar good for having cocktails and watching a football game.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great nights rest guaranteed!!!,I don't know about you but when I go away the one thing I miss is my bed and my pillows. If you stay at the Marriott in downtown Denver you won't have to worry about this. The beds are extremely comfortable and they provide for beautiful feather pillows for your comfort. Upon arrival I was greeted with a friendly staff and swiftly sent to my room. Upon arrival to my room I found that I had All the amenities that I needed. The one thing that was missing was a room which was swiftly booked my room upon request. Each day my room was attended effectively and swiftly ( meaning during the morning hours not sometime in the afternoon).  The concierge was not only friendly but went out of his way to assist in any way he could think of. I would not hesitate to come back again and suggest you give them a try.. It is very centrally located to downtown Denver and easy access to public transit..,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,WOW! And not in a good way!,"I have stayed at Hilton's and Marriott's for quite some time. This has got to be one of the worst experiences I have had. Let's start with the room. It was nice enough, but the maid left hair everywhere in the bathroom and there were not pens, paper, or shampoo when I checked in. Then the next day the bed was only half made---seriously half made!Let's talk about service. The front desk crew was nice enough, but I swear most of them were clueless and if they didn't know the answer, they didn't want to find out. I was there for a conference. They have an affiliation with UPS. I had 3 packages shipped to the hotel. All arrived with PODs, but only 2 showed up at my room that first night. When I went to ask about the 3rd package, I was told that the situation with UPS was a mess and the gentleman from Marriott told me ""It really isn't my concern that you didn't receive your package. You will need to take it up with them tomorrow when---if---they get here."" What kind of customer service is that? Don't ask about shipping charges on your hotel bill---they won't know. And do not call to ask questions later because you will be on hold for 10 minutes before they finally hang up on you!For a hotel that does conferences and it a top of the line chain, this hotel needs to work on its customer service model, educate its employees, and create a better relationship with its business partners!",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great service, outside noise is a little bad, great location ","I was speaking at a conference and needed to get into my room early to shower and change. The staff made sure that happened.  All of the food at the conference was excellent.  So far a 5 rating. Room was large, bed and pillows were comfortable. Still working on a 5 rating. Even though I was on the 19th floor, the room still picked up a lot of street noise, including the train bells which start at 4am.  In addition none of the restaurants in the hotel, including the concierge room are open before 7am on a Saturday.  This makes it very difficult, impossibly to have breakfast at the hotel and still have enough time to catch a 9:00 to 9:30 am flight as the airport is a 30 minute cab ride.  Due to the last 2 items, I am forced to lowere my rating to a 4",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,I thought I was in a JW Marriott,"From the greeting upon arrival to picking up the checked bags and getting the car I thought I was at a JW Marriott. This place rocks.  We were upgraded to a King suite, but needed the hide away sofa for our daughter. Housekeeping was at our door within 5 minutes not only to make the bed, but with extra toiletries. Next time I'm in Denver I will be staying here again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Between 3 and 4 Stars,"I was speaking at this hotel for a conference so the event organizers put me up at this hotel.  Struggled with either a 3 or 4 star rating as the staff within the hotel and at the conference was very helpful, prompt, and friendly. The rooms, common areas, and conference facilities are clean.  Amenities and prices are what I expected for a full service hotel located in a downtown area.Minor negative for not having fridges and microwaves in each room.  The biggest negative boiled down to sleep quality.  Nothing to do with bed comfort or room temp controls but due to 2 things likely related to the age of the building (which looks like it was built in the 1970's).1)  Room to room noise - thin walls as I could hear curtains closing in the room next to me.2) Door noise - biggest irritation is that the design of the room doors is such that every time that someone closes their door it is heard quite loudly throughout the whole floor. I tried and could not figure out a way to get the door to close quietly.  There is also a large gap at the bottom of each room door which does not help.In the end, the lack of sleep quality made for a 3 star rating. Replacing the guest room doors with quieter mechanisms and hardware would be a huge improvement - I've seen the newer doors at various properties and they work great.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Sporting KC ,stayed here for the sporting KC game from Kansas City. rode a bus 10 hrs and the hotel was very accommodating at the bust check in. the star bucks was great because they didn't have free breakfast but they did have a buffet option. the hotel is in the perfect part of the city to walk anywhere and the room was spacious and clean. fantastic view.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place,"I firmly believe pay a little more for concierge level and Marriott City Center Denver has affirmed this. The hotel is comfortable staff are friendly, helpful and attentive. Not one problem and we felt very safe! I am marriott loyal and this hotel is in my top five. Thanks for making our stay enjoyable.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice !,"I stayed here for 8 nights on business.  Never had a problem. The room was always clean when I returned every evening.  Concierge lounge was nice.  Attendant was pleasant.  Only ate in the restaurant once, well, actually I ordered take out.  Burger was fine.  Bartender was attentive.  All in all, a very pleasant experience.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice Hotel, Great Location","I’ve been to Marriott’s all over the country and Denver’s is near the top of the list.  Hotel is very nice inside and the staff is helpful and on top of everything.  The rooms were clean and offered to some good views of the city.  The concierge lounge was huge and offered a great assortment of food, better than most concierge lounges.  My only complaint was the coffee situation.  They had 2 large brew to order coffee makers that ground the beans and brewed each cup as needed.  In theory this sounds great, but coffee took a few minutes to make and when you have 15-20 people waiting to make coffee, could take quite a long time.Overall great hotel close to bars, restaurants, shopping, etc.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Clean, comfortable and well appointed.","We had a nice stay at this hotel.  The staff was friendly, the room clean and well appointed.  My only complaint would be the hotel pillows.  I probably should have asked for a better pillow, but I didn't.  The mattress and the linens were great!  You will not be disappointed.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location for business or pleasure.,"Great location, in walking distance to food and shopping. I stayed for a business meeting but night were freed up for 16th street walking. Bed were comfortable, rooms kinda small, a little outdated. I stayed on the 4th floor and I could hear street noises but not horrible. Breakfast buffet was good but priced high. Starbucks in the building. All staff were Extremely attentive and nice. Homeless are all up and down 16th street but not too aggressive.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location for all ages,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights during the last leg of our vacation to Colorado. We thoroughly enjoyed the ease of access we had to restaurants, Coors Field, Union Station and 16th Street Mall. The hotel itself was also just as great as the location. The staff was extremely helpful and the rooms were nicely furnished. There is also a Starbucks right in the lobby and no one is ever mad about that!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice hotel with beautiful updated lobby!,We stayed at the Marriott for our 1st anniversary this past weekend. The staff was great! The lobby has been remodeled and is beautiful. Great central location in downtown Denver. We felt the valet parking service was a little pricey but it was comparable to private parking lots around the hotel. The rooms need to be updated but the beds were very comfortable. The 2nd night some people with loud children moved into the room next to ours but all in all it was a nice stay. We would stay there again.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Marriott location - easy access to convention center,"Nice decor and convenient to Convention Center (about 3-4 block walk).  Rooms nice (standard Marriott), workout facility pretty good - could have used another spin bike, but the treadmills and other equiptment was in very good condition.  Pool looked good, but did not try it out. Service was really slow, sadly...likely because it was so busy with a convention in town.  Breakfast and Bar service specifically.  One thing about this area of Denver...kind of yuck with all the homeless/panhandlers.  I mean, they are aggressive.  I didn't necessarily feel safe walking alone because they were out in full force.  Streets were kind of trashy too.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Date Night,"We decided to have a date night downtown after dinner with friends and to stay at this hotel.  Valet parking was a snap, Tony who checked us in was gracious and professional.  Our room was clean and appointed very well but had a few dents and dings where art work had been changed.  The mattress and pillows were outstanding as usual for a Marriot.  This hotel is convenient to all of downtown and lodo for entertainment and restaurants.  If we choose to do this again we would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Typical $200 Downtown Hotel for $160,"Nice facilities and decor, did not have time to use pool or spa. Food was very good and service was excellent. Has light rail terminal right across the street and free mall bus one block away. One of the managers gave me a ride in the baggage elevator to avoid a huge backlog on all six main elevators in the lobby, a nice extra touch of service, I did had to have front desk remove internet service charge at checkout, supposed to be free for members, but was on my bill anyway.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Love Denver,Very nice hotel and in a great location. Though the suite upgrade was not much to speak of it was very comfortable and the usual Marriott comfy beds. We have not been to downtown Denver in awhile and was looking forward to shopping and eating on the 16th street mall. Wow...some parts have become quite dirty and not what we remembered. Instead went to Curtis Park Deli on 26th for lunch. Outstanding!!!! But get there early because they tend to sell out by early afternoon.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Lodging close to everything,"Had a we do explore Denver with my 12 year old daughter.  This hotel had very friendly staff, shuttle service, and very clean pool/workout gym. It's close to shopping and restaurants and not to miss 16th Street.  The suite was spacious with small kitchen with refrigerator & microwave upon request.  Slept well. Will visit again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Lovely stay here for a night in Denver. ,"As locals at times we like to stay downtown, we were lucky enough to score a sweet deal on the Marriott for a weekend stay. Everyone was friendly and welcoming.  Front desk lady was playful and helped accommodate our room request. Overall clean rooms and common areas.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Met High Marriott Standards,"Great location for downtown business - for me quite walkable to attractions and many great restaurants. There was no need to rent a car on this trip - what a relief!As a gold member I appreciated the comp concierge level perks and service (breakfast, snacks and drinks and a private place to meet or work) and of course free wifi. The doorman gave good timely walking directions and my check-in went smoothly.My driver to the airport was allowed to wait about 15 minutes in front without being hassled to move - nice.I liked getting member points for declining maid service daily (3 days)- what a great eco idea! Food service to my room was timely and as described (burger and salad-nothing special).Note: We hear a lot about company's commitments to ""exceeding expectations"" - well, honestly, I am satisfied if expectations are simply met because so often they are not. Pricewise-I was pleasantly surprise to find a rate less than half that at the Ritz Carlton  around the corner. The Ritz is NOT twice as good. Do not be afraid to negotiate a bit.This Marriott worked for me.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"I stayed here while in town for business.  I found it to be in a great location, close to to restaurants, shopping, etc.  The staff was outstanding, the room well appointed and clean.  The hotel decor was lovely and I had an overall good stay.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Good hotel, good location","Nice location off of California Street which is a 5 minute walk from the 16th street mall area.  Rooms were clean and the staff was very accommodating and helpful.  The hotel is in a nice, safe area.  If you drove like we did, plan on doing more walking than driving during your stay and do not want to pay the hotel's valet parking prices, there is a parking garage across the street from the hotel where you pay less than you would with the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Always good, sometimes great","Stay here about once a month for work. Each check in, nice rooms, good service. They recently redid their restaurant/bar area downstairs. Standard Marriott fare with some interesting additions. Worth checking out. The only drawback, and I say this is the most mild terms, is for elite members who have access to the lounge. Its on a great floor with great views, fully stocked bar, etc. But oftentimes the food is seriously lacking. I know it doesnt have to be this way; once in a while its great. But usually its uninspiring for the PM hours.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great visit,"Came to Denver to see the Rockies and knock out another baseball park:)Comfy bed, extremely quiet location.  Hotel was great...very convenient to everything downtown.  Very walkable location.  Loved our visit, great service.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Typical Marriott,"We had two rooms on the Concierge floor.  Rooms were nice and clean, comfortable beds and quiet.  The lounge was well stocked and adequate.  Within walking distance to many attractions like the museums and Capital.  Great burger place down the road called Lark burger.  Even great veggie burgers for an inexpensive dinner or lunch with teens.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent Accomodations,"This was a very nice hotel.  The staff were very friendly and made sure that I had everything that I needed.  Though the rooms and especially the bathrooms are a bit small, it did not take away from the service and comfort that I experienced at this hotel.  It is in a great location and about a 10 minute walk to the Convention Center. It's what you would expect from the Marriott Brand.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Average,This Marriott is in a good location however the rooms are mediocre as well as the service.  We would rather stay at another hotel when in town. Rooms are not very clean and we seem to find hairs in our bed and in the bathroom when we have stayed here.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Expected More,"Nice hotel, nothing exceptional. Staff was friendly and room service limited.Room lacked basic amenity like a fridge. Bathroom was a little cramped and shower curtain leaked. Also lacked a drying line for swim suits. Pool was small  but okay.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Loved it!,"We loved the overall experience of this hotel. The location is about as good as it gets in downtown Denver, as you are easily able to walk to just about anywhere downtown. The lobby is beautiful and it has a great bar just downstairs from the lobby. Check-in was quick and easy, and all of our questions were answered by the front desk with a friendly and helpful attitude. The concierge lounge was extremely large and well attended, and we enjoyed breakfast there. I thought the room to be very spacious and clean with great views of the city. The bathrooms are a little on the small side, but for just the two of us it was fine. Now, while my single complaint is no parking, and the only way to park a car at the hotel is a hefty valet fee, I will say the valets are awesome! Once we forgot something in our car, and they ran to get it happily. We also requested specific times we needed our car, and it was always ready as requested. They were some of the nicest and helpful valets I have seen. I just wish it wasn't $37 a day plus a tip every time I see them, just to have a car. But my experience in large cities is that is the norm, so I've gotten used to it. I would recommend this hotel if you are in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Marriott Denver ... Focused on Excellence !,"We have stayed at this Marriott before while attending a conference at the convention center across the street  -  top quality and amenities and staff from the welcoming front desk to the room attendants, to the concierge level with a single purpose ... to ensure our stay was absolutely excellent !",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Average Marriott,"Convenient location, old building, tired carpeting, dirty carpets are the norm, decent sized rooms, poor bathrooms, frozen in the 80's type of hotel. Expected more form Marriott in such an important city. Windows were extremely dirty.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great downtown location!,"We stayed at this hotel for my Birthday celebration. The lady at front desk, Naomi, was very pleasant and provided a fast check-in. She also gave us some great recommendations about where to go out for dinner in the area. Since hotel is located right in the downtown Denver, everything is pretty walkable and you don't need to drive to find a great place to eat. The only disadvantage I can mention was the charge for the valet ($37). You also have an option to park at the parking structure across the street, it's a little cheaper and they don't force you to park at the hotel. But we still chose the valet service, since it's more convinient for us to have our car close.The rooms were regular, did not really stand out. Service is prompt. I requested some extra towels around 11pm, and Naomi from Front desk delivered it to me herself, which was nice. I woild highly recommend this hotel to explore the city, since it's located in downtown and the main attractions are within the walking distance.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Awful rooms, great concierge","The lobby area is comfortable and spacious but the rooms are exactly the opposite: cramped, dim and ugly. The bathroom is even worse: the toilet takes up most of the space so you have to wedge yourself between the toilet and the mirror to use the sink. No amenities whatsoever--no refrigerator, no robe, not even a shower cap--so it feels  like a kind of urban camping to stay there. The staff, on the other hand, are cheerful and the concierge especially really went the extra mile for us--what you would get at a 5-star if you were lucky. If you can stay at the Hyatt instead, by all means go there--it's a cut above this hotel and you will be much better rested and prepared for whatever brought you to Denver.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very disappointed in this hotel.,"I really did not like this hotel because some things were lacking. They have the wrong hours on their restaurant  menu. I went to eat breakfast in the hotel and they had already stopped serving. No server even bothered to come to my table, and I had to go somewhere else, which changed my plans. The first day there were no paper cups with my coffee maker. I used glasses in the room. On the floor I was on, there was no water fountain. I had to go all the way down to the lower lobby to get water. The second to the last day the housekeeping had not come by 4:00 pm. I had to call the front desk and ask for my room to be serviced. I have Marriott points and I am really considering not staying at Marriott in the future.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very good hotel.  Great staff.,"Rooms are not small as some have alleged, but bathroom is small.  Concierge lounge is nice and offers a nice breakfast and excellent hors d’oerves for dinner.  It's open 7 days per week. Attendant Matthew was very personable. Very nice gym and pool on 2nd floor.  Excellent location in the very center of town. Service is good. Almost all staff are friendly.We stayed 6 nights in July 2015.  Unfortunately, the TV in your room does not carry Fox News.  They carry a local Fox channel, but it doesn’t carry the news programs that Fox News carries.   Similarly, the treadmills in the gym carry NBC, CNN, etc, but not Fox News.   This absence of real news and analysis keeps you out of the loop while you are there.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great central downtown hotel,"This hotel was in a great location for access to both Coors field and the 16th Street Mall. We could easily walk to both locations. The hotel itself was nice. The lobby is really great. The room was fine. Nothing spectacular, but it was clean, comfortable, quiet, and I had no complaints. We parked at a garage that the bellman suggested. We stayed one night and the charge for parking was $22. It would have been $37 to park at the Marriott. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Several calls did not help,"First of all, our grandsons, 9 & 11, liked the hotel. The best part was the staff. They were great at addressing our problems. The difficulty was that there were so many problems. We needed an accessible room connecting with a room for our grandsons. This is a hard combination to find, so I called the hotel three times to be sure such an arrangement existed. Each time, I was told there was no problem. When we arrived, they told us that no such combination existed: an accessible room connected to another room. That, threw us into room changes with my husband in the accessible room and a child with him while I took a room down the hall with the other child. Okay, we could live with that. But then, the ""accessible bathroom,"" had no bars beside the toilet, so I had to be with my husband at night and in the morning when he used the toilet. We made adjustments. I had purchased a room with a breakfast and parking package. I had to ask for each charge to be removed. Again, the staff was wonderful and I feel bad giving such a review, but it was hard work staying here. We had to work for each of the elements we had reserved. It did have a great workout center, but pool area was dreary and the pool was freezing. It has a good location, but we probably won't stay there again. So sorry for the staff.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business or Pleasure...this is central!,"This is a great place for business meetings, in the heart of Denver.  Attentive staff and very nice rooms.  I have also stayed there for personal visits...very close to everything that is Downtown Denver!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Starts good, but goes downhill fast","Walking into the lobby is impressive. Service is prompt and friendly. Then on to the rooms. Nothing. They must have spend all the money on the lobby. Old, faded, no refrig, little extra, outdated toilet area, and on and on. As I am  handicapped, I asked for an accessible room. It was, barely. Not even an elevated or elongated toilet or pull bars. If you're looking of an accessible room, go someplace else. There was a kid's athletic convention in town and all the kids seemed to be on my floor and their sponsors in the basement bar. What a disappointment for the money.",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Extra Charges Abound!,"The lobby is nice but it sets you up for disappointment when you reach the rooms.  The rooms are ugly and not comfortable at all.  Even down to things like the TV bring crooked and the rooms being dirty. There is no fridge or bar in the room. However, you can order those things for a hefty fee. Charges for wifi $10 a night. Parking $37. Maid service? Better leave a tip in the envelope they place in the room or they wont be back. They even charged us a $5 minimum per package/letter we had sent to the hotel. Service staff was apathetic and maids only showed up 2x after requests in 5 days.  Only the second time to stay at a Marriott but we will not be back.  Denver Marriott City Center was horrible.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good hotel in good location,We stayed here as part of a flight deal and we were really pleased. The location is great for 16th street. We had a nice big room which was well equipped. We were close to breakfast and dinner options. I used the pool which was fine for a city centre location. We would be happy to stay there again.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice location, comfortable property","This hotel is a block off of 16th street and across the street from a light rail station.  While the property is downtown, at night the streets quiet and the rooms are comfortable and good for sleeping.  Beds are comfortable, rooms are nice sized and the property has most amenities you would want.  Nice venure for a small to mid-sized conference or meeting.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A mixed bag conference hotel,"First off, the location was pretty good for accessing downtown activities. We were able to walk to restaurants, shopping, over to the stadium and museum areas. Also, the front-desk/bell staff are super friendly and helpful! Weirdly - the staff in the restaurant/bars and most especially the event catering staff were constantly huffy and appeared put out by every part of their jobs. The bar/restaurant seemed incredibly short-staffed, so perhaps that was part of it. But the catering staff were pretty unpleasant - makes me wonder if there's a totally different management structure between the two areas.The hotel is pretty typical downtown mid-range conference hotel. A decent fitness room. A cramped and unpleasant indoor pool area (I mean, geez, get some art or paint the walls at least). Room typical size, all the facilities worked, cleaners did a nice job daily. Our first room had an issue, and the front desk staff re-roomed us with a smile. I really do want to praise their friendly hotel staff!",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very nice hotel,"I love Marriott and this one didn't disappoint!  Everyone was friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived.  Location is perfect for walking to almost anything you need.  My one issue was the mandatory valet parking at $37.50 a day (+tip).  Crazy!  Although I guess it's not mandatory if you want to walk a ways and park in a public garage, which was just inconvenient.  They have you between a rock and a hard place. To end on a good note though, the concierge lounge was great.  A nice place to go relax and have a drink after a long day.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent Property,"Located right downtown within walking distance of just about everything. Rooms were decent sized, comfortable bedding & decent furnishings. Sleep quality very good--nice & quiet. Marriott member lounge had the ususal breakfast & afternoon snacks but they need more than 1 staff as she was overmatched with crowd--was a chore getting morning coffee. Nice big bar on the ground level. Overall--typical Marriott but when did you ever stay at a substandard Marriott.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Super nice people here but...,Super nice people here but sometimes service is a little lacking cause of too many people and not enough staff. We checked in and had a line of 6 people.  See 6 people is not much but as Marriott Platinum I never see a line of 6 people. Oh yes when we arrived had to wait almost 20 minutes to get the hotel valet to take the car. Eat breakfast and getting coffee was a bit challenging and at dinner the person I was with asked for the check and another glass of wine. The check came and we never did gt the glass of wine(and we did not get charged for it) but it seems that the hotel is JUST A TINY bit lacking on number of staff.  the funny part is at times I went by the front desk and there was NO line at all. I know it is tricky but usually our arrival time which was mid to late afternoon I think is prime time arrival... Overall the hotel is VERY clean and very well maintained. All the people on the staff are wonderful. I mean if I were in the area I would definitely stay here again. The breakfast buffet was better than most Marriott's adding a few local things. Nice lobby area also for people to congregate to work which you almost never see at other hotels. Other marriotts take note on a nice way to setup your lobby for just hanging out by guests with like plugs everywhere and comfortable chairs - A+ on this one!Overall nice hotel and a lot nicer than many Marriotts I have stayed in. I always judge a place on would I return to this ho0tel if I were in this area: and I WOULD return to this hotel.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Nice hotel, secure elevator to upper floors; meeting rooms; Rooms nice but aged; Comfortable","Not a bad hotel choice for downtown. Went with large company group and got $199 per night rate which might be reasonable for downtown Denver very close to 16th street mall.  You can take the light rail to this hotel, a stop right across street.    Rooms are nice and comfortable but a bit aged with wear showing slightly in places. Standard for a large downtown hotel.    Meeting rooms worked well and were serviced nicely during our meetings with fresh snacks and what-nots.     Front desk staff would NOT allow late check-out for Platinum member who stayed with a company group of 30 or more - spending a bunch of money. BAD PRACTICE as all I wanted was a 1 pm check-out versus 12 pm. Shows they are NOT flexible.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Overall a nice stay....with one major issue,"We enjoyed the location of this hotel. You're within walking distance to excellent shops and restaurants as well as transportation. We parked our car for the entire stay and parking and retrieval were quick and efficient. We appreciated that the Concierge Lounge is open on weekends, although they opened too late for our early departure. Staff is very nice. We had one - mostly bad issue. After a long travel day and dinner out, we got back to the hotel and turned our bed down. Soiled sheets greeted us. Honestly the bed looked like it had been sat on prior to turndown, but that didn't particularly bother us. What did bother us was the sheets were dirty. Man! What a disappointment to have to deal with this when we wanted to go to bed. The front desk reacted promptly and had housekeeping come up and change our sheets. The two housekeeping staff that came seemed a little surprised to see the dirty sheets (I won't further describe what we think was on the sheets). We didn't hear more from the hotel about this experience, and I kinda thought management might get in touch to apologize, but...no. Had they, we would have felt better about this unfortunate and I'm sure unusual circumstance.The hotel rooms are dated but very functional. TV and radio were nice. Bathrooms are some of the smallest you may run across. We didn't experience room to room or hallway to room noise. We would consider this hotel again, with a couple of reservations. 4 stars despite the issue with the sheets reflects that this hotel could have been a great experience with a little follow-up.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Fabulous conference facilities,"From the moment I arrived, the staff of the Denver Marriott City Center have been warm and extremely helpful. The facilities are impeccable and the decor and layout are highly appealing. The generous space on the lower levels makes movement and meetings a breeze, eliminating excessive foot traffic and noise from other hotel guests.Guest rooms are spacious and well appointed as well.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Giants double header,"this place had great service.  our room wasnt quite as expected but changing wasn't a problem even yhough they were extremly  busy. location was awesome. front desk staff was very helpful with arrangements.  Parking was a hassle, very busy in frnt of hotel and had to wait for car",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Hotel and Location,"The hotel was fantastic and situated in the center of Denver and easily access downtown amenities and 16th St Mall. Staff was fantastic and very professional, quick check-in and checkout and any questions were answered quickly. Room was very nice, good size. Very clean and was a nice 5 day stay with no issues.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice Location in Downtown Denver,"This hotel is located in the center of Downtown Denver. In walking distance to a lot of shops, restaurants and the convention center. You can also walk to the Rockies Baseball stadium as well, about a 7 - 10 minute walk. The hotel is very nice, get a high floor, for the great views. The staff is very friendly and outgoing as well. Enjoyed my time spent here. Well worth the trip.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Business,"Centrally located, walking distance to Convention Center, 16th Street Mall with shops n cafes. Furnishings a bit dated, but all good and functioning. WiFi good connection and speed. Would stay again if going to Denver and needed to be centrally located.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent property in the heart of Denver,"I stayed briefly at the Marriott City Center and was really pleased with my entire experience. It's a excellent business/tourist hotel with all the expected amenities, they made my stay really easy and comfortable. The fitness room was also well-equipped. I'll definitely stay here again if I'm in central Denver!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good location But average,Inside the hotel starts to age with exception of the Lobby wich is small . Staff is friendly and helpfull . Rooms are OK But could need an uplift. Also walls are thin so you can hear corridor and your neighbours .,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Customer service fantastic! ,"Marriott hotel customer service is out of this world fantastic! The view is beautiful of the downtown area! There's a Starbucks right on the corner across the street. Spacious rooms and luxurious linens. My husband thinks the bed is too soft I think it's just right. Microwave and refrigerator are available upon request. The only thing I would complain of is street sounds, the trolley bell starts ringing about 6 a.m. and can be heard from the room (we were on 11th floor). If you are a light sleeper it will bother you.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Praise for hotel staff member,"I was there for a conference, and called because of a broken toilet.  Approximately three hours later it was still not fixed and I called the front desk again. The person who identified himself as the manager offered to call again but let me know in the mean time there was public restroom on the second room. He finally relented in moving to another room which smelled like smoke. I went to the front desk and a hotel staffer by the name of Nicole took care of the problem. She apologized for the inconvenience, she showed the right amount of empathy and concern and moved me to a room with a mountain view.  She was the epitome of class and customer service.  The night before I Ieft the the ex-assistant sent up cookies, milk and water with a note of apology. Nicole showed more customer service, and business sense than the manager.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Very good business hotel in downtown Denver,"Very nice Marriott right in the middle of downtown, near good restaurants and walking distance to most everything downtown.  I found the rooms very comfortable and the hotel is nice all around.  The room I had (1721) was oddly shaped (long and narrow) - I don't know about the other rooms but it would be an awkward space with a family.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Best Service Ever,"My wife was here for a week for a conference and I tagged along to have fun.  The service in all areas of this hotel was amazing!  From the friendly helpful bell hops to the welcoming front desk staff.  Richard  the concierge has the town wired and has great info.  Jason (bartender / foodie scene tour conductor) was awesome.  He told us where all the hot foodie spots in town were and made amazing cocktails.  Nate and Frank also really took care of us at the bar the entire week.  My wife had an important last minute meeting to be held in a hospitality suite and the staff made sure her wine was chilled and the room was set up to perfection.  The wife is recovering from surgery and was exhausted on the last night of her conference.  All she wanted was a couple of warm cookies.  I was trying to figure out where to possibly go at 11pm on a Tuesday, when Jason at the bar and Arturo in the kitchen made it happen!!  They made her fresh warm chocolate chip cookies, right then.  Just amazing.  We travel a lot for business and pleasure.  This place is hands down the best all around service we have encountered.  As far as the rest of the hotel:The rooms are a little outdated, but clean and comfortable.Word of warning.  Denver is a great town with a lot of cool places for micro brews, prohibition cocktails, and  gourmet food, but the food and drinks at this hotel are so good it is hard to go anywhere else.  The waitstaff are friendly and attentive.  Try the shrimp tacos.  If Jason is working the bar, ask for the JD Sour.Also, Pretzel rolls.  Yessss!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Friendly staff, otherwise standard business hotel","Maybe it is just Colorado culture, but the staff here was extremely helpful and nice! I had a problem with some dry cleaning I needed done and they were extremely accommodating (so to speak). Great location in downtown Denver. Offer a better selection of teas at breakfast!",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Ok for a Marriott,"I have status at Marriott, so we decided to staycation at the Denver Marriott for our anniversary.  The service was exemplary; staff was courteous.  The pool was large enough to swim laps in and nicely daylit.  The executive lounge was a bit small/crowded for a hotel of this size.  Again the staff was great in the lounge and the food was as expected. The room was small and it felt like we did not have room more than to put up the ironing board and the luggage on a stand.  I ordered a hair dryer because that was not in the room and my hair air dried before the dryer got there.  Overall, I would come back on a business trip because it is closely located to 16th street and many businesses, but I would not come back otherwise.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Location!,"Great location. Close to all that downtown Denver has to offer. Walking distance to everything, with wonderful restaurants around. Would definitely recommend concierge level to take advantage of the included breakfast. Very relaxing and enjoyable stay.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location and excellent staff but....,"Stayed here recently and was very impressed by the location and the staff. Staff couldn't have been more helpful and are among the very best I have seen in a long time. Main downside was the room which, while large, had a pull down bed. I thought it was a joke at first and there was a proper bed but sadly not. Other downside was that the doors to the room let in huge amounts of light from the corridor. Had to use my pillows to block out the light to get some sleep. Shame as I thought it would be a great stay when I arrived",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Marriott,"Came here for a convention.  Was not expecting the concierge room to be open 24 hours on weekdays and for normal hours on weekends (in most Marriotts these are closed for the weekend). The hotel was clean, up-to-date, spacious and well maintained. The restaurant was excellent for breakfast, and they have a Starbucks on the premises. Wifi worked fine. There are usually lots of cabs out front in the am - less in the pm. Everyone from the front desk to the bell hops were excellent and very service oriented.  Very convenient to the light rail system and only 5 blocks to the convention center.  LoDo was also a walkable distance away.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient Location to Downtown Denver,"Denver Marriott City Center was clean and very well kept. Everyone who assisted us, from the front desk, to the valet and cleaning staff were very friendly and accommodating. The standard room with two queen beds was a little snug, but still comfortable, especially since we spent most of our time out and about in downtown and the close-by surrounding area. I chose to stay here for a weekend trip to avoid having to drive through traffic to get downtown. Everything was in walking distance, and there was no shortage of restaurants and shopping in this area. My only issue was being placed in a room directly by the elevators. I should have requested a different room, because there was a little bit more noise in the hallway, which is to be expected. I would definitely stay there again just for the convenience.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Close to the action,"Stayed here for a conference that was 4 blocks away at the convention center.  This hotel is super close to Union Station, 16th street mall, Rockies/Broncos stadiums, and several restaurants/bars. Stayed on the 9th floor and had good view of the mountains and city. The room was comfortable and kept clean.  The valet and front desk staff were very courteous.  My only complaint is that parking is an extra fee, but this is common practice at many hotels... so not a deal breaker.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location,"Great Location.  Within walking distance of 16th street mall, convention center.   Rooms are spacious and clean.  Staff very friendly.   Make sure you get a room on the highest floors to have a view of the mountains.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Average stay when in town for Rockies game,"Price was similar for all the downtown hotels, next time we'll try a different one. At check-in, I requested a rollaway and was assured it would be delivered immediately. Hours later, as we left for Coors field, I told the bellhop (person #2) that we were still waiting for the rollaway and that I wanted it in the room for our late arrival. ""Immediately"" was again promised. And I had to call and ask for it the 3rd time after we got back from the game! Disappointing.Third floor room not high enough to escape traffic noise.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Clean Rooms & Friendly Staff,"I stayed at the Denver Marriott City Center for four nights for a conference at the Convention Center. Overall, it is a nice hotel. The staff is very friendly, the rooms were clean, and the location is great if the convention center or the 16th street mall are on your list of priorities.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Meeting Planner Review,"I recently completed an event with around 38 people in attendance at this hotel.  The staff is excellent and my CSM Daniel was FABULOUS!!!  I never had to ask for something twice and they were always very prompt and responsive.  All details were adhered to and it was a very easy location to work with.  As a planner it is always the little things that mean so much to us.  All the boxes I requested to have ahead of time in my ballroom were there when I arrived onsite and they even left me a box cutter!!!  Mind you I always travel with one since this is the first hotel that's left one with my boxes.  That says a lot to me.  The food was excellent and the chefs do a great job in all the buffets, and reception bites.  All in all I would hold another event at this location in a heart beat.  I hope we get to come back soon as it was one of the easiest, most seamless events I've had in a long time.  They do a great job.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Weekends in the Concierge are great,People in the Concierge lounge were fabulous!  Highly recommend for downtown Denver.  Location is two blocks from 16th Street mall.  Easy access from the highway.  Great business center. Front desk was helpful.  Nice rooms.  Good size.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not so special,"While the shared spaces of lobby and bar areas are nice (benches by fireside), the room seemed a bit tired. Not very large and not soundproof. I was on the 18th floor and still heard a fair amount of traffic noise. Hall noises carried as well. Especially the door slams. I was expecting better of the concierge level and it's pricyness. My daughter thought the workout room was ok. Neither of the 2 business areas worked well, one was in the concierge breakfast area, and did not work. The main one was situated on the lowest level temporarily and after 15 minutes I finally got my boarding passes printed. Not what I expect from a business center. I much prefer the Cherry Creek Marriott but this one was closer to my event.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Staff but Dated Property,"I stayed at the City Center for a recent conference. The staff were great and very helpful. Good location. However, the property itself is a bit worn and dated. It definitely needs an update. There currently is no business center which was a major inconvenience. I had to walk a block and a half several times to a FedEx to scan documents. Room service food was not very good. Given the overall experience, I would say the hotel is a bit pricey.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Valet Service Ranks Low,"Decent hotel but the worst valet service I've ever experienced. What continues to amaze me is hotels like this charge valet fees of $30+/night however when you need your vehicle you have to wait for such a length of time for it to arrive. And calling down ahead of time didn't prove to be much more helpful either. With that said, staff was courteous and housekeeping did a wonderful job keeping room clean. If it wasn't for the awful valet experience I would have rated this hotel much better.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Enjoy staying at this property when in Denver!,"When I travel to Denver for business I usually stay at this hotel.  It is downtown so you have a slightly smaller room but they are very nice and mine have always been clean.  There is more street noise but again, hey you are downtown.  The upside is all the wonderful places in downtown Denver you can walk to.  They also have a complimentry shuttle that can take you to places within a certain radius (as the front desk).  I think their concierge lounge is really one of the best.  It is a very nice size and the breakfast is excellent.  I will continue to frequent this hotel and would recommed it to you!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Wonderful Place for Business and Pleasure,Enjoyed a recent business trip to this hotel. It is actually the second time I have stayed here. Both stays were above average. Nice rooms. Great location. The mall has dozens of great restaurants and entertainment opportunities. I do with they offered and airport shuttle.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Perfect location,Great location as central to all we wanted to do for our four days in town. Staff was incredibly friendly and even supplied all of us with umbrellas for inclement weather. Fireplace in lobby very welcoming and the lounge and dining area were perfect for our late returns. Rooms are well appointed as you'd expect marriott to be,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Beige beige beige!!!,The lobby is ok...staff on reception I found polite cheery and helpful.But the rooms are outdated and gloomy. The shower barely wets you there must be a water pressure issue?For me the worst is the noise...trolley on the main strip can be heard...train horns car noise and other guests banging doors. If you need to sleep past 7am as I did forget it!! Dreadful I dislike coming here and dread it every time due to lack of sleep!,2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Great hotel, Excellent location","I recently stayed at this hotel for a conference.  It is a nice hotel in a great location.  It is about 2 blocks from the walking mall, so you can get to the shops, restaurants, outdoor pianos etc. really quickly. The room was very nice, the staff was always very attentive and helpful.  I had a ""city view"", which wasn't much of a view, but that was not a big issue.  It poured rain much of my stay, and the hotel had umbrellas that guests could take out, which was a nice touch.  The restaurant had very good food and surprisingly was one of the best meals I had in Denver!  The conference was held on the lower level, the conference facilities are nice, but there are no windows because they are below ground.  The conference food was ok, but not as good as the restaurant food.  The lobby is very nice and the concierge were very helpful.  There are taxis available 24 hours a day.  The lobby is really nice with a nice sitting area up above.  I used the fitness room and there is also a small indoor pool on the second level.  I would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location ,"This hotel is in a great location close to shops and transport, the staff are friendly and helpful, room service was a reasonable price and it was tasty and hot, there is a Starbucks inside the hotel and a bakery and salad bar next door. The rooms are large and clean, I would definitely visit again.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Yuck!,"I stay at Marriott properties approximately 250 days per year, and have a pretty good idea about the quality of the Marriott properties and service.  I just finished up my third (and last) stay at the Denver CIty Center.  The rooms are small, cramped, outdated, poorly insulated and dirty.  The constant ice cold, scalding hot swings while showering are not enjoyable. The quality of food and service in the restaurant is so bad, I have stopped at McDonalds to avoid eating there.  Overall I would prefer staying anywhere else downtown other than this property, regardless of price.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Meh....,"It was ok, the bathrooms are tiny in the rooms and the shower does not have much pressure. They gave me a double when I requested a king when making the reservation. The lobby seems to have been renovated and updated but not the rest of the hotel. The restaurant is good and the staff is great. The concierge from New Jersey was a hoot we really enjoyed chatting with him..........They also gave great recommendations to other great places to eat in the local area. One thing that I will say annoys me. The pillows are entirely too small. They are not normal sized pillows and it is very uncomfortable.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,They must have made some changes?,"I was a little hesitant about staying here, after reading mixed Tripadvisor reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't experience any of the ""bad"" things that others brought up.  The concierge (Tony?) was extremely friendly and helpful.  So much that I made sure to point it out to a manager on duty.  The room was clean and smelled fantastic.  The noise from the fire trucks at the station wasn't ideal, but what can you do about that?  It really wasn't all that loud.  The food from the restaurant was fantastic.  The WiFi worked fine and was not an extra charge.  If Denver Marriott City Center has been making changes since the bad reviews were written, it's definitely working!  Overall, a fantastic experience to stay here for 3 nights.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"I booked this hotel as the location was central and walking distance to many things we planned to do. However, the rainy weather altered those plans :)  We still enjoyed our stay as the hotel is nice, comfortable and clean, and staff are very friendly.  Being a Marriott gold member, I received a room on the concierge floor.  We enjoyed a light dinner there, as well as breakfast the next morning.  We self parked in a garage across the street.  We were only here for one night but I would stay here again without hesitation.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Average Hotel!,"I stayed here for two nights for a conference and it was a good stay. The wifi works very well and if you have a marriott's rewards account you can get free wifi. You can stream movies, no problems. The rooms have great views of the city and there is tons of restaurants nearby. Make sure to check out 36th Street Mall. It is an outdoor mall with tons of shops and places to eat. The hide away beds are not comfortable but the other beds are.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Average hotel, Staff made all the difference","I travel on business to a lot of hotels.  I found the Denver Marriott City Center to be an average hotel.  However, the staff made it great for me.  Taylor - who works the valet and bell desk - was very helpful and friendly.  When I was looking for a place for dinner, Taylor was spot on with a recommendation.  He also told me about the free hotel shuttle that guest can use for a two mile radius.  Danielle, who works the front desk was also very helpful.  The hotel gym is pretty decent.  It was a bit crowded at 6 AM on a Friday, but I was able to get to a treadmill.  The free weights and machines were good and provided lots of options.  The yoga mats were a bit dirty, but I felt OK after putting a towel down.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great business stay,"Stayed here while traveling on business. Clean, quiet, comfortable rooms.  Within walking distance of most downtown areas, including 16th St Mall, Coors Field, and Union Station.  A little bit of a drive from the airport, but shuttles and taxis readily available. Would definitely stay here again if in town.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Location,"Great location.  Close walking distance to many restaurants, bars, shops, etc.  Starbucks in the hotel lobby. We also happened to be there during the Annual Snow Show and walked down to the convention center to check out some vendors and music. 16th Street Mall was only a couple of blocks away.  We had a rental car so had to pay to park.  Not bad...about $15 per day. Hotel itself had a friendly concierge and front desk clerk.  Nice lobby area and bar downstairs.  Room itself was a bit dated.  Not as clean as I would have thought.  A bit musty.  Had to remind staff (every morning) that we were supposed to have free Wi-Fi.  All in all, I would stay there again just for the location.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Another great find,"Just finished a two night stay at this property.  Like many of my selections, this one was again a great Priceline NYOA (3 1/2 star at $78/night).  The hotel is a business class hotel that is central to all the downtown area attractions, literally one walking block from the 16th street mall area.  The main areas of the hotel are modern and contemporary; and I would suggest a night of drinks downstairs in front of the libel fireplace.  I will say the main area renovations do not match the room area interiors, but that is not of great concern to me.  Thankfully, I was provided a large corner room and as always, the bed was fabulous.  The negatives:  bathroom was dated, outside street noise was apparent even on the 6th floor and the on-site parking was extremely costly, so I opted for the gar garage (1 block away) for $16 overnight.  If you book direct or go w Priceline, I'm confident you will enjoy your stay at this location!!!!",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Excellent experience, very good location","I really felt Marriot elite :) staff even remembered my name. Comfortable rooms, useful location, couple blocks from pedestrian street in downtown denver. Not expensive. Bigger fitness center than expected.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Fantastic Experience,"I stay at Marriotts frequently, and this location did not disappoint. The staff was incredibly accommodating and everyone from the valet guys to the front desk made me feel comfortable. The room was impeccable in terms of cleanliness and very quiet as well. The decor and finishes in the hotel are nice. There is a restaurant downstairs with a strange setup, but the food was decent and service was great there also.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Awesome staff!  Always great experience,"My family and I have been staying at City Center for over 20 years for both business & family trips and have always had great service.  We call it home when we visit Denver.  The staff is awesome.  Especially Essence, she was friendly and helped us with getting settled in our rooms.  The renovations to the property updated the look.  The concierge services were excellent. Location is close to 16 Street.  Great experience always!!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Couldnt ask for more,"I was only staying one night, my room was ready when i checked in which was fast and painless. Very pleasant people at the desk. Very comfortable room, nice bed, easy to control temperature of room. Checking out the next day was able to leave my bags with the bellstand while i went to the ball game. Came back and had no problem getting them to catch my shuttle in a timely fashion. Have nothing but great things to say. Will be back next time my travels take me to Denver!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,$239/night???? For what?,"Ok, I understand that I may have to pay a premium to stay At a hotel in the center of a major metropolitan area, but for $239/night, I would expect to have full 24 hour access to a gift shop or convenience center or at the least vending machines available on every floor for a quick snack or to fill a need for a forgotten toiletry. Seriously, there is a charge to valet park your car, because according to the doorman, there is no self park, then one has the lucky ability to pay more than 2 Benjamin's for a room that has no more personality than that of a motel. I thought the economy is still struggling-though guess not for the Marriott brand. Nowhere near worth the price.",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient,"I stayed at this hotel just for one night. The location is in the center of the city and it was convenient for the business.The receptionist was friendly and the lobby was comfortable.The room looked a bit old, but it was clean. The king size bed was very large and soft. There were four pillows in the bed, and I could put some of them between my legs and the bed, which is my favorite when sleeping.Personally, it would be better if the coffee and coffee maker were provided in the room.Overall, the hotel was comfortable.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Thanks to the front desk and all the staff at the hotel.  Special thanks to Mikhaila,Mikhaila was very attentive to all our needs.  Very patient with us.. she ensured that we had a very comfortable stay.  She is all about customer service.  She is definitely an asset to the hotel.  Her colleagues Nathan and Jamie were also very helpful.  It is employees like her that make us loyal customers of Marriott.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Tradition mixed with a welcome modern splash!,"I stayed here for one night and entered the hotel with the preconceived idea that it would be 'just another Marriott'. It was, and this is the reason it was so great! This hotel has undergone a renovation and the lobby area looks fantastic. Huge roaring fires and plush sofa seating mixed with contemporary wall decor and an amazing front desk area. In the room, the Marriott traditions pop up all over the place. The comfortable bed and pillows, air conditioning that actually works at the touch of a button, and a media connection hub along the back of the desk. What really sets this and many other Marriott hotels apart from their competitors, is that it hasn't replaced it's shower heads for energy saving dribbling 'rain water' mixed with air. The shower pressure is ample and you actually leave the shower feeling as though you've had one. The room's are all energy saving bulbs, but they are warm tones and not the stark white ones used in other hotel chains making you look like you've just come back from the dead when you look in a mirror.  You might need to sit down for this one...the room had a window which actually opened. Yes, opened! It was great to breathe in clean, fresh outside air whilst admiring the view of the Colorado mountains in the distance. The housekeeping staff at this hotel were friendly and chatty, and the lifts were prompt and efficient. You need your room key to access all guest room floors for added security. I was told the breakfast buffet finished at 11am on weekdays but at 10:20am arrived to find it had closed which was disappointing but the Starbucks in the lobby took care of that. The TV is big and has all of the usual HD channels, but it's worth noting there wasn't a fridge in my room but I did have a coffee maker.  The wifi is free in the lobby area and I did use it to make internet calls which is a good test for the strength of connection. I managed to hold a conversation for around twenty minutes with minimal connection dropping, but in room wifi which is chargeable was very clear and strong and most certainly better than most hotel wifi packages out there. There is a basic and a high speed package and although I am one of the many people who feel internet access should not be chargeable in hotels, it was great value for money in terms of the connection strength. The bathroom toiletries were good quality and the iron was clean and did not dirty my clothes when using the steam function. This might seem irrelevant for some, but as someone who travels a lot there is nothing worse than an old, dirty iron ruining your white shirt. The ironing board was very thin and it could have been padded better but that's just personal preference.  In summary, this hotel has rolled with the times but retained it's traditional feel which in my view makes it a real winner in 2015.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Valet Service at Hotel,"My stay was exceptional, mainly due to Taylor the valet.  He was attentive, thoughtful, helpful! My trip was duo purpose, attending meetings and needing to pack up an office move over a three day period.  Taylor went the extra mile and took great care!  I really appreciated his assistance and genuine concern.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Okay, but fyi there is no business center here until May 2015","Good, standard Marriott property with outstanding personnel (front desk, bell staff, valet, concierge, meeting and event staff- everyone we encountered was accommodating and happy to help), but to be honest, it was hard to do the 2 basic things I had come to Denver to do- work and sleep. (Well, I hadn't specifically come to Denver to sleep, but that's the number one thing I think a hotel should do well- provide a comfortable place of rest.)Definitely read the room recommendations on this site. Note that the SIDE of the building you are on is actually more important than how high up you are (although that matters too). Request to be on the opposite side from the firehouse or you will hear every emergency vehicle siren- day and night!The lack of a dedicated business center was a real downside for me since I had a lot of work I needed to do on this trip. This can't be helped as I understand that a new one is in the works. Hotel staff were as helpful as they could be, but it's still frustrating.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Weekend Stay,"We stayed on the weekend; missed the bustle of business travelers for a quiet stay.   Our room rate was significantly less than the nearby Marriott Courtyard.  Overnight parking is pricey ($37/day) but comparable with nearby hotels.  Every hotel employee we interacted with was friendly, helpful, and well trained.  Each time we left the hotel, we were asked if we needed directions.   Most of the local attractions (Larimer Square, 16th Street Mall, great restaurants!) were within easy walking distance, and the light rail stops nearby across the street.  There is also a hop on/off bike rental kiosk directly outside the hotel ($9 daily membership fee; no charge for 0-30 minutes, and reasonable rates over 30 minutes, with many drop off/pick up locations throughout the city).  Had we had more time, this would have been a fun way to expand exploring the city. We were fortunate to have Concierge Lounge access, which was staffed during our stay by Matthew, who provided everyone who walked in the door with exceptional service.  Our room was clean and comfortable; double paned windows provide quiet.  I'm picky, but have no negative comments about this property--everything, and everyone, met, or exceeded my expectations.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Solid and reliable,"These are the two adjective I would use to describe my two-day stay at the Denver Mariott City Center. Located right in the middle of downtown Denver and the 16th street, the overall experience made me feel like the hotel certainly lives up to its brand name, despite some letdowns. Here's my lowdown of the good and the bad:The good:a) Ambience (very contemporary and sleek lobby with six elevators that will swiftly take you to your room; the room itself is spacious enough to make your feel welcome)b) Almost perfect walkability (Free Shuttle service from the Capitol to Union Station, and vice versa, on the 16th street basically got you covered in downtown area; you can even opt for walking if that's to your preference; Light Rail station is nearby, and could serve as an option to travel outside of downtown Denver)c) Dining and shopping options (multiple dining options that cater to most cuisines of your choice, from light snacks to fancy upscale dining experience; the whole 16th street serve as a big shopping complex, so feel free to explore and even get yourself some nice souvenirs to remember Denver by!)d) Airport transport (The Greyhound bus station 5 blocks from the hotel also serve as an airport shuttle stop courtesy of the public transit service RTD. It runs hourly, is very timely, and only going to cost you $11, which is affordable considering the price of other options)e) Certain in-room tech features (Provided you got your cables/ports to connect your tablet or laptop to the big television screen, you can fully and easily take advantage of that)The not-so-good:a) the room did not have a safe nor a mini-fridge; both of which would have elevated my stay even moreb) in-room amenities (inc. shower amenities, coffee maker, bathroom, towels, bed..) are so-so, and they are certainly nothing to write home about. The room provides just about what you would expect from a four-star hotel.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,good location,"Had some business in town and ended up at this property.   i generally stay at marriott or hilton properties and have status with both.   in this case, there was a convention in town that was taking up most of the rooms in the city and i was lucky to get a room here.   because of high occupancy rates across the city - room rate was quite high.   however, was comparable to any other rooms i could find at that time.   this is a very nice property.   front desk staff is really friendly and helpful.   i arrived a bit early and my room was not ready.  they were very gracious about it and said they would call as soon as room came available.   went downstairs to their bar/restaurant.  also - very nice.   ultimately got checked in.   is your basic marriott - clean, comfortable, quiet.    are in the heart of downtown denver with easy access to most anything downtown.    staff was outstanding - would gladly stay here again",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient for business,"Visit recent, and had a great experience with staff. I ordered room service twice, both times good and fast. Room was nice and typical of a full service Marriott. The best were the valet team. I had a challenge with my phone directions and they were just so helpful and friendly. The night I arrived they were also just super- I was tired and they could not have been better.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good rooms and easy conference location,"This Marriott property has a very nice lobby with a contemporary feel and is conveniently located about 3 blocks (less than 10 mins) to the Convention Center. I was here for 7 nights. The rooms are good, but certainly not in the top 25% of Marriotts that I have used over the last 7 years. The bed was comfortable but my desk chair was in bad shape (rocky and stained). The bathroom had the usual tub with curved shower rail but no updated shower only stall that might be expected. My tv was suitably sized but definitely had less than half the channels in HD. What is good value is the Happy Hour (snacks and drinks) and it has a great seating location in the lower level. I would probably stay again but might be tempted to check other Marriott properties first.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A too pricy hotel which gets an average rating thanks to the outstanding restaurant,"The hotel is situated in the city centre, close to the colorado convention center. The price that I had to pay for a single room (king-size bed) was over 200 $/night. The room is clean, but the bathroom is too small. The room is too nosiy; one can hear the neighbours through the ventilation. There is no fridge/minibar in the room. Despite the high price, the wifi (10$/night) and breakfast (20 $/person) are not included in the price for the room.The only thing that makes me to give an ok rating to the restaurant is the outstanding restaurant of the hotel. The sitting is in a cosy environment, the service is warm and friendly and the music selection played in the resutrant is very good and not loud which enables a relaxing conversation. I recommend the gost cheese salad, the strip and the chicken breast in the menue for those who want to visit the restaurant.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Gorgeous hotel, perfect location","Recently came to Denver on business, and stayed here for a 5-day meeting at the convention center. This hotel is perfectly located. Everything you could possibly want is within a mile walk in some direction - it truly is in the center of the city. Check-in was super smooth, and I was quickly in my room, which despite one of the reviews I read, was certainly not small. Clean, nice amenities, and free wifi in the rooms when members book through the website. Nice perk for not always using Priceline or Expedia. A really important one for me is having an in-room fan that makes a decent amount of noise and won't turn on/off throughout the night. The apps just don't work as well, but sleep quality at this place was perfect. For the coffee lovers out there, a Starbuck's actually in the base of the hotel, in addition to the restaurant/bar. Marriott quality for sure, all around. Would stay here again in a heart beat.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convention Time!,"Full disclosure:  I am a Marriott Premium Member. This is the second time that I've stayed in the Denver Marriott City Center for this Convention.  The first time was in 2011.  It is conveniently located ""near"" the convention center (About a 7 minute walk if you catch the lights right) and located very near the 16th street mall shuttle where you can find all kinds of food and local shops.  Everything about the stay was absolutely perfect.  The convention negotiated a decent price, making it an excellent value. The hotel was clean and the beds were very comfortable - exactly what i expect when I come to a Marriott.Service was very good - even through the busy times.  We had a minor issue with the check in process as I used the Marriott App and there were some initial problems charging a drink tab to my room, but that was cleared up, without hesitation or headache by the restaurant staff.  I was especially impressed that when they came to me they stated what the problem was AND that it had already been solved.  I commend their staff on initiative in taking care of the issue.The WIFI was great and I never lost connection throughout the stay. I chose the ""fast option"" and it was fast enough for streaming video and conducting Skype video communications.I especially want to mention Isabelle, my housekeeper.  She did a wonderful job in keeping my room in perfect condition throughout my stay.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Well suited to the business traveler,"This is a very clean, modern urban hotel. The restaurants and bars are very good, and not that expensive. If you're on the concierge level, an excellent free breakfast is provided, and the lounge is comfortable. An array of snacks are provided throughout the day as well. For room service, try the Denver omelet. Watch out for the parking: it is $37 a night.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Conference Experience,I stayed at the Denver Marriott City Center for a work conference and I thought it was great.  All the staff was helpful and the accommodations were perfect.  The meeting rooms were spacious and designed to handle a crowd of our size.  Food service for the lunch and the dinner moved quickly and the food was great.  Definitely would recommend.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Marriott  - the best for business - Part2,"Hello again friends--Took a recent quick business trip from my home base (Miami/South Beach) to Denver Colorado...As usual, Marriott doesn't disappoint..solid service, spacious room, even a great recommendation for best breakfast in town (Syrup mmmmm)!Decor was pretty cool with fireplaces everywhere...nice warm touch!Have to head back to Denver next month and will probably stay there again!Enjoy safe travels as always...",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A convenient location and great staff,Stayed here for a meeting held at the Convention Center.  Easy walk to just about everything downtown.  Staff is very attentative.  The rooms are clean and well outfitted but a bit on the small size.  Overall a good value.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great experience,"After a 7 hour drive, I was exhausted as I checked in. At the counter, I was greeted by a very friendly young man, with a huge smile, who got me checked in extremely quickly. My room was lovely, very clean, with a mountain view, as requested. When I went downstairs to go out for the evening, I stopped at the concierge desk for information. He was with another guest, but the gentleman who had checked me in addressed me, by name, and asked if I was satisfied with my room. I was a little startled and thought I must have mistaken him calling me by name, but after questioning him, I found out that indeed he had. His name is Nathan, and he is a tremendous asset to this hotel, as were all the staff who answered all questions, directed me to the ice machine, and provided a wonderful downtown experience. This hotel is withing walking distance to everything I wanted to do in Denver. The fireplace in the lobby is a relaxing place to use the free wifi (additional charge in the room). And, vital as a solo female traveler, I felt safe and was very comfortable parking my own car in the garage across the street, as recommended by another traveler. Nathan, if you are reading, here is my Tripadvisor review as promised. Thank you for an exceptional stay!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,My convention was hosted here - very nice,"I was in town for a national convention.  While the rooms were fairly ""standard fare"" fr a larger chain hotel, the service was great.  The overall hotel was very clean and the meeting facilities were very nice.  The staff was helpful and seemed to go out of their way to accommodate their guests.  I would stay here again.  However, do not expect views of the mountains as there are still numerous taller buildings between the mountains and the views.  Centrally located two blocks from 16th Street in a safe part of town.  Approximately a one mile walk to the Pepsi Center and much closer to Rockies' Stadium.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Perfect choice for this Texas girl,"Quiet & convenient hotel located in downtown Denver.  Walking distance to any bar / restaurant you need downtown.  Walking distance to 16th street mall.   Very comfortable beds and clean room.  $55 flat rate cab fee from airport to this hotel...although the cab driver tried to charge me more on my trip back to airport--beware. Also walking distance to Enterprise rental cars-- since I rented car to drive to Breckenridge for a day.  I would stay here again. Downtown Denver seemed clean & safe overall. I recommend walking to ""Syrup"" restaurant for breakfast..about 2 blocks away.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Exceedes HIGH Marriott Expectations!,"This hotel is in the center of everything, 1 block from the 16th street mall and in a great (safe) part of town, however it is the Service sets them apart!  I have said in other post that Marriott hotels nationwide have (in my experience) been consistently above par for a full service chains and it honestly takes a property going way over the top for me to write a review.  The Denver Marriott City Center is it!  This hotel takes customer service to the next level.  From the time that I checked in, the staff at this hotel has been awesome.  Management is visible and completely engaged and that engagement is noticed when you walk through the lobby.  Employees speak top you and genuinely seem to care about how your Marriott experience is going and tries to make sure that everything, not just meets my expectations, but exceeds them!  So to them I would have one word… BRAVO!Oh and do not forget to stop by the Concierge desk and ask Rich for his recommendation on what to do, where to eat and where to go.  This guy is AWESOME…  He is personable, likeable and you can tell he TOTALLY loves what he does.  Picks up the phone, calls the reservation for you while you are standing there and the 4 recommendations that he gave us all were spot on… It’s nice walking into a restaurant and the management greets you and ask that you please make sure to give Rich our feedback on the experience.  You can tell from the way he acts, he truly loves his job!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Worked perfectly for us,"I have no complaints about this hotel. Beautiful lobby. Standard looking rooms. Great staff. Beware of the parking charges. Valet parking is $37 per night. You can find $14 all day parking at the garage across the street. Overall, great hotel, great value. Love it. Would stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great location,"Situated only a few blocks from the main 16th Street Mall area, this hotel is in a great location. The lobby is large and the front desk staff are courteous. My room was on the 8th floor and free of traffic noise, except of course if you prefer fresh air and opened the window, this is at least a nice thing to be able to do. The room was well equipped with a large tv and two queen size beds. The bathroom clean with lovely quality toiletries and soft towels.  The beds although comfortable, had sadly for me unsupportive pillows, but overall the room was good. My biggest gripe is the noise the doors make when they are shut, you can hear everyone around you entering and exiting their rooms. There is on the second floor a good pool and fitness centre, with all the equipment you need for that important workout. Very little to fault during my stay, but sadly no outstanding customer service to comment on.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Setvice,"This Marriott is conveniently located nearby the convention center and walking distance to a number of excellent restaurants.  The hotel is clean and the staff is top notch.   A visit to the concierge lounge is a must, where you will be served by one of Marriott's premier concierge lounge representative, Matt S.  Matt is so excellent that he should be a teacher of customer service.  While taxis are plentiful, recommend taking a bicycle taxi to most destinations.",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Meh...so so for a city hotel, but we had good service.","We use this hotel all the time for our clients.  It has undergone a great lobby renovation and is in a perfect location for downtown events, including the convention center.  We were there Valentine's Day night.  I sincerely think the hotel was participating in some type of ""If you are in a gang or just a thug, we want you to stay at our hotel tonight.""  The crowd was really random and sketchy.  Not sure why.  The front desk clerk could not have been more friendly and upgraded us to a mountain view.  We had a few other couples with us.  Ours was a great room--others were pretty tired.  Throughout the year, the rates are all over the place for the same room.  The definitely follow the supply / demand of the city.  I'd check around for others if the price seems high.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,excellent customer service,"I want to say thank you to Trenna in Reservations, who was wonderfully accomodating, when I needed to change my departure date, and the hotel was fully booked.  I certainly should have called sooner, my error!    as soon as there was a cancellation, Trenna let me know that my stay could be extended.    I appreciate the high end service !",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great Location!,"This is a really nice hotel in a really fun downtown area. The staff was very professional & accommodating. The rooms were standard. You can request a small fridge ahead of time. Certain amenities are quite expensive...Valet Parking is $37 (this the only hotel option-unless you park in a parking lot around the corner), interent $10 & breakfast buffet is $17.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Not worth the high price!!!!,"This hotel was very disappointing to us. The rate for the room was high. We thought well atleast it will be a nice hotel with clean rooms for the price. We were wrong!! There were black shoes prints on the comforter and I found several hairs in the bedding and on the pillows!! We informed them about it and they did not offer a thing. Not even clean bedding!! It says on here you get free wifi. Wrong!! You get free wifi if you are in the lobby but not if you are in your room. You half to pay extra for that!! They also charge you to use one of the computers that are in several locations in the hotel. Then my husband had to have a fax sent to the hotel for a job fair that was going on at the hotel which was why we stayed there to begin with. We went to the desk to pick it up and they told us ""sorry our fax machine is not working."" Needless to say disappointment after disappointment!! Would not stay again. Waste of lots of money!!",1
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Excellent Stay at Marriott City Center,"Me and my two friends stayed in the Marriott City Center a few weekends ago. We had an excellent experience. From check in to check out, we were cared for by all the employees. What we enjoyed most was the customer service that they provided for us. We went to Maggionos for dinner, and as we all know you come home with a lot of leftovers. Because our room did not have a refrigerator, they offered to bring one for us. Which they did, they brought up a well sized fridge so we could keep our leftovers from spoiling. The location of this property is perfect for a night in Downtown Denver. You are in walking distance from the 16th street mall where you can shop, see a movie, or dine out. Overall, we were all very impressed by their willingness to split the bill, bring us extra amenities, and offer dinner suggestions in the area. We will stay again, soon!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Convenient Location,Good:Location. Easy walking to Bus. District. A lot nice restaurants and barsGuest Laundry is free and detergent is provided for free as well.Bad:Bldg is old. Room is clean but old as well.No refr in the roomOnly one washer and dreyer,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Terrible front desk service,"They lost our reservation, failed to accommodate the error, we got a room without the view I expected.  One phone in the room didn't work, we waited a mn hour for our car to be brought from valet.When we dropped off our car for valet service when we got there, an hour later it was still in the front lot, unlocked.  Very disappointed and won't stay here again",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Amazing service and beautiful hotel,"Cashed in reward points for a Valentine's staycation. The reception manager, Matt, took complete care of us, helping to get points from the previous week's stay at another Marriott property released for this weekend's use. We stayed in a Jr. Suite, which was super cozy and private. We had a fabulous time in Denver!!",5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,denver overnight,"We stayed here after a long flight to Denver airport and this hotel is in a good location to downtown.The rooms are nice and comfortable, however a bit small with a cramped bathroom. We chose the concierge level and it was a nice upgrade but the lounge doesn't open until 5 pm. Wished it was open earlier. The lounge offered a nice limited view of the front range and we enjoyed the good food. The lobby was nice and modern and the front staff was courteous and helpful.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Great place in the heart of downtown.,"Great place In the heart of Downtown Denver  !! Great for a staycation !! Hit fogo de chao and Comedy works and had a great evening. Lots of fire trucks at all hours of the night, However it is downtown.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Optimum Location,The Marriott City Center is a must for people who want a close location to downtown. Very close and within minutes of the main drag. The hotel is very nice and has many amenities. Restaurant and small store on site. Rooms are very well maintained and spotless. Bellmen are very helpful and will be sure you are well taken care of. Front desk personnel are all very responsive to any requests you may have.,5
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,A Bit Tired,"The updated lobby is nice but it hides some very outdated rooms and halls. Further, the phone system was not working real well. The staff was quite helpful, especially room service, the bell staff and the front desk staff, which partially offsets the negatives. That said, the guest rooms need some updating and soon.",3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice business hotel downtown Denver,Spent a couple of nights at the Marriott City Center while attending a business meeting.  Nice hotel.  Excellent staff. Very friendly and accommodating.   Convenient downtown location. Planning to return in September for a conference.,4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Nice and convenient but need better soundproofing,Stayed four nights on business.  Well-appointed and in a central location close to everything.  But one complaint was that the walls were so thin that I could hear every conversation from the adjoining room so that I kept the TV on most of the time to drown out the noise.  I have stayed in many Marriotts but have never encountered this before.,3
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,Good location and good service ,"Was here for a business meeting. As with most Marriotts , the service was consistent and good.  The hotel itself is modern with lots of areas to lounge and meet.  Location is near the main restaurant and bar area so a fantastic place to stay for the Denver nightlife.  The one complaint I have is something that I've noticed in most Marriotts these days and that is the ambient scent they are pulsing through allThe vents.  I think they mean it to be spa like, but it smells awful.  Hope they move on soon because I may need to switch to the Hilton.",4
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,overrated.,"Rooms were very small and bathrooms were dated. Rusty door hinges paint peeling off the doors. Platinum elite member requested a few items and none of them were done. used points for cook to order breakfast, did not receive vouchers and we were told to eat breakfast at the concierge level. Will not stay here again. worst Marriott I have ever stayed in",2
"Denver, CO ",Hilton Denver City Center,"Convenient, Clean, Friendly Staff","My husband, daughter, and I stayed at the Denver Marriott City Center last week and had a wonderful experience. When we first checked in, the valet, bellman, and front desk worker were extremely helpful and friendly. We stayed on the concierge level, which I really enjoyed - the concierge lounge was a great environment with nice views to enjoy while having breakfast or popping in to grab a drink. Reviews below complain about small rooms, but that's standard for a hotel in a big city...as long as we have beds and a bathroom, we're fine. I really want to brag on the concierge too - we were travelling with my two year old and he would make it a point to stop and talk and play with her, he really made us feel welcome at the hotel. Overall, we had a great stay, and I don't understand the negative reviews at all...well, maybe free wifi would be nice, but that's it!",5
