"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Horrible Service, No Breakfast","The hotel was very nice and the room was clean, but the staff were horrible. They served little boxes of cereal for breakfast but didn't say that on the website or when I checked in and asked what time breakfast started. Close to the airport but would not recommend until they got new staff.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Average moderately priced hotel.,"Probably slightly below the quality you expect from your average LaQuinta.  The hotel is showing it's age a little.  They contract with a shuttle service that services @ 6-8 hotels and you should know that they do not start until 5 a.m., which means you're on your own for 6-7:30 flights.  The hotel staff did give us the number of a limo service that was very reasonable (only $27) and he was right on time at 4:15",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,terrible,"hotel smelt absolutely terrible, made me want to vomit. front desk messed up our checkout and made it difficult to continue with them. whoever was working the front desk was also rude when we brought up our issues with them, and barely helpful at resolving them.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Definitely a low end hotel,"Got to Denver Airport. Called hotel. Phone rang 25 times with no answer. Called again pushed a different button and got someone. Got packed into a Westin van with a dozen other people going to 4 hotels. Got to this hotel and the clerk refused to use the credit card that the reservation was made with because he didn't have it in person. I had to pay with my credit card. No breakfast due to COVID, except little cereal boxes. Hardly any snacks available in pantry. Called front desk from my room. Phone rang a dozen times with no answer. Room had weird angled walls. Bathroom didn't have a door that closed and locked. It was more of a closet door. No rails for holding onto for shower and tub.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good choice near the airport,"We stayed here for one night after we landed in Colorado before continuing to RMNP. The hotel is renovated and looks very clean and modern, we loved the rooms. The clerk at the reception was not very enthusiastic, but overall it's a decent place if you need a place to stay near the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Meh,"Our recent stay was fine. Not good, not bad. First off be prepared to wait a long time for the shuttle to pick you up from the airport. The shuttle they use is used by multiple hotels along tower road. We waited approximately 45 minutes for the shuttle to arrive. Be prepared for there to be no social distancing on the shuttle. The hotel itself appears well kept, check in was quick as we were the only ones checking in at the time. Once we got to the room I immediately smelled a foul odor like sulphur in the hallway however the room itself smelled fine. Be prepared for a minimal at best breakfast. Cold cereal, milk, OJ and coffee were the options. If you can’t eat dairy you’re SOL.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointing,Clean facility but very disappointed with service level.  Booked 2 rooms and couldn't get a shuttle for all 4 of us unless we left an hour earlier or later than needed.  Shuttle in was jam packed and went to multiple hotels.  Asked if others wanted to go at the same time would they have another shuttle.  They said NO.  They gave us a number for a local person who charged us $40 when hotel quoted $15.Worst part -- they didn't seem to care.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,XL Dog Traveler,"It can be very hard to find lodging when traveling with a large dog! This hotel is clean, comfortable, & the property is walkable & near restaurants & other services we use. We stayed here last year, and are staying on our way to & from vacation this year.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Labor Day Weekend,"Much better than expected based on how bad the reviews were, but I got a great rate and gave them a chance.  I was pleasantly surprised in all areas except one and Ill get to that in a moment.  Front staff, cleaning staff, everyone was super friendly and helpful.  Room was very nice and everything looked very clean.  Excellent in all areas except...Breakfast???  Really?  Breakfast was a brown bag with miniature size apple juice, craisins, and a little chewy bar!?!  That really was the most poor choice of items to put in a brown sack for ""BREAKFAST.""",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,unpleasant,very rude individual at front desk.. no pool. No breakfast.. website says nothing about pool being closed I r about no breakfast being offered. Other staff was friendly.. views are spectacular towards mountains,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,don't go here,worst place i  ever stayed 1st show was slow to drain was standing in water above my feet had to turn shower off and wait for it to drain then turn it back on so i could rinse of dirty water on my feet 2nd tv went out had to get them to come fix it 3rd power went out plus it was loud you could hear them flush toilets from next room and breakfast was a bag with apple juice granola bars and cranberry who the heck eats that,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disrespectful and very unprofessional services.,I would like to upload the video I have of the front desk employee flipping me off! This was the worst service I have ever received at a hotel! I would like to be refunded and I didnt even receive my Wyndham rewards!,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice stay,Check-in took a while as it appears everyone appeared at one time.  No issue checking in.  The hotel site didn't mention a shuttle to the airport but pleasantly surprised that they did have one thus saving us from having to get up as early to turn in the car rental as I just returned it that evening.  The room was comfortable and clean.  Very quiet for us.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Breakfast,What time is breakfast served till? What kind of breakfast? Really enjoyed the stay room was very clean. It was very easy to book online and walk to the lobby and get my room right away! Is the fitness center open?,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Terrible experience,There was no housekeeping available. We were there 5 days. Wet towels piled up in our room. Trash over flowing. Floor dirty.  No one informed us this was going to happen. I understand the covid issue but to not tell you what to expect is wrong. We had to beg for new clean towels. For a bigger trash bag for our trash. My husband asked them for fresh bedding and changed our beds. All we got is Sorry. Even corporate said some of their hotels have no housekeeping they are sorry.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Horrible,"If I could give zero stars I would. Not because the place or rooms weren't nice. They were and most of the people that provide customer service were very nice to us and made us want to keep coming back. Except for one person which made the entire experience horrible. May, one of the front desk personnel, let someone into our room just based on them knowing our first and last name. That isn't right and is violating our privacy and compromising our safety. She then proceeds to tell us that it is their policy if they know our name they can let them in. We were very loyal customers and the fact that she was so rude to us when we were trying to resolve the situation is in fact why we will never come back. It's very unprofessional and she refused to take responsibility for her bad decision making. When we asked to speak to a manager she refused to give us a name or number to reach one. She told us that she had already spoke to a manager and they told her that she did everything right. She proceeded to cut me off when I was trying to express my concerns and told me that I can just leave if I want to. This experience alone will make it to where I, a very loyal customer, will never return.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Terrible service,"They checked me into an occupied room. Then when checking me into a new room have me a non-working key.  Nothing but ""I'm sorry"" to explain the fact that I walked in on a family in their room and took 6 trips up and down the elevator just to get into a hotel room that wasn't already full.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,First time stay,"Stayed 3 nts. recently, Arrived around  11 a.m. got checked in no problem  :o) Quickly I might add... Super clean room, very nice grounds and very nice hotel all around. No complaints at all :o)  Its a pet friendly hotel which I have no problem with,  the rates were very reasonable and I see myself staying there again...",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not good,"When we walked in our room the floor was dirty, crumbs, paper, even a piece of gum. Gross. I called the front desk. His first comment to me when I told him about the floor : “Is it just white spots on the floor?” No apology, no comment about what I had just told him, all he said was: you want another room? The next room, we walk in and immediately smell something like pet urine. I think, is this a pet friendly room or something? I call the desk again and he says it is. He never told us this when he moved us to the other room. And I have allergies. Again, never apologized, did not say one word about our inconvenience.So after dirty and smelly rooms, we left. A very Unhelpful, disinterested front desk guy. We then went to the Hyatt Place and the rooms were spotless, front desk super nice and very professional.  100% difference.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Meh,"Thermostats don't work, and window only opened 2"" so we sweat through the night. TV had to be reset 3 times over the course of a 1 night stay just to see the video. Shower has hot and cold water mixed up. Place has a funky smell in the lobby and hall ways. Good location and price though.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Would not issue refund during Global Pandemic,"Despite the fact that there is a Global Pandemic, a Do Not Travel and Stay At Home order, and a national state of emergency, this hotel REFUSED to refund our stay, even though the request was made more than one month prior to the reservation. DO NOT EVER BOOK A STAY AT THIS UNCOOPERATIVE HOTEL.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Short stay made a great impression,My family needed a last minute hotel. We stayed at La Quinta Denver Airport. Our stay was excellent! The room and breakfast were great. Our favorite part was the indoor pool and hot tub. We'll definitely stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Simply Wonderful,"I was very happy with my selection of the La Quinta Inn & Suites near the Denver Airport. The shuttle to and from the airport, the service, the location and the awesomeness of the hotel were A #1. The room was super clean, convenient and comfortable. I will definitely stay there again when I go back.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Sewer Smell,"Booked ahead of time based on the reviews here and other places. The entire hotel smells like sewage, including the room we stayed in. All the hotels around were booked and we arrived late at night. Otherwise, I would have never stayed here. Until the sewer smell is gone please don’t stay here!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A stay to write home about,"Our experience with this hotel began before our stay did. Because of a confusion with our reservation I called the hotel before we left home. First I was put on hold while I listened to an ad about La Quinta having no tricks to offer. That should've given me pause right there.Once a human answered my call, I began to explain my question, and was interrupted by ringing on the line. A lady's voice thanked me for agreeing to listen to a promotion. What? Well, having some extra time, I listened for a bit before I asked if I was still speaking to someone at the La Quinta in Denver. No, I was talking with a super-friendly lady in Florida who wanted to sell me a great vacation deal. Hmmm.I answered a few questions, quite charmed by the southern-style hospitality, but as her spiel went on and on I saw my time was running out. First I tried politeness, and when that was not effective, I hung up.Still needing my question answered, I redialed the Tower Road La Quinta. I was  again stating my concern when a phone rang on the line, and someone with the same suspiciously gracious southern voice picked up. Incredulous, I redialed the hotel, and told them I was going a little crazy and they were NOT to transfer me to the number in Florida. And guess what, they didn't.So much for ""no tricks"".When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with friendliness and an attractive lobby. Our only initial disappointment was that there was no luggage cart available. Our rooms were on the fourth floor, and we were  with our elderly parents who do not travel light. However, bright spot! the elevator was working, so with two heavily laden people and two trips we got everything to our fourth floor room.Now we encountered our next issue. Our key card wouldn't work. Here we were, half our luggage in our room, half in the hall, and we couldn't get into our room. Back down the four floors to the lobby my husband fetched a new card. That one didn't work either. Another trip down to the lobby, and this time he returned with the man from behind the desk carrying several cards, none of which would open the door.So we were told to return to the lobby and someone would be sent to break the door. Never mind that our laptop and one of our phones as well as other luggage was stashed behind that door. We had to trust it would all be fine. After 15-20 minutes in the lobby we were invited to return to our room with a door that now worked. And our luggage was intact, to our relief.Everything after that was an anti-climax. Lukewarm water from the bathtub faucet? Every light in the room switching on suddenly while we were dozing off? By then nothing surprised us anymore.To be fair, the room was clean and fairly quiet and nicely arranged, all items of importance to us. Nevertheless, we don't see another stay at a La Quinta in our near future...",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great and Quiet,I stayed here for a quick work trip and it was very comfortable and easy to get around from. Beds are amazing and the room sounds were pretty quiet especially for the proximity to the airport. I would stay here again,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Close to the airport without airport prices,"I stayed at the La Quinta Inn Denver airport in advance of my trip out of town. I was worried about the weather and wanted to ensure I'd be able to catch my flight.  I was not only pleased with every aspect of my stay, but I was happy to find that they had a shuttle that could get me to the airport and back to my car when I returned.  And it was less expensive than the airport parking!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Hotel for Dog Lovers,"It was clean, despite the large number of dogs, and the staff was friendly about it. There weren't any extra or hidden charges related to them either. We heard a dog bark here or there, but the rooms are well-built so it was not a noise problem, either.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great airport hotel,"There are many hotels on Tower Rd serving the airport, and over the years I have stayed in many of them. For the most part they are rather blah because travelers use them for a single night. The La Quinta was a delightful surprise. It’s rooms were larger than most and felt like a place one would want to stay more than ine night. Our room was very spacious, clean and quite comfortable. It c  as me equipped with a microwave, coffee maker and fridge. It’s bathroom was a step above most. The staff were friendly and helpful. It’s wifi was easily accessible. We’ll stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,No hot water for you!,"the price was right, but getting into the room the hair in the sink, the transparent toilet paper, the mattress cover that only covered the middle of the bed, most of all the luke warm water pretty much made up for the price.  Dirty, we won't do this again.  Dogs barking was not pleasant either",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Bad plumbing,Usually we love this hotel for early flights out the next morning. This time the lack of response from staff to call us back and let us know they could not fix the shower/tub that would not drain was a disappointment. We were already in bed so did not want to move to another room. We hope this was just a fluck and will still use them or try one of the other Wyndham brands.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Dirty,"Hair on bathroom counter and lots of hair on the floor. There was so much hair that it had formed into clumps that were floating around on the floor. I spilled water and when I wiped it up the cloth came up dark brown. Nice hotel, but very dirty.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Place to Stay! Very clean! ,"This was by far our best stay on our trip. I have two Aussies, and it’s hard to find a good hotel that is excepting. The hotel is very pet friendly. Our room was VERY clean with comfortable beds.  I will be staying here on my future visits. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Overnight stay,"LaQuinta is always a great hotel. Room was extremely clean and comfortable. Nice bed, lighting and bathroom was beautiful and clean. Pool was absolutely amazing and big, Hot-tub was exactly what I needed after a long day of driving.  I will be back. Thanks all staff for such a great stay.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice stay,"We have stayed at laQuintas across the country and this stay ranks high on our rankings. The employees were very accommodating. The check in was very quick and the desk clerk asked what floor we would like, I asked for the ground floor since we have a service dog and the ground fool makes it easy if she needs to go out at night. in a few words, it was a great stay. it is very convenient to the airport and offers shuttle service to the airport and has short term parking for people traveling. to the airport",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Airport stay State,A perfect place to say when you’re flying out of Denver to go anywhere. Especially good bargain bargain if you want to park your car there and leave it while you’re away. Did shuttle service and it was excellent,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,GREAT STAY,We had an amazing stay. The frontdesk staff was nice and very helpful in finding a place that delivered. The room was clean and comfy. The indoor pool was clean and there wasn't an overwhelming smell of chlorine. I will recommend this hotel to family and friends. We will be back. Thank you so much for a great experience.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pet Friendly.,"La Quinta DIA is the place to stay if using DIA. They are the best “pet friendly” hotel chain. No limit on size or number. No deposit or cleaning charge. Walk across street to Ruby Tuesday or next block to Italian restaurant. Clean, quiet and fair price.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good Stay for Great Price,"Beautiful hotel inside and out! Very modern looking. Friendly staff! Check in/out was fast. Beautiful rooms, modern looking. Rooms had alot of space. Great breakfast area, and food. Highly recommend!!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful staff,Excel)want in accommodating handicapped guests very clean. The hotel staff was very helpful to us our home had caught on fire and we stayed at the LaQuinta Inn for about a week is it very stressful week and I was super grateful that we had somewhere to lay our heads that was clean and secure. The hotel is located so that it's easy to jump on a couple of main highways the entrances and exits at the hotel make it easy to access the parking lot,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,LaQuinta limits the size of families,Pretty good. Could use a little more focus on individual guests based off of reservations requirements. When you arrive late at night the last thing you want to do is hunt for and find missing extra sheets for the pull out bed when you have 4 small children.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,hotel,"This hotel has been newly remodeled and they have done a very good job.  The breakfast was excellent with good selections of yogurt, fruit, cereal, eggs.  The rooms were really large.  The front desk on the morning was excellent.She helped give directions.  For the money this was well worth it.  I have not seen such a nice hotel for the price",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good airport layover,"This hotel is conveniently located to DIA.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Hotel everywhere,Definitively I will recommend La Quinta to my friends and family. The rooms are very comfortable and clean all the time. They have friendly staff and their prices are affordable.  Very nice property and good breakfast.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean and convenient to DIA,Rooms are a nice size with appropriate furniture.  Good WIFI and nice breakfast options.  This time of year the problem is their parking lot is not plowed/cleared and parking is at a premium.  Their staff are friendly and helpful...good welcome cookies in the afternoon.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great location near DIA and one of the better values for hotel near the airport,"Nice guestroom, good breakfast, have stayed here a couple of times. Would recommend as a good option to stay for an early flight or when weather is an issue. Has a shuttle to the airport if that is needed, and has a park and stay option.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Very Good Place to stay, especially if you have to take a late night or early morning flight.","Everything was great, shuttle was efficient even though it was 1 am.  Check in was quick so we could get to bed and breakfast was still there at 15 til 9 am even though it was scheduled to end at 9 am.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Smelled like sewer in hallways.,Beds were not comfortable and pillows crinkled like plastic. Breakfast was very busy and ran out of some food after opening only one hour. The staff was very friendly and other than the smell the rooms were clean.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Good place, shaky shuttle service","Returning to the Wyndham from the airport was a near disaster with more people attempting to get any  number of motels than there was room in the shuttle. On cold days, be prepared with warm clothing because it may be long and chilly day as you wait for the shuttle. Run quickly when you see it.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Remodeled rooms,The website says”Remodeled” but when you show up to check-in yes lobby was remodeled and suites were remodeled but staff was not knowledgeable including management knows according to front desk staff.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Terrible Experience,"If you want to step in dog poop on your first night of your honeymoon, then this is the place to go. My brand new white shoes were destroyed for our vacation. The room was clean and the check in process was easy. I would not go here again when there are other hotels that will deal with the situation a little bit Moreno professional.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Can’t be beat, great hotel","From the friendly service, great accommodations, comfortable beds, clean all around, to the breakfast this is a great hotel and very convenient to the airport.  We did not use the fitness center or the pool but they both looked very nice.  Everything at this hotel was efficient and spot on.We just got the basic 2 double bed room and it was a bit bigger than expected, again everything in the room was very nice.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel,"Love a hotel that makes room for my entire family including our dog! Room was very clean, breakfast was great and the service is awesome too! Stayed here overnight before leaving on a trip from the Denver airport.. Very convenient.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Thank you!,Thank you for renting a room to three young men from Michigan yesterday.  My son and two of his hockey team mates were stuck in the Denver airport for longer than they had anticipated.  They were not able to check in due to the length of time they had arrived at the airport before their flight.  They were stuck sitting outside of the TSA check point with equipment bags and their personal bags.  They called the La Quinta and inquired about a room for the day and explained their situation (and their ages....all three boys were 18) and the staff agreed to rent them a room for the day.  They were able to take the shuttle van over and spend the day relaxing (and studying for mid-terms!) at the hotel.  They would have been stuck at the airport from about 9am to 6pm if it hadn't been for you!!  So for this mama from Michigan...I send you my thanks!!!,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,LaQuinta Denver Airport,"Very nice stay.  Helpful and friendly staff, good location to airport, shuttle service - AND special care and attention to the native rabbit population, which was there and established long before man came to Colorado, let alone conceived an airport east of Denver.  Lovely garden area to complement the nice, neat hotel exterior.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Probably won’t stay again,"I had to catch a 5:30 am shuttle to the airport. I only grabbed a bagel from the breakfast offering. I had a question for someone at the desk, but there was no one available. Someone came out of the back room right as the shuttle driver appeared so I had no time to ask my question. I called from the airport to resolve my question.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Mixed bag,"This hotel is attractive, convenient, has a great breakfast, is well priced, and has some wonderful benefits like a lovely enclosed courtyard with a swimming pool, a delicious hot breakfast, and some of the most friendly and helpful employees that I have encountered. However, two things marred an otherwise delightful visit. On check in, the male desk attendant was rude and unhelpful. HIs unsmiling and impatient ""hello""made me want to walk out the door. When asked about the most accessible access from my handicapped husband, he glared, then eventually surlily directed me to a door and elevator that was far away from our room, and required working our way through two sets of doors to even get to the elevator. Boy was I surprised when we finally arrived at our room and found a very convenient back door and elevator just across the hall from our room.The room was clean, comfortable, well appointed, and easily accessible for my husband's scooter. The beds were comfortable and we slept well until 4:30 am when a group of about 4-6 people gathered in the hallway laughing, talking, slamming doors and banging bags around with no regard to others who might still be asleep. Because of my unpleasant encounter with the front desk on check in, I chose not to report the noise disturbance.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice comfy hotel with some room for improvement,"Our experience was a bit mixed ... The hotel is very comfortable with comfy beds, nice rooms and good facilities ... Pool etc. Breakfast was also good, though really didn't like all the disposable items.Our arrival was also a bit inconvenient...the shuttle bus only runs every 20-30 mins with no timetable so we took a taxi for $30 and despite booking a room for 4, the sofa bed was not made and we had to go down to get all the sheets from front desk.  Absent these experiences would have been a 5.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Very nice hotel, great staff","Had a late night arrival so stayed here - left my car a few days before - a 'reverse park & stay'. Very nice, accomodating staff. The property is very nice - comfortable rooms. I absolutely wil stay there again. And can recomend this hotel to anyone traveling through the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Conveniently located.  Very pleasant staff.  Other guests were a pain.,"I have stayed in many LaQuinta hotels.  This was one of the worst stays; however, that had to do with other guests having no respect for anyone and thinking partying in halls (with yappy little dogs in tow) was appropriate.  Other than that it was fine.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport travel convenience,"Always use this hotel while traveling, excellent service in all aspects including airport shuttle service. Accommodations are as good as they get, clean comfortable with an excellent bathroom and shower...thank you!",5

Convenient shuttle service to the airport.  Always stay here,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice property and great for those that travel with pets,"Well appointed, clean and comfortable.  Not too far off IH70 and well worth the drive over near the airport.  Only issue was lack of help in locating cart to unload luggage. I ended up walking entire property (5 floors) to locate both carts parked in the hallway",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Clean,friendly staff",This La Quinta Inn seems brand new as usual the breakfast is very good and the rooms were immaculate. The ride to the airport is literally just a few minutes and the driver was very informative. I would definitely stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport LaQuinta,"This property is a must stay.  I arrived earlier than expected, called the hotel and was able to get into my room earlier than the normal check-in time.  This place was very nicely decorated and extremely clean.  I would definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A great choice,We always stay here when we fly from DIA.  The facility is clean and so comfortable.  The rooms are immaculate and the beds are so comfortable.  They serve a good hot breakfast that is complimentary.  You can walk across the street for other meals. Long-term parking privileges for fliers is the clincher.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great People entire Staff.,Enjoyed the friendliness of the entire staff. Cleaning staff was very friendly and always asked if I needed anything as we met.  Couldn't have asked for anything more.  I will stay at La Quinta where ever we travel.  Thank your staff for me.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"An Outstanding renovation in 2017 moves to lack of service,with the new Wyndham Flag, failure in service","I checked in on Monday 8/26 and was assigned 235 around 5:30.  The air was off so I turned on the unit and went to dinner.  Came back around 6.     The public areas Could of been cooler they were a little stuffy.   Going back to my room it seemed cool and about 8pm the unit without touching the  thermostatic started pumping out very warm area from the heater side.   The temp rose to,almost 80 and nothing I could do would bring the cool air back.   I call the front desk and they sent up a guy to work on it.    Before he arrived the unit started to kick out cool.    He arrived and while he was there it started kicking out heat again so he said they would move me to a new room.I am not giving the rating due to the issue but what happen from a service and the guarantee of a good night,     First none of the six carts could be found.    They assigned me 220 which was a good walk .  I had surgery two weeks ago and am limited on weight for the first 4 weeks of less than 5 lbs.   I went down stairs and explained I needed a cart the guy at the desk said they were all out,  the guy that came up and arranged for the new room had been called back to the next door room 236. Which had a mechanical issue with the door.    I explained to the two desk clerks I had a lot of luggage and bags of books and purchases  and needed a cart due to a weight  restriction.    The tall guy said I would need to look for them.  There. Was. 2. Clerks and he didn’t offer any help in moving,    The lady said she had moved,me to a closer room,  204.     Guess what it was right next to the elevator and all night long there was people coming and going.  They said that was the closest room and they were aware it would be really noisy because there was a gift for me on the night stand.   Ear plugs photo below.When I checked out,they ask and I told the, didn’t get any rest and the desk clerk said she would share the info with management,   It has been over 24,hours no refund of the,points, no call from management to discuss the situation.  This hotel has gone down hill compare to the high rating in 2017 I left.   The breakfast was ok but the purpose of a hotel is a,quiet,night and that was no where close,to,what I had,  the lack of any help by the 6’ strong young desk clerk for,this senior,citizen was no where to be seen by him or the lady that checked me out other than sorry.    Wasted points since they didn’t provide a good quite night,   I will be calling corporation in the morning.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great stay!,"We stayed at La Quinta Denver Airport after looking for a hotel that was close to the airport, and that was dog friendly.We booked directly with La Quinta and I called a few days prior to our stay to request a 10 am early arrival and a suite upgrade for my Wyndham status. The person I spoke with at the front desk put me on hold while they checked into the request and confirmed the suite upgrade and said they would allow the early check in if available at arrival.We got to the airport and went to the shuttle pick up spot and waited about 10 minutes for the shuttle and were whisked away by ourselves to the hotel. When we got to the hotel, we received a warm welcome to the hotel by the front desk agent and were allowed an early check in to our suite.The suite was located on the 2nd floor and was spotless and was very spacious. For dinner, we walked to the Ruby Tuesday next door (about 40-50 feet away). Breakfast is served daily in the lobby from 5-9 AM and features many hot options (eggs, biscuits/gravy, sausage) and a make your own waffle station, along with cereal and pastries and fruit. They also have coffee and tea out and throughout the day. If you’re looking for a hotel near the airport, I would come back here again!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent La Quinta,"Best La Quinta we have ever stayed at, hands down.

The rooms were very nice!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good for layovers,"We had a two day layover before returning home. I’m glad we stayed here. The pools open 24/7, the breakfast is good, staff are friendly, the rooms are clean. The only problem we had was with one of our shuttle bus drivers being rude. ",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver International Airport Stay,We decided to go up to Denver the night before our flight to avoid having to get up early and deal with traffic.   This La Quinta was relatively new and the staff was very pleasant and professional.   We were happy we stayed.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Customer service,"First time in Denver! It was a quick trip. Great stay. Clean rooms and comfortable bed. A little noisy in the hallway. I wanted to give a 5 star rating because of the two people that worked the front desk. Essence was very pleasant and helpful. I was waiting for her to finish helping the guy  in front of me and I smiled the whole time because she was doing a an excellent job. The gentleman had lots of questions. Jordon, who worked the night shift was pleasant and very helpful as well. When you walk into an establishment and you have an individual that’s rude, and poor customer service skills it sets a bad tone. Zoe is the reason I gave 3 stars. She has a bad attitude and horrible customer service skills. Really don’t know what her problem was, but she was my first encounter upon…",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,What a surprise,"Wow , booked one night and I must say what a fabulous hotel , the decor is fresh and modern the rooms large and very comfortable and the grounds really pretty , complete with  free airport shuttle .

The bathroom was contemporary with a sleek backlit mirror. The curtain material was nicely coordinated with headboards and headboard wall.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel,I base my rating off of my best experience with La quinta hotels. Overall I love la quinta and this was a good one but some accommodate pets differently then others. Keep an eye for pet changes per la quinta.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice for an overnight stay,"Awesome short stay. The shuttle to and from the airport was on time and drivers were very friendly. The front desk people were very helpful even checking in at 1am. They had a crib readily available when we arrived as well. The breakfast was the best part. A lot of variety and options from coffee to juice, hot food to cold food. Awesome location.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,buisness travel,"I was extremely happy with my room. Very clean, not noisy, had everything I needed. Great location to my car return and airport. The breakfast area is very spacious and even has outdoor seating. They also have a work station while you eat. Highly recommend this hotel",5

I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel, room, and outside area.  The breakfast was very good and the service was great!  I will definitely be visiting again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very happy to get two rooms at last minute due to cancelation of flight home!,We were heading to the airport when we received a text our flight was cancelled.  We had to deal with the stress of re booking flights for our group of five adults and extending our rental car and then finding alternate lodging close by the airport. Luckily we did a dn La Quinta worked out great!  We were able to do an early check in whe3n we arrived from Colorado Springs.  We went to an early dinner - walked across the street to Ruby Tuesday for great meal.  And then some of our group went to bed while my wife and my sister and I went swimming to relax in the indoor pool and spa.  It helped and then we also went to an early bed as we had to be up at 3 am to pack and return the rental car and take a shuttle to the airport to check in for the  7 am flight home.  We were delighted when we got to the lobby that some food stuffs were available to eat so we had our bagels and waffles which helped us a lot.  We wre very happy with La Quinta!  Thank you.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta,It’s a very convenient hotel when flying out of DIA...the shuttle service is great...I stay here usually every time I fly...this is the 1st time the check in process was not as good...the gals acted like it was a bother to help & it was slow service!,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,It was great,"I liked every part of this hotel. I wish all La Quinta's around the country were this nice. This hotel met and exceeded every part of what I needed or wanted. I honestly would have been happy to stay here much longer, but was just traveling on business.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta frequent customer,"Great value, excellent operation. I'm a frequent traveler and always stay at La Quinta. I let the hotel know if I have a problem. Always responsive if I have a concern which is infrequent. I highly recommend La Quinta.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Nice Location,Great looking location with  staff friendly and very comfortable rooms. I was able to sleep without outside noises / interruptions. I appreciate the Door Dash offer even though I was too exhausted to take advantage of it. Overall very satisfied.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Bad customer service,"The hotel itself was fine, very poor customer service experience though.  We had booked a room with 2 beds and a crib for our family of 5...  they oversold and gave us a king room but didn’t bother to tell us that at check in.  Also weren’t helpful at all in getting this problem addressed, just sent up a rollaway bed.  Not a great solution but it was too late to change hotels at that point.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Awesome,"Never been to. La Quinta before. I was Very surprised how warm and cozy the place felt. Room rate could’ve been better, but I did Book at the last minute. Otherwise they were very accommodating. We were there for the Soccer National Finals as a team and they allowed us to feed the team in a certain room or even outside in the gazebo. Overall had a great time.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Two x 2 night stays at beginning and end of 7 week RV trip,We have stayed at this hotel several times now and have always found staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel has been recently renovated and rooms are fresh and spacious. (still think it's stupid that I have to type 200 characters to finish my review),5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,My 18 yo twins were thrilled..,".. and commented that this was ""the nicest hotel they have ever stayed at"". Thank you for accommodating young men of this age - many area hotels would not! The boys were impressed with the newly renovated, modern decor and they especially enjoyed the 24-hr gym and pool facilities. They felt the hot breakfast was adequate, could have been a little more upscale. But the location of this hotel was perfect - right next to restaurant options - and the hotel shuttle was reliable with airport pickups on the hour and half hour. Chevk-in and check-out was a breeze. And front desk was so helpful in responding to phone inquiries! Thank you so much! They'll be back!!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place for early flights,Very accommodating and nice property.  Extremely comfortable bed and room was clean.  On time shuttle and parking   Allowed my little dog and had a nice area outside for pets.  Very happy and will definitely stay here in the future,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Impressed with property,It is extremely rare for a hotel to impress me.  This is one of those few times.  The room looked and felt very clean.  I was impressed with the bathroom even though the toilet was very low to the ground.  The toiletries were quality ones I would expect in a nicer hotel.  The pillows and bed were very comfortable which I rarely find in any hotel I stay.  The breakfast did have the make your own waffles that I expect and they had make your own egg biscuits which I have not seen in any place I have stayed.  The front desk person in the morning made a call to get me on a shuttle to the airport.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU RESERVE YOUR SPOT EARLY.  I thought with having an hour and half it would not be a problem getting on the shuttle to the airport.  It could have been a problem yet the front desk person got it done for me.I recommend this place and I now know why they have the award they have since they deserve it.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Best La Quinta ever!,"This is the best La Quinta I have ever experienced! The room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The staff was professional and friendly. Breakfast was ready at 5am and the free shuttle to the airport was easy and convenient.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Lied to and screwed.,"Bed was dirty , hair in sheets not ours hair in bathtub not ours. Reservations promised ground floor room requested for medical reason. Upon arrival request denied refund refused. left in middle of night slept in car.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Warning...do not stay here,"After paying $200 for a quick night, we were very disappointed. Our door handle was broken, the shower didn’t have hot water. The front desk told us to leave it running for 10 minutes first. That did the trick after we already took a freezing cold shower. The bathroom door didn’t lock. Very disappointed with our service.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice property,"Yes. it's a La Quinta. Not only is it close to the airport with free shuttle, it is a great property. Lobby was spacious, front desk well lit and Essence at check in was polite. Bedroom was large with nice design and bathroom too. Furnishings, linens and towels all seemed to be rather new. Room also had small frig. and microwave.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Close To Airport And Convenient For The Area,This La Quinta is close to the airport and convenient when you have to cover areas both north and south of Denver.  The rooms are OK but if you are a lite sleeper early morning flights can be disturbing. I generally stay at another hotel in the area but they were sold out so I tried the La Quinta.  Not disappointed but not really impressed.  The first floor rooms can be a bit noisy from both the halls and parking and should be avoided.Breakfast was nothing to write home about with other hotels of similar value offering more choices and better quality.  The coffee and the fresh fruit were good at least.  The bottom line is they are average.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Bait and Switch,"We're Hilton Diamond members and this stay was booked through AMEX concierge services.  This was our first stay in a La Quinta in over a decade, and it'll likely be our last ever.  This is a great hotel if you like being lied to and enjoy rude staff.  Additionally, the potential infectious diseases from the dried blood all over the lobby are a nice touch, if you're into that kind of thing.We arrived around 1020 at night, and had to wait for the apparent lone front desk lady (Danijha) to get off the numerous phone calls before we could check in.  We expected it to be busy as they were sold out.  What we didn't expect was the price change when we arrived.  We booked on thing, then called to verify and were apparently given 'wrong information that we were incapable of understanding.'  The front desk lady was slightly civil at first but became increasingly rude.  She gave us three different prices and four different stories for why 'we were wrong.'  I asked if a manage would be on duty in the morning and was given a curt 'no managers work weekends.'  The other staff member (Jordan) threatened to cancel our reservation and refuse service to us because we questioned the rates we were being given at the hotel during checkin (we had already paid and they wanted more).  When I inquired as to how many other customers have had this problem I was told 'allot.'  I then asked why it's so common and Jordan replied that I was 'incapable of understanding' in a VERY hostile manner.  While we were there waiting for my credit card to be returned (as I refused to be charged additional monies) we observed several other customers treated quite shortly and rudely.As an added bonus we received phone calls starting at 110pm on the room phone.  When we answered the caller hung up.  One can only surmise that they calls originated at the front desk.Bottom line, don't stay here unless you enjoy being treated poorly and the old bait and switch tactics.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Potential theft of CC number,"Hello,I recently stayed at the La Quinta early this month (June).  The hotel was fine, and our stay was enjoyable.  However, after returning from our vacation, and reviewing my credit card transactions, I noticed two fraudulent charges.  The card with fraudulent charges, was only utilized for our hotel stay.  And coincidentally there were two charges for $90+ at the same gas station on the same day, in Denver.  This review is mostly meant to make management aware of the issue, and if this is a reoccurring incident, I hope they will look into it.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Night Stay at La Quinta DEN airport,The staff were extremely helpful and the room was very clean.  The shuttle to the airport was easy and really did a great job getting me to the airport. The shower was great....hot and made you feel real clean. The bed was very comfortable and quiet....no problems.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient,Great location close to Denver Airport. Super easy check in.  Plenty of parking. Located not far from all kinds of shops and restaurants.Room was clean and comfortable.  Nice staff.  Good hotel breakfast the next morning to give us a head start on the day.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Does everything well ,"Like probably everyone else, we stayed just one night but as we had a late flight the next day, we spent a few hours downtown before returning, picking up our bags and finally departing. This was made easier by the helpfulness of the staff and the availability of the airport shuttle to enable us to connect with the A line from the airport to Union Station and then finally to connect with our flight. The rooms were large, felt newly fitted out and were super clean. Nearby restaurants were convenient though without a car, choice was limited. Breakfast was above average. We were very happy with the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Nice, Comfortable, Helpful","It was a very nice place with a helpful staff. The bus will take you to the hotel from the airport as soon as you get on, but it only leaves the hotel every half hour. Totally fine, but just plan accordingly.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great stay, EXCELLENT hotel","This is a very clean, modern LQ. Fast airport shuttle, right next to a Ruby Tuesday's not even 100 yards, very nice rooms. Fast check-in. Breakfast starts at 5am which is great for an airport-area hotel. We look forward to returning.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient stay,"Definitely the best LQ experience I’ve had since the merger.  I arrived really late, after 11pm, and the front desk staff was present and friendly.  Parking my rental car was a challenge, but the staff helped out with tips for finding the last few spaces, and I literally found the last space in the lot!  Property is fairly new and the rooms were clean and in good repair.  WiFi was strong which is always a plus. Walking distance to a Ruby Tuesday, Village Inn, and another Italian place.  Breakfast was the higher-end LQ fare, with sausage, potatoes, scrambled eggs, and biscuits/gravy added to the usual suspects.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Sleep 'n Fly,"After a fun-filled week in the Denver area, I turned in my rental car and spent the night at LaQuinta Inn & Suites.  The reception area is well-appointed and very clean. Nice area for lounging.  Computers available to print out boarding passes.  Attentive and friendly staff. Clean and comfortable rooms. No hallway odor noticed. Everything seemed clean and fairly new.  Shuttle bus is prompt in arriving to deliver you to the Denver International Airport - about a 10 minute ride from the hotel.  However, the shuttle only stops once and does not deliver to individual airlines - so it's a bit of a hike to ticketing or security.  Price exceptionally reasonable for the time spent there (for us, anyway).  Only downside was the coffee.  Undrinkable!  Rest of the breakfast bar - even at 4AM was okay.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent Hotel,"Everyone was extremely friendly and the room was very impressive.  Hotel is half a block from Ruby Tuesday and 1 block from Village Inn, which is very convenient for those who shuttled it to and from the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Quick Stay,"I needed a spot close the airport and this hotel nailed it.  I arrived very late in the evening (after 11pm) so it was hard with finding a parking spot but once I got into my room, everything was very nice.  I was only there for a few hours because I needed to leave early the next morning for a 6am flight.  I checked out at about 4pm so I could make the quick drive to return my rental car before making my way to the airport.  This hotel provided me with a good night's rest with a perfect location.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,My dog and I love this place,"When coming to Denver for business or pleasure, if possible we stay at this Laquinta location. I love the extensive grassy areas for my Jack Russel puppy and I love the ease of securing a dog friendly room.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice hotel,So recently stayed here for one night clean hotel but there are some cons about this hotel. first off the customer service when I checked in and out was not very welcoming and when checked out I get no how was your stay was everything ok nothing. Now onto the room i thought it was clean but then when I walked around I found things worth attention. First off the bathroom faucet was dirty will show in pictures below I also came across the top sheet of the bed had dog hair not very clean. Overall I would not come back to this location do to the customer service and room not being clean among other things I found.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Loud, locked out, terrible food","Arrived about 10 pm and checked in. A loud dog was already being complained about by several people near my room. After I couldn't get to sleep I called the front desk about the barking dog. Room was changed,but key wouldn't work. Had to walk down to the front office 3 separate times to get a working keyBreakfast was awful. No milk for cereal, which was all I wantedNo one available at check out. Rang the bell several times. Finally the shuttle driver told us all just to leave keys on the counter because we had to leave",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Long wait for shuttle, then was full",We had to wait a long time in the cold at the airport for the shuttle (20 - 25 min) and then it was too full for us to get a ride.  So then we had to wait for the next one.  Otherwise the staff and hotel were ok.  Options for heating water in the room were minimal.  The room was fine.  Carpet was kind of a crazy pattern.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice pool and hot tub daystay,"I really enjoy visiting this hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful, they serve an expanded free breakfast, and the have the BEST pool and hot tub of any hotel I have stayed in in the Denver metro area. The pool and Hot tub are enclosed in its own attached building, with large glass windows to view the outdoors, with easy access from the rooms. The only drawback is the tv service the hotel uses, which is Dish, which in my opinion only, for lack f a better word, sucks the signal was out for most of out stay on all but a few religious channels..but we were here for the pool and hot tub, so I guess thats' a moot point.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Relaxed stay,"Relaxing stay, true heated pool and whirlpool. Relaxed atmosphere, pretty quiet room and hot bar breakfast. Staff was friendly and professional! Some staff didn’t understand English but as long as I pointed out an issue it was immediately fixed. Great value for the price!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great location for Denver Airport,"I’ve used this hotel on a number of occasions when traveling via Denver airport from and to the UK.It’s a good location with good shuttle bus service to and from the airport.I’ve always found it to comfortable, clean and with friendly staff.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Overnight stay,"Check-in person was uncaring and did not make a good impression of LaQuinta Hotel staff.   Family has stayed at this location many times and never treated with nonchalant ""here are your key cards-have a good evening"" dismissal.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Aweful Hotel,"The front desk staff clearly don't like their jobs... they are short, rude and don't care about the needs of your guest. I've stayed a La Quinta hotels all over the country and other hotels around the world. This is by far the worse hotel in regards to the staff treatment of guests that I've every experienced. This was a three-day stay and we thought about leaving after the first night. The second day my wife and I were away from the hotel nearly all day. We returned to the hotel at approximately 9:30PM to find that our room had not received housekeeping services. We called the front desk and were told that housekeeping was not available and ""must have forgot your room."" I was then told, ""just use your old towels."" We went and had to sneak into the indoor pool area to get fresh towels for our room. The staff really appears to only be working for a paycheck because they consistently and repeatedly do not care about your guest. I would highly suggest pre-employment and random drug screenings for the night-time front desk personnel. You could smell the marijuana on his clothes and he clearly appeared, as my physician wife stated - ""Baked."" I will never stay at another La Quinta or Wyndham hotel ever again!!!!!!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,BEAUTIFUL,I stayed at the La Quinta for a week  because my daughter was getting married.the staff and service that we received was great. the grounds were beautiful.i was able to concentrate on the wedding but not the room.i can not wait to go back. it was centrally located with easy access. i can not wait to go back.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Quick overnight,We had a 6 am flight needed a close hotel with a shuttle. They picked up at 4:30 am no issues. Worked out great could use bigger in room TV. Check in fast and efficient set up shuttle for us. Had already started breakfast.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Best hotel on 6000 mile road trip yet,"To our surprise, this is a Laquinta, which is a brand I was never a fan of.  But since Wyndham has taken it over it turns out to be the best room of our 6000 mile road trip with our small dog.  Extremely comfortable bed, very well maintained, well designed and decorated room.  I highly recommend this pet friendly hotel.  Staff was also very friendly, room was spotless.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent choice,"I am not sure what the negative reviews are about.  I stayed in a King, room 306, and the room was fantastic.  Clean, large, comfortable.  Room had a Refrigerator, microwave, coffeemaker. This was a terrific choice.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Shuttling to and from DIA,"With the exception that early restrictions forced the original Denver airport hotels to be built way too far away from the airport, the LaQuinta (now LaQuinta by Wyndham) is one of the best of the Tower Road complex of a dozen or so hotels. All the hotels are about the same, so the key is which hotel's shuttle bus is most dependable. LQ's partnership with Western Shuttle is working.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disgusting,Thus the worst hotel that you are anyone you know could stay at. This is my second time staying at this hell hole (not by choice) and the first time it smelled so bad you could smell it before you pulled up at the front door. The mattresses are yellow and stained as well as the pillows the carpet is slick and black. The second time the lights were out on the front door and it was a lot of people just standing around smoking weed in the pitch black. It was the worst stay of my life and I travel for a living.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,comfortable and clean,the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. The lobby was very nice and the staff was friendly and helpful. We were flying out in the morning and we were able to leave our vehicle there while we traveled for a small fee. Some places in the area offer this service for free.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,untrained front desk staff and uncomfortable beds,"untrained and sometime rude staff at the desk, terrible nights with uncomfortable pillows and mattresses. all night a noisy pump is working and the elevator rings each time it passes by the floor. it's clean though.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great value!,"Great place to stay, Very clean and up dated. I highly recommend staying here. They do offer FREE airport shuttle also. The staff did an excellent job. The pool area was exceptionally clean and it's open 24 hours",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,False information. Terrible front desk staff/manager.,"I was on the phone with La Quinta inquiring about their parking policy. They said it was free for the first 7 days and then $10/day after that. I asked if it was the same if I booked through Expedia as they could not match the price and was ensured that it was. When we got to the hotel, the front desk attendants told me parking was $10/day. I told them of my conversation with La Quinta and they said that was not their problem and that if I wanted to leave my car, it would be &10/day payable right then or I could go park my car at another hotel. When I asked for a manager to help, I was told there was none on duty. They were unwilling to help in any way. If there is a difference in policy from corporate to an individual property then I as a consumer should not have to pay for it. Then to top it off, when we got into our room, all the towels were covered in hair!I have had an issue with a La Quinta in the past and this is the last straw! Never again! Note to anyone thinking of booking, get it all in writing!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Location,"This hotel is located close to the airport and worth the extra money to be close to one of the busier airports in the country. The shuttle service was great and on time which we appreciated both late in the evening and early in the morning. The front desk even offered to keep our ski bag behind the desk so that we didn't have to cart it to our room, a small but appreciated gesture. Our room was newly renovated and very clean. It was rather large and had plenty of space for us to re-organize our things after a week long skiing adventure. Breakfast had lot's of options and the staff were freindly. Will certainly stay here again if I need to be close to the airport!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great value with ease of transport to airport.,"No problem with the Park and Fly package, great transport to and from the airport.  We were able to check in early with the friendly staff who explained our pickup plans and signed us up for the VERY EARLY pickup up time for the early flight.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,bad experience,"Breakfast was good and the room was clean... that's all I can say was good.  TV didn't work, desk outlets didn't work, squeaky headboard with every move made, pokey pillows, microwave broken, the worse though was the NO Toilet Paper and the front desk would not bring any when I called and asked for some. To top it off the front desk staff exhibited no sign of remorse or compassion on my plight.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great location near the airport,This hotel overall was exactly what we needed.

Despite the travel problems it was a true respite from the storm.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Hateful front desk service. 😡,"I can’t understand why my debit card was been declined so I try to explain the lady that I had already paid for my stay, she got mad and start yelling at me in front of people and my kids. Why ??? I wonder if they realize that a business survives from customers and that their pay check come from them. There’s not reason to be hateful or ugly with customers. Yes I know that some customers aren’t the best sometimes but I didn’t consider that I talked to her ugly, and that guy named Travis that wait on my when we check in take my money for 1 night stay and didn’t wanted to give me my room key till I pay for the 2nd night. I explain him that I wanted to use cash since I didn’t got time to go to the bank before I came and even make an offer to leave a deposit if I need to, and no he didn’t give me the key and make wait for over 30 min with my kids till someone else told him that what he was doing was completely wrong????? What is going on with customer service. Oh and to be clear just Front Desk, the cleaning staff and the rest of the staff are very friendly",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver Airport La Quinta - overnight stay,"The free shuttle service ran very smoothly, I didn't have to wait long to be picked up. When I called for shuttle information, the receptionist gave me very easy to understand directions. I was able to find the shuttle with no problem. Check in was also very fast. The room I had was recently renovated, updated and comfortable. Water pressure in the shower was high and toiletries were provided. I was able to get a good night's sleep. There was a decent variety of food at breakfast and several kinds of coffee. Shuttle back to the airport was prompt and efficient. Overall an excellent experience!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great overnight stay before early trip from DIA,This is my go-to hotel for Tower Road.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Poor customer service!,"Had to get room keys reset everytime we needed back in our room! The girl at the service desk kept telling me to keep my card away from electronics, that is funny in my back pocket next to NOTHING! Wow",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disgusting!,"Never had the need to write a review before but this hotel has got to be the single most disgusting one we have ever stayed at!  Sofa bed had food all over it and chip bags.  There was hair all over the bedding and stained pillows.  Front desk attendants didn't seem to care too much.  Message to manager left unreturned.  We'll cross La Quinta off a list for a long, long time.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,we were happy with our visit,thank you for up dating the hotel it is a pleasure staying here again it was time to fix the rooms and public areas. The Hotel is just so well located to the Airport. The Staff is very accommodating and pleasant. Keep up the good work and we will be back soon again.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,works in a pinch,"unless you have no other options go elsewhere. Staff does not go out of there way to be welcoming or accommodating. Rooms are so-so and not so clean, beds need replaced (our experience)Hotel does provide shuttle to airport and she was great! staff should take lessons from her.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay while flying to and fro from DIA,"Very nice, new hotel - clean, quiet, reasonably priced.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good choice for airport hotel,"I needed a hotel after my evening flight got canceled because of a snowstorm, and this was a good, reasonably priced choice. There is a newly remodeled lobby complete with a welcoming fire in the fireplace. The room was clean and modern, with a big TV, nice big bathroom, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, desk etc and comfortable bed. The breakfast buffet had a lot of choices, from eggs and sausage to waffles to cereal to bagels, as well as apples and oranges. Yes, the eggs were pre-packaged circles and not made-to-order omelets, but at the price point they were fine. The shuttle service was prompt in the morning and as prompt as could be expected during the snowstorm. Be aware that multiple hotels use the same van, so you need to keep a sharp eye out for the right one. There are several places to eat within easy walking distance. I would definitely stay again if I needed an airport hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good Value,Used LaQuinta's park stay fly option which was competitively priced. Hotel was in very good condition.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place.,"We used the “Stay and park” while on a week trip to Mexico.

The breakfast was better than most hotel breakfasts. We will definitely stay here for our next trip.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice! ,"We only spent one night here at the fifth floor. The hotel is very nice, newly remodeled with very comfortable beds. A size smaller than a queen but very comfy. Breakfast was adequate but nothing to rave about, it can get pretty busy down there as we noticed around 8:45 am when we left. Staff at the reception was very nice, the guy working the night of Thursday January 10th around 11 pm was extremely nice and accommodating. Sorry I forgot his name, but after a 10 hour drive it was great to be greeted with such good manners. Would definitely return.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great place, close to everything!","The front desk staff was great! My only disappointment was the free breakfast. There wasn’t anything at all to eat but carbs. No eggs, meat, etc. Plenty of muffins, bread, bagels, waffles, bananas. We had to go out and buy breakfast everyday, even weekends. Most LaQuinta locations step up breakfast, at least on the weekends.",4

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Overall ok.,"No significant issues.  Service waa good, rooms nice, breakfast normal for LQ.I would like to say that this hotel does have lots of receptacles for pluggibg in devices and such.

Lots of other hotels in area.  They have the community shuttle to the airport",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,stay,stayed at hotel so we would have a short drive to dia. Let us park our ca r there will we were out of town. They shuttled us to and back to get our car. The hotel rates were more then fair for the quality of the rooms.,5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Our stay at La Quinta,"Close to airport, clean, nice lobby!  Serve breakfast!

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Front desk,"I was at your hotel last week with my friend overnight because we had an early morning flight.

We arranged our early am shuttle to airport upon arrival the night before.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Raw Sewage Odor,"The entire hotel smelled like raw sewage and it got worse as the night progressed. When I called the front desk to ask why, I was told they had no idea. They recommended I open my window, in 30 degree November weather. I called the Denver Health Department and reported the situation. We frequently fly in and out of Denver, but we will never stay here again.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Low end hotel,"We stayed overnight before an early flight.  The hotel seemed nice when we arrived, but we soon found it to be 'low-end' in many respects.  For example, there was a lot of noise in hallways that kept us awake.  Paper products in the room were cheap.  Breakfast was what you'd expect in a cheap motel (circular egg things, watered down coffee, etc.).  With all the hotels available at DIA, we would not stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Fantastic stay! ,"We have 3 small children and had an overnight lay over so we shuttled to the hotel.

Tv didn’t work in the living area were my kids were but the other one did and they made do. The shuttle was on time and nice in the morning. The breakfast was great and abundant.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"New Remodeled, Big Room, Thin Walls","The La Quinta is in a great location near the airport and also near a few dining options. The newly remodeled rooms are nice and the bed was comfortable. I was also impressed with the size of the room and bathroom. Only point off is that I could very clearly hear everything happening in the room to the left of me. I believe this was part due to the the connecting door having a large gap between the door and the floor, letting noise flow freely. My neighbor wasn't being overly loud, but I had to turn on a white noise program on my phone to go to sleep.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice place to get stuck in two days from a snow storm,"I arrived in downtown Denver on a Saturday night from a scenic train from Oakland,CA. I decided to stay near the airport for lower rates and better access to rental cars, forecast was for 1 to 3 inches of snow, but a blizzard moved in with 4 to 6 inches and I couldn't take a rental car to explore around the area. Discovered this newly remodeled motel (see picture of the lobby) had a first class pool and exercise area so I just stayed here the whole time except for walking across the street to one of the two restaurants available within walking distance. The next morning when I was leaving for my flight I made the mistake of leaving my IPAD on the table in the lobby. I called from the airport and they were nice enough to mail it back to me in Vicksburg. I highly recommend this place to stay at in the Denver area, for its lower cost and nearby access to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nicely renovated and remodeled,The clerk on the desk went out of his way to walk us to 5th floor and open the room when we having issues getting the card key to work.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Shuttle never made it,"Scheduled the shuttle for 6:30 to catch flight at DIA. Front desk kept calling and was told 2 or 3 minutes. At 7 another companies shuttle dropped a lady off, but said it was not our shuttle. He was with a different company.  5 minutes later he came back and picked us up and then went around to his scheduled pick ups. Never saw the La Quinta shuttle. Have had shuttle trouble there before. Also, they never get the wake up call right.  Adios, La Qunta.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent Stay,"Stayed overnight using the ""park and fly"" option. Lots of parking spots and seemed very secure.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay somewhere else,"The TV didn't work, even after I called and someone came to fix it.  Three minutes later it didn't work again.

Hotel was very nice. Room was spotless. Took the shuttle in the morning, it was reliable and prompt. The girl at the desk that checked me in was provided great customer service.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pet Policy,"We usually try to stay at La Quinta because if traveling by car, we have a pet and appreciate your pet friendly policy. That is all I have to say, but the Trip Advisor post requires more characters and apparently I did not use the minimum to exit. I am thus not impressed with Trip Advisor, but am very happy with La Quinta.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pretty good but dont like dogs in the  restaurant,"Shuttle good, check in quick, room big and clean. The hotel had a new fresh appearance. Dinner next door at restaurant was convenient and an Italian  restaurant 200 yards away. We thought the breakfast was poor quality compared to some other La Quinta and don't like to see dogs in the restaurant.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent as always,"I have stayed many times at this La Quinta, and always have excellent experiences.  The business trips with meetings in the conference room run smoothly and personal stays are nice.  Always friendly staff and clean rooms.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice hotel stay,"The stay here was great, rooms nicely furnished, better tv premium channels than a downtown Major chain hotels, breakfast was nice with free shuttle to airport, I will stay here again.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pet friendly and has a great breakfast selection!,The lobby was beautiful and would book there again.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay near DIA,We stay here when we fly out really early from DIA.  The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.  We haven't had a chance to experience the breakfast yet- leave way too early for it!  Would definitely recommend!,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,BED,The mattress was very bad.  The mattress pad was hard and wrinkled under the sheet which made it hard too sleep.  Reminded me of a pad under a childs bed to prevent them from wetting the bed.  Also was not told we could not park car while flying for 2 days.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great room, but...","I was in Denver for a one day business trip so instead of hassling with traffic, I decided to stay at the La Quinta Denver Airport as it was close to my meeting location.  The hotel is relatively new and it is in great shape in terms of the room and the breakfast area. My only complaint was that there was some sort of machine or equipment that was making a droning noise most of the night and I was only able to get about 3 hours of sleep.  When I went out of my room this noise was in the hallway and in the breakfast area, so I know it had nothing to do with my room itself.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Airport Hotel,"Very nice airport hotel.  The rooms were very clean and spacious.  The hotel was quiet and everything appeared newly renovated.  Beds were comfy. Made an appointment for the airport shuttle and it was right on time.  The breakfast was hot with a variety of items, including eggs, bacon, potatoes, biscuits, waffles, yogurt, and fruit; and started at 5am for early flights.  For the cost, it was a steal and I would stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Surprisingly Nice!,"My husband and I needed to stay close to the airport for a very early departure in the morning.  We chose this hotel as the accommodations and the price seemed to be the best of the mix.  We were happily surprised to find a very nice lobby with comfortable seating.  My sister and her husband came over and it was like being in a nice living room as we sat by the fire.  The room was even more of a wonderful surprise!  Everything was new, nicely furnished, particularly comfortable bed.  The size of the room was great!  Nothing was cramped and we had everything we needed.  We were really impressed as we were expecting a bare-bones hotel just to get through the evening with a bed and shower. Instead we had a lovely, clean and comfortable stay!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Sewer gas odors, not a good experience","We arrived here in late evening, dog in tow, in route back east.  We previously have stayed here and thought we would give the property another chance.  When I walked into the lobby this time, there was an awful smell.  When I inquired about the obnoxious odor, the front desk attendant told me they were working on the sewer pipes and it has been going on for some time.   Since it was late, we decided to stay.  After lugging our luggage and dog to our assigned room, we found the door key we were given did not work.  Upon entering the room, the toilet seat was broken.    Not a good start.   On the positive side, the room was large, the bed was comfortable and they do accept dogs for no extra charge.   Breakfast is the typical La Quinta mess hall spread.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A great option among Tower Rd hotels!,"I always price compare LaQuinta because they give us a 12% military discount...sometimes it is not the best rate (Spring Break 2018), but we were traveling at non-peak time for this trip and I was pleased with the price.  Their free breakfast is always great!  My flight was to depart at 6am and they have a 24-hr free shuttle, so I was able to get the 3:30 a.m. shuttle.  It was a quick ride at that time of day, just keep in mind, this shuttle is not exclusive to LaQuinta...they pick up at other hotels, so give yourself some extra time.  Otherwise, the accommodations were clean & comfortable and within walking distance of restaurants.  I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointing,"Stayed here night of October 9 after getting stuck in Denver overnight due to weather and without our luggage. Booked through American Airlines.  Arrived at 8 pm and when getting ready for bed, discovered there are no amenity kits with toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving items, shower cap, etc.  Asked at desk and was told I could buy them in their store, but not everything was available.  The next morning at a 4 am wakeup, we discovered there were only hand towels in the room--no bath towels.  We didn't have time to get more towels before leaving, so used hand towels for shower!  When I mentioned the lack of towels when checking out, the desk seemed indifferent.  On the plus side, the breakfast was excellent and the shuttle service also.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel near the airport,"Stayed here overnight, came in at 11:00pm. Check in was easy, I had reserved the room, prior to arrival. The room was beautiful, new hotel I think. Great breakfast in the morning, and shuttle back to the airport. I would definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Inexpensive, convenient & safe","On a recent overnight trip to Denver I stayed at this property. I liked everything about this hotel except that the door between the adjoining rooms was so thin that I could hear snoring from the next room. Except for this one thing, this hotel is a very good value at the location.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,I.f. from Alabama,"The room was not clean. Had dog hair in the carpet. Mattress was wore out and AC didn't work well. We ask to be put on fifth floor, but was assured the room had been deeply cleaned. Not worth the high price you have to pay.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice,"The hotel is very conveniently located near the airport, with restaurants right next door.  So we were able to walk there. The rooms were very clean, lobby is beautiful and service was excellent.  Nice breakfast also starting early for those with early flights.  Free shuttle to airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Comfortable rooms, good location, shuttle service, decent breakfast","Everything was fine w/exception to the front desk staff -- when our door key cards were not programmed and we had to return to the desk to get them keyed after wandering the halls looking for our room (for some reason, the rooms were not in sequential order) and finding out they didn't work, the nighttime front desk clerk didn't even apologize for the inconvenience.  The mornring front desk clerk was pre-occupied w/the computer she working on and I don't believe ever made eye contact with me for the 3 interactions I had with her (checking out, asking about shuttle, and business center).  It's too bad because otherwise I would have given a 5-star rating.  Maybe mgmt may want to investigate why these particular employees don't seem happy -- could be they need some morale boosters or maybe management itself is the problem, not sure.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver airport,"Hotel good overall, fairly quiet and pool/hot tub nice. The only issue I had with this hotel is that when they remodeled they installed a new heating/air system that did not allow for the fan to be put on continuous use. I am a light sleeper and like to run a fan for to cover up any small noises.  When I fly I do not have access to a fan like when I drive.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very recommendable,"Pet-friendly hotel near Denver airport. Lovely room with everything you could want for. The only downside is that breakfast is open only until 9am, not ideal when you arrive very late the night before like we did. Otherwise everything is perfect!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent!,"This hotel was fantastic! Much better than a lot of higher priced hotels. It was modern, up-to-date, extremely clean.

I would definitely recommend this hotel, and would stay here again.",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel,I was able to book this room at the last possible minute after a storm closed DIA causing me to miss my connecting flight home.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great for a quick stay.,"We stayed here before catching a flight out of Denver. The room was very nice, very clean and comfortable. It was a little pricey though, like all of the hotels near the airport. The bathroom doors are a little strange but everything else was great.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great room and service.,We would give our stay at this LaQuinta a 10.  Very nice place and kind people.  Would like to see fruit on the menu for breakfast.  Will stay here again when in Denver. We appreciated the military discount and they all thanked my husband for his 26 years of service.  That was so NICE.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Last minute reservation at end of vacation,"Called hotel to make reservation for our last night of vacation before flying out the next morning from Denver International Airport. Was given price for night and said I would take it. Somehow between accepting the room and giving my credit card number over the phone the price went up. ??? When I questioned the price discrepancy I was told sorry the price went up while we were talking. Did I still want the room? I took the room anyway because I was tired and did not feel like calling around for another room. Hotel has been recently remodeled as promised and room was clean and nice. We stayed in a Deluxe King room on the first floor. Hotel is pretty noisy but I expected this being near the highway and the airport. Front desk staff was very friendly on check in. Free breakfast was nice. Had waffles, eggs, cereal, yogurt, fruit, and more to choose from. Would recommend this hotel if looking for something close to airport.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay and Go,"We stay at the La Quinta Denver-Airport when we have a early flight out of DIA on the following day. We keep our vehicle at that facility, on our return flight back we stay another night before going home.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Clean Comfortable Perfect Location,"We stayed after the Denver game on Sunday night. Quiet, clean, spacious and comfortable. Staff was efficient and check-in was a breeze. Bed was great. Shower was nice. We were on 4th floor, no tub, but we didn't need one. Great value. Breakfast was hot and ready at 6 am, we grabbed a quick bite and headed to the airport. We always stay at La Quinta if there is one in the area.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Needs Work,"The hotel needs work… night staff was not friendly, did not want to be there. The bed sheets were old and needed to be replaced. The bathroom needed two rolls of TP ""not one"". There was no shampoo in bathroom.  The bathroom sink moved all over the place, needed to be replaced. The back of the bathroom door needs to be repaired and then painted. The pillows were very soft... Need a couple of pillows with different hardness.  D Tirado",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay afyer cancelled flight,"Our BA flight was cancelled as we were boarding and we managed to get a room here. Friendly staff and a really comfy, clean and spacious room. Good facilities and a good breakfast. Pricier than others we stayed at but at BA's expense.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Awesome,"The staff was so good, they made me feel like they were MY staff and the accommodations were over the top. The hotel was very clean and the breakfast was very good. It was a very enjoyable stay over and I will most definitely stay there again, and again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A Pleasant Surprise,"Appeared to be recently renovated, if not new.  Attractive interior from reception/large breakfast area to the rooms. Way above average LaQuinta.   Either there were no pets in rooms (doubtful) or the insulation is terrific as we never heard any pet sounds.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Hot Mess,"Night desk service was so bad, not helpful, seemed like we were a bother. Breakfast  was not ready at 6:30 and the eggs looked like and tasted like they had been rewarmed from the day before. In the morning we found dirty underwear in our room. which needless to say was disgusting, we notified the front desk on check out.  Morning staff was very friendly and apologized and said management would call us....no one ever did and because of the lack of response to someone else's dirty underwear in our room, I feel the need to post our experience on Yelp and TripAdvisor.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Nice Hotel,"Very clean and pleasant staff.  Stayed one night before our early morning airline departure.  I wish breakfast had been put out earlier than 5:30 a.m., as we had to leave at that time and only coffee was available.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,The Worst Ever and Here is Why,"I am normally loyal to La Quinta, but this property has to be the worst of them all. They missed the mark of so many levels. I do not blame LQ for the people  who choose to stay with them, but I do blame them for the quality of the rooms, the lobby, the grounds and the staff, PLUS how the staff reacts to concerns and complaints.We arrived September 5, 2018, checked in for four nights and went to our room which was the furthest from the front desk only to find it was the wrong room type. We hiked back to the desk, got a new room and moved our luggage to room 112. This room happened to be an adjoining room with room 110. We should have stayed in the original room.We noticed right away as we entered and unpacked:•	Room door did not fit properly and had to be pulled three times to close completely, resulting in three loud thumps.•	No luggage rack.•	The closet door would not stay open and slammed shut on its own.•	No water cups.•	The bathroom had a split door and both had to be pulled closed and thunked.•	One bar of soap.•	There were only two very small dresser drawers, perhaps 4” X 12” apiece, that could not possibly accommodate two adults with belongings meant for four nights.•	The TV would turn on, but had no channels loaded. We loaded the channel lineup only to find the remote would not move channel up/down and the volume did not work. We unplugged it eventually and got it to work. We never could get Netflix or streaming to work, as the screen advertised, to work.•	And we were given only one room key card and had to visit the front desk again.It had been a long day for us, so we went to bed about 9:30 PM. Room 110 had the light on and left it on all night long. Normally, this would not present a problem, but the adjoining door was not a good fit for the frame and light showed around the entire frame (about two inches on the floor edge). Room 110 decided it would be a great idea to turn on TV and leave it on ALL NIGHT LONG. Had we not been exhausted, we would have dressed and gone to the front desk one more time.In the morning, we complained to the front desk and we were told that Room 110 was checking out. Okay, good. Problem solved, except it wasn’t because the front desk was not truthful about the check out. We had breakfast, went back to the room and the key cards were no longer programmed. We had to go back to the front desk. To this point, none of the encounters with anyone at the front desk had been pleasant and this one was no different. The male clerk acted as though we had done something to the cards when he said, “I programmed these myself.” A more appropriate comment would have been, “I’m so sorry this happened.”We were gone all day Thursday, September 6th, returning about 6 PM. It had been another long day, so we got to bed around 9:30 PM. Around 4:30 AM on Friday, toilets and showers started. Newer hotels are more soundproof, but not this one. Suddenly, at 6:00 AM on September 7th, the alarm began ringing in Room 110. It continued for 45 minutes. My man went to the front desk where the alarm could easily be heard. He complained and was offered a new room on an upper floor. He asked to see the room and was given a key card. He went there and the key card would not work. He walked back; the clerk was once again snarky acting. The clerk recoded the key, my man visited the room again and still it would not work, so he went to hotel next door and made reservations for the remainder of our trip.When he told me we were moving, I began to pack and I will admit, I was not quiet about it. The alarm ringing in Room 110 was the final straw for me. I turned on the TV, a bit louder than I normally would have, but it was obvious the neighboring guest HAD to be awake. I didn’t do anything to mitigate the noise from the doors in the room. That should have been handled by LQ long before we arrived.I went to the front desk to check out, thinking my man might create a scene. The desk clerk was on the phone and asked the caller to hold while she spoke to me. I told her we were leaving early. She picked up the phone and told the caller that Room 112 was checking out and she would call back. I asked who was on the phone since it was obviously about us. She said it was the Manager who had a complaint from Room 110 about excessive noise. I told the clerk that we had complained a day prior only to be told that the excessive noise from room 110 would stop because they were checking out. I told the clerk they left the lights and TV on all night both nights and we were not given a satisfactory resolution. My final statement to the clerk was that she had a real problem in Room 110 and it needed to be investigated. Have you heard the phrase, “Hello Wall”? That is apropos here. The clerk never asked how she could solve the issue, never offered another room, never seemed concerned that we were upset, never apologized for our complaints having been ignored. What I find hard to believe is that this LQ was not in an isolated area. It is surrounded by many hotel properties with similar pricing. The one we moved to had a better room layout, was larger, much quieter plus less expensive. And I was pleased to find a staff with customer experience at the forefront of their approach. So skip the LQ and reserve the Fairfield/ Marriot which is right next door.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great staff, exceptionally clean",This was our second stay at this hotel. The rooms are modern and very clean. The pool is great and the common area at the entrance is lovely. It had a nice selection of larger rooms for families that needed parents and kids in one room.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very comfortable stay,"Ours was a late night arrival at DIA.  The shuttle trip between the airport and the hotel was easy, as was the trip back the next morning.   (You may sign up for early morning shuttle returns to the airport at the La Quinta front desk.)   The hotel has a pantry near the front desk where you may purchase snacks, drinks, and even frozen meals.  Really great idea as there are fridges and microwaves in the rooms.  Slept reallly well, the bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast was good.  The waffle machine, as always, made the meal feel special.  :)  I'd recommend the La Quinta at DIA.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Did not get what we reserved,"Room only had one bed and a pull out sofa that was not at all comfortable, was promised a 2 bedroom suite for a maximum of 6, (repeatedly by reservations person) the room was low quality.  Would not recommend. (TV did not work, had to be reprogramed)",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay for DIA,"We have to come from Cheyenne to fly out of DIA and usually have early flights, so our trip usually starts by staying here so we just have a short trip to airport for early flights!  They do have shuttle - but we usually do long term parking.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great option in the DIA area,"This hotel was a great choice for a place to stay so we could catch our very early morning flight out of DIA (and not make our Denver host lug us out to DIA in the middle of the night).  It was very tastefully remodeled, and the floors in the room were not carpeted, which I loved. My only complaint was that the bathroom floor was not as clean as it should have been, and we also seemed to get a lot of noise from the room above.   Other than that it was definitely a good choice, especially for the price.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,clean and convenient,"This property is clean and convenient for an overnight near DEN.  They are a convenient shuttle stop,  offer a good breakfast,  waling distance to several chain restaurants. friendly and helpful desk staff.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,My Unplanned Stay at La Quinta Denver - Airport,I was stuck at the Denver Airport overnight due to weather.  My experience with airport hotels in the past has not been good.  I was pleasantly surprised with the decor and cleanliness of the La Quinta Denver - Airport.  The staff was very friendly and efficient.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent Value for a Great Room,"I had a clean, nice room for a great price near the Denver airport. A shuttle was provided to the airport; took less than 15 minutes (early in the morning). This hotel chain is a hidden gem that I would use again!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Stayed Twice, Twice as Nice","Probably the cleanest LaQuinta I've stayed in.  I'm a Returns member logging 60+ nights/year at LQ, seen a ton of them.  None are as clean and inviting as this one.  I recommended a coworker stay here as well since he also had an early departure from DIA.  He was also impressed.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Clean,modern, friendly","Hotel was updated, clean and staff was friendly. The eggs for breakfast were not tasty, they were flat like pancakes. The rest of the stay was great and we appreciated the shuttle to and from the airport which ran every 30 minutes.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Family VACAY,We picked this hotel as it is close to DIA.  We were picking up a family member who arrived early in the morning.  Proximity to the airport was the reason we elected this LaQuinta to stay in.  There are nice restaurants nearby.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean and comfortable,Pleasantly surprised by this upgraded La Quinta! I had not stayed in a La Quinta for quite some time so I was somewhat skeptical but was quite pleased with the comfort and cleanliness and amenities of this hotel. I would absolutely recommend this location for anyone.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice hotel but some issues.,"The hotel appearance was nice however, I had to have my door key recoded daily. This became a real pain after a days work and being on the 5th floor. Returning to my room after work only to find out my key didn't work, then having to go to the front desk to have the key recoded. The fact that the elevator was sooooo SLOW didn't help the situation. The location of this hotel has nothing at all around it other then more hotels. Plan on using Uber to go eat or to look for entertainment.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice!,"We stayed one night before our flight out of Denver, Co. It is a very nice hotel and beautiful property. We did not hear a single plane go over. The only complaint I have is that the mattress seemed to be an older one not very supportive but I slept OK anyway. The bathroom  doors are French style with no locks on them. Otherwise we had a great stay with a good hot breakfast in their gorgeous lobby. The employees were friendly and helpful. There is a Ruby Tuesday restaurant next door you can walk to for a nice meal.  Rooms are large and the A/C worked great. Airport shuttle available but we had a rental to return. I would definitely stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Room was nice,Decent size. Went back and forth to get the key to work. Airport shuttle was on time and and very nice driver. Front desk was helpful. Some of the breakfast was out at 4:30 and that was nice. Pool was perfect temperature and lots of towels.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great rooms,"My recent stay at LaQuinta Denver airport was great.  The hotel is fairly new, everything still looked new and well kept.  The rooms were very clean and the appliances (refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker) were clean and without odor. The front desk staff were very helpful.  Although, the hotel doesn't have a dedicated shuttle, it provides airport transportation through a third party vendor.  The airport shuttle company (Western Union) ran frequently and their drivers were friendly as well, especially Ms. Shannon.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Dissatisfied,The front desk agent seemed bothered that he had to wait on us. The room had two nonfunctioning tvs and the entry door was very difficult to open. A/C was not working until maintenance checked the circuit breaker and turned the power on.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Conveniet for Denver Airport,"We have stayed here a couple times now and really enjoy the hotel for its cleanliness, friendly staff, and shuttle to the airport.  My only negative is they need to take off their website that it is free to keep your car there for up to 7 days  and then they will charge you.  We were only parked for 3 and we were charged $20.  So I'm a little confused on that point.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great staging for our flight home,"All of our needs were met at this hotel as we were ending our vacation and returning home.  A relaxing hotel with a lot of space, good staff, good breakfast, walkable places to eat, convenient shuttle to the airport, etc.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Suprisingly Very Nice,Excellent service. Very good price. Clean room and bathroom. shuttle to the airport as well. Great staff and nice amenities. Breakfast in the morning too. Close to other services like restaurants.....,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,One night stay,"Clean, comfortable, quiet and friendly!  Convenient location.When calling for airport pick-up, it would be most helpful if the hotel assistant would please be specific as to which van to look for.   A contract van for several hotels was used with very little logo to identify a L.Q. pickup.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Newly remodeled, but minimal customer service.","Arrived mid afternoon and was greeted by desk attendant, & directed to room. Asked for 5:00 airport shuttle &was put on 4:30 list (unbeknownst to me).  Room was clean & comfortable. Got 4 am wake up call. When we arrived at the lobby at 4:45, we discovered we’d been put on the wrong shuttle list and it had already departed. Thought we’d grab a muffin & juice while waiting for the next shuttle, but there was nothing out on the breakfast bar. So much for free breakfast.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,great,"couldnt have asked for better service they had clean and comfortable beds, the ladies at the front counter we so helpful they even had a take out menu for me since I dropped off my car at rental earlier, Shuttle service was fast and friendly",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great overall, but a couple of problems","Everything was great EXCEPT the key cards had to be reset twice, and I could hear into the adjacent rooms. I could hear people's phone conversations as if they were next to me. Thankfully, I brought a portable Bluetooth speaker and used the fan app on my phone to block any noise at night. Otherwise, I would not have slept.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel!,"Very bright and airy hotel, clean, and quiet. Loved the spacious and nicely decorated room. Bed was a little firm for my taste, but not hard. Appreciated having the fridge and microwave in my room. It's next door to Ruby Tuesday, which made it easy to walk over to for dinner. I will definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Relaxing end to a rough day,"Long but productive business trip was over and my boss and I schlepped to DIAro return home. Only, the flight got canceled, and the airline said our comfort that night wasn't their problem. To make matters worse the hotels my boss thought to call first were booked, as it was a Friday night. I called LaQuinta. The shuttle was slow getting us, but not terribly. The staff at the hotel were awesome, treating us to a welcome and assuring we got a wakeup and a shuttle just as we needed. Plus the hotel is really well appointed. The lobby is very classy and new, and the rooms were comfortable and very well maintained. This hotel was just completely reno'd earlier this year and it shows it. The area is very quiet, with a few restaurants but not much else besides other hotels. I will definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Quick mini vacation,The facility was redone in January 2018 and it still has the new appeal.  Rooms were very clean as well as the bathrooms.  Lobby was nice and big.  Indoor court yard was nice and relaxing.  Facility is smoke free although smoking is allowed in the courtyard.   More than once we refrained going to the courtyard due to numerous smokers in the area.  It is a very nice courtyard,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great La Quinta, but lacking customer service","This is a very nice La Quinta, clean and new. The rooms were clean and large, with a large bathroom. Stayed here as I had two dogs, and they never charge extra for them. Only had a few complaints.  First, the breakfast was not great.  Second, even though I called 2 weeks in advance to reserve a ground floor room for the dogs they put us on the second floor.  Luckily my dogs are not spooked by elevators, or it would have been a problem. Need to make better notes for specific customer requests.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Mile High Quality,"Great value, airport shuttle, nice walking area. Restaurants within walking distance. Nice common area with large screen TV and seating. Front desk personnel were friendly and helpful with directions.",5

Convenient to airport.  Shuttle Service fine. Nice grounds around back of hotel.  Lobby area for sitting is pleasant.  Would stay again if flying out of Denver airport in the morning.  Breakfast was fair.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful!,"Haven't stayed in an LQ in a while but was pleasantly surprised with this experience.  This chain has really come along!  Wonderful experience, clean spacious rooms, no hassle check in or out; courtesy vans from DIA, excellent breakfast offering, quiet and welcoming.  My only complaint is they advertise themselves as a smoke free property, but when I went out to the veranda in the morning for some fresh air and coffee the smokers drove me back inside.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Business Travel,"Needed a site close to the airport. La Quinta DIA fit the bill nicely. Clean room, helpful and friendly staff. They set up the breakfast counter early for the folks that have to be at the airport for those early flights.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Love the renovation, but...","I’ve stayed at this La Quinta before.  It’s quite convenient if you have early/late flights out of DIA.  The shuttle is reliable and the ability to park your car here is quite handy.  I loved the renovated look.  The lobby is more welcoming, and there’s lots more seating at breakfast.  However, we stayed during a bizarre night that had some unruly guests.  We endured about 2 hours of yelling/talking before it got quiet enough to get some sleep.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Front Desk incompetence lets this really great (value) hotel down,"Denver International Airport Hotel has usual LQ layout w back yard. Room spacious, place clean and modern, WiFi good and all amenities as expected. Decent breakfastand breakfast/cleaning staff courteous and professional. Negatives - Front desk a big let down. Check-in despite booked online hold to card and LQ membership took over 20 minutes. Despite payment no receipt or invoice provided, including on check out when it was specifically requested. Front desk unable to advise where to walk in basic area.Membership wrongly shows booking cancelled and no reward points so continuation of front desk incompetence. Gym aircon turned off with key lock box to its controls so at 11am expected to work out in heat-box.",3

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Stay,"We had a very enjoyable stay at this LaQuinta location.  The hotel was very clean and up to date.  Our room was very nice and comfortable.  Location is close to the Denver Airport, the reason for our stay.  Also close to eateries.  The pool and hot tub was clean.  We had to leave early so we didn't get to take advantage of the continental breakfast, but at 5am they did have some food available.  We really enjoyed our stay and if we are in the area ever again, we will definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Saved by LaQuinta,I wrote an awesome review on the previous page but was then taken to the Trip Advisor page to write another.  There is no way I can duplicate my first writing.  The place was awesome.  The 24 hour pool and hot was a lot better than the 7pm lol shutdown we had in Vegas at another place.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,too much money for what you get,"We arrived very late at night.  No elevators working.  Hauled our own bags up the stairs only to find out our key cards didn’t work.  Finally got in the room - TV didn’t work, so desk staff had to come into the room at 2 am to reset.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Best of the budget hotels,"La Quinta At the Denver Airport is clean with modern/updated decor in rooms and lobby. Airport transportation was on time. Price was good that night. I have stayed across the street at the quality inn for more $$ and La Quinta is much nicer. Nice garden patio area in the back, however it was occupied by smokers. Breakfast was uninspired but good for a few calories.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,LaQuinta DIA,"Beautiful grounds. If you call and book through their agency you will get mis-quoted on the price.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Terrible front desk and shuttle service.,Terrible front desk and shuttle service. Travis was extremely rude and highly unprofessional. Shuttle took two hours to pickup from the airport. Travis told us it wasn't his fault and demanded that we contact the shuttle company ourselves and then threatened to cancel our reservation. Highly unprofessional.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Refrigerator Noise,"Room 327 had a very loud refrigerator. Made it very hard to sleep, which is rather key for a hotel that caters mainly to those using Denver International Airport. Otherwise, the new decor, the size of the room, the bed and bathroom where all very nice. If only we could have done what we really came to do, which was sleep before an early flight.",3

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,It was ok,"Stayed here with the family.  It was just ok.  Staff was not very friendly or attentive.  The breakfast could use some work. Same things every day. Eggs, sausage, and waffles. Will not stay here again. Pool was good. Hot tub was nice.  Had the do not disturb sign on the door for 3 days, took it off the 4th day so we could get clean sheets and clean towels. They totally dismissed our room. Though the day after that we had the do not disturb sign on the door we only had one more day to stay so we decided not to have them come in and clean.  Housekeeping put a note over the do not  disturb sign saying that ""We see that you had the do not disturb sign and could not come in to clean"".....duh, we had it off the day before.",3

The staff was not the best not really friendly or helpful at late check in or when questioned about why you could not key in from outer doors.

My husband called again to let them know that the room was NOT clean and they ended up sending a maintenance man.  Now we’re confused, the maintenance man is confused and we still have a dirty room.  So the maintenance man takes the trash and apologizes and says I’ll go get somebody up here.  30 mins. later a housekeeper arrived and whipped our room into shape.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"La Quinta, Again",We've begun to make it a habit to stay at the DIA La Quinta when leaving Colorado.

This is an easy one, clean lobby, cookies at check in, courteous staff. Only complaint, looked like someone emptied their razor into the sink and didn’t clean it out. AC unit a little loud but they always are. Super close to airport so for the quick overnight stay, it’ll work",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Horrible Hotel!!!!,"The AC unit didn't work, I had to sleep with a window open and hear the constant air traffic and street traffic. I was with a large group, they seem to have all experienced this same problem. The floor above me didn't have hot water. The breakfast was disgusting, cold, and not well maintained by the staff. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. The only good thing is it's proximity to the airport. I would NOT recommend this hotel!!!!!!",1

Other than that.....it is a very nice place to stay.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Exceeded Expectations,"Great service, building, and rooms are beautiful.  Best LaQuinta I've ever stayed at!  I'm thinking it's a newer hotel but it was great!  Inadvertently made reservations through Reservations.com.  I know, I was deceived.  They got the reservation wrong but I called the hotel before we arrived and they sorted it all out.  I will only call the actual hotel instead of booking online from now on.  Thanks, La Quinta!!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Not so great, but adequate","There were strips of the curtain missing, that was kind of unwelcoming. The worst parts were the shower: the tub was so clogged that taking a shower involved standing in a foot of water. Also, the people in the room above us sounded like they were dropping furniture all night. Very noisy.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very handy 'stay and fly',"Newly renovated and clean, comfortable accommodations.Shuttle to the airport around the clock made it easy to 'stay and fly'. Checked pricing at several motels, and this value was by far the best! Would definitely stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver Airport,"Nice place to stay when catching next day flight out of Denver. Nice hotel at a moderate price within walking distance to a couple of good eating places.  Rooms are well appointed, breakfast is pretty basic.  Shuttle to airport is very timely and efficient.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,night before Seattle trip,We enjoyed our stay and especially being able to leave our vehicle while we were gone.  The rooms were clean and comfortable. The proximity to the airport and the shuttle service made it very convenient. We would definitely recommend this La Quinta to anyone needing to fly out of DIA especially early in the morning.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Paper thin walls and no hot water,"Beautiful renovations but the i could clearly hear the entire conversation of the guests next door at 2am.  Also, I had no hot water for my shower.  The rooms were nicely done so I don't know why they did not invest in noise cancelling walls.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,one problem after another,"coming home from a Mexican vacation we called the hotel to see where to go to catch the shuttle.  In an hour and a half time the shuttle NOT ONCE came past where 10 of us including a very tired 7 month old infant  were told to stand.  We made 3 phone calls to the hotel and ended up taking two taxi's to the hotel costing a total of $80.00.  While checking in late that evening a customer came up wide eyed saying she had been stuck in the elevator closest to the lobby.  The employee said her apologies and said they forgot to lock the elevator since it wasn't working properly.  Again thank heavens it wasn't us with a baby along.  We walked to the far end of the hotel to get on the functioning elevator to go to our rooms on the 3rd floor.  As luck would have it, our son in law was having stomach problems and needed to get into the room.  Our daughter unlocked her room finding a uniform of an airline employee, we think the individual was in the bed sleeping, I opened my door across the hall and found a lady eating from a to go box with a german shepard at her feet.  Scared the heck out of her and me.  I made our apologies as our son in law ran to the stair case and hurried to the lobby rest room.  The employee at the desk made apologies and gave us new room keys.  I am glad that the woman was clothed and that the dog was not protective and bite my leg off.  Needless to say, I think our next trip we will find a more reliable hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Waiting in the cold,"I stayed at La Quinta on a return trip from FL in Feb. It was the least expensive and I based my choice on that and it's location. The hotel shuttle from the airport was run by Western and didn't say La Quinta on the side plus we stood out in the 10 degree weather for 20 minutes waiting for the thing. The room was ok, seemed clean, although the entire facility is definitely in need of a face lift. It certainly isn't fancy but it was reasonably priced and came with a basic breakfast.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great to start/end a Denver trip,"The hotel was clean, rooms stayed warm and cozy and far enough from the airport not to hear too much noise. Stayed on arrival and departure...both great.  Airport shuttle does not always say LaQuinta, which cost me a cab ride for $30, but when I did use the shuttle after figuring out how to spot it, the shuttle service was excellent.  $30 cab fare for a 4-mile trip was a learning curve, but I also never called to inquire about what the shuttles actually ""look like"".  Anyway, it was a great stay and we will be back there for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointed,"I've stayed in many La Quinta's before and this one in particular two other times.   I was completed disappointed in the entire property except for the front desk staff.  First room unacceptable, no bedding provided for sofa bed and the King Suite did not have a separated bedroom, but a glass partial partitioned wall. Second room, better, but sofa bed still not made and missing mattress pad.  The king bed had the worst mattress I've ever encountered in any hotel.  Breakfast room extremely chilly and food mediocre. I've had better at McD's.  It was an embarrassment to me as I had bragged about how I can rely on the quality if LQ.  A huge letdown.",3

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to fly from,This is a great place to leave your car while you travel. The airport shuttle can be as long as an hour 30 minutes to pick yo up from the airport though. Please review the process with them to expedite,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Ok Hotel,This looks like it was a very nice hotel when it was new however the age is starting to show and it looks like it's not being maintained properly. The bathroom facets were leaking and the tub was fill of water. The ceiling in the lobby had water stains and some of the tiles were missing. A few doors didnt close all the way and there was poor patch and paint jobs all over. The Continental Breakfast was not as good as other hotels I have stayed. But it was very clean and the staff was very nice. I will probably try a different hotel in the same price range next time,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great stay before flight,"Shared a 2 bed suite with my sister before flight out the next morning.

For the most part, they are updated, excellent places during a business trip.  The LaQuinta at Denver airport, however, is a stand-out.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta hitting on all cylinders with this remodel,"Well, this is what it looks like when an older property undergoes a flawless remodel.  Congrats, La Quinta!  The room was just beautiful and rated up there with the four-star and rare five-star accommodations we try for (if we can get a reasonable deal).  Room fixtures, furniture, carpet, paint and hallway carpet/paint really well done and flowed together into  a very, very pleasant experience.  Staff very nice and competent at check in and out, but that's all the contact we had with them.  We didn't partake of the breakfast but it looked ok--was close by the relocated front desk so we saw it at check-out.  Looked like standard breakfast items.  Just there for a night, but we usually look around at pool and gym anyway for future ref.  They looked nice.  Was worried about soft bed at first then saw that it was just soft top to mattress and when lying down made for firm, good night's sleep. Recliner was nice touch to stretch legs after drive down from mountains.  See note at bottom on bill error that got fixed quickly.  We have been in/out DIA maybe dozen times in last couple years.  Glad we took a chance on this one and will bookmark it for future trips.  A few minor nits:  --lobby/checkin had been relocated somewhat at tail end of remodel (rooms already completed, though)--no big deal -- shower on/off had been left in ""on"" by prior guest or h.k., so got a surprise cold start to shower--my bad, but I don't take contacts into shower (ha). -- fridge worked well for our cokes and wine, but was little unlevel so rocked when opening/closing door--bet maint. could adjust the feet underneath -- on checkout, did not notice had been charged higher rate than quoted on senior rate last June; reported it few days later, forwarded them my June confirmation email, and they got difference credited to my card promptly, so cannot complain",5

TVs did not work in my room, nor 2 other rooms of people that were staying in my class.  The AC/heating unit is horrible and the room goes from freezing cold to burning hot and back again within minutes throughout the whole night.  The beds and pillows are horribly uncomfortable.  The first 2 nights in a row my trash was not changed and was overflowing.  There was one day when there was no breakfast set out.  I travel a lot for business, and I can say this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Gross sheets...horrible hygiene ,"Upon arrive staff was nice. When we arrived at our room and lifted our sheets back, we found at least one stain on every section of the bedding (fitted sheet, sheet, comforter & duvet) ON BOTH BEDS in our room. So after contemplating calling, we did politely and only asked to have a change of sheets. We had to ask her to go back twice because she didn’t bring us correct sets of sheets (extra pillow cases instead of sheets). Then the new sets were stained too! I politely pointed this out to which she replied “sexy” (obviously joking about this). I am not an unreasonable person, but I do expect clean sheets or a fix for these continuous problems. We did not ever get unstained sheets or anything for all this trouble.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay at hotel,I was very happy with where the hotel is located & it was right next door to a couple of restaurants. The staff was very friendly & my daughters loved the cookies at night.  The room was clean & spacious.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport preflight stay over,"Great place for staying at and being shuttled the next day for a flight.  The breakfast was tasty, yet simple.  They front lobby was being remodeled so the room they used was temporary and small.  Our suite worked well with family.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,DIA LaQuinta,I enjoyed our stay - clean room and apparently being renovated.  Décor is classy.    I do wish you'd reconsider asking for reviews from clients who have completed a positive review - I seem to have done a couple already.  We like LaQuinta..  Thanks.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A week A away from Home,"We stayed at this Hotel the week of Thanksgiving for our Anniversary. I was greeted by the young lady at the desk, check in was a breeze. The room was clean and had a great view to the mountains.Beautiful bathroom and very spacious room, we didn't feel like we were in each others space while in the room.  I believe they were doing some work on the lower level of the hotel but we never heard any noises which was a plus for us we wanted to relax the whole week. Breakfast was served daily with hot and cold items everything was clean and good. We will definitely book again when we travel back.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Loyalty Customer,"I am a La Quinta Rewards Elite member so I have stayed at a variety of La Quinta Hotels. La Quinta Denver DIA needs to work on their customer service skills. Glad to see the upgrades in the rooms and eventually through out the hotel. The rooms are clean, free wi-fi, and complimentary shuttle service to airport.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Excellent, 5 star if were not remodeling","We drove to Denver and stayed overnight so we could fly to Mexico the next day.  Hotel was very nice with large rooms, clean and nice amenities.  We chose this hotel because we could leave our vehicle at the hotel lot and get a free shuttle ride to the airport.  The convenience of being able to shuttle to the airport and leave our vehicle at the hotel while we were away was fantastic!!  Even though we left early morning before breakfast they still had muffins and fruit out already so we could grab and go.  They were great at providing warm cookies, water and coffee when we arrived.  Super nice staff.I would give this location a 5 star but the were in the middle of remodeling the lobby which made it a bit confusing when you arrived as to where to check in at.  Also the elevator and lobby access was blocked so you had to walk around outside to get to the front desk.  Well marked directions but and inconvenience.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,always enjoy my stay,"Have stayed at this property a few times when flying out of DIA .  However this time we chose to stay at this property on the Thanksgiving weekend as part of our short ""mini-vacation"" only a few hours from home. Although this property is under construction currently , the stay was still very pleasant.  The front desk staff rate a thousand kudos in my opinion for how friendly and customer service oriented they were on a short staffed holiday weekend. The indoor pool and hot tub were ofcourse a huge hit with our young grandchildren .  This property is very pet friendly which was also important to us.   My only recommendation is that it would be nice to have the usual type of book(s) in the room that tell about the facility and nearby area.  With the construction , this property was not up to it's usual on ambience in the lobby and breakfast/ front lounge area / main level restrooms, however the staff clearly did the best they could under the circumstances of dealing with major construction.   I will certainly continue to utilize this property.   The housekeeping staffing was greatly decreased on the Thanksgiving holiday itself, therefore we did a bit more ""self service"" than normal, however the staff that was present were all without exception friendly, professional and top notch.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice.,Enjoyed the hotel and staff greatly. It's being renovated and will be even better in the future. Will definitely stay again when we need to stay at DIA.  A good value and convenient to good food and services.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,On the way to DIA,"Stayed overnight for an early morning flight out.  The room was super.  Clean, spacious, everything was perfect.  Breakfast was the standard fare, but the staff was very attentive and checked regularly to make sure all the items were full.  They have a shuttle to the airport and parking for your car (@ $10. Per day)",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Breakfast Room Recognition,Rosa did a great job keeping up with the breakfast crowd to assure that we had a hot breakfast in a clean environment.  The hotel has a shuttle to the airport which is close by. Driver very professional and friendly.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excelle,"Important was for me to have a Shuttle Service and  being able to leave my car at a safe place. Difficult was to find the place at  DIA  where I had to meet the shuttle bus for La Quinta Hotel . Finally I found the right Island.  It would have helped to have a voucher or information when I checked in, about  where the pick up is when I had to return to La Quinta to pick up my car. (It was in the middle of the night!).  But now I know .....and all in all it was a good experience, so that I would recommend la Quinta and also use it again for my family .~~~",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Average stay,Hotel in the process of major renovation.  Hopeful completion will improve the pleasure of the experience.  Wake up call did not come.  The building was very much in run down condition.  Staff tried. Transportation to Airport on time and outstanding.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Unhappy Guest,The hotel was run down - it was dirty in the common areas - breakfast was not appetizing - I was not informed renovations were being done on the lobby - the guest printer had no ink and none was available to fill it - my bed covering was stained upon arrival,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Room nice/ Services did not meet expectations,System was down and they were unable to check me in until an hour after I showed up. The printer did not work. The elevator did not work. And breakfast was lacking considerably for a $175 room. The room itself was very nice.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Overnight stop before collecting hire car. ,"After a long haul flight chose here to bed down before collecting a hire car the next day.On arrival found there is still rennovation work ongoing and the main entrance has moved.Reception Staff welcoming and polite, first impressions very clean.Got to room which was huge, had a microwave and fridge and all the usual. Bed comfy, room lacked for nothing. Very little noise from the nearby road.Breakfast in the morning was standard US style. So tempted to try the waffle machine but thought nope, don't need the extra calories 🤣.Free hotel shuttle bus was used both ways couldnt fault at all.If in the area again would defo use again and recommend  to others..",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice design/comfortable accomodations,"One of the nicer LaQuinta's I have been to. Freshly renovated - ,clean with nice features - quartzite counter tops, indirect lighting in bathroom, pillow-top bed. New-looking, soft, clean and absorbent towels, fresh looking bedding.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay as you prepare to fly out,We use the LaQuinta when we have an early morning flight or a late incoming flight or bad weather to fly out or in.  We have been doing this for years. It is our go-to place for DIA. Also love the military discount.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very good and getting even better,"I have stayed at this hotel multiple times in the last 4 months , I have seen  improvement in every aspect , the hotel staff is amazing , always friendly and always accommodating ! The hotel's lobby  is being renovated at present time.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Needed a clean safe place to stay.,Took my granddaughter and her friend to see a concert at the Pepsi Center.  Everyone from the front desk to the housekeeping department couldn't have been nicer. The room was excellent. Very clean and comfortable.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Unpleasant stay and customer service,"Unpleasant stay and very poor customer service. I had to wait in the lobby / dining room area during construction before being allowed to my room. Check in staff had my card on file. However, I clearly mentioned that another card would be used for this visit before arriving. They made me wait in the lobby for more than 20 minutes before I could go to my room. Poor service for military veteran.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Overnigjht before an early flight,Convenient location next to Denver's airport. Handsome new refurbishment presents welcome and uplifting impression. Rooms are expansive and new with baths offering ultra clean and modern finishes. Fair pricing. Great parking. Good value.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good experience!,"This hotel is conveniently located to Denver International Airport and offers a ""stay and park"" option and rate.  The service was excellent, and the room accommodations clean and comfortable.  Very friendly service.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport stay,This hotel was good. They were undergoing construction during our stay. The hot tub jets did stop part way through the use. They offered breakfast early which was nice since we had an early flight to catch. We let our car there and took shuttle to airport. It was easy to catch shuttle back to hotel after our vacation out.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Charged twice for room,My partner and i had planned this trip to include a stay at LaQuinta DIA..as we had an early flight in the morning. I had made the reservation thru Priceline..and when we checked in- the staff acknowledged that the room was pre-paid- however- asked for a card for any incidentals...they charged my account for the room..not happy..now i have to spend my time & money getting a refund.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice,"Just about done with their remodel. This LaQuinta is one of the nicest we have stayed at. The bed is so comfortable, towels soft, the remodel of the room is tastefully done. Shuttle to and from the airport is convenient.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Experience,"Excellent accommodation's for the price, although there was construction of the lobby but that is to be expected when you are upgrading a hotel.   Enjoy that it is close to the airport and easy to park.  Also close to restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great stay,"How many rooms have a recliner?? I can't stand watching tv or reading in bed,  so this was a wonderful surprise! The bathroom was actually lovely, with a mirror that didn't fog. Spacious. Would book here again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,My Review,It was very nice.  We had no problems and would stay there again.  We were very glad to find a Ruby Tuesdays within walking distance.  It is very convenient to the Denver airport .. we had no problems getting there early in the morning.  Parking was good.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Newly remodeled rooms,"New rooms are very nice. As expected for a hotel primarily catering to airport transit the hallways can be noisy due to late check in/ early check outs. A bit of an issue getting in and out right now due to the remodeling og the lobby, but the staff handled everything very well. Great staff.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Was very Pleased,"The remodeled rooms were very nice & well done . They are still working on the front of the building & lobby , but after staying in the remodeled room I'm sure that it will be great when finished . I will stay here the next time I visit Colorado.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Expected Better,"Keeping in mind that the property was going through renovation of some sort, the rm was nice, clean and we slept well.  However, as mentioned on the survey, there was no breakfast, we had given ourselves time to eat & get ready to travel before leaving your property. didn't work out. Breakfast was not served on time, with a # of other guests waiting in the breakfast area for breakfast that had not arrived when we left @ 615AM.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Close to DIA,Partner was flying in on an evening flight and we were both flying out the next morning so it was a great  location for trips to and from Denver International Airport. They do offer car parking while you are gone but you must contact the hotel directly. Rooms recently remodeled.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,LaQuinta Denver Airport,Great hotel with nice room.  Shuttle service to airport was on time.  I was very pleased with my room and its location to the airport.  Ruby Tuesdays is in walking distance for dinner and lunch.  I give this hotel 5 stars.  Hotel staff was very nice.  Made sure I had everything I needed for my stay.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Don't book until renovations completef,"see comments above.  Service was below par, mainly due to renovations and Staff trainees.Plumbing was also a problem...running and noises toilet.  Trying to submit this response. But system not accepting comments. Another frustration.. c W at. Another",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Love LaQuinta,"As always, our stay at any LaQuinta, is pleasurable!  Everyone was pleasant, and everything was clean. Only drawback was this location is undergoing a renovation, and finding the front desk was a little tricky. I try to stay at LaQuinta every time I travel!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Worst Hotel Experience Ever!,"Had a reservation for a king room with the instruction that we would be arriving on a late flight from the East Coast.  Arrived at the hotel at 12:30 am and had to wait ten minutes behind two other parties.  When our turn came, we were told there were no King rooms,  We responded that room type didn't matter.  After ten minutes of the hotel representative looking at sheets of paper and comparing them to the computer screen we asked if there were ANY rooms.  She replied that she didn't think so, but she was going to go check.  She came back and told us no.  We asked if she could find us a room at a nearby hotel (making it clear we didn't have a car).  She called a few places with no success until she found a nearby property with availability.  This property was $70.00 more per night than the price we had been quoted for La Quinta.  We asked if La Quinta would pick up the difference.  She called the manager at home who, judging from the way the conversation went, said no.  The representative then made another call to a hotel that had a room and (great news) it was cheaper.  We were told it was just down the road.  We headed out on foot carrying our luggage.  It is now 1 am (we had been up 21 hours at this point).  The ""just down the road"" ended up being a mile on a four lane road with no lighting and no sidewalk.  Luckily our bags were not that heavy, we are physically fit and we were wearing comfortable footwear.  The whole experience was beyond believable.  If it hadn't happened to us, I won't believe customers could be treated so poorly.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Under construction,Had we known this hotel was under construction we would not have stayed here.  Room was nice and very clean.  Noisy old heat system noise was aggravating.  Inadequate staffing.  Non existent lobby with a matching breakfast.  Previously stayed here and always pleased.  Very disappointed.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,The best is now way ahead of the competition.,"First let me say I have stayed at this hotel since it was the only hotel out on tower and that goes back a lot of years.     I stayed in room 302 and this room was outstanding .  The rooms are all remodeled and they look fantastic.  Better than the competition,Also I want to address value that some gave low marks.   If you book a room the day of the stay you are going to pay more and I checked last night and this was one of the least expensive in the surrounding 10 hotels for 2/9/2017.If you want to save even more join AAA, LQ returns, and book 2-3 weeks earlier.    The glass divider in the room makes it even nicer in the suite very cool design and remodel.   Secondly the free breakfast is like all hotels too many carbs for a diabetic or those on protein diets.     Room is quiet, 302 and staff has been excellent.   JOy checked me and did a super job.All the staff has been friendly, professional and quick to respond.Thanks LQ for a very restful stay.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Still great under construction,Hotel was under some construction during my visit.  The exterior and lobby were still under construction so they had a detour from the front door. They still offered a continental breakfast.  They had  beautiful remodeled rooms.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Remodel in progress,"Hiccups occur with remodeling a property while still open for business. My review is regarding our room. Our coffee pot had not been cleaned out, it was bad. No fan in bathroom, which is a must to help control stream and odors. The elevator hadn't been clean for some time apparently. Attention to little details help during remodeling for the traveling public.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not a good surprise,"I have stayed at this hotel before and it was a good experience, but my last stay there...just may be my last. It was under construction and everything was a mess. It was hard to even find out where to get into the hotel. The tub leaked water and there were about three inches of standing water in the tub when I got to my room. I was not very impressed and felt that it was not the quality experience I should expect for La Quinta.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,The besst,"Even though there is a lot of construction going on, the staff and rooms are just right! Always professional and rooms normally excellently cleaned. Thank you for all you to make my stay worth it. I just wish they had told me that there was construction before I arrived... but either way.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,OK ... But Way too Expensive for One Night,"My family had an early flight from Denver, so we stayed at this location ... as it was the only LaQuinta site in the entire metro area that allowed long term parking. We checked a few other locations, just to verify the online information ... yepper, no other LaQuinta allowed stay and go packages, and most did not offer any shuttle service to the airport.Upon arrival to the hotel, the staff was friendly ... the rooms seemed comfortable ... and the overall experience was appropriate. However, for one night ... the cost was over a couple hundred dollars ... WOW! Considering that they were not responsible for any damages to our vehicle or theft, it seemed funny to be paying so much for a non-liability contract of sorts. Heck, I have stayed at other LaQuinta's in urban areas with stay and go packages ... for only an extra $20, with special parking at the back of the hotel.If we did this trip again, we would gladly park at the airport and pay the fee, which is less than the hotel fees. Plus, then we would not have to wait for the shuttle ... which by the way was late about 10 minutes for our pick-up in the morning.  Not a big deal for us, but another family and a Delta flight crew were visibly upset over the tardiness.Bottom line ... good hotel, with solid amenities.  For the price, though, go somewhere else in the metro area.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,a good hotel but poor house keeping,Hotel was good to very good except house keeping for our day to day room service was not up to the standard I would assume this hotel is use to giving.  Example we came back to our room on 9/19/17 to find the used towels were taken away but no new towels were left and we had no toilet paper so my wife went to the front desk area and found a housekeeper standing the who she was of work and could not help her so she had to get the person at the reception desk to get us the needed supplies.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Renovation,"While this hotel is under renovation, the staff and manager are doing a great job informing the guests and making arrangements to satisfy their needs.  I do feel this hotel is way overpriced for the type hotel it is.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,In renovations but quiet,Took me a while to find the entrance as they r renovating the lobby and other areas. I had to wait a few minuted as they were just moving the reception's computer from one place to another. Breakfast was at  the temporary  reception area the following day.  if you will be bothered by this  may be avoid it during the rest of September  17,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Avoid at all costs,"I stayed there for one night while traveling on business, the room had a bad smell, the furniture was filthy and felt sticky, I requested a ""non-smoking"" room and they put me in a room marked ""non-smoking"", but you couldn't escape the stale stinch of years of smoking, the bathroom was also filthy, the shower had hairs in it and on it, very disgusting, I'll stay in my car next time.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Overnight to visit friends in Denver and then fly home,"Stayed two nights at this La Quinta after 12 days of touring National Parks north of Denver.  Our room was remodeled and fresh.  Beds, linens and towels were comfortable.  Location was great for visiting friends and made car rental return and airport access easy.  Their hot breakfast has something for everyone, eggs, sausage, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juices, pastries and a waffle machine for hot waffles.  There are several restaurants in the area, to include a few you can walk to. Downtown is easily accessible--but like D.C. , avoid rush hour.  Staff was super friendly. Yes, we'll go back for pre-flight stay.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful Hotel,"What a great place to stay at. Wasn't too far from the downtown Denver/Aura area and was surrounded by other hotels. We stayed at a La Quinta the night before and wanted to try them out again since we loved their beds. Checking in was a breeze, I wish I remember the young ladies name because she was such a sweetheart. Made check in a breeze and even gave us a room on the top floor. Rooms were updated and I was nervous they would be noisy since they were close to each other but we had no issues. Clean, comfortable, and updated.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great for a layover or early flight out of Denver International,The room was nice and clean.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The is a restaurant next door..  Hotel is convenient to Denver International.  Some renovations going of out front and in lobby or I would have given it 5 stars.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta sticks it to hurricane stranded customers .. No compassion at this hotel!!,"We are currently staying at the hotel. 09/10/17. We where traveling back to Florida when the hurricane hit. We are stranded with Nothing! No luggage. No clothes. Have been sitting around the hotel for two days. Mostly praying that we have families and homes to go to...... We received a voucher from the airlines for a reduced rate. Tonight the hotel informed me that our voucher is only good for 2 days and if we want to stay tomorrow we would have to pay the 199.00 rate per night. Or take the shuttle back to the airport get another voucher and come back, all before check out of course.We do also have the option of finding another hotel..... We have no car, by the way.So needless to say I went on-line and found another hotel down the street. And my 70 year old mother, with a heart condition, and I are going to pack the couple things we do have and walk down the road to the Microtel Inn!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointing experience,"We are LQ regulars therefore had a expectation about this hotel which wasn't met.  The person who checked us in was un-welcoming, the bed was too soft and the bathtub either hasn't been renovated with the rest of the room, or was done poorly.  Otherwise, the décor was very nice.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel by the airport,"The accommodations were beautifully renovated. The room was modern, clean, and attractive. The staff was neglectful and would talk amongst themselves rather than the customers, but the place was very well kept and was a good value. But as a warning, they'll put away breakfast 30 minutes before the sign says it's over...so get there early!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,always a nice place to stay,"Hadn't stayed at this La Quinta in a while , while i was away they renovated the place, everything was new and clean, staff was on top of game, food was hot and tasted great, grounds where well cared for, no trash laying around, pool was clean, plenty of towels and deck chairs, fitness room had plenty of equipment,",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Tremendous Support and Accommodation,"This stay at the DIA Lq was a real boost during a very difficult trip. We arrived much later than we had originally planned, as our elder Cocker Spaniel had presented with Vestibular Disease (loss of balance/coordination) late the previous night. After a night in the Emergency Vet and carrying her in/out of the vehicle all day, we asked at check-in for a room near an easy exit/elevator. We didn't really expect a ground floor room at 8:30pm. But the front desk staff (who was swamped at that time) was so kind and accommodating.  After a 5-7 minute wait for my turn to check-in, with all 3 stations/attendants checking folks in, and each guest having requests, I didn't have much hope for our own. But the young girl helping me greeted me with a smile, heard my request and not only gave me the last 1st floor room, it was also just 2 doors from from an exit. It was such a pleasant surprise. Thanks Lq for being a gpreat place for pet owners.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Renovation provides nicer rooms,"We stayed here with our dog on the way out of town,  The rooms are spacious with new carpets and apparently new room furniture.  The bathroom was small and there was mold on the shower/tub tile.  The breakfast leaves very few options for people that want to eat healthy.  This property is better than your average La Quinta, but still is lacking in service, cleanliness and breakfast options.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good business option,"I stayed for 2 nights on a business trip.  Nice, clean, quiet and safe hotel.  Breakfast was biscuits eggs and sausage patties.There are 2 restaurants within 3 blocks walking distance as well as a 7-Eleven.Beds are big and comfy.  Rooms are big as well as the bathroom.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great deal in a great location,"Stayed here on a early flight overnight.  I wasn't disappointed!  What a great value!Clearly an older hotel that has undergone some renovations, but it was clean and comfortable.  The continental breakfast was well stocked and offered enough of a selection to cover most breakfast needs.  The shuttle service was prompt and super friendly. An added bonus is it's within walking distance to Ruby Tuesday's for quick and easy dinner grab.  Based on my one night here, I would absolutely stay here again.  It's not as ""fancy"" or ""new"" as the Hampton Inn, but for the cost, comfort and service I would say its a fairly comparable experience for a much better price.  On a side note, we had paid more to stay at the Days Inn on the arrival night.  Don't make the same mistake we did!!  This was a much better choice!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A Recommended Stay!,"We enjoyed our stay here.  Our vacation ended with a great nights rest that offered amenities that went above and beyond what we were expecting!  The staff was friendly and helpful, .and courteous, thank you for our wonderful stay and for caring for our families needs.  Our dog was treated well here., a very big Thank you  to tge staff at the Denver LaQuinta.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Business Stay,"overall ok. had construction noise throughout the day. noisy neighbors slamming doors, music way to loud for 2am. Staff at front desk seemed not very happy. Rooms were nice, had issues with air conditioning unit as it would blow cold air, then when room was cooled, it would switch to heat mode and heat the room up along with being loud when running so just shut if off. Might stay again",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Nice,"This hotel was close by the airport, clean, easy to find, and restful.   It was far enough from the highway that it was quiet.   The shuttle did not have any markings indicating La Quinta, but the driver did announce La Quinta at the pickup point.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Andrew is the man,"In all of my experience with La Quinta (and it's a ton), never have I had a better service than with Andrew. Fast, friendly, on the spot with my Platinum bag and helpful with someone new to the area. I don't know if he was just in a good mood, or if this is how he always is, but you'll absolutely see me back because of him.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful,Our family gathered in Denver for a vacation in Steamboat Springs. Staying at the airport allowed us to meet multiple flights. We are grateful to the amazing staff for all their help and support. The hotel was a very relaxing place to gather prior to driving to Steamboat.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Our trip to Disneyland,We had an early flight out of DIA on 7 August. We were taking two of our small grandchildren to Disneyland. We stayed overnight at  La Quinta Denver on Sunday night the 6th of August. They have a Stay and Go parking package. You book a night and leave your car and also book a return night when you come back. We had a very late return flight on 12 August. I was glad to have a room waiting for us.  This is the second time I have used this package. They also provided transportation from the La Quinta to airport and on our return flight transportation back to La Quinta. This package worked great for us!,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent Customer Service,"We always stay at this La Quinta when we are in the area.  The staff is very accommodating and friendly, the rooms are comfortable and clean, the kids love the pool area, and the garden area is charming.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Over night,The room was big. It got a little chilly so I turned on the heater then it set off the smoke detector off. The bed was like sleeping on plywood plank. The free breakfast was just a waffle maker toast and milk in the fridge with some apple juice and orange juice out of the machine. The coffee was like drinking hot water.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A GREAT place to stay,"Let me start by saying that I've been a La Quinta Returns member since 1994. I strayed at this hotel several years ago and that prompted me to return this trip.  Prior to my recent retirement I spent roughly 150 nights per year in hotels all across the country. This was the eighth night of a five week road trip and hotel number seven of sixteen different hotels we stayed in. Spacious room, clean, air conditioner too cold, even if it is set at 72.  Very well laid out room. Nice bed and pillows, nice shower, fridge and refrigerator in a beautiful custom made cabinet.  Nice and clean building with good parking.  They have complimentary  cookies in the afternoon. Nice breakfast.  Nice ladies in the breakfast room, constantly refilling everything that needs to be refilled.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stranded in Denver ,"We could not get outta town the day we arrived in Denver. FAA Control Center was down for the day, so we needed a place quick. La Quinta came to our rescue!Got a great room at a good rate.Loved their style. Lovely room. Their Arrival Staff could not be better. Well done!Breakfast the following morning was good. Great job on the shuttle too. Very convenient with excellent service.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Loud & Rude... Not the greatest of stays... ,"A week before our trip I reserved our room at this location. We were quoted a rate using our AARP membership. Upon arrival at the airport, the shuttle was waiting which was great. The gentleman was friendly enough and drove carefully stopping at other hotels to drop off along the way.  We arrived at the hotel and check in was quick. The girl at the counter with the big bun on her head wasnt very friendly but she wasn't overly rude either.  This location is under construction and thankfully so because that means they haven't addressed the elevator and soon will, Yay! - the elevator is gross! The elevator is dirty and outdated, it looks like an elevator at a big city parking structure. The hallways are long and of course our room was wayyyy down near the end... this is ok, I'm fit and love to walk but the redecorating is depressing; gray paint all the way, no art on the walls and black and purple casino patterned carpet...but the hallways are clean.  Our room was attractive, obviously redecorated, and nicely so. The bathroom is a good size with modern decor and nicely stocked (the bathroom tissue is a loose roll, no holder... it's weird) The bad thing that night was it took forever to get to sleep because 1) the light on the microwave is a blaring bright blue that lights up the entire entryway AND reflects off the wall mirror right in your face in bed... Nothing a towel can't take care of... But here's something a towel cannot possibly rectify:  until about 4:30 am we were treated to doors slamming, kids crying and screaming; dogs howling, growling and barking... Really?!  I have nothing against kids and dogs, I have kids and pets and they become agitated just because let alone traveling. But hotels, please... isn't there a way to accommodate appropriately?  When I reserve a room I'm always asked how many in my party and if there are kids what ages... If I have a pet obviously I'm going to mention this. With that said, knowing how kids and pets can be, can you not have a designated scream, cry, bark, growl, howl floor or section of a floor? So needless to say we didn't get much sleep and we had flown in for an appointment the following day that we were late to and very very tired at but if that wasn't enough when we finally did get up and get ready to leave we found that we had no hot water! Later on that afternoon around noon I called the front desk and asked for a manager, a gentleman transferred me to a manager's voicemail where I explained our experience so far. I left my phone number and today, four days later, I have not received a return phone call.  That evening when we returned to our room I called the front desk and spoke to a young lady by the name of Jiane, she was very stand-offish and not friendly at all!  I explained the situation, yet again and mentioned to her that I had left a message with the manager and received no call back. I mentioned that I felt that $152 a night was quite a bit for not having rested and for not having hot water. She offered to move us to another room, which was pointless since we were checking out in a few hours. She said, in her very stand-offish way that she would apply a discount. (at least I think that is what she said, she talks so low). Also, when we initially reserved the room the person who reserved the room told me that because we are Oregon residents and we are tax-exempt to be sure and mention that upon check-in which we did and the girl upon check-in told us that she had ""no control over that"" those were her words. She told us to return in the morning and provide ""proof"". I mentioned this to Jiane on the phone and she also told me that we had to provide ""proof"" that we are tax exempt in the form of identification. I told her we had absolutely no problem with that and the following morning we stopped at the front desk and gave her (Jiane) the proof she requested; she made a photo copy and when I had to ask (because she doesn't provide information) if she'd apply it, she said she would. She is even more stand-offish in person! What an absolutely boring, un-personable young lady!... She's not even nice, she has the personality of a brick, she barely speaks and when she does it's short, and really, really quiet. I feel for the hard of hearing that deal with her. We checked out later that morning. Today, I checked my credit card statement and not only was there not a discount of any type, but the rate I was charged was higher than what was quoted on the phone when I initially placed the reservation PLUS TAX!... And as of yet, no call back from the manager. UPDATE:  I called the front desk and spoke to a young lady named Rebecca. I explained all of the above. She read the ""notations"" on our 'account' and said that a discount will be applied. (whether she did it herself or Jiane did it, she didn't say, but whoever did it, thank you) She was very energetic, friendly and vivacious on the phone. She was understanding and concerned and profusely apologized for EVERYTHING and EVERYONE.  She said she'd leave a message for the manager. She didn't mention the tax exemption. (NOTE: we purchased a new vehicle on Thursday in Denver and tax exemption applied... What does that tell you? It shouldn't be such a big deal for a hotel - La Quinta in Westminster has honored it numerous times) Do I discourage you from staying here? NO, absolutely not: comfortable beds, good breakfast, near the airport, 24 hour free shuttle, pet friendly. Will I stay here again? No. We're retired and we travel quite a bit. Most hotel employees are friendly whether they feel they like you or not... They represent the hotel as the face that welcomes you when you walk in that door or when they address your concerns; we definitely did not feel welcomed. Why did I choose this location? I chose it because it is near the airport and provides late night shuttle service which we needed as we were flying into Denver to purchase a vehicle, therefore, we had no transportation upon arrival. Also, because the AARP rate was within our budget.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,July stay,Great stay as always. Never had any problems at any location and the rooms are always nice and cool when I arrive. Nothing worse than entering a hot hotel room in he summer. Slept like a baby and the wife was pleased as well.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Clean, friendly, hard to sleep well","The hotel staff are excellent and very friendly. The courtyard is nice to relax in. It was hard to sleep with all the random lights from microwave, click, huge gap under each door that lets in a lot of hallway light. I used towels to block all the lights to be able to sleep.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Third time wasn't the charm!,"Our most recent stay was the third time we'd used this hotel recently but this is the first review I've done of it.The previous two stays it was fine. I'd have given probably 4 bubbles, maybe even 5, for either of the first two stays.This last time everything was fine. Room had been recently redone, was clean, everything seemed ok, but.....When we returned from dinner at a nearby restaurant neither of the elevators was working. They had been fine when we checked in. I asked at the desk and was told that they wouldn't be repaired until the next morning because a part was not available and neither was safe to use. We are oldish with bad knees and hips so the elevator is more than an important convenience for us. When I told the clerk this she graciously comped us the room. Luckily we were on the second floor, and luckily the elevators were fixed after breakfast but before we checked out so we didn't have to hump our luggage downstairs.Then, about 10:30 p.m. my wife went to shower and the water was luke warm at best. Another call to the desk, and maintenance was sent. Maintenance came promptly and fixed the shower. It was a simple adjustment that allowed the water valve to open more fully and allow in more hot water. Took maybe 10 minutes to fix. I asked the guy why it wasn't properly adjusted and he said that it must have been overlooked 2.5 months ago when they refurbished the rooms. So either no one had rented that room in 2.5 months or other people like cold showers or are too lazy to complain.?When you look at my photos of the tub you will ask yourself, ""Why, why, did they make the rest of the room so nice and leave this worn, stained, and shoddy tub when they had refurbed everything else in the bathroom and the rest of the room???""Both of the times we had breakfast here the eggs were cold despite being in the typical warming dish.We are in and out of DIA somewhat frequently and always need a hotel before we fly and sometimes when we return. We are undecided about whether we will take another chance here or look elsewhere.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very accommodating ,"Check in was a breeze. Room was very spacious and beds were comfortable. We stayed 1 night before leaving for a super early flight. Their free shuttle to the airport runs 24 hr, just let the check in desk know what time you need. I think it runs every 30 minutes. Was very timely and got us to airport in less than 15 minutes. The business area was easy to use for printing our boarding passes. Despite the check in attendant, Stephen, being the only person working on a very busy night he was super  curteous helped us with all our questions and any amenities we needed. It's rare that you find an employee who doesn't complain or have even a single negative word to say when they are clearly swamped. We did not have time to utilize the indoor pool area but it did look to be nice and big. Lots of manicured grass areas with seating to sit and relax or have a friendly conversation in. Will be staying here again when back in the area.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice room,Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Room was spacious and clean. Noise was a bit of a problem. I could hear outside noise and hall noise quite clearly. There weren't enough condiments to go with the amount of coffee provided.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Kids love it!,"I live an hour away from the airport and the kids actually request this hotel due to the proximity to the airport, the pool (not to be understated) and the general nice attitude of the staff.  The price/quality ratio is just perfect.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good place to rest and repack before flying away from CO,"This is a new modern and very fresh hotel, many La Quinta are a bit aging, but this is a newly minted gem.  The bathroom had a mirror and countertop oh so cool, see photo.  The breakfasts are filling and good choices exist for a healthy start to your day.Great bus to airport included in room.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Really nice place near airport,We just needed a place to stay the night before  our flight. This hotel far and away exceeded our expectations. The room was huge and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was friendly. There is a free breakfast but nothing too exciting about that.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta is a good option at DIA,"Hotel was nicely refurbished, clean and comfortable at a reasonable price.  The breakfast is a bit under whelming but not bad.  Refrigerator was loud enough at start up to wake me up.  Grounds were very nicely maintained.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not too happy,"Stay somewhere each week as a rule. Not sure if I would stay at this location again. The elevators NEVER work at this location! No points, nothing off my bill... very disappointed! The last three times I have stayed here one or both of the elevators did not operate. Just not acceptable, especially since no one offered to carry bags up 4 flights of stairs for me!!",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent airport hotel.,"Very clean, comfortable rooms, near restaurants, 5 miles or so from the airport, great staff.  Has a very small gym and pool very nice.  Small courtyard that I walked in to get a little exercise outdoors.  Would use this hotel again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean,"Friendly staff, very clean room, warm cookies in the afternoon.  Room mostly quiet except for one noisy barking dog in room near us on the first night.  Did have to deal with broken key reader at back door do we had to walk back around to front if hotel to get back in after walking our dogs.  Hotel looks quite new inside.  Would stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,I have been coming here since it opened,"I was here along with six other people for a two-day business meeting. My room was comfortable and hospital-clean. The breakfast was excellent and included a waffle machine and eggs and sausage patties along with yogurt, fruit and cereal. The Sales Manager, John Webster, was very helpful with organizing our conference room and our catered lunches as well as reuniting me with my lost glasses. The front desk and the cleaning staff were very friendly and efficient. Altogether, it was a thoroughly pleasant stay",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,One night stay,Great hotel and price. Perfect for a night stay before early flight out of DIA. Would definitely book again. Had an airport shuttle available but did not use. Pet friendly a big plus. Warm cookies at check in counter. Great breakfast that started at 5am.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Consistently Good Experience,"This is my Go To hotel for safe, consistent, cost effective experience. Rooms and facilities are clean and well kept. Staff is very accommodating. Most La Quints's are conveniently located to public transportation.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Some cons but overall good,"The good: The hotel is very close to the airport and there are some dining options around.  It is a somewhat isolated area except for other hotels and apartments.  The hotel is undergoing renovation and we received a newly renovated room, in fact we were told that the wing where we stayed had been opened a few days before.  Paint, floor, bathroom, everything was brand new.  It was very convenient to have a microwave and a fridge.  Our room was facing the courtyard and it was very quiet.  Except for the renovation issues, the room was very nice.  The breakfast was convenient (coffee, juice, breads, waffles, oatmeal, apples, yogurt, etc.).The not so good: There were no vending machines in the vending room since it had been recently renovated, however; the front desk person was very helpful and gave us free water bottles and some snacks.  Our room had a strong smell of paint or some other substance used in the renovation; also, every surface in the room was covered in a white dust (also linked to the renovation).  We did tell the housekeeper, who was very gracious and told us that they've been trying to wipe the dust for days.  We didn't notice much of a difference later. The day we were leaving, the construction crew doing the renovation had a section of the parking lot cordoned off and we had to wait for them to move the equipment out of the way to access our car and leave.  There was no place to put soap, shampoo,etc. in the shower, other than the floor.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Will stay here next time we are in Denver,"Close enough to the airport, but far enough away that you don't hear the jets.  The Front Desk staff was very accommodating and moved us to a new room when we discovered that all the electrical outlets in the bathroom were not working.  Issue: The GFCI's were found to be already tripped and would not reset.The only con is the Housekeeping needs to be better or the recent renovations will be for naught.  Examples: Bed sheets looked like they were merely turned inside out, dust was on most surfaces, and container of Strawberries was found in our fridge. Renovation issues: Door sweeps on most of the 4th floor doors were missing where they were on the 5th floor and paint on the inside of the Bathroom double door in Room 410 was bubbled either by over paint or most likely by solutions used for cleaning.Again, we would stay here again and hope the property is as good as it was during our stay.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Superb,The room was absolutely wonderful. The staff pleasent and quick in their duties. Wake upmcall was made pefectly on time. I am definetely staying there in two weeks. The remodeling should be done by then.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great,"Booked a room, on line, had a cold,  ended up putting the wrong date in. Still, was given a room. Thanks!The was room was just great. The one wall behind the bed was deep purple my favorite color. There was no carpet, but tile that looked like wood. ( loved that).Wonderful amount of lighting. Very clean. I am not a modern person but this room was super nice.My only trouble was there was no tea bags, in the room.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,good for one night,"the rooms are nicely decorated, microwave, coffee maker. Bathrooms look a little beat up, but the big thing is that there is NO food, no vending machines, no soda machines. Good for a quick stay. The work out room is almost non existent, but was empty when I went so I was able to use the treadmill",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Enjoyable,"Rooms are large and clean.  We stayed here our first night after a long flight, and decided to book for our trip back home.  We arrived early and was given our room in minutes.  Very relaxing and even used the workout room and pool/spa.   There are several choices close by to have meals.  Staff is very friendly and polite always ready to help.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Short Trip,"We just stayed over night to catch an early flight. LQ is always our first choice, the price was right, location was perfect. Hotel has been updated rooms were nice. Our door to the room wasn't hung right, but no issues with locking or closing. They have attempted to update hotel, I believe it was good enough.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Birthday adventure ,"Stayed her with my cousin mid May I enjoyed my stay but the breakfast was less than desirable and the last day the hot water was out the location was perfect because was very easy to navigate  from , it's a quite hotel but comfortable I really can't say it was the best place to stay but I would stay there again",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Hotel,"We always stay at La Quinta, but this time we saw the nice renovation. The rooms look awesome, new carpet, furniture, paint, curtains, etc. The breakfast very good to start the day, very balance and delicious.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Rip Off Pricing,Convenience of staying by airport and being able to park car at LaQ while travelling far offset by pricing . I'm an Elite member  - no AAA or AARP discount allowed . Paid $50 more than I have ever paid to stay at a LaQ . Room was not carpeted . Staff was great .,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,My door doesn't shut?!,"We stayed here on the 18th of april, room 205. Brought all of our luggage to the room, went to leave the room to take a walk and our door didn't shut! You could push it right open. We tried shutting it several times, and even tried slamming it. Went to the front desk to ask for a different room, they were booked. They gave us 30 percent off for the night. How comforting to stay in a room where anyone could just walk in at anytime. Let alone not being able to leave the room without taking all of our belongings with us.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Okay Stay,"Kind of loud.  Redoing the rooms and we had to have someone come and hook up the television because it hadn't been done correctly.   Room had thin walls and was loud without the television to drown out the noise New decor looks straight out of the 80's with purple wall and crazy carpet.  If you just need a place to sleep before an airport visit, it was okay.  The shuttle was reliable and the breakfast was convenient.  Staff is nice.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Convenient, Clean, And Close To Airport","While traveling we often say at a La Quinta.  This La Quinta is convenient to DIA and has a shuttle starting, I believe, at 0300 hours. The price is reasonable, the hotel is in good condition, and our rooms as we stayed there twice, were in excellent condition with comfortable beds.  I found the staff helpful and personable.  The breakfast is typical La Quinta which is to say it is what I would expect of a La Quinta. In the future should I fly into/out of DIA, I would again stay at this location.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not as expected,"I stay at the Laquinta hotels when I can, I read the reviews before booking this week's trip in hopes the renovations had been completed. The staff was friendly and courteous, but as for amenities that I look for and as to why I choose Laquinta. The hot tub was out of service the entire stay, the fitness room appeared to be unexcessible due to construction. The rooms are very comfortable as normal and clean for the most part. I did not mention to management that the tun rails were not being cleaned because I had noticed the same hairs on the tub all week. The reason I didn't is as a customer I do not feel I should be required to notify hotel staff when their people are not doing an adiquate job.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Always a Friendly and Pleasant Stay,"We've stayed at this La Quinta many times and always, without exception had great service. The remodel is coming along nicely and we like the fresh, new look. Make sure you're in a room that has been fully inspected as some of the electrical was not working well in our room.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,First try--winner!,"Needed to overnight in Denver. A relative stays with this chain so I thought I'd give them a try. Was warmly greeted (thanks Trista) and given a room. Property has lots of free parking, free Wi-Fi, and free breakfast. It is under reno right now, but that's understandable and forgiveable. The room was nicely decorated and comfy yet modern. There's plenty of closet space, but limited TV channels. The neighbor's doors closing sound like they are slamming, so don't be too surprised when it happens at 5am. Otherwise the room is fairly quiet. All in all, a good stay and worthy of a repeat stay. Did I mention they have freshly baked cookies every afternoon?",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Recent updates make this a much better value.,"We have stayed at this La Quinta many times and I have reviewed it before.  But they have made so many changes that they deserve a new review.There were two issues I have had in the past and both have been addressed.  First they offer a fly/park option,  While it's a fair deal, they often ended up with so many cars parked at the hotel, you couldn't get a parking spot.  It happened to us once before where we had a room, but not a parking spot anywhere near the hotel.  Now they limit the number of fly/park customers so that you can stay and park at the hotel.  That is a big improvement.The second is major.  They are remodeling the entire facility.  The rooms were very dated the last time we stayed.  The carpet was stained, the walls damaged and the place just had a run down appearance and feel.  No more.  It is now very modern with all surfaces and plumbing fixtures replaced.  It feels and looks like a brand new hotel.The place is now very modern.  It is now a bargain as the finishes are that of a much more upscale hotel.  The rooms are large, the furniture new, and the place is very clean.  Heck, even the breakfast seems better.  I would not hesitate to recommend this La Quinta.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Hotel. Quick Stay,"Tried this hotel for the first time while in Denver because I had an early morning flight.  The hotel was easy to find, and had decent parking.  Big lobby with nice front desk staff that made check in easy.  Didn't have time to use much in the hotel as I was in and out but they did have some restaurants right next door that you could walk to.  This La Quinta was also undergoing renovations like the one I stayed in the night before in Grand Junction but its a nice upgrade. Nice carpeting in the hallways and the rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Would recommend if in the area.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Horrible,Stayed on the way out couldn't find my reservation for three rooms! On the way back got told one price then put on hold and rates got jacked 30 bucks per room!!!! Beware!!!!! Park and fly was good but the staff not so much and reservation people are incompetent!,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Easy convenient hotel,"Stayed at this hotel at the very beginning and the very end of a ski trip.  Lovely, clean accommodations and wonderful breakfast bar.  24 airport shuttle allowed us to return the rental car the night before dearture and take the shuttle - which makes getting to that 5:30am flight much easier!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Under renovation,Check on the status of the renovation before reserving.  We were in one of the rooms that had not been renovated yet and it was kind of old and dumpy. Will hopefully be better after the renovation is completed.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay & Fly,Nice convenient location for a stay-in-and-fly-out.  Hotel currently under much needed renovation; results look good.  Located on hotel row near DIA.  Two decent restaurants in walking distance. Fresh cookies in the evening.  Breakfast service starts early (5-ish).,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Robert: the best shuttle service experience ever!,I had the best possible shuttle service with Robert as my driver. He was absolutely pleasant and went above and beyond to make sure I understood where to go once I was at the airport. His driving was also very safe and it was the most comfortable experience. He then was picking up an elderly couple that he had dropped off a week or so before their trip to Hawaii and he had clearly established a good relationship with them the week prior. His kindness and friendliness was the perfect touch to an amazing time in Colorado. Thank you!,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Part of excellent trip support,Traveling?  A great place to stop before catching a flight from Denver International Airport.  Prompt and friendly shuttle to airport.  Supportive and friendly staff at hotel for any needs while traveling.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Good, clean rooms","I had a good overall stay here. I was greeted promptly at the airport by the shuttle. It was a quick ride to the hotel in a modern shuttle. Once at the hotel, check-in was fast and friendly. I was given a room on the top floor of the hotel. It was clean and relatively quiet, other than some noise from the hallway and the elevator by the room. The bed was of decent comfort. The shower was fine and had decent pressure and good temperature. I wish La Quinta's would give lotion as a bathroom amenity, though, especially in Denver's dry climate.Breakfast in the morning was plentiful and included eggs, a self-making waffle machine, and biscuits, yogurt, a variety of cereal, juices, and coffee. I was happy with the offering. The shuttle back to the airport was quick and easy. Overall, I had a good stay here, and would recommend this hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,good rooms after a long flight,"Rooms have coffee making and as seems usual in the US, a microwave.

I wish I had singles to tip the driver.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful stay!,Last-minute reservation.  Everyone was nice and hotel was clean and lovely.

We will definitely stay here when returning to Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay here when flying out of DIA,We like the LaQuinta at DIA.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great price,"Booked my room through trip advisor. Ended being through expedia to make a reservation. Upon arriving at the hotel it was never updated with the hotel. But the girl working at the counter took care of it with the exact room we reserved through expedia. Room was clean and comfortable bed. The prices were better here then the other hotels in the areas. Breakfast was nothing special, but that isn't the reason we stayed here. Great price and comfortable clean rooms. I would stay here again.The hotel also has a pool and hot tub.",4

The people are friendly and warm and it is a very inviting place to stay.  This facility is close to my work and a short hop to the airport.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Always stay at LQ!,"I only stay at LQ...it is the best!

I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in or near the Denver Airport. Staff was very helpful. Hotel was being renovated and will be lovely when fully complete.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Short but sweet,"The room was great. The attention to detail in the room was hands down wonderful. Asked at checkin about shuttle service - glad I did, because it runs often, but you must sign up for a spot on the van.  The driver was friendly and prompt.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Beautiful New Decor,"Wow the renovation of this hotel is spectacular.  We thought it was nice and not outdated before, but when we arrived the change since our last visit was spectacular.  New decor, new rooms, new bathroom fixtures and all!  Well done and relaxing.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,great,"the parking program  best any were in the world very liberal . The staff made me feel as if I was a regular with them . While sitting in the lobby I heard one desk agent address on man on his arrival by first name . Even though it was my first stay there I too felt like an "" old timer "" with them .",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Checked me out.,This motel will cause me to question staying at LaQuinta inns and suites. Between the poor upkeep of the facility and being checked out in the middle of my stay so I can be charged for a higher rate I am not sure If I will come back to this facility or not.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean the fitness area,"The machines in the fitness center have probably never been wiped down and judging by the water stains in the drinking fountain, the entire area is likely neglected. Common areas need extra attention.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,J. Dirksen,"Chose this hotel because of the location and they had a stay and park deal for the airport. Told front desk we needed shuttle at 4:00 am and they said no problem be down here at 4:00 am. We Got to front desk at 3:58 and no shuttle out front and NO ONE present at front desk. I had to go searching for someone to help me and then she said, your shuttle already left, it leaves promptly at 4:00 am! I was standing there before 4:00 am and there was no shuttle and no one to help. Stay somewhere else that has a more professional staff and save your self a headache and missed flight. Rooms are dated and not very clean and Bathtub was nasty and had hair left in it and mold around the tub in the caulking! Nasty!!! Will never be back here again! Not happy with his stay at all!!!",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great vaue,We stay at LaQuinta when possible.  Best value for the dollar and no hassle about our dogs. The rooms are always clean and fresh. Easy check in and out.  Pleasant surroundings especially at the Denver Airport property.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,airport convenience,"good location with easy access to airport, average accommodations but is pet friendly! Very noisy - be aware that if you have an early wake up time ask for a quiet location. don't expect much for breakfast but its something to get you going.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Overnight Stay,"Stayed here to take advantage of the shuttle to/from airport.  Front desk staff friendly and helpful.  Stayed in a renovated room that was large and very nicely decorated.  Room and bath were clean, the bed comfy and two nice restaurants within easy walking distance. Only drawback for us is the gap between the bottom of the door and floor which allowed hallway and neighboring room noise.  We could hear and understand most of the conversation from the folks across the hall and muffled TV noise from the adjacent room.  This was disappointing as we were in bed early due to an early flight the next day and it was hard to fall asleep.  Once the neighbors went to bed it was a quiet nights sleep though.  Doors could use some type of under door seal that would help with this issue. Breakfast was nice and filled us up before our flight (suggest setting out some mustard packets for making sausage biscuits).  Our overall stay was nice and we would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Lovely Hotel and Great Staff!,This hotel is a great choice if you need to stay in the DIA area. The staff was friendly and helpful and very fun to stop and talk with. The pool and jacuzzi are nicely maintained. This hotel is desperately in need of a recycling program and breakfast generates WAY too much trash but the food options are nice. We brought our own mugs/cups and utensils which is a wonderful option if you can plan ahead that way. The best thing about La Quinta is the option to bring our dog and for that we are very grateful. The refrigerator is a wonderful asset in the room too. We had a great time relaxing here! Thank you for being so kind!,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Cheerful front desk ladies,"The front desk ladies were cheerful when they checked us in.  It felt like a nice warm welcome. The room was clean.  The mattress was actually comfortable but soft. I prefer hard mattress.  So I slept on the very side of the bed, but gravity pulled me to the center of the bed. Bathroom is clean with hair dryer.  Breakfast starts at 5am on weekdays and 6am on weekends. They had variety of choices such as eggs, sausage, fruit, muffins, bagels, yogurt, waffles, oatmeal, variety of juices, etc. They had a van that took their guests to the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent,Great room and total package excellent. Booked by airlines due to weather. Staff very pleasant and helpful. The Internet service in my room was nonexistent and the staff contacted their provider to resolve the problem.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Tired hotel,"Shower was good, but bed was saggy and a bit lumpy; hair dryer did not work; breakfast was meager and unappealing. We stayed here when our flight was cancelled out of DEN; rate was good but hotel not so.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient location to airport,"Due to snow storm, I was stranded in Denver an extra day.  The hotel was comfortable and I appreciated being able to leave my car and shuttle to the airport.  The shuttle was on time and efficient both directions.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Clean, nicey decorated, close to the airport","My family stayed here during an overnight layover. The woman who checked us in was very helpful and friendly. The beds were comfortable, and the room was clean. It's a nice place to stay if you are stuck in Denver and want to be close to the airport!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Comfortable, Nice, Clean",We just did an overnight here on our way to Winter Park and it was very nice.  The breakfast in the morning was really good and we would stay at this location again if we had the chance.  The bed was super comfy.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Average Accommodations,"The DENVER - AIRPORT La Quinta is nothing to write home about. Overall it's not bad, but it's not great either -- and the breakfast leaves a LOT to be desired.  But if you need an affordable option that is less than 15 minutes to the airport, it works. However, be forewarned that the room doors are lacking in sound muffling qualities -- everyone who walks by sounds like they are in the room with you -- so if you're a light sleeper, it might not be the best option for you.   If you have the ability to do a short drive, the La Quinta Inn DENVER GOLDEN is much, much nicer (at the same or lower cost).  The drawback is that it's about 30-35 minutes from the airport.  But if that's not a concern, then it's a much better La Quinta to stay at.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,BEST HOTEL to park your car for a trip!,I love this hotel for parking our car when we go on trips of 4 or more days.   They have a park and fly rate that is completely reasonable. The ease of taking their airport shuttle to DIA and back to get your car when you return is GREAT!  The hotel offers a continental breakfast and the rooms are always clean and accommodating.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta near DIA,"We drove from Albuquerque to Denver and arrived at sunset. We were exhausted and after dropping family members at their DIA parking we needed a La Quinta without driving too far. When our iPhone said we were 5 miles from a La Quinta we were thrilled. The staff was friendly, a great restauranr was across the street and we fell asleep by 9 PM, cozy and happy.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,All basic needs met,The title explains what I look for in a mid-priced hotel The La Quinta was fair to us in a season where rip-offs abound. Thank you management and staff! NUMBER ONE COMPLIMENT A GREAT BED LINENS AND MATTRESS  This is so important to a couple that has a Beautirest Foam mattress at home.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A shelter in a time of storm,"We had a nice night stay at the Hotel and took the shuttle to the Airport.  Hotel was nice and clean and room was nice and warm.  Temp outside was in the teens and snow.  We left our vehicle parked there and when we returned, it wouldn't start.  The General Manager went above and be on to help us, even offering his car to try and jump start ours.    When we found out our vehicle was going to have to be towed to the dealership, he made sure we had a room available for the night.  And this was 2 days before Christmas.  The staff was very helpful and caring.  We will definitely stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel,"Hotel accomodated our vehicle parking while in cancun.

Returned 10 days later to room upstairs bed was stiff, staff stated they were in middle of remodel,  staff treated us great and hotel very clean.  Food good for the type.  Would def stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Welcome haven on Christmas Eve,"When a flight delay caused us to miss our connecting flight, Airport Accommodations put us up at La Quinta for the night (well, at least for a few hours!)  They sent a shuttle to pick us up.  We arrived late, cold, exhausted, and hungry, to an inviting lobby with a pleasant desk clerk.  Our room was warm, clean, and comfortable.  We had not eaten all day, had no transportation, nor any idea where to get something to eat.  The desk clerk provided us with options that could be delivered, and we were able to use the lobby computer to check out the menus before ordering.  We were also able to get butter, salt, and pepper from the breakfast area when none was brought with our order.  Then a wonderful hot shower!  (even though we had no clothes to change into).  Our early wake up call came right on time, and the shuttle arrived promptly at 4:30 a.m.  Even at that early hour, the shuttle driver was friendly and not grumpy, getting us to the airport on time and wishing us a safe flight and Merry Christmas.  I don't know about the breakfast, since leaving so early, we did not get to eat breakfast, nor use any of the other amenities.  But we definitely recommend this La Quinta to any other stranded passengers who need a place to sleep.",4

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Quiet, not pricey","It's a nice hotel that falls within someone's budget. The hotel needs some updating, but is in really good shape. The bathroom could have used a bit more attention with the cleaning, but overall we would stay there again.  Plus it's right across the parking lot from a Starbucks!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very comfortable,"I have stayed at this hotel at least 3- 4 times a year for the past 6-7 years.  While it is due for a renovation, I have always found it to the spotlessly clean, well maintained, and the staff is excellent.  I especially appreciate that La Quinta is pet friendly and this hotel has always been very accommodating of my pet needs; the cleaning staff was very considerate of my cats in their kennels.  The staff is very knowledgeable of local spots of interest and gave me very reliable taxi information.   I especially like the hotels location near to several restaurants and a convenience store, and the desk staff is always ready to give friendly advice on nearby spots to eat and drink.  My only fuss was that this past summer one of the elevators was out of order, and there was a shortage of luggage trolleys.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Ready for the remodeling ,"The hotel is still fairly nice and clean...but is ready for the upcoming renovations. The hotel front staff is excellent. The rooms are nice size. My only complaints are:1. The breakfast is exactly the same every morning (unlike similar hotels from other brands that mix it up a little each morning).2. The in room TV has limited channels...very basic offering of choices.On the plus side, it is very convenient to DIA and there are several good restaurants within a short distance.",3
