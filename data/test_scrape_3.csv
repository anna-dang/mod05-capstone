"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,WHAT A STAY!,"The Crawford Hotel was seriously the most unique and beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in. My husband and I decided to stay here for our honeymoon and it certainly did not disappoint. From guest services answering our every need and the Tesla valet courtesy car service especially with Jamel and Riley as our drivers was amazing!!!! I can’t really say anything bad about this hotel whatsoever. Super quiet, super cozy, and outstandingly beautiful and romantic!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anniversary Staycation,"Husband and I booked the B&B package for our 31st anniversary.  The hotel staff were warm, friendly, and professional.  Also I was able to update my reservation after a date mixup.  As mentioned by others in several reviews the hotel amenities are great and the rooms are beautifully decorated.  The experience overall was great with the exception of a few things:   1.  Being awaken early AM to loud noises which sounded like large doors being closed and metal clanging 2.  Couldn’t figure out how to order breakfast from Snooze as it was not featured as a category on the iPad.  Called the front desk and they placed the order for us (thanks)!  However by the time the food arrived it was very cold. 3. Upon checkout I sat in the great hall in the area reserved for hotel guests while I waited for my husband to return from the restroom.  We saw several people sitting in this area the night of our stay as well.  After about a minute of being seated, a security officer approached me and informed me that this area was for guests only and asked if I was a hotel guest of which I responded I was and then was asked to provide some sort of proof...hotel room number or key.  Since I had previously observed many others who had been seated there unapproached, I informed him that I wouldn’t provide him with such proof but that he could check with the front desk for verification.  After checking with the front desk he came back and apologized.  I understand the need to enforce the seating requirement however from my experience I felt highly offended.  Perhaps Crawford hotel could figure out a different way of enforcement.… waited for my husband to return from the restroom.  We saw several people sitting in this area the night of our stay as well.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Birthday Getaway,"We traveled from Emeryville, CA to Denver on the Amtrak Zephyr. It was such a pleasure to get to a real hotel and bed! Anna and Jen at the front desk were marvelous. They put us in a corner spacious room on the balcony level. I love this hotel. Second time staying here and will be back again. Awesome bathroom, shower,  and whirlpool tub. Minutes from multiple restaurants so easy walking even in cold weather. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A perfect staycation during the pandemic (and perfect for out-of-towners too),"We stayed at The Crawford the weekend before Thanksgiving to celebrate a 40th birthday and knew that with the pandemic most everything would be closed. So, we decided on a staycation to treat ourselves to some fancy and fun time away from home. The staff are so professional and accommodating, and special thanks go to Jordan (concierge) as she answered all our pre-trip questions, offered to schedule car services for us, and greeted us warmly in-person when we arrived. The amenities included in our stay made it fun because we got to take advantage of enjoying Union Station's full atmosphere (including the restaurants there that offer takeaway food and we even treated ourselves to the complimentary drink, coffee, and ice cream). The rooms are lovely, have very thoughtful touches (like disposable cameras), and gorgeous architecture and design so make it feel like a real getaway to a special hotel versus one of the many chains that don't offer much of an ""experience."" As far as cleanliness and COVID-friendly, The Crawford was completely on top of it so it felt very safe, clean, and accommodating to anyone with underlying health conditions or otherwise simply trying to travel responsibly. The Crawford is a hotel I would highly recommend to anyone local and to anyone coming to Denver who wants an original experience, in a fun part of town, and values real customer service that makes you feel pampered and taken care of. Did I mention the free Tesla car service (within a 2-mile radius)?… (like disposable cameras), and gorgeous architecture and design so make it feel like a real getaway to a special hotel versus one of the many chains that don't offer much of an ""experience.""

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible service - above and beyond!,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The Crawford! We were staying there to celebrate my cousin’s 40th birthday and the staff was so incredibly kind and generous! Jordan at the front desk was so very helpful in making sure we had a great stay. She went above and beyond to accommodate additional requests. Top notch service. There were some great perks including the free Tesla rides within 2 miles (and the excellent driver Riley!) and free coffee and ice cream at Union Station. Enjoyed the fun Polaroid camera in each room too. Finally, very Covid safe and clean! Will definitely look to stay again when I’m in town.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Every time we love it,"We love the location and the hotel every time.  Staying in Union Station with awesome amenities and great people watching if always a treat.  To have such a beautiful room to enjoy on top of that is always appreciated.  We have stayed there after taking the train in from Chicago, after a flight in and this past year after some great days hiking in the mountains for fall colors.  NEVER disappoints.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Quick Get Away,"We took the A Line train directly from the airport to the door of Union Station for $21.00.  It was super convenient and runs every 15 minutes or so.  Upon arrival we received a room upgrade to a suite room which was very nice with 1 1/2 baths.  Location was convenient for tours in the surrounding area.  Only let down was that the Tesla service was not offered during our stay and we had to request our coffee supplies from the desk; which wasn’t delivered timely.  Lack of room cleaning/stocking was due to Covid which is understandable during these times.  Complimentary daily coffee shop drink, bar drink and ice cream per person was provided due to the amenity fee which was nice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Could not have been a better stay! ,"During my time here the staff was incredible and so helpful, the rooms are clean and absolutely gorgeous. Even our TESLA driver, Riley was absolutely  amazing. I would recommend  for anyone to stay in this hotel at least once! ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved it,Loved the stay at this hotel on my wedding weekend. It was a treat to have a Tesla drive us complimentary! Riley was amazing! The rooms are so spacious and the amenities are just so amazing. The concierge desk is so helpful and warm.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved the Location and Staff!,The location of the Crawford made it so easy for a 4 day exploration of Denver. The hotel staff were so quick to respond to questions and any extras for the room. Having access to the Crawford Hotel e-bikes to explore the many scenic trails and river/creek was a highlight. Hotel staff Jen and Jordan were so helpful and part of why this was a 5 star experience! ,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel & Wonderful Staff,"My husband and I stayed at The Crawford for 2 nights and had the best time. Our room was absolutely fabulous (we booked the Deluxe Loft). But the staff really made our trip memorable. Jordan and Jen were so friendly and helpful. They had great restaurant recommendations and made our stay that much more amazing! We will definitely be back soon! Highly recommend this amazing, historic hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved the location,We really enjoyed our stay here.  We were loved the central location.  Everything we wanted within walking distance.  We traveled to catch a game at Mile High on the lite rail just a short walk from the hotel  Simply the location is brilliant.  The building and surroundings have a great feel about them and the hotel itself is closed off to the public so you don't have any disturbance.  The rooms were well set out and comfortable and we loved the exposed beams and rustic feel to our room that gave the room plenty of character.  The staff were extremely helpful and took care of any request we had. We would easily stay here again when back in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An almost perfect stay,"This hotel is fun and unique. When you arrive, you'll need to park at The Oxford hotel down the street.  They will move your luggage to The Crawford and valet your car. When walking in, a lot is going on. Trains are moving, people at the bar, others seated at comfortable seating with drinks or meals. We booked the LoDo Suite and could not be happier with the choice. The room was immaculate and stylish. The seating and the bed are in separate areas and has two full baths. The staff was terrific and accommodating. We had dinner at Stoic and Genuine inside the station. The food was incredible, and the service as well.  We ordered oysters on the half shell, clam chowder, and Maine lobster rolls. The bed was comfortable, and we did not hear any noise from other guests.  Everything…",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,DO IT! You'll be happy you did!,"Talk about making the right choice!  My fiance and I got engaged 10/3 of 2019 and wanted to celebrate our first year being engaged so we planned a little getaway from SF to Denver.  To be honest, we debated staying at a different ""luxury"" hotel, and I'm SO glad we didn't.  Not only is the location of The Crawford absolutely perfect (literally can't mess up the airport-to-town train ride even if we wanted to), not to mention how EVERYTHING is walkable from it, but the service was the absolute BEST.  I called a couple days before our trip to inquire if the hotel could recommend a photographer to do a last minute engagement shoot out at the Red Rocks; enter: Jennifer Brown and her incredible customer service.  She not only helped me track down one of the most EPIC photographers…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Short escape from ""Paradise""","In mid October 2020 I ""escaped"" Aspen, Colorado for a short, but much needed reality check in Denver. I've always wanted to stay at The Crawford Hotel and booked two nights and opted for a third last minute. Growing up in the Colorado mountains the city has always been a draw and this trip was no different. The hotel is attractive and comfortable. Close to everything from good restaurants, quick eats, workout and bike routes. The downtown area is undergoing constant rejuvenation and can be noisy, but fun day and night.In person shopping at unique stores and attractions; Don't be afraid to explore.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Must Stay for amtrak travelers ,Took train from emeryville to denver..stay over two nights and then back west again.For first night we stayed in west denver....nothing special....so we remembered we passed hotel crawford in train terminal...went online and booked a loft.Sooooo. Glad we did!!!!!  Awesome room with lots of places to eat and drink.Felt like an awesome downtown vibe with lots of people out and about.Room was above our expectations.......only minor changes I would have made were some type of step stool for better view out window and the large sitting chair was extremely stiff and not comfy at all.....I would here again without hesitation.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Luxury service,"This was my third visit to The Crawford. We were celebrating my son’s 10th birthday on this trip. The staff went out of their way to make our weekend memorable. Union Station is a great location with so much to see and do. Restaurants, shopping, museums, 16th St. Mall are all within walking distance. The rooms are absolutely lovely and exactly what you would expect from a luxury hotel. It is worth the upgrade to have the clawfoot tub. I appreciate the traditional decor and details. The location is so fun and unique and definitely adds to the specialness. Our driver, Riley, was very personable, and the Tesla ride is all my son has been talking about! I really cannot say enough good things about The Crawford. This is definitely my favorite Denver hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Overpriced, you're paying for the location","Hubby and I have stayed at the Crawford twice.  We stayed two years ago in a Lodo Suite room and loved it, didn't mind the $20 amenity fee and took advantage of some of the free deals.  Decided to stay again for a staycation recently.  I think this might be our last stay for a while.We booked a bed and breakfast rate for a deluxe loft room, which faces toward the train tracks.  No matter what people tell you, these rooms are not soundproof - you will hear the bells from incoming trains all night - and I mean ALL night.  The mattress was saggy. I think it's an innerspring, but I don't think it's been turned since the hotel opened.NOBODY is enforcing the mask mandate at Union Station. There were people running around in the station without masks, and don't bother sitting in the main hall because without question someone will sit down next to you hacking and coughing.  We wound up retiring to our room for most of the evening because it was hard to have a relaxed conversation with all the Amtrak riders camping out without masks.The biggest issue I have, though - the hotel NEVER sent me a copy of my folio, even after I asked.  We took advantage of the bed and breakfast rate, but when I saw the charge on my credit card, I don't think we got the $50 credit.  But it's hard for me to confirm since I can't seem to get a copy of my bill.  What are you trying to hide, Crawford Hotel???",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great visit, would definitely stay again!","Went to the Crawford for a night with two girlfriends, had a lovely time. Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Our check-in was a breeze. The room was very clean and well-appointed. Loved the little extras like the camera in the room. Everyone was wearing a mask and were very conscientious about staying at least 6 feet away. Had a great time, can't wait to go back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic,"I cannot say enough good about The Crawford!  We had an unfortunate incident when our keys were stolen to our rental from the valet box BUT the staff went above and beyond to compensate for it. Outstanding service, excellent facility, friendly & accommodating staff and all around one of my favorite hotels. Our Tesla driver Riley was fantastic as well!  Don’t miss out on this place next time you’re in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,During Covid-19 Normalcy in an Abnormal World,"I've stayed at the Crawford in the past while visiting Denver.  It was absolutely wonderful to stay there during the Covid-19 pandemic..to have some normalcy in an abnormal world.  I felt safe - the hotel was so clean & the staff was, as usual, over the top.  Sandra in housekeeping so friendly & helpful.  Laura & Jennifer & Riley at the front desk very pleasant, friendly and also helpful.  We opted not to have housekeeping in every day but the response for anything we needed was very impressive.  Great to be able to visit the Crawford again during this time.  Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Getaway!,"Visited Denver again for a family getaway. Staying at The Crawford always feels like we’re at our home away from home. During these uncertain times, The Crawford staff made everything feel wonderful and safe. They checked with us numerous times during our stay to be sure things were going well and they were!  After a day in the city the rooms are so spacious and comfortable to come back to!! Laura, Riley, Jennifer and Sandra went above and beyond to make our stay great!  Can’t wait for our next visit!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great service!,"Stayed one night at the B&B rate -- included valet parking ($47 value) plus $50 allowance for in-room breakfast from Snooze.  Breakfast choices were great, but in the Covid era, cardboard and plastic are the best we can do.  Included typical barista choices -- we had chai latte and a cappuccino.  The room has an I-Pad to use for getting information, ordering breakfast, and retrieving the car from the valet, among other things.  Bathroom is very nice with a walk-in glass shower with two heads -- the rain shower was great.  The room also has a Nespresso machine with espresso pods.  We took advantage of the free Tesla transport (2-mile limit) to go to our restaurant. Riley, our driver, was on-time, very polite, and professional.  Have stayed in downtown Denver on numerous occasions…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exquisitely comfortable with outstanding service,"My husband and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary here in the midst of the pandemic and felt for once like everything was normal for a moment. The suite was fabulous, with high end everything! Luxurious and beautiful. The hotel staff were super friendly and went above and beyond, especially at the check in desk. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Sorry we came back.,"Couple of year’s ago we spent a few days here and it was great so we came back. Our second visit was during corona virus, so I realize things have changed,  but the service was horrible. They no longer clean your room. No clean towels and the garbage piles up in your room. No parking at the hotel. You have to take your car to another hotel for parking and walk back to the Crawford. Thongs were not in working order in our room. The hotel employees are incompetent. I had to ask 3 times for toilet paper and clean towels. Never did get them. When I asked questions at the front desk, the girls kept chatting to each other and were very unhelpful. We will find another place to stay next time.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for EVERYTHING!,"This beautiful, historic hotel in Union Station was ideal for ALL our needs and then some.  It is just steps from the light rail which transports to Denver airport(only $10.50 per person).  The ticket is also good for the city bus and doesn't expire until 2:59 am the next day!  Both of our tours conveniently picked us up in front of the hotel, and we were in the heart of LoDo (lower downtown-very nice part of town). The daily amenities are plentiful-free coffee(or tea), ice cream, happy hour alcohol, and more discounts!  Our room was comfortable, clean, quiet, and spacious. The shower was AMAZING-also spacious, with strong water pressure and soft water texture(no residue).  Robes, slippers, more coffee and alcohol available!We were delighted with the hospitality while in Denver.  Kudos to the state of Colorado for managing to simultaneously welcome tourists and take all precautions during this unusual time. Went home with great memories!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crushing on The Crawford ,"We’re in the middle of our stay at The Crawford but did not want to lose another minute before raving about this amazing establishment. From the moment we stepped foot onto the plaza in front of the hotel, to our seamless check-in experience, to the actual room itself, our experience has been top notch! We’d like to give a special shout out to Lara who has been delighting us with extra special surprises.Upon arrival, we were thrilled to learn we’d been upgraded to a Crawford Suite. The room layout is perfect for any traveler, but particularly if you are a couple traveling with a toddler. There’s plenty of space for everyone! The suite has everything, including its own fully stocked bar (with dishwasher!), assorted bitters + top shelf spirits, in addition to boardgames and beautiful coffee table books. Other thoughtful touches include an aromatherapy diffuser, spa-worthy waffle weave robes + slippers, and makeup remover wipes. We couldn’t be more pleased with our hotel experience at The Crawford. In fact, my husband remarked that we could literally limit our entire visit to the confines of this hotel and its exquisite bars and restaurants...there is just so much to do right here. Walking through the lobby continues to take our breath away each time; it is jaw-droppingly gorgeous! Is it possible to look forward already to a future visit when you’re in the midst of enjoying your present stay?",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Really Outstanding Experience,"I had hear about the Crawford Hotel  but the experience of it was so much better.  The check in was fast and friendly.  I felt incredibly safe, because to get to my room there was a card key elevator, a card key door to the hallway and then a card key lock on my room.  The Loft room was really beautiful, and very quiet.  There was water waiting for me and craft beverage for purchase.  The bathroom was so nice with the antique tub and the shower with multiple shower heads.  There was an iPad in the room that had information about the hotel, Union Station, transportation and local sites to visit.  I was also able to order room service through iPad and really enjoyed the selections available.  On the desk was a copy of the book Atlas Obscura, and once I picked it up I knew I would have to order a copy.  It has fascinating information about artifacts, buildings, shrines, etc, from around the world.  The staff that I interacted with was polite and friendly and the general manager emailed to follow up to make sure I enjoyed my stay.  You don't want to miss out on this experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel!,"We stayed at The Crawford in Denver because we had a very early flight home and needed to take the commuter train to the the airport. It did not disappoint! The building is in the refurbished historic Union Station. It is home to The Crawford, restaurants, the Denver commuter light rail, some small shops, and the Amtrak station. There are also many restaurants within walking distance of Union Station. We used the Tesla courtesy car service to pick us up from the rental car return. Our room had 16 foot tall windows and was decorated in the historic style of Union Station. It was very comfortable and luxurious. We would recommend The Crawford to anyone looking for a luxury hotel in downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very neat unique hotel,"Being at a train station and a lot of traffic coming through, the room was surprisingly quiet. We chose a non smoking room but for some reason when we arrived it smelt like a smokers room. The value of the room was a little overpriced but it was a cute room. Snooze delivers room service but it was too overpriced for 2 people, a few eggs and pancakes close to 100!. It’s in a great location but the lobby where people come and go can be a little cleaner.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Outstanding hotel,Situated in the heart of downtown this train station which was converted into a hotel is an absolute must stay. The Amtrak trains still run from here which is cool. The rooms are outstanding and opulent  along with the deep luxurious bath tubs and huge showers. It shows that however planned this hotel put a lot of time and effort into it and it paid off. They have a coffee shop pizza place Sushi restaurant and a bar overlooking the grand concourse which is unique. Definitely very happy l booked this hotel 👍,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anniversary ,"I really liked the loft we stayed in. It was nice and cool , and clean. It was awesome to be so close to dining and outside activities. They only reason I didn’t give more stars is our bed squeaked all night every time we would roll over or move I was awake. Also bed was lumpy with dip in the middle. Otherwise great place to stay. Room 418 needs a new bed.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,so perfect is this location,"loved staying here in the beginning of the come back from the apocalypse.  My sister and I stayed 5 nights to celebrate our retirements.  Loved the entire stay... the light rail from the airport to the hotel is perfect.  then you stay in the middle of all the fun.  the bikes they loaned were perfect and fun.  the rooms were spacious and comfy with the Nespresso coffee every day... comfy beds great soaking tub.  the extra charges were well worth with free coffee, ice cream and my first ride in a Tesla.  Will come again with more crowds net time.....",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Spectacular Customer Service,"Well, we had a disaster happen and if not for the spectacular customer service of Jordan at the front desk and Sarah who backed her up, our visit to Denver would have been a disaster. We arrived in Denver on a Friday afternoon and parked our rental car in the public lot across the street from the hotel. On Saturday morning we went to retrieve our car and without warning, the parking lot had closed for COVID cleaning until Monday morning! Zero warning and we were due to fly home on Sunday evening. We went back to the front desk and Jordan went to work for us. She walked back over to the lot with my husband to see the situation for herself. Then she arranged a rental car for us so we could get on with our weekend and we exchanged cellphone numbers. Jordan made countless calls and waited on hold for hours, enlisted coworkers to cover the phone if she had to step away. She called the lot owners, the management company and anyone else she could think of until she found a person who would come out and unlock the parking lot prison our car was trapped in and she found a guy who could come unlock the lot! Jordan then called us to let us know that we had a plan, could park both the rental car in valet at the hotel’s expense and then sent a bottle of Chardonnay and three glasses to our room for what we had been through. When Jordan’s shift ended, she enlisted Sarah to cover any problems with our situation if they should come up. No one could have done more to help us with a situation that came right out of the blue. We will never forget the excellent customer service we received at The Crawford. The suite our family shared was beautiful, comfortable and spotless and we are loyal guests for life!Thank you again, Jordan and Sarah. I hope your management gives you a big bonus for your effort!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Short but sweet trip!,"My husband I booked a last-minute trip to Denver after having to cancel our honeymoon to Italy. Kathleen was professional, courteous, and incredibly accommodating, and very graciously sent us a bottle of prosecco on the house! Although we were only there for one night, we will definitely be back at the Crawford when we return to Colorado. What a lovely and welcoming hotel -- we had a wonderful time!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Short but sweet visit,"I stayed here for a work trip, it was booked for me.  Everything went smoothly, the room was basically a mini-suite with 2 TVs and a kitchenette which was perfect for remote work.  The Union Station location felt secure, despite an errant vagrant who accosted me in the AM while I waited for coffee (not the hotel's fault, and Union Station security was quite present.  The hotel has partnerships with a bunch of the dozen+ restaurants at Union Station, so discounts abounded.  I finished my meetings early and had a looooong wait until my flight, the front desk staff sent me to their spa (Oxford Spa) less than a block away to wait, which was quiet and comfortable, equipped with snacks and drinks. 12/10 would stay there again even if it wasn't work (and thus I had to pay for it myself :)).  Megan at the front desk was especially wonderful!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel but a few flaws,"This is a really nice hotel and we had a great time, but there are a few flaws.  Each room comes with a preloaded IPAD, which is a great idea.  You can read newspapers and magazines, contact customer service, set am alarm, etc.  Unfortunately, ours had been so messed up by a previous user it was almost impossible to use.  I contacted customer service but the problem was not resolved during our two day stay.  We also had trouble with the Nespresso coffee-maker in the room which did not operate as it was supposed to.  They replaced it.  The Crawford is a nice place and the staff is earnest, but these two problems should have not been allowed to happen.    Especially for the price!  It has been a week since we stayed and I bet that IPAD is still screwed up.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Lovely hotel, great hotel, excellent staff!! ","We loved our quick overnight at the Crawford. Train from the airport, Late dinner at the Terminal, cozy bed breakfast at Snooze. Fabulous staff that helped my husband with business/ printing help. wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else in downtown Denver - five stars!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver Date night layover,"WOW what a find!Flew into Denver for a visit CSU Fort Collins and watch CSU RAMS 🏀game. Drove upto Ft Collins to stay at the Elizabeth (see review) and needed to stay an extra night prior to flying out to next destination. So decided to get a room in Denver and explore the LODO area. Discovered that there was a hotel within Union Station called the Crawford that offers standard rooms as well as “loft” rooms so selected the Loft options (that over looks rails and station stop). It’s an excellent view of LODO. The Crawford is literally smack dab in the middle of Union Station, along with craft kitchens, cafes and bars - of which you get discounted (and free) treats, drinks and eats for staying at The Crawford. Now be aware it’s a fully active station with commuters, travelers and locals buzzing about. There ARE kids, but I wouldn’t say it’s kid friendly. I would stay there with kids BUT keep them busy sightseeing and in the rooms.The Terminal Bar is cool, the ice cream shop was delicious, the Cooper Lounge was convenient for a night cap (but that’s about it $$$)There is a car service that will shuttle you around LoDo for free and the driver offered great recommendations. Lastly Th e main reason we would most likely visit is the location and A line service to and from the airport.. CANT BEAT IT... there are rental cars service right across from The Crawford. So you can ride A Line check in and walk to get rental car if you need to ALL IN ALL it’s highly recommended for visiting Denver for Nuggets 🏀game, Rockies ⚾️game.. or avalanche 🏒game",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Vintage Classy,"On arrival we were greeted by the valet quite well, they grabbed a cart for our bags and such in a very timely manner. I always like to bring some fun and fashionable clothing for these occasions and they cared for our things properly. As we arrived at the front desk concierge it was just good vibes all the way, the staff here felt like friends instantly.  The Cooper Lounge on the 2nd or 3rd floor, (can’t quite remember) this was great for getting the night started, having a wonderfully made cocktail and enjoying the loft view of the Crawford and enjoying good conversation with our other friends who joined us as well.  The Terminal Bar on the first floor was exceptional service and wonderful drinks and it gets better the later you stay, we stayed until it closed and then walked the union station after. The security guys were also very nice to us, even after closing the Terminal Bar thee e u said we could carry on our conversation in the station as long as we wanted, this works when you are guests of The Crawford. The greatest thing about this place is the customer service though, the staff is on point. I honestly wish I had more cash on me at the time of my stay so I could tipped more. I will make up for that next time.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel with fantastic customer service,"My son lives in Denver and we came for a visit to go snow tubing and see the ice castles. We arrived at the hotel on Thursday night and left on Sunday. We took the train from the airport to Union Station and then we are at the hotel.  We were greeted by the Staff and they upgraded our room. The rooms are small but beautiful and clean. The bathroom great with a nice rain shower. We had breakfast at Snooze in the morning and it was delicious and it’s located right there in the train station in the hotel area. We were also given a voucher each day for each of us for a complementary ice cream at this creamery right in union station. The ice cream was delicious. I even had vegan almond joy and it was so good I couldn’t wait to get it the next two nights while we stayed there. Big shout out to the following staff that went above and beyond for the best customer service we have seen in our almost 40 years of traveling around the world since we got married. We must mention Jordan, Kim,Megan and JD. I can’t speak highly enough of these staff members that work there! I point out that it was Kim’s first day at work at the hotel but she addressed situations like she’s been there forever! We will definitely stay there again next time we come to Denver from Florida to visit our son!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible property,"My husband and son had a concert to attend in downtown Denver. We decided to go as a family so while they were at the concert my daughter and I walked around downtown and rode the tram to shop. The hotel is top notch and the staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable. We enjoyed the free beer in the historic bar, walked around the old train station, shopped while eating our free ice cream and did a lot of people watching. Our room was fantastic. It had a lot of the old wood beams, young living essential oils with the diffuser, beautiful tub and showers and chic, throw back  decor. They also had a Tesla available for local rides which we did not take advantage of this trip. I highly recommend this hotel!  It is FULL of personality and great architecture.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Casual entertainment on a new level!,"The rooms were luxurious, the cocktails were divine, (did you know there is a cocktail bar above on the second floor!? I highly recommend the ""Witch's Ladder"") the decorations and nuance was a perfect balance of old and new, the woodworking and stylized rooms were meticulous and craftily put together with flair and care! On a whim, I booked the Union Station Art and History Package and was taken on a tour of the spectacular history of Denver's ""Living room"". WOW! The information and things seen were so interesting and fun! Those conference room walls are like something out of Star Trek technology! A big kudos to Conner, our guide. He delivered so much information about the different style rooms, history, and highs and lows of the building with such suave composure, it was a true pleasure that we will talk about for a long time. I can't say enough about this hotel, located at Union Station in Denver... Staying for our Anniversary was the best decision for down town casual entertainment and stay. We will be back again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location...but that’s about it!,"We had high hopes for The Crawford Hotel; however from the poor front desk service; to the poor attitude from the bartender at the bar upstairs; to a bed that wasn’t comfortable (it declined at the head of the bed), the room wasn’t clean (it had personal soap bottles from the last guest, trash in the trash can) it fell short. If you happen to get a room (like we did) that face inside the union station, it is quite loud as well (but gets quiet at night). Overall, not worth the price you pay to stay there.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great Staff, Comfortable Room, Incredibly Convenient","I'm a native of Denver, and Union Station went from very grand in the days of train travel to a dump from, say, 1965 to about 2008. Thanks to some visionary people, the Crawford Hotel's namesake for one, Union Station is now back to very grand. If you take RTD's A Line from Denver International Airport to Union Station, walk about 50 steps to the Crawford Hotel front desk on the north side of the grand hall in Union Station. You'll meet some delightful staff members who will have you on your way to your room in minutes. My room, number 318, was comfortable, clean, quiet, and stylish. 18 foot ceilings helped the ambiance. Take a tour of Union Station with Connor, who has encyclopedic knowledge of Union Station's -- and LoDo;s -- history; book the tour through the front desk. Have a drink at the Terminal Bar or the Cooper Lounge. Enjoy Pigtrain Coffee. Mercantile Dining was also nice, with outdoor seating to enjoy Denver's sun. A note of caution: your room rate won't include Denver's high state, lodging, and tourism taxes. And there's a Historic Preservation fee on top of the taxes! You know what? The Crawford was worth it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Locations and Amazing Room Amenities,Is located in Union Station which was very easy to get there from the Airport.  My room was warm and comfortable with up upgraded TV and IPAD to get any information you needed on the City or Hotel.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,hip new living history,"Beautiful, grand, historic, meticulously restored, and (best of all) an efficient, functioning train station. all the charm of thoughtful restoration with the vitality and purpose of a functioning transportation hub. hotel is an easy train ride from the airport. arriving on the train somehow feels right. and no need for a car in downtown Denver; public transport is awesome! Hotel staff are exceptional! check in was effortless and friendly. had a problem with the business center computer and Anna not only offered to help, but really did the job for me (and I picked it up after the nightly ice cream parlor snack that comes with the room.) She and the other staff made us feel like long-time repeat customers. seemed like staff were having fun (even as they fielded one weary traveler after another). wonderful service had the air of what 1st class train travel may have been like when the station was in its (first) heyday.Train station complex has at least 6 restaurants, maybe more, nice pubs, a coffee shop, the aforementioned ice cream parlor and sweet shop, all top notch. tons of gluten free options btw! nightly beer at the train station pub is part of the amenities package (for which there is a charge at check-in).beautiful building, exceptional service, top tier amenities. if downtown Denver hadn't so much to offer, there'd be no reason to leave the train station!",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Superb...,"experience at the Crawford, in large measure due to my room and the environment but in largest measure due to the service. I’ll mention two by name: Ander and Sara.  The story began when I tried to check into the sister hotel, The Oxford. It’s perfectly ok but sometimes things just aren’t a fit and the Oxford wasn’t for me. In an effort to resolve my issues, I asked about moving over to the Crawford. It was arranged and, when I got there, the Crawford staff installed me in a superb room, one of the most beautiful and comfortable and spacious and functional rooms I have been in, in a very long time. And I have travelled over two million miles, so I know hotel rooms. The staff was courteous and helpful and just really proactive in ensuring that I had a great experience. Highly recommend and kudos. Great place, great service, fun amenities, restaurants, coffee shops, live music, all built around a working train station. One word to the ethnocentric: if you aren’t comfortable around diversity, this place isn’t for you. It is part of a working train station and there are all kinds of people there. Didn’t bother me a bit because I enjoy all walks of life. Total thumbs up. I’ll definitely be back. Loved it. My kind of place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love The Crawford,"We have stayed at The Crawford numerous times and always have a great experience. The staff is always friendly, and the location can't be beat.  We love walking downtown to great restaurants, and have utilized the complimentary Telsa for events.  Union Station has so much going on, and is usually very busy.  But once you close the door to your room, the noise is gone.  The soundproofing is top notch! Beds are super comfy and amenities well appointed.  You will not want to stay anywhere else downtown!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Charged my parents, it was supposed to be a gift","We booked a room back in October for New Year’s Eve for my parents as a Christmas gift. The room and the package was great, no complaints at all about the quality of the property or room. However, we filled out a credit card authorization form about a week in advance to make sure all their charges would be on our card (not much of a gift if you have to pay for it right?) I confirmed this with the front desk to make sure it was taken care of. I realized that my card hadn’t been charged, and on the day of check out I had to find out from my dad that they had charged him the full amount on his credit card which was the opposite of what we were going for. I had to call in three times to get to a billing person to figure it out. Finally got the charged reversed and fixed, but needless to say I’m totally embarrassed that our “gift” turned out to be an $800 credit card hold on the recipients.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Historical Hotel,"Can’t recommend the Crawford Hotel enough!

Will definitely be returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fabulous hotel in Union Station!,"This hotel is awesome!  It was my second stay there and I loved it just as much as the first stay.  They sent some champagne to our room for my husband's birthday (we were there to celebrate the occasion), and we used the free shuttle to get to our dinner destination.  Valet was a little slow fetching our car the next morning, but no huge deal.  Will stay again for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel for travelers and downtown lovers,"We were delighted with the accomodations at the Crawford.  There was a large Christmas party crowd in the Great Hall of the Union Station, but when you went to the rooms it was completely inaudible.  The soundproofing inside and out is spectacular.  The room was well appointed and the 13 foot tall windows (ours looked out on the tracks) were like a step back in time.  There are multiple restaurants in the station and many more just outside. Plus, the Tattered Cover bookstore has a small place in the station and the big store is across the street.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome Hotel!!,"My wife, son and I decided to make a quick trip to Denver and flew in.   We rode the train from the airport to the Crawford(it is so cool to take the train directly to the hotel)!! The hotel is beautiful inside and out!  The ice cream shop, coffee shop, pizza and other restaurants in the hotel are excellent and it is fun to people watch in the lobby area as so many travelers make their way thru the station!  I highly recommend the “Snooze” restaurant for breakfast!  Make sure and put your name in thru the hotel desk and reserve a table at this outstanding venue!  The breakfast is delicious!!, creative, affordable and custom made!!!  We also really enjoyed the awesome shuffleboard tables in the lobby, just take your drivers license to the bar and they give you the pucs!  The…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved the Crawford,Everything from the friendly and helpful front desk staff to the room were wonderful for our adult getaway.

We will absolutely stay again when visiting Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Anniversary Getaway,Loved the Crawford...very quiet rooms even tho we were just above Union Station lobby. Nice amenities...were even able to make a reservation at Snooze (usually 1-2 hour wait). We’ll return!! Valet parking alittle slow tho.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience. Love this hotel.,"I came in for business/vacation for a few days. I'm in Denver a few times a year and this was my first time at the Crawford.  I cannot say enough about the hotel and the staff, I will definitely be back.  The room was beautiful and had an extremely comfortable bed. The convenience of being right at Union station is a huge plus.  I was very impressed with the presence of staff with their attention to detail and their genuine friendliness. Crawford will certainly be my go-to place on my future visits to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible and lovely experience at The Crawford! ,"My mom came into town and we decided to book a hotel room as a treat for her visit, and so we could be amid the energy of Union Station and all the surrounding restaurants and shops. I cannot say enough to express our satisfaction with our stay - check-in was easy and quick, our room was beautiful and unique (loved the amenity of the Polaroid camera! My mom and I had a blast taking photos - very cool), and the option of having a driver take us anywhere in the nearby area was so convenient (in a Tesla!). Every staff member of The Crawford we came across checked in with us about our stay and made sure we had everything we needed. One staff member even remembered both of our names, which helped to make the experience feel even more personal. On our departure day, we both had a bit…",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Don't pick ""Superior Classic"" or room 319","I like this hotel - I travel to work in Downtown Denver and stay here once or twice or month.  It is an interesting hotel right in the train station.  Perfect location if you fly into the airport and take the train to downtown (faster than a car in traffic, reliable, and only $10.50).  The staff is really helpful and the rooms are comfortable.But, room 319, which they call a Superior Classic is bad - it is so tiny as to be claustrophobic.  There is a desk across from the bed but the TV is on that desk so you only have about 12 inches to work.They brought me a ""welcome gift"", which is nice - and based on a preference sheet I filled out some time ago.  But, they brought me iced Green Tea (which I really don't like) because they were out of the tea I requested.  Don't get me wrong - I still think this hotel gets a Five.  I just hate this room.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Weekend Getaway,"We spent our anniversary weekend at the Crawford. Yes, it is more expensive than other area hotels, but the amenities make it worthwhile. We received free beers every happy hour at the bar located on the property. Also free ice cream (really really good ice cream) from the on-site ice cream bar, discounted food at the attached restaurant, and were driven around by Brian in the hotel's Tesla to church and to the football stadium. There is no more convenient spot to stay - you won't need a rental car as you can take the train straight there from the airport. The staff was incredible. They really make you feel special. And - the hotel itself was modern, clean and beautiful, with unique touches in the rooms that made it special - and artwork and photographs worth stopping to look at in the hallways. We highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A great unique hotel,"We stayed at the Crawford hotel after arriving in Denver via the Amtrak California Zephyr.  Since the hotel is Denver's Union Station, it was very convenient.  The hotel is basically Union Station with rooms on two sides of the great hall.  Our room door opened on corridor that was open to the main lobby, and although there was buzz of activity from the lobby, the room was very quiet!  The room had very high ceiling, maybe 12 feet.  it felt like a grand hotel room from a bygone era.  There were even little glass containers with pre-mixed cocktails and glassware in the room.There were several places to eat in Union Station.  We could look down on the hotel bar from the corridor, but we didn't get a chance to try it.  It looks really cool.If I have reason to visit Denver again, I would definitely try to stay here again.  It was a great experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Pampered bachelorette,"My bridesmaid booked this place to stay in for my bachelorette night out! It was so incredibly comfortable. They gave us a corner room and had champagne and chocolates waiting for us. The shower (I think it’s called a rain head?) was so relaxing and warm after our night of partying. I also LOVE the coopers lounge for delicious drinks and incredible (I mean INCREDIBLE) service. I was also surprised with how quiet the room was, despite being on the busy union station corridor. Slept like a baby! Will be back there soon for another staycation!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A great location for seeing Denver and the surrounding area...,"We loved the hotel and all it had to offer.  From the older vibe of the building to the bustling main lobby, we enjoyed our entire time there.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Never left the building,"This was my second stay at the Crawford.  I love love love the wonderful 2014 renovation of Denver's circa 1881 Union Station, which included adding the Crawford Hotel to its upper floors.  Denver was having a heat wave when I visited, so I ended up rarely leaving the station, and then it was only to take photos of its exterior.  I slept, rested, toured and, most importantly, ate my way through the station for 2 days.  It was so convenient because I flew into Denver, then took the light rail directly from the airport to Union Station.  Departing Denver, I caught Amtrak's California Zephyr, also at Union Station.    The Crawford has no dedicated lobby.  Rather, the Great Hall of the station is its lobby/living room, and is so for all station visitors.  There is a front desk/bell…",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stay for the Experience,We stayed one night on the 3rd floor. The room was beautiful. The was a few spots in the bathroom where i noticed have been missed while cleaning. The bed was unbelievably comfy! Guest services were nice but not what i was expecting for such a fancy hotel. We ended up getting a deal but i would never pay the $450 a night. It was a great experience staying in Union Station at this historic hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,It was just fine. ,"Decent enough, but there seems to be many nicer hotels in the Lodo area, for a similar price.   We stayed in a loft room, and while spacious, the one window was very small so it was extremely dark in the room, even in the mornings/daytime.   The bathroom could have been cleaner - grout stains, dirty floorboards and a glass bathroom door covered in layers of sticky hairspray (I assume). Housekeeping didn’t come to clean our room until 4:30pm, which was just strange.  Great overall location, but the uniqueness of staying above the old train station terminal wears off quickly as there’s no real hotel lobby - rather an open space area shared with folks waiting for the train (or just escaping the cold). The “perks” that come with staying at the hotel are great and worth the $20 per…",3

It was clean, nice and comfortable. We spent the entire evening just within the hotel. We had dinner at Stoic & Genuine, had cocktails at The Cooper Lounge (A MUST DO!!) and then had a night cap at the Terminal Bar.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect ,"Perfect location, really nice rooms. So many restaurants and pubs nearby (and within the station). Jumped on some Lyft scooters right outside and toured the area. Excellent airport and Fiddler’s Green access with the train right there. Loved the complimentary extras like the ice cream, coffee and pints from Terminal. The vibe was terrific! We’ll be back for sure. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver’s Best,"I have been traveling to Denver for work approximately 15-20 times a year for the past five years. I have tried several hotels but my first choice is The Crawford. And it’s by a winner by a wide margin. Their five star starts with Marie and her entire staff ALWAYS providing five star service at every  point, reservations,  check in, breakfast, room selection, car service,etc. The rooms are unique and more than comfortable, well appointed, and spacious. Many thank yous to Marie and The Crawford staff for making me feel right at home so many times. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Absolutely brilliant in every way,"This has to rate as one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.  From checking , in to reluctantly checking out,  we enjoyed every minute of our stay. The staff are delightful , friendly, helpful , go the extra mile. The rooms fabulous - we had a loft  - the space was fabulous we just enjoyed being in it. The concourse the hotel,overlooks amazing - comfy sofas, games, tables and chairs , live band - people coming and going, catching trains, lots of life.  Surrounding the concourse were bars (a beer at 5 pm with your room card) coffee shops (a cup each a day) an ice cream shop - (delicious a scoop a day) , a flower shop, a cocktail bar and top notch restaurants (The Mercantile being but one) hope you’re getting the picture.  As I said in the title brilliant in every way - wish…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top Notch destination,"Denver has become a frequent destination and I have recently discovered The Crawford Hotel in Union Station.  From the great vibe of Union Station, welcome smiles from the front desk staff (uncanny ability to remember names), to the uniquely designed rooms, The Crawford is a gem.  Kudos to the entire team for making my stay so enjoyable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome place to stay,"This hotel is THE place to stay in Denver.  It is so convenient to everything!  Amazingly quiet in my room even with all of the activity surrounding the hotel.  The staff is very attentive, room was very clean and spacious, and the service all around was excellent.  I highly recommend the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,"I have been coming to Denver almost every other week on business for almost five years and The Crawford is my favorite hotel.   For starters, there is NO more convenient hotel for a business traveler flying into DIA.  Get off your plane, get on the train and 32 minutes (and $10.50 in RTD fare) you are at Union Station AND at The Crawford (by the way, that beats the pants off of an $80 Uber Black ride).   Then there's The Crawford; almost every room is different; this is no cookie-cutter hotel.  Rooms have 18 foot ceilings, cast iron bath tubs AND large showers.   Refrigerator and coffee maker in every room.  Also, FOUR great restaurants to choose from in the lobby (plus an ice cream shop and a sandwitch shop) and two fantastic bars.  The vibe in the lobby is hard to describe but…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Historic and unique; luxury with a twist,"Stayed here before a conference, just to experience the hotel and union station.  Both have been renovated extensively, with great attention to detail and historical accuracy.  The hotel is a new concept, yet it is built in to pre-existing rooms from the original union station, creatively using existing space to provide three different kinds of rooms: loft rooms, classic rooms with tall windows and great natural light (I stayed in one of these), and Pullman rooms (smaller, but very cool rooms that mimic a sleeper car of the past and have windows looking out on the trains).  The hotel takes itself and its guests seriously, and aims to please.  They have a number of arrangements with restaurants and businesses in Union Station, such that the entire station becomes a large hotel lobby for hotel guests.  The room I stayed in was well appointed and comfortable, with an excellent shower and tub, and large windows with a great view out to the train tracks.  My bathroom actually featured an old safe built in to the wall - from when the space was an office years ago.  The bed was comfortable, and technology worked in the room.  If you enjoy renovated historical buildings, and a high class hotel, this is a place to put on your list.  Consider taking out one of the electric bikes in the morning to see the city; and take the 1 hour historic tour of Union Station led by the concierge!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful surprise,What a nice surprise! Super central and great history. Located in busy and hip Union Station but ultraquiet in the Loft. We took advantage of a few of the wonderful amenities. Jordan took great care of us and everyone we interacted with seemed happy and was knowledgeable. The staff did everything they could to make our stay even better.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel,"Loved the location, history, amenities and staff. Easy walk to great restaurants and Coors Field. Will be back for sure. Loved the downstairs bar and the room on 3rd floor was amazing - wood beams and all",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel!,"I loved this hotel. Elegant, quiet rooms with train station or city views. The Lobby is Union Station with lots of eating and people watching opportunities. Great coffee, good ice cream, lovely “pub’, The choices are varied, but all excellent...even a flower shop!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Larry's places to stay at,"Well to start it was my wife's & mine 45 wedding anniversary on July 13. I love going to see any where they have a baseball game so I look up the Colorado Rockies baseball schedule, I told my wife if I could see the Rockies on July 12 I would take her shopping on our anninversay so it work out great so i found the hotel it was real nice & clean u name it it was great.  So we got to the Hotel they had Valet parking I had a problem with that. So the hotel took us Downtown Denver and they pick us up. It's was cool but we want to pay cash for our room but it didn't happen. We was upset about that. Our bill was pretty high. So the next time we will stay somewhere it's not too high.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top Notch Service,"The Crawford knows how to provide exceptional service. Beginning before we even booked our stay and continued even after checking out. The extra care the staff shows only enhanced our wonderful stay. The location can not be beat. Walking distance to wonderful restaurants, bars and entertainment. The A train outback made traveling from the airport to the hotel a breeze! Our room was cozy, clean and had great details with exposed brick and beams. I’ve seen other reviews speaking of the hotel being noisy but we didn’t experience that at all. Once the door shut it was like the outside world disappeared. This hotel and staff has quickly risen to one of our favorites. We will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Historic Hotel,"Loved our stay at the crawford, beautiful room, great amenities, in the heart of downtown and can hop right on the A Line from the back of the hotel and catch a ride to the airport. Grab a drink at Terminal Bar, some great people watching and a huge selection of craft Colorado beers.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Modern amenities with vintage features,Myself and my parents had stayed here in 2015 and came back this year to experience it again. The rooms are well-kept and seem just as new as they were back then. The iPads are a great touch for techies that make it feel even nicer!! There's soo much to do close by the hotel as the area has an awesome bar and restaurant scene. Definitely a hotel you can stay in without a car and still experience a lot just by walking! Love the Union Station building it's located in as well.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome!,"What a great place. The Crawford was recommended by a good friend. I am so glad I called him. What a fantastic place. The rooms was small but gorgeous. Sound proof & can’t hear anything from the trains outside the window. Service was off the charts great. The hotel is in Union Station. What a great place union station is. Fun, vibrant and definitely the hot central spot in Denver. Five minute walk to the Rockies game, food scene everywhere within a few blocks. We will stay here again and again. We are use to NYC small hotels and this meets or beats any NYC experience. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent place to stay!,"This hotel went above and beyond to make our stay sensational.Check in was quick and easy, room was clean & modern. The free ice cream/beer while people watching was brilliant. Be sure to use the courtesy Tesla, the driver Riley was a Star!⭐️ We’ll most definitely be back. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Waay overpriced and overrated ,"Bailed on New Orleans because of hurricane. Last minute— Denver seemed right. Crawford $500/ nite!!  Asked to have  house car take us to dinner. Front desk said sure. Show up at valet. They knew we were scheduled. Stand around for 15 minutes. The guy pulls up. Says he is busy. We should have taken an Uber. He parks and walks off. Valet just shrugged and walked off. Thanks.   Cooper lounge. What a rip off!! Then the waitress tried to short change me.  Today I get back to the room at 2:45. Not made up. Call front desk. “Oh, they make up the empty rooms first. “ I guess the people who aren’t here pay more.   Not staying here again!!",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, haughty front desk","Great location. Union Station is breathtaking and its amenities are fabulous.  My Pullman room was adequate, but overpriced. My chief complaint concerns attitudes of  people at the front desk.  My face-to-face interactions with them felt as if I was interrupting them from conversations they'd rather be having with each other.  When I checked out, the person at the desk was superficially polite, but didn't ask if I had enjoyed my stay at The Crawford nor encourage me to stay with them again.   There are many hotels along the 16th St. Mall, easily accessible by free shuttle buses.  I will choose one of those hotels the next time I'm in Denver and include Union Station on my itinerary because of its stunning beauty, shops, and excellent restaurants.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,great spot,"terrific stay.  only steps away from the train.....and surrounded by good food/bars etc.  a few freebies too with your hotel stay.  While the weather was fine when I was there, had it been raining, I think I could have gone (by train) from baggage claim to hotel check in without getting wet.  Probably a nice bonus during the winter.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location but.....,"Beautiful property and great location. But: 1.  They obviously change the sheets but not the bedding.   There was a coffee cup lid between the quilt and the base of the bed. 2.  Check out was a real hassle.   My wife and I stayed there for one night on the ""bed and breakfast"" special but it took 3 people to get us checked out as they bill separately for valet parking and breakfast and they then deduct it from your folio only if you notice their error.    The special provides a Snooze breakfast delivered to your room.   In reality it is a $40 credit which barely covers the fees and service charges.   While you can eat a wonderful breakfast for 2 at Snooze for $40, the hotel does not disclose the fees and service charges that they tack on.    I signed a $39 charge at room service…",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location & historic vibe,"Stayed here one night this week, had a great stay. Although the train station & plaza are very lively throughout the full day, guest rooms are very quiet.  Great food shops in the station, including select free items with your room key.  Location is easily walkable to Milk Market, Coors Field, Larimar Square.  We were in a Pullman Room; loved the art deco/Regency details on the furniture & decor. Only downside: the beds are advertised as queen size, but it was the smallest Queen I've ever slept in. Not sure if Murphy-style beds run smaller? Felt like we were sleeping in a Full size bed.  There is a cute Farmers Market on the plaza Saturday mornings, and several great breakfast options. Make sure you tell the hotel that you want priority seating at Snooze the following…",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Retro hipster vibe but lapses in service,"Interesting location and there are a lot of things to do at Union Station. Light rail can take you to many spots in Denver. The rooms (I saw several) vary in size and amenities. In some the furniture is wearing pretty badly. Some staff were accommodating, others had a lot of attitude. I was double billed and had to call a manager to get the extra charge removed.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,All Aboard - Sleep at the Train Station!!,"Friends told us to stay at the Crawford - suggesting a truly unique experience.  WOW - they were right!  The hotel is embedded in Union Station in the heart of LoDo - easy walk to Coors Field, the Pepsi Center or the 16th Street Pedestrian Mall.  Union Station was totally renovated in 2014 and is a very active Amtrak and commuter station.  The front desk is tucked in with the many shops, restaurants and bars surrounding the spacious 4 story atrium.    Our 4th floor Loft Suite was a split level design with closets, minibar/fridge on one level and then a few steps up to the sitting area, bedroom and bathroom.  The exposed structural wooden beams and slanted ceilings gave the room a great feel.    We were concerned that the noise from the atrium might carry into the room - but the…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect 3 Days in Denver,"Visiting Denver for a wedding and a friend recommended the Crawford.  We loved the ease of taking the light rail from the airport directly to the hotel.  The hotel is located in the amazingly refurbished Union Station.  There is a small check in desk within the lobby.  Margo was wonderfully accommodating and all staff members were helpful and full of tips for getting around.  Room accommodations include  many extra amenities found throughout the station including a morning cup of coffee and a daily scoop of fantastic ice cream.  Complimentary rides within a 2-3 mile radius in a Tesla is an additional perk.  Our driver, Riley, was prompt and hospitable.  Rooms are on the smaller side, but not uncomfortably so.  There is a beautiful grand Whole Foods less than a block away.…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Stay,Our stay at the Crawford was great! The room we stayed in (The LoDo Suite) was beautiful and really highlighted the beautiful aspects of this amazing historic building. The walkability was perfect- there were so many places to explore. We were driven to a bar in ballpark area and the ride there was d.O.p.E. In was in the courtesy Tesla with the raptor doors!!  The on-site amenities are incredible - great ice cream bar and a liquor bar! We got preferred seating at Snooze AM eatery the next morning - a great way to top it all off!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Stay - Beautiful Rooms and Helpful Staff,"My partner and I stayed at the Crawford on our honeymoon this past May. We had an unexpected cancellation of our reservation, but it was reinstated and the front desk staff was very helpful in getting that fixed. JD and Margot were especially great and helped us with finding vegetarian restaurant options. The room was beautiful and we enjoyed the convenient location to many Denver attractions. FYI leave your Chromecast at home. You can stream through the TVs. Also there is no parking garage or lot. Instead there is valet which is on the north side of Wynkoop street. Make sure you also take advantage of the free perks like the drip coffee, happy hour beer, and ice cream.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Why would you stay anywhere else?,"I'm never one to post reviews or anything but I felt compelled to talk about how great my experience was! This hotel sits right inside of the train station where the airport train lets you off at and the convenience level was absolutely amazing. The rooms were spotless and the breakfast joint in there was superb. THEY EVEN HAVE A TESLA! We had Dan, the hotel Tesla guy take us out to eat and to a jazz bar called Nocturne. He was extremely knowledgeable and one of the most polite people we've ever met. Cool accent too. Upon check-out, we had a tall gentleman named J.D. assist us and he even offered water to us upon exit. I will never stay anywhere else when I visit Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Elegant accommodations!,"We chose the Crawford for its convenient location in Union Station since we were flying into DIA and leaving the next morning on Amtrak. We were upgraded to a delightful queen room. With the historic setting and the quiet elegance, we found just what were looking for in a lovely hotel. Next time we’ll stay longer to take advantage of all the amenities and the many places to visit in downtown Denver. Gracious staff, comfortable bed, and near the eclectic train station waiting area made the Crawford a perfect place to start our railroad themed vacation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Spend the Money. It is totally worth every cent.,"I was in Denver for the weekend. I didn't have a hotel. I took the train into the city from DIA and was at Union Station. I just saw The Crawford. It was about 7:30 AM on Saturday morning. I figured if they didn't no big deal, just keep walking. If they had a room I figured I could just store my bag and come back later. Not only did they have a room but she gave me an upgrade. She also gave me the room right away. I found an amazing room (308) on the third floor. The room was spotlessly clean, cool and very quiet - despite the very busy street below. There was an IPad for me to use. The hotel has amazing little amenities such as a free beer in the bar or a free ice cream. Need a ride? They have a Tesla and will take you there for free - provided it is within 2 miles of the hotel. For breakfast, Snooze, located in Union Station, was awesome! Can you get a cheaper hotel? Sure, you could. Don't. It is worth every cent you pay to stay here. The staff is fantastic and the location is the BEST!. I can't wait to stay there again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Outstanding,"Everything about our stay was outstanding.  Location, accommodations, Union Station is great fun, and, more than anything, the staff at the Crawford was went way above and beyond at every opportunity.  We picked the hotel for convenience from the RTD train.  We will go back for everything they has to offer.  I can't recommend the hotel highly enough.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,10 Star Review,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Crawford Hotel.  The front desk staff was always helpful and welcoming.  We really appreciated the amenities from the Tesla transportation and the valet services to the drink specials and the ice cream treat.  The atmosphere is energetic and always exciting plus the rooms are gorgeous and amazingly quiet.  We highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel Ever,"Wow oh wow!  Where do I start!  I have seen the grandeur of the Crawford so many times in passing while going between places near Union Station (for work trips) in the past.  Finally, I had the opportunity to stay that the exquisite Crawford Hotel, and it was even better than I imagined.  The Crawford has a unique vibe about it which I have not experienced anywhere else.  It is at a real, working train station, so that is marvelous in itself that the planners managed to figure out how to meld the flow of the workers in transit together with the folks there with less hurried schedules, and create a lovely mix of energy and ambiance in its symbiosis.  I also got to learn its history a bit - that the station dates back to turn of the century train transit; and the hotel itself is…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Stay!,"The Crawford Hotel located in the Denver Union Station is a unique hotel in a great historic location.  We stayed in a Pullman Room, which was clean, comfortable, roomy, and nicely decorated. Bathroom was spacious with nice amenities and a large shower.  Hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  The train station provided the perfect setting for one-stop dining and lounging.  A little pricey, but worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful renovation of historic train station,"My husband and I were embarking on a week long trip to ride excursions trains in Colorado and New Mexico, so we stayed at the Crawford for our first night in Denver.  The hotel is located in the renovated train station, which seemed like the perfect place to begin our journey.  My husband is the train fan, and he really enjoyed staying at the station and learning about all the intermodal transportation options that come together there.  Our room was on an upper floor in the building, and must have been an office before it was converted to a hotel.  The room was not large, but was very well appointed, with a lovely bathroom and very comfortable bed.  It was quiet and well-designed.  When you arrive at the Crawford, it takes someone to show you where the hotel front-desk is…",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun in Denver,"Great time at the Crawford.  Really fun to stay in a high end hotel with a train station for a lobby.  Best part was complimentary TESLA to get us around town.  Riley, aka Tyler the TESLA driver is da BEST.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Outstanding,"Let’s start with the Crawford Hotel’s price which is on the higher end. With that said every single facet of the hotel met or exceeded our expectations for the price. The rooms were very comfortable, well appointed, and quiet (a big concern based on the location). The staff were all top notch and there are to many amenities to take advantage of in under a week’s stay. I would strongly recommend the historical tour of Union Station (1 hour) to give you an appreciation for the site. Also take advantage of the Hotel’s Tesla X to get you to and from dinner. We have stayed at a number of Denver Hotels and the Crawford is our new favorite.   Certainly worth singling out are Dusk (excellent service at the front desk), Conlin (sp) (an outstanding tour guide and  concierge), and Riley…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel for staying in downtown Denver and walking distance to everything,"Great hotel and very posh.  Would give it a five star, but had a little bit of an issue with valet (tough place to park on a weekend due to crowds for ball games and getting to valet) but that's mainly not the hotel's fault.  Staff was extremely attentive to details and helped us by personally escorting us to our room (front desk staff, not bell hop).  The bar on 2nd floor overlooking the terminal was great.  If you are going to a Rockies game, great place to reside for a weekend series.  Also, they give you lots of perks that can be used at the terminal shops/restaurants.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Cool location, okay rooms, bad room service","I stayed at the Crawford because I like Union Station and the location is very central, but the room was dark and very basic for the price.  I was also very unhappy about the ""room service."" One, it's delivery, not room service.  Then, I ordered breakfast from Snooze and the order took over an hour.  Then, it was the wrong order and we had no plastic silverware.  I complained and got a partial refund, but it was disappointing.  The one good thing was that we were able to get a reservation at Snooze, which is only possible for hotel guests.  That was a good experience.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for a romantic getaway in Denver,I could not have asked for better service from the reception desk. They were so polite and recognized my husband and I's needs and desires. We wanted a special night downtown to ourselves and they made sure to make us feel comfortable. The room was so perfect and we felt like we had a very personal touch. We were a little concerned that the rooms were going to be loud being so close to the station but it was completely quiet.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel and great location in LoDo!,"We loved our stay at the Crawford Hotel at Union Station. We stayed for three nights during Memorial Holiday.   Our room was a King Superior Loft on the Fourth floor.   The room isn't huge but we had plenty of space.   The room was very quiet and the bed quite comfortable.   Because I am a light sleeper - I actually prefer having minimal windows in the loft room.  If you need plenty of sunshine - you might opt for one of the Classic rooms instead.     Only negative was housekeeping seemed to half way do our room one day.   Bathroom was cleaned and towels replaced but missed making the bed all together and didn't leave any extra toilet tissue.   This doesn't take away from my star rating though but could be improved.  You do pay a daily resort fee but you receive a free daily beer at the Terminal Bar, free morning coffee at PigTrain,  and free daily ice cream at MilkBox (all within Union Station) as well as discounts offered at other local restaurants.   The Cooper Lounge was closed during our stay so I can't comment on that.   We loved Snooze for breakfast every day.    We took the train (RTD)  from Denver Airport.  Cost $21 for two people each way but so easy and brings you directly to Union Station.  Takes about 40 minutes. Check-in to the Crawford is immediately on your left as you enter Union Station from the Train.  LoDo is a perfect area to stay in Denver.  We walked every where with ease.   We enjoyed Illegal Hamburgers for lunch and Seven Grand Whisky Bar and The Cruise Room at the Oxford Hotel for cocktails.   16th Street Mall is walking distance but find that area more touristy and not really something we were interested in.  If you have some downtime and want to unwind - grab a drink from the terminal bar at Union Station, grab a pizza from Acme Pizza also at Union Station and sit on the benches playing cards, people watching or listening to free live music.   Coors Stadium is walking distance to Union Station.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Location and Room Size AMAZING!!,"We spent three glorious nights in Denver. I loved this hotel. We went straight from airport to the hotel for $10.50 a ticket and because the station is right at the hotel it was so convienent. Check in was a breeze, lots of free promotions when we checked in. The  lobby was full of travelers, tourists, homeless people, working people. I really enjoyed that all sorts of people can use this area. Lots of seating, free wifi, games. We ate breakfast at the coffee shop which was quick and great service! We also ate at two different restaurants in the hotel which had great food and fun to sit outside and watch people go by. Free yoga class on Saturdays. Rooms were huge, bathrooms nice. Just a great hotel.  I would highly recomend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Cannot fault this hotel,"My husband and I came to Denver for a short visit and we’re really happy we chose to stay at The Crawford. Really like the location and our room was great too. The hotel staff on the front desk were always polite and friendly and very knowledgable. The $20 daily amenity charge gets you a lot of things so we were happy to pay this. We booked a table at the Snooze am eatery and really enjoyed the food there. The Terminal Bar was great too, and the ice cream place! Thank you for an enjoyable stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for travelers,"Easy to get to from the airport via light rail.  Super convenient to anything you could want.  Wonder proximity to 16th st Mall.  Beautiful, comfortable and clean.  Property is priced right.  We loved it.  You also get a 1 free beer per guest at terminal bar, a free scoop of ice cream from the creamery and other discounts available from local places that we did not use.  Fun experience. Extremely walkable area",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible Experience!,"I stayed two nights at the Crawford with friends for a bachelor party. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel and its location. As far as comfort and amenities go, it does not get much better. The location was perfect because its seconds away from a huge variety of restaurants and bars. Although herding a bunch of guys around for the bachelor party was a pain, the staff was so accommodating and friendly it really wasn't bad. I have to give a shout out to my guy John Higgins with the hospitality team. Although we're not related I felt like family with the outstanding service I got from him. All in all it was an outstanding stay and I will not hesitate to book here anytime I am in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Another great stay...,"We stayed here the night before flying out of town  Outstanding access to travel to the airport and the room was absolutely amazing!  We always look forward to staying at the Crawford, they never disappoint.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,3 Day Stay - excellent!,"I’m currently staying at the Crawford and have been quite impressed by what this hotel has to offer. Our check in process was efficient, professional and helpful. We were provided with excellent information on the hotel and area amenities. Our room is as expected and is well maintained and clean. Some reviews have spoken about noise or the activity in Union Station. I find this hotel to be extremely quiet and yes, there is activity in the station area but I found it to be inviting and a positive part of the experience. We have visited many of the eating establishments in the hotel/station and have found the staff to be equally pleasant and the quality of the food excellent. While I haven’t stayed in other hotels in the area, I can say this hotel is a great choice and we will be returning customers!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel for downtown Denver,"If you’re searching for a beautiful, quiet hotel room in the middle of downtown Denver with all that has to offer, the Crawford is it! Service was excellent, especially with Jordan in charge at the front desk! Great experience and I will return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,THE best hotel to truly experience Denver,"Whether it's for a staycation, family or friends in town, or I have an early morning flight out of DIA, I always find myself back at the Crawford Hotel inside Denver Union Station.  Everything from it's location, the history of the space, the city-wide amenities and the above and beyond service, make it one of the best and most unique ways to experience the city.The Tesla courtesy vehicle is such a cool (and free) way to explore the downtown area. There's also so much to experience inside Denver Union Station that I've been content just dining and drinking my way through the restaurants and bars inside the train station! The Cooper Lounge has a cocktail menu that's exclusive to hotel guests. And you can't beat that free daily scoop of Milkbox Ice Cream!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Experience at an Incredibly Unique Hotel in the Heart of Downtown!,"As a traveler, I'm all about unique experiences that can't be found anywhere else. Staying in a hotel that's part rail station in downtown Denver is one of the coolest experiences I've had. The Crawford Hotel not only provides a unique location within Union Station with award-winning food (Snooze - YUM!!) and cocktails, but the rooms are incredibly decorated to match the hotel's history and the staff is beyond kind! Service is the most important thing when staying at a property and everyone at The Crawford goes above and beyond. It's definitely one of my favorite spots!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Experience at The Crawford,"My wife and I spent one night at The Crawford. Union Station is a really cool space with a lot going on. Parking and getting a valet was a breeze, as was check in. The room was very well appointed with a great walk-in shower. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel had a Tesla available to take guests anywhere near downtown Denver (within 2 miles) and we definitely enjoyed there service. The driver was very friendly and knowledgeable about Denver and was quite helpful with some of his suggestions. The next time we visit Denver we will definitely stay at The Crawford. We really enjoyed our short visit there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Cool place, poorly executed","Unfortunately the image this hotel very skillfully portrays was not met by the levels of service / actual experience we had here. I booked the Crawford because we would be coming in from a long-haul flight and its location next to the light-rail was convenient. Plus, it looks so fricken' cool! When we checked in, it didn't seem busy (there was one other couple) but we still had to wait awhile to be seen to and the person who took our names was visibly harried. I don't know why she was so stressed out? She didn't tell us anything about the gym / spa across the street, and didn't offer to show us to our room or take our luggage.I tried to get a 1pm checkout but was refused, 12:30 was the latest they could do (seems a bit silly to me -- this prevented us from going on a walking tour we had wanted to do).In the room, we quickly realised in the evening that it was far too loud. The bar area turns into something of a club atmosphere late at night. We needed earplugs to sleep but still kept waking up. Despite our massive exhaustion from a 10+ hour flight!!Finally, this is minor but strangely it has really stuck with me: I had also booked the hotel because I love Bigelow amenities and was actually quite disappointed to see that they don't supply you little soaps/shampoos in the room.We complained on check out about the noise, but were told we could ask for a different room the next time we stayed there. Why would we go back? I don't think the price was worth it (£200 for one night -- doesn't even include breakfast). Also, we did end up using the coffee / free ice cream benefit but they charge you $20 for it -this is silly, it should be baked into the expensive fee of the room. Personally, I think check-out could have done more to make it up to us, whether it was a room discount or complimentary meal at Snooze. I noticed that rooms were £370+ if I had booked them last minute. £200-£370 for that kind of experience isn't worth it in my opinion.The sad part is that the image of the hotel is SO COOL -- it reminds me of a more modern, hip St Pancras - but they don't follow through with this in terms of service. I wouldn't be back here and would choose another hotel in Denver next time.",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel,"This is a great hotel and a really unique experience.  The train station is a historic building in Denver that has been restored and the hotel incorporated into it.  The rooms are beautiful, clean and comfortable.  Staff was friendly and very helpful.  Perfect location for exploring downtown Denver.  You must stay at The Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Westward Trip,"We flew to DIA, took A-train to Union Station, stayed at Crawford a few nights, visited CU-Boulder (bus directly from Union Station), caught Rockies game, and took Amtrak California Zephyr to SLC.  The hotel staff was fantastic, from front desk, to Tesla driver.  We arrived a bit early for check-in, they conveniently took our bags, texted/called when room was ready, put bags in room.  Room was fantastic, quiet, clean, well-appointed, and definitely lodo style, and our kids got a real kick out of the jackolopes on the wall, bathroom was awesome from big tub, to big shower.  Can’t say enough about the facilities, our sons played shuffle board, got ice cream, while we drank a few pints.  Restaurants are great, breakfast at Snooze on patio, great service excellent food.  Will definitely stay again when Westward-bound.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect hotel and perfect location,"I loved being able to take the train from the airport directly to the hotel.  It was so easy and quick.  The room was really clean and very comfortable.  I also felt like I got a lot for my money, I took advantage of getting my coffee each morning and my scoop of ice cream from Milkbox each evening.  Really cute hotel and so easy to walk everywhere.  This will definitely be my home each time I visit Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome location!,"My husband and I traveled to Denver and stayed at the Crawford for 4 nights for our 10th wedding anniversary and couldn't have been more pleased.  The location couldn't be more central to everything.  We took the train right from the airport to the hotel-super easy. We had a rental car to pick up about a mile away and the front desk clerk drove us the in a Tesla which was super convenient.  Our room was super clean and cozy. Union station has everything you need- a few restaurants,  a bar, a sandwich shop, coffee shop, gift shops, and an ice cream shop. Snooze is a must for breakfast and you get priority seating if you let the hotel staff know the day before.  We spent a lot of time walking around the downtown area.  The Crawford is close to tons of restaurants,  Coors field, parks, shops, breweries, etc.  We had so much fun and highly recommend the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,There's no place like home... except The Crawford,"If you're in Denver on vacation, work or a stay-cation, stay at The Crawford! The location is incredible, you can be anywhere in the city in a matter of minutes - walk, drive, bike or train. The restored train station makes for a lovely boutique hotel.The rooms are gorgeous and I slept like a dream (the beds are oh so comfy!). I brought my dog with me and the staff was so welcoming; providing me with dog bowls, treats, a toy, bed AND a Furbo, so I could check in on my pup while I was away. To make it feel even more like home, the bath tub is heavenly, I could almost float in it! With all the luxuries of The Crawford, the staff is equally wonderful, great housekeeping staff, friendly front desk and concierge full of local tips. I would stay here again and highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful,The Crawford was an amazing place to stay in Denver! They had wonderful amenities and the location was perfect! The room was comfortable and clean. We stayed in a loft room which had beautiful wood beams and brick. I recommend it highly!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Very hip, but not super-functional","The hotel is actually inside the Amtrak station, so you walk through the train station waiting room to get to the check in desk, and then to get to your rooms.  It's a very cool vibe, but the rooms are nothing to write home about.  Rather small, and not worth the rather high prices the place commands.  I've stayed there twice now, and will be going with one of the other hotels right nearby in the future.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic Stay!,"You can't ask for better customer service! The front desk staff were professional, kind, and attentive. Our room was very clean. This hotel is close to everything and has countless amenities. We highly recommend!",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Experience,First review I have ever written. But had to spread the word about this place. Rooms are beautiful and are meticulously clean and decorated nicely. The front desk staff was super friendly and helpful with any questions we had. I could not speak more highly of this place. In the heart of Denver and so much fun all around.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great stay. ,Such a gorgeous property. Everyone there is so nice and the hotel is so spotless. I would defiantly come back again. Jordan was very helpful in giving me excellent directions. The amenities in the room far exceeded expectations. They even deliver chocolate truffles to my room which are my favorite,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Stay!,I had an outstanding stay int he city at the Crawford Hotel!  The staff was exceptionally accommodating with my particular needs.  The front desk staff made me feel welcome despite my constant requests.  Lara and Margot helped me track down some amazing flowers and chocolates for my girlfriend.  They truly made this stay-cation special.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing stay at The Crawford Hotel!,We had an amazing experience at the Crawford Hotel!  It all started at the front desk where our check in was smooth and they helped us get dinner reservations along with organizing the Tesla to drive us there.  Housekeeping helped us with all of our requests.  I believe Lara and Steven assisted us one day.  I fully recommend taking advantage of all the amenities they have to offer in downtown Denver.  A big thank you to their team!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Everything you could ask for in a CBD located,This hotel is THE place to stay in Denver. Centrally located within the fantastic redeveloped Union Station. The rooms are spacious and well appointed and the staff are always available to assist  where needed. But it is the Union station itself which makes a stay at the Crawford so memorable. The selection of high quality food/beverage and specialty stores within the building is very impressive - several with special deals for those staying at the Crawford.But why oh why has the  Crawford decided to levy the dreaded US$20/night 'Resort Fee' (payable at the hotel in addition to the accommodation charge) on those choosing to stay here? It is a real blight on what was otherwise a memorable part of my US vacation.  The imposition of the Back Door Resort Fee added to the published rates detracts from what would otherwise be a 5 star review.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Amazing Stay, Amazing Hotel!","My boyfriend and I decided to stay at The Crawford Hotel after our friends had such a great time.  The staff was beyond amazing- they were welcoming, friendly and attentive to everyone's needs. We were upgraded to a loft style room which was amazing with exposed brick walls and wooden beams.  The Tesla was an amazing touch and was able to take us to dinner nearby.  We loved all the little items you get being a guest- especially the craft beer and  ice cream.  We will most definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel Experience,"My husband and I stayed the Crawford as a stay-cation, while we sleep trained our twins. Our whole experience was delightful from check-in to check out. We stayed in the Pullman suite and were greeted with a sun-filled room that had its own lounge area and scrabble board on the wall. My favorite part was the super deep tub and the bedside essential oil diffuser. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Denver. It is at the hub of everything. We were able to walk to Jax fish house for happy hour and then walk around downtown afterward. I love that the room provided little goodies at the businesses downstairs; a happy hour beer at Terminal bar to priority seating at Snooze! I will definitely be returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,I was very disappointed!,"While the location - literally within bustling Union Station - is perfect, that's where my compliments stop. My ""gallery"" room faced the train station's main hall and the noise level was very loud until after midnight as travelers enjoy the vars and restaurants in the station. This was particularly annoying since I was assured at check-in that noise was not an issue in the ""well soundproofed"" rooms -- WRONG!! The furnishings in the tiny room belong in a Motel 6: deep scratches in the. cheap desk and large stains (from spills) on the table and nightstand. More stains in bathroom. Apparently no one is monitoring such things.  🤨  This hotel is expensive, so spend your money elsewhere!!",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Spot,"We live in Loveland and went to a concert in Denver so we spent the night at The Crawford Hotel.  It’s a perfect spot with the train.  The hotel is beautiful, extremely clean, and very comfortable with lots of amenities right there.  The staff is very friendly and we were especially impressed by Brian, the courtesy Tesla driver, who gave us a ride to the Pepsi Center.  We will definitely stay at the Crawford again when we have an event to attend in Denver and don’t want to drive home.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Valentine's Day Weekend!,"I travel a lot and missed Valentine's Day and took my girlfriend for a downtown Denver Valentine's Weekend the day after.  I have always wanted to stay at The Crawford Hotel and I was not disappointed.  The room was a deluxe loft on the 4th floor...loved the architecture of the brick and wood beams built into the room...the bed was amazingly comfortable and it was all so quiet from the hustle and bustle of Union Station.    Most notably, Jordan was like our personal concierge and took care of anything we needed...she made us feel so special and went above and beyond!  We also loved the Cooper lounge and found both Parker and Frank to be exceptional bartenders in both drink-making and conversation...we closed it down on Saturday night and it was such a short walk to our room…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Second time around,"My first visit did not go well. Heating issue. Parking issues. They called and asked to make it right and gave me a good reason to do it. We did. Room was great. The service top notch. The parking better ( still need more valet people). It’s a unique place and environment ( Union Starion Denver). Give it a try!  Best, Dave.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver stay-cation! ,"We are locals and Union station is one of our favorite places to explore - great selection of restaurants, Cooper lounge and the shops!   With that in mind we opted for a stay-cation date night and booked the Crawford Hotel.    Hotel room is lovely - we had deluxe loft on top floor.  Very unique space with the wood beams and character of the ceilings.  Well equipped room with nespresso machine, mini-fridge, bathrobes and lots of space.  We both spend a lot of time in hotels for our jobs, and what was so nice is that this didn’t feel like a normal hotel!    There were a couple service misses though!  My husband booked the date night package with the cooper lounge cocktail and appetizer.   A few days before we realized we didn’t have reservation for the Cooper Lounge. He called…",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent hotel,We had been to Snowmass for a skiing holiday & were unable to get back to Denver airport via the shuttle that we'd booked due to the I70 being blocked by a rockslide.  We ended up getting a train from Glenwood Springs to Denver Union station.  The train was running late & we didn't get in to Denver until about 23:00.  As we went into the station to get our luggage we noticed the Crawford hotel - as we hadn't planned on being in Denver we didn't have a hotel booked.  While my husband waited for the luggage I went to see if there were any rooms free - they had only one room available & it was a double to I took it.  The person who checked me in was very friendly & helpful.  After a long & stressful day we just wanted to get some sleep & the check in process was completed quickly. …,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,I Wanted To Like It,"We recently traveled from our home on the Western Slope of Colorado to Denver for a concert. Having lived in or near Denver for almost 25 years, we're big fans of the city and all it has to offer. We decided to stay at The Crawford Hotel because we're also big fans of rail travel and historic train stations, and The Crawford is located in the new newly-renovated Union Station.  What a disappointment! On arrival at Union Station we had to make our way through the waiting area -- which is basically a day-shelter for street people, or so it would appear. In addition to the traditional wooden benches found in old train stations, Union Station offers a large selection of upholstered couches and chairs. Unfortunately, most of them looked stained and dirty, and most were occupied by…",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique,"Just steps from the new transit line to/from DEN and Amtrak, this is a fun way to see a repurposed Union Station upper level turned into a luxurious and pristine hotel. Elements of the old building are all around in the unique rooms. Ours was very spacious with a well appointed bathroom that included a huge tub - for a perfect soak. There is so much to explore nearby in this new area of construction - the area has been transformed into a work, live, play neighborhood and is a perfect example of “what was old, can be amazing again.”  Hotel service was excellent. Food options abound. Don’t miss this! ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Just wonderful,"An absolutely amazing visit. Elegant decor, wonderful service. Complimentary Tesla drove us to a nearby restaurant recommended by the Crawford and we had the best evening! I will stay at the Crawford for all my future Denver visits. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel with Great Staff,"We stayed in the Crawford Hotel last week. What a tremendous place. We took a taxi from the airport  as we had 2 large bags and skis and were tired from  our UK flight. However it is possible to go by train. The front desk staff were superb, welcoming and efficient. We ate at Stoic and Genuine which is within the station itself. Again also good. The hotel has a courtesy car (a Tesla) and the following day they took us to the coliseum to attend the National Stock Show. They even picked us up in the evening to take us back to the hotel! The drivers were super, very friendly and courteous. That night we had a late snack at the Terminal Bar, again it was very good. The rooms at the hotel were super.  We stayed in a Pullman room which is reminiscent of a railway carriage. Large walk-in shower with gorgeous toiletries. Lots of space for cases and clothes and free bottles of water for each day of your stay. All in all it was an amazing start to our skiing holiday in Colorado!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great fun, huge rooms, very cool!","I travel to Denver weekly. First time here. Very cool, the room is huge and has 2 bathrooms. Very well appointed, great amenities and a great massive lobby with all kinds of action and places to eat. Perfect location too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Hotel and Great Location,"This Hotel is beyond beautiful! The location off of the train from the airport made it so easy to get to and was convenient when dragging luggage around. Inside Union Station there are multiple restaurant, bars and a coffee shop, ice cream shop and a deli. 16th street mall is close as well as some breweries and restaurants.  The staff was amazing and helpful.  The rooms were modern and beautiful, my only complaint was the bathroom door was a slider (which was beautiful) but there was always a gap, so you were always somewhat exposed when in the restroom. Having the rooms part of the lobby of the station was magnificent and beautiful!!! But when you closed your room door, you couldn't hear a peep from the lobby!  My only suggestion is I wish it had more munchies available (a vending machine or something at the front desk)  If you want a drink or something to snack on after everything closes, there is nothing available unless you leave the area to the closest convenient store which is quite a walk, especially at night.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beyond Expectations!!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Crawford Hotel! Beautiful Room, fabulous staff, great location. We come to Denver frequently to visit family and have stood in my of the top hotels and air bnb’s and this is by far my favorite! We can’t wait to come back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exceptional and Unique ,"Worth every penny for the convenience and beauty and staff. I asked for an early check-in and was our room was ready at 9:30 am! I believe the polite manner in which I asked without being at all demanding helped though! Beautiful room! Loved the amenities. I did struggle with working the fancy Nespresso though! I’ll be back! Downtown right outside Union Station and the free mall bus ride, shops and restaurants inside the station plus Amtrak!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved the Family Jones Distillery Tour and Union Station Tour,"My wife and I enjoyed a staycation at the Crawford.  In addion to the lovely accomodations at the Cewford and amenities at the Union Station, we enjoyed the Family Jones Disllery Tour.  After checking in to our breathtaking room with views of downtown Denver, we returned to the front curb where a Tesla Model X was waiting to silently whisk us to our distillery tour just across the river.  We tasted and learned about 7 different spirits and they also served us snacks and offered designer cocktails after the tour.  After the tour, we enjoyed the leisurely walk back to the hotel. The following day we toured Union Station with guide Ian who did a masterful job with a one hour education on the history of the building (including fascinating photos on his I Pad which included earlier versions of the buikding) and it’s place in Denver history.  There are wonderful preserved artifacts throughout the building which one may not see or notice without taking the tour.  Well done on all fronts.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,LOVED THIS HOTEL AND THE FOOD AND BAR OPTIONS,"Loved my one night in the Crawford.  But first, to set the mood, the Crawford is a hotel with rooms above the HUGE renovated Union  Station (which still has trains). You walk in and go through the station to the Crawford Hotel check in desk, which is a large kiosk on one side of the station, and then cross the huge atrium/seating area (filled with bars and restaurants) and go up to your room. In the meantime, every corner of the staton is filled with interesting bars and restaurants, including the amazing Mercantile (a James Beard awarded restaurant).  I travel extensively and have never seen a hotel set up like this.  Fortunately I pulled in on a Saturday night and the place was packed, and fun--which was great for me.  This is not a chill mellow hotel lobby---at least during the evenings.  The idea that someone had to take the Union Station and convert some of it into a hotel and most of it into bars and restaurants, and blend it in with an existing Amtrak Station----and put a great hotel above it----well---just brilliant.  Even though just outside my room was the huge atrium with bars and restaurants, and (simultaneous) Amtrak waiting aerea, my wonderful and comfortable room was absolutely quiet and the constant hum of the atrium was silenced.  So for the right kind of travel, this is an amazing hotel.  Now, don't know if it's for everyone as the valet parking is expensive and not directly in a typical hotel lobby but across a somewhat large outside expanse, and it's not under any kind of hotel arrival area.  I was coming back in a few weeks with a group of people to produce a commercial and while the hotel was great for our scout, it wasn't a hotel in the normal sense where you can find your team at the typical hotel bar or in the restaurant----as there were so many of them at the Crawford (and EXCELLENT ones) that you could lose your team.    So I would absolutely stay again in a second, but not necessarily with my group as it's not set up as a normal hotel is...but for some groups it may be absolutely perfect.  I see why it's usually rated #1 hotel in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Our first visit, hopefully not our last!","My wife and two kids stayed a couple nights and we loved it...great service, room with 20’ ceilings was beautiful and fun.  Convenient location to see downtown Denver attractions.  Loved the shower, in room controls on iPad, and bedding was very comfortable.  Also enjoyed shuffle board in the lobby, beer and great restaurant choices, and the complimentary ice cream.  Highly recommend!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Romantic staycation in downtown Denver,"My significant other and I live in Denver and spent the weekend at the Crawford in celebration of her birthday.  I also used the occasion to ask her to marry me, so I really wanted the hotel experience to be special.  For those who don't know the Crawford is located inside Union Station in downtown Denver. We love to take the train to downtown Denver and have always been interested in staying there.  The hotel does a fantastic job of providing intimate spaces for guests within the hustle and bustle of a metro commuter train station.  Check in was fast and efficient, the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful in pointing out amenities available during our stay.  Our room was on the third floor above the main station lobby area.  You would think there would be the potential for noise in our room from the busy crowded area below us, but we didn't hear a peep.  The rooms are converted office space from the station's past life, with soaring ceilings and gigantic windows.  The furnishings were elegant.   It was a perfect combination of historical charm with modern updates.  The bathroom was modern and featured an enormous shower, easily big enough for two, with a rainfall shower head.  I had ordered rose petals for the room floor and bed, as I intended to propose as soon as we were in the room. These were delivered without a hitch. The service was great, everyone we met had a smile, asked us how we were enjoying our stay and was there anything they could do for us.  Amenities include complimentary items from vendors located in the train station, including coffee, hand crafted ice cream and discounts at the deli.  You also receive priority seating at Snooze, a popular breakfast eatery located in the station.  Room service from Snooze is also available.  Union Station features one of Denver's most ""in"" cocktail lounges, the Cooper Lounge.  Hotel guests receive priority seating and discounted menu items.  The drinks there are amazing.  The hotel also provides complimentary Tesla car service within 2 miles of the hotel, which gives you access to anything and everything you could possibly want to do.  I'm sure all these things are noted on the hotel website as well, but I want to point out we took advantage of all the amenities and enjoyed everything.  All in all the hotel enhanced a very important weekend for us.  We will definitely plan future stays there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver's livingroom,"Adorable and impeccably restored hotel in Union Station. ""Denver’s livingroom,"" a saying we found very true. a most convenient and appealing offering with several unique in-house restaurants, a couple cute shops and unbelievably quiet rooms despite them being in working train station! Amenities include free drink at the in-house Terminal Tavern and free ice cream at the in-house Creamery, each day! 50 feet away from free mall shuttle which goes on the main tourism drag from the Contemporary Art Museum to the Fine Art Museum/Civic Center. The hallways feature vintage ads and original art. The rooms are well appointed with original and custom architectural features, and very high ceilings, huge windows and a high shower head and great water pressure. Definitely the place to stay in Lodo Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love this place!,"My husband and I stayed at The Crawford in late Oct and made a reservation for a last minute trip this month (one night). Unfortunately, when we booked, the loft rooms that we had enjoyed during our previous visit were sold out. When the concierge sent a “welcome” email several days before arrival, I asked if they would check for a loft room for us again. And YES! they were able to get us one! 😍Believe it or not, this hotel is SUPER quiet despite being in Union Station and near all the hot spots in Denver! Staff is very accommodating and lots of “treats” for guests at the local retailers in Union Station. A very “urban experience” for us Okies!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique hotel, fantastic staff","Enjoyed a company event at this hotel, and elected to stay a third night.  Great service, front of house very friendly.  Housekeeping is excellent.  Perfect place to stay in the event of inclement weather with choices of restaurants, bars and a few shops inside the hotel. Centrally located to LoHi, and of course downtown Denver.  We will definitely be staying again.  Thank you, Crawford Hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Motel 6 for 6 times the price ,"Since it has been two weeks since I wrote the following to GM Tiffany Owen with zero response, thought I would try a more transparent medium...My wife and I have stayed at the Crawford multiple times, including couple NYE’s in the past. This time we arrived around 4:30 pm (check in starts at 4) and they stated the “loft room” I had reserved was not ready...but they had a “classic room” ready. We were tired and ready to rest so I took the classic, room 429. It was a little noisy being on the outside hallway to the atrium, but bearable. Not sure why a reserved room was not ready when the reservation came up.At bed time, I shut the tall curtains to find out they would not shut all the way, leaving about 6 inches open. With the lights from outside, and the sun in the morning, those 6 inches kept the room bright at night and it was tough to sleep.The next day, as we were coming back from lunch around 330, we stopped at the front desk to tell them about the curtains and if they just had clips we could use to close them, the front desk lady said she would send up “engineering” to look at the problem.We held off on showers waiting for engineering, but they never showed. We finally called before we left for dinner around 630, and the front desk said they never got the order for engineering. Hmmmm.We returned back around 930pm to find that the slide door lock was left in between the door, keeping the door open and the room unsecured. We went inside our room to find no one was there. We quickly made sure nothing was stolen and called the front desk to see if engineering was done, since they left our door open, and also to inform them that this is unacceptable. While on the phone I could hear the clerk ask engineering if they we done and they stated they were, and that “there is nothing wrong with the curtains” and we were “ just being very picky”.The manager on duty came to talk to us to let us know leaving the door is unacceptable for their employees, and offered us an upgraded room. My wife was not feeling well and we didn’t want to pack all our stuff up so we didn’t take him up on his offer, but I wish we did as I tell you about the rest of the night.Around 10pm the “silent” disco NYE party started, woke up my wife and kept us awake. It was so loud you could hear every word the “silent” DJ was saying and the room vibrated from the bass. I went online to see what time the party would be over, and the hotel’s website said 1am. I know it was NYE , but it was ridiculous. At 110am the music and DJ we’re still going, so I called the front desk and they said it would be over at 2.We finally fell asleep when the music stopped at 140ish, only to be awoken to hammering and construction sounds of them disassembling the stage around 330am.Other things we noticed for a supposed classy nice hotel...you could not change what head the water came out of if the shower (there are two heads, one on ceiling and one on wall) as the switch was broken. There was pink mold in the corners of the shower and the faucet handles didn’t seem to be put in right as the whole thing moved around as you turned them. Video and pictures were taken of the condition.I’ve stayed in Holiday Inn’s and Marriott’s cleaner and with better service than this. Not worth what was paid.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Start of our Honeymoon was PERFECT.,"We came to the Crawford for the first 2 nights of our Honeymoon. The Crawford had to be one of the coolest hotels I've ever been too. First, we were complimentary upgraded because it was our honeymoon to the Crawford Suite: SO EPIC! :) They left us champagne and chocolates which I thought was so great. If we are ever back in Denver, we will absolutely stay here again!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great service & ammenities in a truly unique setting,"Wow - my partner and I stayed at the Crawford for nearly a week over the holidays. We wish we could have settled in for even longer. The rooms are comfortable and spacious enough, but the amenities, services, and location made the stay superior. Each day, you you can take advantage of the Oxford Spa Gym - a great downtown workout spa/gym, have coffee, ice cream, beer, and local, knowledgable staff. Jordan at reception and Dominic at management provided friendly, professional service and are both exceptional. They work hard and love what they do. Our room, like we asked, faced the interior of the train station, so during the holidays, the festive crowd lulled us to sleep like a city street. If you are sensitive to noise, ask for a room away from the interior. I travel extensively for work, but this hotel is worth the stay away from the typical high-end chain establishments. Soak up Denver, and enjoy yourself in this unique establishment. Thanks for the great visit!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Stay,"The Crawford Hotel is the absolute best place we have stayed when visiting Denver. The location was perfect and the room was beautiful, elegant, and very clean! The staff at the hotel will make sure you take advantage of all of the amenities that come with your stay (free ice cream, coffee, a beer and pizza slice from the different shops that are located in union station) and will go out of their way to make your stay 100% (shout out to Connor for going above and beyond). You won’t regret your stay at this historical hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Old School Hospitality,"We were given a gift certificate to The Crawford Hotel and finally had the time to use it in early December.  We had tickets to a Christmas show at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and decided to make a night of it.  We were greeted by the efficient and gracious Jordan upon our arrival.  She upgraded our room and explained the various amenities that comes with the room including a free scoop of ice cream from Milkbox Ice Creamery, free beer from the Terminal Bar, and courtesy transportation in a Tesla.  Our room (#304) was huge (love the high ceilings) and beautiful, and overlooked the train station.  I was struck by the wide hallways in the hotel, and how QUIET our room was.  I don't know if it was because of the time of year (the Holidays), or if Union Station and the surrounding area is always so busy and crowded with people, but it felt as if we were miles away in our room.  I barely heard the train bells.It was a treat to spend the weekend at the Crawford.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Magical Holiday Experience!,"In the throes of Black Friday madness, we stepped into that great hall; it was beautifully decorated, and we were welcomed with a warm reception and a flurry of holiday entertainment that can only be showcased in such a grand venue of the restored train station.  The music was great and the energy was festive and positive.  The room was beautiful, and we were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary bottle of Champaign in our lovely loft suite.  The amenities were great with provisions for a great bubble bath and bath robes.  Everything about our experience was fantastic from the friendly hotel staff to the awesome Christmas production performers.  Events included the lighting of the tree, musical bell ringers, and even St. Nicholas.  I can't say enough about the great holiday experience at the Crawford Hotel--great amenities, great vibe, great food, and great martinis. :-) Thanks to everyone on staff that weekend!",5

WiFi was decent and the shower stall was big enough for 4! However, the housekeeping service was pretty awful. They only made my bed both days. I didn’t get new coffee pods or clean cups or more towels. The first day I called down and asked for these items. The second day I didn’t bother because the person who brought the stuff up was rude as if I was the problem. For what they charge you’d think the service would be better.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel .. great location..,"Is like traveling to the past with all the modern day amenities, the location is perfect, right downtown, great bars and restaurants in the first floor/lobby which is a working train station... Great place to visit even if not staying there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,First class service in a unique setting,"Housed in a train station, the hotel offers a unique environment with first class service.  The check in is in the station surrounded by stores, restaurants and shops, none of which are part of the hotel.  The station is filled with chairs, benches and couches buzzing with people from all walks of life.  Ian and Riley provided outstanding personal service during my stay.  Each time I came to the desk they somehow remembered my name despite talking to countless people each day.The room was a unique loft that was comfortable and welcoming, something important if you travel a lot.  It wasn't a typical hotel room.I was staying for the weekend, but could stay at The Crawford because it was booked.  They willingly took me to my next hotel in their Tesla.  The driver, whose name escapes me was friendly and professional.  He even carried my bags into the hotel I was checking in to.There is no doubt that I will be staying at The Crawford for future trips, both personal and business.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Downtown convenience,"This was our second stay at The Crawford Hotel at Union Station.  We love the hustle and bustle of the train station, shops and restaurants juxtaposed with getting on the elevator and going to a peaceful, quiet retreat being our room.  Staff is wonderful.  Rooms are comfortable and clean. Some funky elements such as faucets working backwards or hot water taking a tad of time to get warm, but nothing offensive. Rooms are well appointed. It was extra specific for the holiday season, beautifully decorated and so alive!  We love the convenience of being at the train station and heading right to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience,"The hotel is in the train station so if you are looking for a traditional full service hotel, this isn't that. However, in the atrium of the train station, of which the hotel rooms overlook, there are restaurants, cafes and a common seating area which is a great place to meet people or do some work. There are many restaurants within short walking distance from the hotel which makes it great for walking around if you have the time. The rooms are spacious. Highly recommended.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Comfortable, convenient, a bit noisy","Stayed here for business for a couple of days around the holidays, nice central location, good restaurants to choose from on the main level. Changed rooms after the first night due to street noise, no problems.  Rooms a bit smallish but well appointed.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,First-Rate. I hope to return very soon.,"A wonderful experience from beginning to end. I can't say enough positive things about our stay at the Crawford.Being the start of the Christmas season, Union Station was remarkably busy. The energy and bustle in the great hall of the station was exciting. But only steps away, our lovely room was quiet, peaceful, and comfortable. The room was so quiet, it took effort to hear the arriving and departing trains outside, even though visible from the window and merely steps away.Our ""Pullman"" guest room had a modern and attractive art deco vibe. The beautiful and roomy bathroom featured C.O. Bigelow luxury toiletries. The bedside iPad not only provided music choices, but fast communication with the concierge. We appreciated being able to select a time for housekeeping service, and the hotel help arrange reservations at restaurants within walking distance. Though we didn't watch much, there were better TV channel choices than in many other hotels.The amenities at the Crawford are quite special, too. Union Station has many dining choices under the roof, plus many more only minutes away. The complimentary Milkbox Creamery ice cream was a special treat.We loved the Crawford and look forward to our next stay there when in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect!,"We stayed at The Crawford for our honeymoon, it was amazing. The building itself is absolutely stunning! It has multiple restaurants, bars and boutiques and is also near 16th st. Mall. We never rented a car since everything was near and the hotel can shuttle you around in their Tesla. We most definitely enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotels, spectacular and unique rooms","Stayed here on a business trip.  My room was great and reasonably priced.  Plenty of dining options within a very short walking distance too.  Would definitely stay here again and I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a unique, historic hotel.  P.s.  the bathroom was incredible!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Engagement luxury,"This is a beautiful old hotel above union station downtown Denver.  We spent one night here, and my now fiancé proposed to me in our room.  He had so much help from Kyle, who truly made our night memorable.  We had a corner room over looking downtown, and had breakfast in the bed in the morning from Snooze.  Kyle even brought us a bottle of champagne to congratulate us!  This hotel is the true idea of luxury, and I have no complaints.  We will be coming back yearly for our anniversary!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Restoration,"The hotel is in a great location in an amazing building. Loved having all the shops, restaurants and bars on the first floor. It was also decorated for Christmas which made it even that more festive.  The only reason gave it a 4 vs. a 5 was because of our room.   Don't get room 432, it was right by the door entrance which we heard open and close all day/night and we barely had a window; it was a little sliver not even at eye height.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location!,"We drove up from Greenwood Village for  an amazing staycation at the Crawford Hotel. The hotel is perfectly located right in Union Station.  We went to the Terminal Bar, Stoic and Genuine, Ultria, and Cooper, all amazing restaurants right in the terminal so no need to go anywhere if you want to stay put. There was a holiday market outside on Wynkoop to enjoy and a short walk over to the 16th street free mall shuttle which makes enjoying downtown Denver so easy.  The hotel staff was so accomodating with our request for an early check-in and pointing out the hotel amenities. My only suggestion with the room is to install a night light or dimmer in the bathroom so you can safely walk down the step from the bedroom to the bathroom without leaving the bright bathroom light on. Comfortable bed, quiet sleeping, lots of fun people watching. We will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Must experience ,"Flawless hospitality and comfort at great value. Experience modern life stepping back in time.Not a detail missed that I could notice.Could not be easier, off the plane, on train, in room.                                                           Need to get nearby? Someone will drive you. Lots to do all around.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Why stay anywhere else?,"What a charmed visit! Taking the light rail from Denver International to Union Station finishes at the front doors to this fabulous and historic property. Yes, it was Thanksgiving week, making it feel a bit magical, but anytime would work. The hustle and bustle of a high-end station-hotel lobby makes the luxurious quiet of the rooms even more rewarding. Get a room with a bath (although their showers are pretty exceptional). The service is impeccable and friendly, the bed is a lesson in comfort. After describing it to one friend, he said that we should spend the week at the hotel and skip visiting family. If only...",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lovely!,"Had a great time at The Crawford!The staff was lovely, the atmosphere was SO lively and the room was perfect. The little touches like robes and slippers, delicious chocolate at turndown and the Nespresso machine really made a great impression. Plus, you are in such close proximity to all of the downtown Denver fun. Will definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Worth the splurge!,"It was the start of my birthday weekend, and we splurged for one night before we headed to the mountains. It was definitely worth the splurge! The front desk clerk was professional, friendly and efficient. The room was luxurious and uniquely styled. We used a key card to get into our hallway, and once inside the noise level from the lobby of the train station magically disappeared. So well insulated that we never heard a sound of any kind all night long. We were in a Deluxe Classic room. I think the Pullman rooms are the ones you see around the open area of the lobby, and I'm not sure I'd want to stay in one of those. But the quality of the hotel was so nice, that I would bet those rooms are virtually sound-proofed as well. I don't know if we'll ever have the chance to stay at The Crawford again, but I would definitely do it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Ideal location, elegant hospitality","If you need to be in Denver for early morning meetings, don't try to drive in, stay at the Crawford!  Elegant hospitality, excellent breakfast spot, remarkably quiet.  Coupons for ice cream and coffee at small shops in Union Station.  I had trouble figuring out the tablet controller for morning alarm, too high tech for me.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stayed at The Crawford Hotel to visit our son in Denver.,"Room was unique and excellent in décor and amenities!  Service throughout our stay was exceptional.  Great location and walking distance to so many venues, restaurants, etc.  We plan to stay there again soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Take Me Back!,"I live in Denver but recently stayed at the Crawford Hotel because we have a baby and my house was under construction. I was nervous to stay in a hotel with her for the first time but the hotel staff helped put us in an awesome room that had two sections so she could nap in one and I could hang out in the other. The room was absolutely beautiful and sparkling with everything we needed to feel at home. Being in Union Station was so much fun!! Every morning we’d walk down to Mercantile for pastries and coffee, it was like being in Europe. The room service in the evening was perfect too. I’m having withdrawals from life at the Crawford... highly recommend it!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to stay when in downtown Denver,"We have stayed at the Crawford several time and love it. It is close to the 3 major sports venues, opera house, light rail, downtown shopping and restaurants. All the shops and restaurants at Union Square are wonderful, plus you get a deep discount at most. The rooms are luxurious and impeccably clean. The staff is extremely helpful, kind and they all have a smile on their face.It is our place to go when in Denver and plan on staying many more times.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Over the top!,"I recently returned from a 30-day journey around the country, and the Crawford was one of the highlights of my trip. Just as other reviewers have stated, the hotel is convenient, charming, and reasonably priced. However, it is the excellent customer service that sets the hotel apart from other beautiful properties. Kyle and Sydney at the front desk were consistently friendly and helpful and in fact, are the reason I chose to return for another night a few days later. Myles could not have been more pleasant or helpful driving me to buy a new pair of prescription sunglasses. I will return to Denver and will definitely stay at the Crawfor again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect stay at the Crawford,"As you walk through the hustle and bustle of the gorgeous Union Station, you are greeted at the front desk by friendly hosts. Up an elevator to the guest rooms that are spacious, high ceilings, and where old meets modern. The room we stayed in was a split level room the the living area slightly raised. The bedroom was cozy and the bathroom was huge! The tub was perfect!! ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,2 days. Efficient ,"If you never spent much time in Denver this is a great place to start. Big rooms, high ceilings nestled in a Renovated train station.  The Crawford rides the rails between hip, nostalgic and functional. I would stay again but also excited to explore other hotels. Maid service comes late in afternoon and beds are little on the soft side but all was good!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top notch,"The hotel is attached to Union station and both are restored to the original beauty.  The hotel has many food choices from deli, to upscale and walking distance to many others. The hotel itself was fantastic, high ceilings, luxurious bedding and great bathroom and showers.  I'm hooked, I wouldn't stay anywhere else while in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Looks nice,The hotel is convinient and spectacular. It’s right at the union station so that people travelling by train won’t worry about missing one by staying somewhere else downtown or paying for parking in a parking garage. The mini fridge includes 2 16.9 oz bottled waters. Highly reccomend it.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Excellent location, price, staff, and room !","The Crawford Hotel has all the modern luxuries, yet the look and feel of a 1940s retro hotel.  The location is above Union Station in Denver, with easy access to everything downtown.  The price is much lower than the huge hotels a few blocks away.  The staff are extraordinarily friendly, plus they gave me great suggestions on where to eat and other needs.  And, finally, the room was nice and tidy, just what you would expect from a wonderful hotel.  I would stay there anytime.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Our New Favorite Hotel in Denver!!,"We stay in Denver often over the weekends for the great food and fun. We normally stay at the Four Seasons, Hotel Teatro, Ritz Carlton or Brown Palace. We just tried the Crawford and they have stole us away! This hotel is so much fun! The location is fantastic. The staff is superb and the rooms are so five star. Especially the Loft Suites. We loved the whole idea and concept of the Union Station Lobby along with all the eateries and bars. The energy was exciting and upbeat and makes for a great place to stay. At the same time the rooms are quiet and tranquil. My wife and I could not believe how much we enjoyed this hotel. We have stayed at fine hotels all over the world and we were so impressed at this one. They also do a wonderful job of adding some cool amenities that include the merchants in Union Station. The Cooper Lounge was another one of the many great things about this experience. My wife and I had two more trips to Denver planned and we were going to stay at one of our other hotels but will be cancelling those rooms and booking at Crawford. Don't make the mistake of not staying here! It is GREAT!! Can't wait to go back again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lots of promise but overall was disappointed,"I booked this hotel because it was quirky and boutique - a former railway station sounded really cool.  The exterior of the building is beautiful and the interior is too, to a degree.  I was immediately surprised to find that the hotel “lobby” wasn’t really a lobby but effectively a wide open public space with cafes, shops and bar with members of the public and tourists roaming around in it.  This meant it was congested and noisy all of the time.  When I checked in I was told my room wasn’t available but another similar sized room was - I accepted.  The room was very small - shockingly so compared to the photographs on booking.com .  I asked to revert back to the originally planned room which they kindly allowed me to do but was surprised to find that room not being much bigger.  Overall I concluded that the pictures were very misleading.  This, combined with the chaotic ground floor / lobby / railway waiting room / bar / cafe / Gelateria led to this not being the best hotel experience.  I think the lobby for the hotel should be separate from the chaos so that it improves the experience of guests.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, perfect downtown location","The Crawford Hotel has quickly become one of our favorite places to stay in Denver!  First off, the hotel is embedded in the former plaza of the Denver Union Station train station, which now doubles as a half-public-space half-retail destination.  Surrounded by several great restaurants and bars, shops and interactive spaces, the hotel is ground zero for all the hustling and bustling excitement of Denver.  Furthermore, the hotel is connected to the train and bus station - literally, right out the back door of the hotel and you can hop a 30 min train to the airport, hit the central bus terminal, or take lightrail to most any other suburb of Denver. The redevelopment does an excellent job of paying homage to the buildings historic past as the logistical hub for people moving in an earlier time. On the other side, one step out the front door of the hotel has you smack dab in downtown Denver's historic LoDo district (lower downtown), with more breweries, bars and restaurants in walking distance than you could ever visit.  Just a couple blocks north is Coors Field, where during our stay the Colorado Rockies hit a walk-off home run to help them make the 2018 playoffs.  You could hear the crowd's roars spilling over the walls of the ballpark and down into the streets and alleys - a pretty cool experience. The hotel rooms and amenities are beautiful, and from what I understand, each room is uniquely shaped and designed as it was retrofitted into the original train station building.  The 2nd floor off our room featured a speakeasy of sorts, called Cooper Lounge, which seemed to only have access to hotel guests, Although a cunning adventure seeker could figure out how to make their way up to the bar, it's definitely not obvious from the plaza below. Service from staff and the surrounding retailers was excellent.  The environment of downtown Denver paired with this historic redevelopment masterpiece should be on everyone's bucket list. Overall, a fantastic hotel and a fantastic stay.  Although a little pricey compared to other downtown options, the Crawford is well worth it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,LOVE this hotel!!,"The Crawford Hotel is a truly unique and fun experience. I have traveled all over the world and was blown away by how special the Crawford is! We stayed in the loft which was lovely, comfortable and has very cool architecture! When you enter Union Station you may be a little confused about where to check in to the hotel, just look at the signs (which are clever) above the shops. People watching is the best, much more fun than a traditional hotel lobby!  Make sure to take full advantage of the $20 amenity fee. This gets you ice cream, beer, coffee and lots of other discounts to use in Union Station. No catches, just show your room card. The hotel is in the heart of Lodo, close to almost everything you need or want! We can't wait to go back~",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Five stars…BUT ..!!!!,"Lets deal with the BUT first. We were in room 325 , the door from the bedroom to the bathroom was frosted glass. Why? When one used the toilet at night, and switched on the light, the light little impeded by the glass washed over the room  waking my wife.  There is a trend among hotel designers to use glass  with varying degrees of opacity in the bath room door. Why? I want to meet the guest who on booking said “give me the room  with the glass bath room door so I can wake my partner through the night with my nocturnal evacuations, and they can have the  unbridled joy of seeing my flabby distorted  form performing these acts of relief.” Who is this customer? The glass bathroom door is an act of design desperation craving difference in a crowded market. Doubtless there was a staff meeting where the Head of Marketing said “ we will dominate the  hotel market  not just by well appointed rooms at  competitive prices, supported by superb staff; we are going to dominate this sector through the raw innovation  of  glass in the bathroom door.”  Cue applause by the owner's  corporate  myrmidons incapable of grasping the practical reality. If you have read thus far thank you I  feel better now. The glass bathroom  is  a design flaw in an otherwise great hotel, built round an interesting space. The Crawford is in  the old, but still functioning Denver Union station. This is a superb location, centre of down town Denver,  you can catch trains across the west and more importantly to the airport. One of the joys of the Crawford  is you can stay in central Denver and not need a car. Our room was on the 3rd  floor, the door opening on to a balcony that over looked the central concourse. The concourse is a public space, with a variety of good eateries and bars, and is abuzz with life, so different from the solemnity of the traditional  hotel lobby.  However abuzz means noise and I was concerned this would be a noisy room . It was not. The  thick, insulated door, halted all emanations, this was a triumph of noise suppresion design. The room was quiet, well appointed , Nespresso machine, good wifi , comfortable bed.  All  supported by well trained staff, truly helpful, friendly, and competent.  I would happily go back if they solved the glass bath room door issue.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A True Five Star Experience,"I have never before stayed at a hotel where before I even left, I was saying to myself that I needed to come back. The Crawford is a truly unique and wonderful experience, from the wooden beams that break through the rooms to the absolutely top notch staff who will go above & beyond for you. Everything about the stay is absolute luxury.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Greta,"Many thanks to Riley - best courtesy car driver ever - for the r/t to the Fillmore last Sat. eve (Greta Van Fleet was truly awesome... much love to the Fil. as well). This was our forth stay at The Crawford, the room was most excellent (love the high ceilings), the entire staff was great as usual and the location simply cannot be beat. The selection of food, libations and shopping in Union Station is impressive (Pigtrain Coffee is superb... their cro-nuts are my new addiction). We're already looking forward to our next stay, see you then.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"Spent 2 nights at the Crawford. The staff were very friendly and professional. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated and clean. The rooms was very quiet, never heard anyone above. below or next to us. The building itself is majestic and historic. Many wonderful restaurants within walking distance of hotel. Would definitely stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,One of the best and most unique hotel stays I've had,"We were only able to stay one night at The Crawford after a last minute decision to visit Denver, but it was such a memorable stay.  Walking into the Union Station lobby made us stop and drop our jaws... it's beautiful and vibrant.The woman at the desk generously offered us a choice of rooms on the 3rd floor (high ceilings, views of the train tracks) or the 4th floor loft.  We switched to the 3rd floor and were very happy with the room, which was luxurious and romantic.We ate downstairs that night and at Snooze the next morning.  Both meals were fantastic.  I am vowing right now that I am coming back to Denver and I'm staying at The Crawford again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,OUTSTANDING!!!,"I’m somewhat late in writing this review, but my wife and I will never forget the most gracious, kindest  team at The Crawford Hotel.  From the moment of checking-in and throughout our most pleasant stay, The Crawford Hotel will always be our only choice of stay in Denver.  Great people do make a great difference.  The room was spotlessly clean, a must have for us, and location, location – couldn’t be better;specially if traveling by Amtrak. D & R Cogdill.",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Absolutely amazing!,"We are from Seattle where we think we have pretty good restaurants, bars and hotels. This place blows our downtown away! The Crawford is a place every traveler should experience. It is just that, an experience. The service from even before we checked in when the concierge called me personally to confirm our stay and let me know they were upgrading our room (who does that?!) and he made our reservation for us at Cooper Lounge(a must do swanky bar with scratch cocktails), since it was a Friday night he didn’t want us to not get in. Upon arrival, our room was not only ready early but upgraded to a gorgeous corner room with 18 foot ceilings and beautiful decor. Located in the train station with coffee shops, bars, restaurants, shops all within steps from your room and to the fun…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great historical place,The hotel itself has certain charm. It is placed in original building of central train station that is there since end of 19th century. The main hall or the train station is at the same time also a reception area for the hotel.  The rooms are relatively small but the ceiling hight makes the room more spacious than they really are. The hotel does not offer food but there is variaty of restaurants around to dine. Hotel offers free water and free shuttle service with Tesla X around the town which actually you pay 20 USD per day. All in all nice experience however overpriced.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Plus customer service!!,"My wife and I were booked here by Pack Up and Go and couldn't be happier.  From the moment we walked in to the beautifully renovated train station / lobby were treated exceptionally well.  The front desk people are all great and go out of their way to be accommodating.  The ride in the Tesla is a must, we took that to Linger for Dinner and Austin was a great driver.  We love how active the lobby is and the Cooper Lounge has great drinks and appetizers.  The central location is perfect for visiting Denver. We will without a doubt be back to the Crawford Hotel!",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,THE BEST PLACE WE HAVE EVER STAYED AT !!!!!!!!,"Stayed at the Crawford twice. Three(3) days in August and three(3) days in early September for our 50th wedding/honeymoon anniversary trip throughout Colorado and Utah riding trains and visiting National Parks.  We got upgraded both stays. Our first stay was under the ""linger a while"" promotion, but our second stay was at full price. However, the upgrades made it more palatable. Very handy, coming and going by AMTRAK. The staff was super excellent. Cortney, Connor, Margo, Sidney, Miles, Riley, Orianna(sp) and others whose names escape me. But, most of all, IAN  was superb in getting us dinner reservations to the ""ODYSSEY"", a small intinment Italian restaurant and tickets to the Carol  King Musical ""BEAUTIFUL"".

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Golden Age of Travel,"Glorious architecture, gracious staff and thoughtful details combine to make this hotel a new favorite for me. Its setting in historic Union Station, now restired to her former elegance, is only the beginning.   Being delivered in style in the hotel’s Tesla to a nearby destination was the height of pampering; and that’s even before I met friends in the elegant Cooper Lounge and later, sauntered down to select my complimentary scoop of ice cream at the neighboring creamery.  My small room couldn’t have been more charming. Now scheming about how I can plan a return trip ... pronto!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Our trip was so delightful because of our stay at the Crawford,"The location could not be more perfect, and the front desk was most helpful each day.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,THE.BEST.PLACE to stay in Denver,We stayed at the Crawford hotel in the historic Union Station for a short 2 night stay for a concert at Pepsi Center in early August.  We took the $9 A-line train right to Union Station from the airport which was REALLY nice because we didn’t have to rent a car or Uber from the airport.  The new train service from the airport to downtown Denver/Union Station makes such a difference.  Everything is so walkable.  Definitely take advantage of the Crawford’s courtesy Tesla!  They will take you and/or pick you up anywhere within 2 miles.  We took the Tesla to the Pepsi center and were blown away by the car - the driver was really nice too ;).  I would also recommend that you make reservations as I did to eat breakfast at Snooze on your last day.  There was over an hour wait on a…,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed here for two nights after a trip to South Dakota before the train trip back to Chicago and beyond. We had a LoDo suite. It was pricey, but more than worth the price. Our eight-year-old granddaughter loved it. It had a large full bath and a half bath, a living room, and a bedroom that were on two different levels. it's unique in that the rooms are built around the existing timber in the original structure. There's a $20/day fee, but it offers benefits (ice cream, coffee, drinks, 20 percent discount in some of the restaurants, preferential reservations at restaurant for breakfast) that made up for it. Our train ran late and they let us use it even after checkout as we were going to be in the station all day. There are a lot of nice, trendy shops and restaurants in the…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A timeless stay,I stayed at the Crawford for one night while in Denver and it was an incredible experience.

Our room was comfortable; we could hear some occasional noise from the train - altho not a huge issue, next time we will try the street side! Otherwise for such a busy place the hotel is extremely quiet; once you get past the locked doors (great security here) into the actual hotel hallways etc it's amazing - you would never know you are at a busy train station.

I arrived way before check in and they exceeded my expectations. Can’t wait to experience the rest of this beautiful hotel!  More review to come. ,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Short stay in Denver,"Absolutely perfect experience. The Crawford in a great area, and part of the beautifully renovated Union Station.  The station itself has so much to offer, from Pig Train coffee to the awesome Terminal Bar. The Crawford rooms are unique, incorporating may elements of the original Union Station. The rooms are also quite spacious. But the best part of the visit was the wonderful Crawford staff - super professional and pleasant and knowledgeable of the history of their wonderful establishment.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique (in a good way) , comfortable, and convenient hotel","This unique hotel is conveniently located INSIDE Denver's very comfortable Union train station and is reached by the light rail which runs directly from the airport. The rooms at the Crawford Hotel are located on the floors overlooking the interior of the station. Some are train themed, and some are decorated in the style of a bygone era. Our room was extremely comfortable ( really comfortable king sized bed too!) and had all of the usual conveniences. The rooms are reached by elevator or stairs. In order to make the elevator ascend, if you go upstairs by elevator, or open the door to the hall, if you walk up the stairs, you have to use your hotel key card, so security is good. Everyone can walk out of the hotel hall and look down at the activity in Union Station.  We had an…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful hotel in the center of everything ,"I stayed here for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it! The lobby is a vibrant space that also doubles as a transit station - that means there’s always something interesting going on no matter the time of day. You can get beer, ice cream coffee and even pizza all in the lobby. It’s also extremely convenient to the airport light rail, we also took the RTD bus to Boulder for the day for only $4.50.  The room was beautiful with high ceilings, plenty of space and a very comfortable bed. This was the first hotel I’ve stayed in that I couldn’t hear a peep from any other hotel guests, no doors slamming or noisy people in the hallway. A refreshing change! If you want to be in the heart of LoDo this is a classic and fun place to stay. ",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver -- One of the Most Unique Anywhere!,"The Crawford Hotel is one of those ""must stay"" places in the world that makes travel fun and memorable whether for business or leisure. As a long ago native of Denver, it is remarkable to see how this former downtrodden Union Station locale has been completely transformed into the epicenter of the supercool buzzy LoDo district. The number of excellent high end restaurants, bars and fun casual places to eat in and around Union Station is simply amazing,   The Crawford rooms are clean and comfortable (I recommend the larger higher floor rooms with tall ceilings). The hotel service is both very friendly and highly professional. And the freebies and discounts included in the Crawford's amenity fee make it the one of the very few I've seen that are worth the money -- free Terminal…",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Gorgeous hotel with so much history,"This hotel was amazing. The little things like coffee and robes were nice, but we stayed here for the history. We stayed in a third floor room which the concierge mentioned were office spaces in the station's past life. Amazing. High ceilings, creaky floors, beautifully redone and and amazingly helpful staff.  You get a lot of perks for staying at the hotel like free ice cream downstairs and a discount on drinks; take advantage of them! It's makes the room's price tag a bit easier to swallow. :) The ice cream was SO GOOD. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An Amazing Stay in Denver!!!,"We were in Denver visiting family and thoroughly enjoyed everything about The Crawford Hotel and Union Station.  The staff is so welcoming and professional.  Each and every one of them made sure our stay was fabulous.  The rooms are amazing and so wonderful to relax in after a busy day about town.  The complimentary Tesla will take you around town within 2 miles of the hotel.  The hotel is located in the middle of the excitement of Denver and some of the excitement of Denver is located in the middle of the hotel!!

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,OUTSTANDING HOTEL INSIDE UNION STATION!,"The Crawford Hotel is located inside the terminal of Denver’s bustling transportation and restaurant/bar scene. The hotel itself is first class. Kyle at the front desk set the tone of gracious hospitality as we checked in. The room was spacious, sparkling clean and amenities were perfect. It’s one of the just coolest hotel experiences, especially paired with all the food and beverage outlets within Union Station. I’m definitely going back for a longer stay. And hope Kyle is there to be of assistance. Daniel H. - Dallas",5

The nicest in which I've ever stayed.  Unique.  It's so nice to spend time in Union Station.  You can visit for a cup of coffee, breakfast, snack, lunch, drink or dinner.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,New Favorite in Denver,"Great location, beautiful, bustling space, well designed rooms. Stayed here with husband and 2 year old daughter for a weekend. Was the perfect home base for wanderings around Lodo. Loved having breakfast in the central common area as well as ice cream after dinner. My daughter played for hours in the fountain outside on a particularly hot afternoon. We stayed in a lodo suite. Really liked the room only caveat was the lack of windows. Only one in the sitting area, none in the bedroom. Room was beautiful and well appointed otherwise. Will be our Denver go to.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Jewel in Union Station,"Newly renovated Union Station has a real vibe in the lobby, it is a real train station with bar, restaurant, shops, totally clean and vibrant, location is close to Coors Field, near a lot lot lot of restaurants and shopping. Room was a bit small but had really high ceiling so felt roomy, big big window too. Parking was by valet only. The only nit I had was the $20 amenities fee, but truth be told it gets you a free coffee, beer, ice cream etc. which being the cheap SOB that I am, since I already paid for it, I got all of it.  A real nice place, I was pleasantly surprised by all of it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful stay in heart of Denver!,"We stayed one night with our 7 yr old grand-daughter who loved the attic room where we stayed. For us adults, it was quiet and comfortable yet just steps away from dynamic downtown Denver. Room was upscale and spotless. Staff was friendly and helpful. We loved it and will be back asap!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotel and location, book ahead for Snooze!","First time in Denver and the Crawford was a great hotel for me and my friend to explore the city from. Great rooms and location, and an amazing facial at their sister hotel the Oxford just over the street. The only disappointment was even as hotel residents, they couldn’t get us a reservation at the supposedly famous Snooze for brunch... if you want it, I’d book well in advance. Maybe next time!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Accommodation & Amenities! ,"After a 2 week trip around the southwest of CO , we checked into the Crawford Hotel  for some R& R and site seeing. We did not have a aut It was the perfect place ! it was immaculate And we had everything we could have wanted ! We had no automobile with us and planned to take the train to the airport the next evening.. it was perfect! The hotel provided a Tesla & driver to  the botanical Gardens . There is also several places to eat in the Unions Station and we took advantage of the Snooze Restaurent as well as Coopers lounge & the Terminal ! We had coffee & Ice Cream in others sweet shops @ the station. The rooms were unique and beautifully appointed! Very comfortable! I’ve already told several friends to add this to their travel plans!

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,What an End to my Trip!,"Stayed here to catch the Train. And what a blast. I love how the hotel is now a part of the station. Front desk were so helpful, as the train was delayed and they allowed me back into my room at 0800hrs to wait until midday when the train was ready. Really helpful. Its so classy. I loved the Cocktail Bar and then we were able to use the Tesla to get a ride downtown. Wow. Made my sisters night. Highly recommended. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Red Rocks Central ,"My wife and I stayed at The Crawford in mid July for our first trip to Red Rocks.

I asked for some help putting together a picnic dinner for our trip to Red Rocks and Paloma, Kyle and several others took care of everything. They were amazing. I won’t stay anywhere else in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very nice,"Enjoyed the hotel located at the Union Station just a block from Coors Field. Very convenient for eating and shopping. Rooms were very nice with several amenities included - free beers, preferential seating, ice cream, etc. this area of town is really being rebuilt and a fun place to stay. ",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stayed at the Crawford in late July 2018,"I have been to Denver quite a few times over the last twenty years, but have never stayed in the LoDo area.  The company I visited placed me at the Crawford during a busy week in July 2018 (I'm told the area hotels had a 85%+ occupancy rate at the time).  Normally, I rent a car to get around Denver, but the company suggested using the RTD trains, and staying in LoDo (Lower Downtown).  I have to say, this advice was excellent.  Basically, I just walked out the doors in Denver Airport, bought a train pass at the kiosk, hopped the RTD train to Union Station, and walked a few steps to the Crawford.  I'm a fan of historic properties in the first place, but this whole concept of taking a train to my hotel was an extremely pleasant trip back to the late 1800s!  Union Station is a…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wow staff!,"Just returned from a short business trip to Denver and loved this property. 9.5/10 lost .5 as I would prefer a hard surface wood or slate throughout room rather than carpet but that’s a personal preference.  Kudos to the staff who went beyond on service. Anya at the desk amongst other things recommended we take the convenient train back to the airport. Great saving! The use of a driver and hotel Tesla for short trips was awesome. Drivers,  Myles and Austin, were so friendly and we thank them for their helpfulness. All in alll would highly recommend this property!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel. Great Service. Great Location,Wonderful Hotel. Union Station in Denver is a great place to visit.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Most Beautiful Hotel in Downtown Denver!,"My husband and I stayed at the Crawford Hotel for our anniversary and it was THE best experience I have ever had! Upon arrival, the front desk staff were exceptionally friendly. They explained everything that was included with our stay, including a free ice cream scope from Milkbox and a $5 menu at their Copper Lounge, which is a bar on the second floor of Union Station. I live in Denver so this was a quick get-away for my husband and I. However, the experience we had was so over the top that it truly felt like we were on VACATION! The staff also welcomed us with a bottle of Champagne and two glasses in our room since they knew it was our anniversary! I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Can't say enough AMAZING things about this hotel!!,"We're so happy we chose this hotel for our first visit to Denver!! Couldn't have asked for a better location and the deluxe loft room exceeded our expectations. Also, the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating... in particular Mara and Dominic. They made us feel welcome and went above and beyond to make our stay amazing.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Gorgeous hotel and amazing customer service,"This hotel is one of a kind! We stayed in the Loft Delux room and the room was so unique with high vaulted ceiling, original exposed brick, and beautiful wood beams! It’s by far one of my favorite hotels to date! Mara at the front desk checked us in and she was absolutely amazing! She went out of her way to make sure that our stay here was extra special! It was a great way to start off our first time to Denver!The hotel offers a complimentary Tesla service, free beer at the bar in union station, along with many more amenities! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and next I come back to Denver there is no doubt in my mind that I will be staying here!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exceptional hotel in downtown Denver,"Could not possibly say enough good things about The Crawford.  It's part of Union Station, which means you're in the middle of tons of options for dining and entertainment, and just a short walk from seeing the Rockies play.  It also means noise could be an issue, but it wasn't in the room we had.  I would suppose the closer your room is to the main area, the noisier it will be.The rooms are very well appointed, and the hotel has some great amenities.  Specifically, you have a number of freebies from the other places located within Union Station, such as free coffee, free beer, and free ice cream (one per guest per day). Their valet is quick, and you can request your car be brought up right from the iPad in the room. Valet was complementary if you drive a Tesla (and they can charge your car).  They also have a Tesla Model X that will take you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel.The day we arrived, there was a concert going on in front of Union Station, and the day we left there was a farmer's market set up outside.  Certainly always cool things going on.  Staff was super friendly and helpful.   I'd be glad to return here anytime.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful, quiet, excellent location, tall ceilings, wonderful surprise in Union Station!","We live in Boulder but had a one night getaway in Denver and stayed at The Crawford hotel in Union Station. We were upgraded to a Deluxe Classic room, and it was beautiful. The ceilings are high with modern, art deco furniture, beautiful bathroom, and a very comfortable bed. The room looked out at the train station, but we could not hear the trains! The rooms are tranquil! The location is superb! Everything you need is in walking distance such as restaurants, bars, cocktail lounges, flowers, coffee and even Whole Foods. The staff at the Crawford are very friendly and professional. Someone accidentally gave us incorrect directions for the elevator to our room and later brought up truffles!My only thought is that it would be nice if the rooms had glass water bottles instead of the two plastic ones provided in the refrigerator. This hotel seems to care about the environment, and this little touch would be nice. I am trying to never use plastic water bottles so I personally appreciate the ability to drink from a large, refillable, glass bottle. We truly enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel, and we will return!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful hotel in Denver's Union Station,"This is a great hotel to visit in Denver.  We fly into the airport and take the train here, then in the morning we rent a car for about half the price of the airport car rentals.  We arrived early and they had a room available for us.  It is a very clean and beautiful hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Most perfect place to stay in Denver,We are local to Denver and have stayed at The Crawford numerous times.  It’s location in U ion Station is ideal!  The rooms are historic and charming.  For out of town travelers this location is ideal as the light rain goes directly from DIA to Union Station.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford Made Us Feel Special,"My partner and I celebrate our anniversary on the 4th of July.  We live outside Denver, but love being in the downtown area, and so, every year we pick a ""fancy"" place to stay and treat ourselves.  This year, we chose the Crawford Hotel at Denver's Union Station.  We've often passed through the station as we utilize light rail for downtown access, but we had never stayed at the Crawford, and we were curious.  We chose a 'Pullman' room for our one night stay. From check in to check out, everything about the Crawford and their wonderful staff went far above and beyond our expectations. The amenities, were posh and quite fabulous.  You could easily stay completely within the confines of Union Station for your entire stay of you so desired. We had oysters at Stoic & Genuine. Ice…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford rocks!,"Was only able to stay for the night but the team took great care of my wife and family.  We had cookies and milk for the kids when we checked in and the complementary ice cream and coffee for each member of our party was the perfect start to our exploration of the surrounding area.  The preferred seating at breakfast was a help and got us on our way to the next stop.  The restaurants were great.  Make sure to stop by the Mercantile.  Wonderful afternoon wine and cheese on the deck.  Really high end selection of meats and cheeses. The facility is amazing.  This is a great use of an old building.  Also take advantage of the free shuttle within two miles, my kids called it the space ship.  Only complaint is we could not stay longer.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, beautiful hotel & very convenient","Amazing location. Only steps to the train that goes directly to the airport in 35 min for $9. The hotel has a tesla that can fit five passengers and they will take you anywhere within a two miles radius--and with the location of the hotel it was perfect. We got dropped off at highlands and Rino and then leisurely walked back to the hotel. A couple of good restaurants in the station. Highly recommend having hotel staff book a reservation for Snooze for breakfast. With your stay you get a free beer each day, a free scoop of ice cream, and cup of coffee from the stores in the station. Hotel staff was very friendly and had some great recommendations for food. Highly recommend this place. The price is definitely worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Eagles Concert,We loved everything about this hotel. The location was close to Coors Field and we walked to a concert. Could have walked to a play the next night but instead got to ride in the Tesla! The room was lovely and the staff were great.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience.,"We had passed through Denver Union Station a couple of years ago while it was still under renovation. Having read that upgrades were complete, we decided to come back and check it out. Arrived on the Amtrak Zephyr and checked in to the Crawford Hotel.  We had an amazing time. Our room in the Crawford was perfect - king size bed, large bathroom, comfortable chairs and sofa. The room was immaculate. Nice view of the station tracks - but not noisy at all. The staff was very helpful.  We never left the station complex in the two days we were there. Several excellent restaurants, Snooze and Terminal Bar are two in particular, but there are others as well. Terminal bar is a great place to unwind and people watch. Huge selection of craft beers as well as a nice wine list. Cooper's…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Just checked in and so far worst experience I have ever had with a hotel,"Well, we just checked in. The room type I called to confirm TWICE, including earlier today, wasn’t available for us. We called and spoke to Kyle today who confirmed our room preference was in the computer where I had called weeks before. We stated AGAIN that we wouldn’t be here until around 10:30 pm and literally asked that they please not give our room away. We were assured they wouldn’t.Now I can’t unpack and settle in because I have to change rooms tomorrow. I had emailed with concierge to order a birthday surprise for my boyfriend, which was supposed to be a floral arrangement and some chocolate truffles. The amenity I ordered isn’t in the room either, so no nice birthday surprise on arrival.The lobby literally has tweakers in it. Two cops were trying to get a couple of them out when we walked in to check in and there were 2 more outside the main front doors.The compensation for not getting the correct room was a waiving of the $20 amenity fee for today which is laughable since we just got here at 11 pm and couldn’t use any of them anyway. Of course I didn’t know at that point that the birthday gifts I ordered weren’t delivered to the room either. This has started out wildly disappointing, and I am definitely not impressed.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect destination for a special occasion!,"I booked a room here to surprise my husband for his birthday. The room was absolutely gorgeous, a perfect combination of historical charm and modern amenities. The staff accommodated all my requests to have a special note and bottle of wine in the room upon our arrival, the complimentary car drove us to and from our dinner reservation and they even offered to book us a spot for breakfast in the morning. Plus the turn down service was the perfect little touch in making us feel already so pampered. Located right in the heart of the bustling Union Station neighborhood of Denver, it was the perfect home base for an amazing urban vacation in the city. Would definitely recommend for a first time visit to Denver or just for a fun staycation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Convenient and very nice rooms,"What an amazing place! Although we took a rental car from the airport, the local train would have taken us right to Union Station and the Crawford Hotel. The hotel, restaurants, and shops are all located in Union Station.  The roms were huge and service was wonderful. Hotel is just a block from the free city bus line or they will give you a free ride in a very nice Tesla to local spots. Will definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Convenience and Gracious Style,"I haven't been to downtown Denver in 25 years, but had the opportunity when a BOD meeting was scheduled at the Crawford Hotel. Landed at DEN and walked 5 minutes to the RTD train which whisked me to Union Station in 30 minutes for $4.50 ($9.00 if you're under 65). The Crawford Hotel is in Union Station which contains multiple restaurants, bars, shops as well as the Amtrak office and the hotel front desk on the main floor. The rooms are on the 2nd through 4th floors. We chose Stoic and Genuine for dinner and couldn't get enough of the oysters and wines. The rooms are very comfortable with modern-rustic feel, if that makes sense. We had a grab and go breakfast at Mercantile in the morning, completed our BOD meeting by noon, stepped out of the lobby and onto the train for a quick return trip to the airport. If you are having a meeting of 20 persons or less from around the country, you can't top the convenience of Denver and the Crawford Hotel. A great centerpiece for the downtown Denver renovations.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A must stay every time I'm in town!,"The Crawford may be a beautiful hotel in a really cool setting, but what separates it from anywhere else you may think about staying in Denver is the unbelievable service provided by their amazing staff.I come to Denver once a month for business, and can tell you I've never had better service staying at any hotel anywhere in the world.Tara, Ana, Sydney, Dominic, Riley, Kyle... you'll learn these names and be completely wowed by how well they will take care of you. Just a small example is when I switched rooms and left a couple of toiletry items in the old room and they were disposed of. Tara went out and purchased replacements for my missing items and brought them to me. (!)All of the people at the Crawford treat you in an amazingly high-class fashion and make you feel as if you're the only tenant staying there. I had a slightly delayed check in one time and they gave me a small bottle of champagne as a thank you for my patience.Don't forget Austin and Miles, who will drive you around locally in the beautiful Crawford Tesla, as well as help you find places to go and things to do while in the city.And if this all isn't enough, your small hotel fee gets you daily perks like free ice cream, coffee, those Tesla rides, a free beer daily, etc.Oh and if you're asking... yes the rooms are amazing too... very comfortable, great beds, all the best amenities, high-speed WiFi... a tablet in each room with info and reading materials... etc.Obviously I can't say enough about this wonderful place and their amazing staff. You couldn't pay me to stay anywhere else when I'm in town! I'm telling you as I tell anyone else who will listen!Trust me on this. Book it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"All good! Easy transportation, spacious guest room & good eats & entertainment options","Rode the train directly from the airport and rolled our bags to check-in The Crawford. Easy Peasy. Trendy fun cocktail bar, a variety of restaurant options and easy transportation made for a super relaxing, un-planned 5-night stay.  The hotel's Tesla was always available for us. We used the city-bikes, hopped on the trolley/bus, Uber-ed, and road the train roundtrip for airport transfers. ""Walking distance to Coor Field for baseball game.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great way to catch a train.,"We chose The Crawford as a comfortable overnight stay before catching Amtrak’s California Zephyr west across the Rockies. We flew early to Denver the previous day to catch a Rockies game and planned to store our luggage prior to check-in. Imagine our delight when our room was ready for us at 9 am! This gave us time for breakfast at the Mercantile in Union Station and a nap before game time a few blocks (easy walk) down the street at Coors Field.We had a deluxe queen, and it is everything the photos show. It has quaint charm with very modern amenities. Every staff member we came in contact with was super helpful.When you check in, you get a card that entitles you to discounts at several cool Union Station establishments. This was great for after the game and the next morning as we prepared to board the Zephyr.It may seem a bit expensive, but it’s a really great stay in a really great venue where you can literally step out of your room and onto the train. Treat yourself!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing venue,Just amazing setting for hotel and conference. Everything about the the hotel exceeds expectations. Great location from the airport. Stunning bars and restaurants in the foyer which brings back the history and heritage of the train station.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Few Days before Skiing,"We took the train from the Denver Airport to Union Station, it was so easy.  Our 3 day pre-ski stay at The Crawford was great.  The hotel is very nice and the energy of an active train station was fun.  We walked all around downtown, enjoying the sites and lots of great food.  A huge, huge thanks goes to Kyle, a hotel front desk employee.  He helped make our trip extra, extra special by securing us tickets to Hamilton. It was amazing.  Thank you, thank you Kyle.   We plan to make our pre-ski stay and annual event at The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"It's not cheap, but it is very nice and the service is excellent","Went with my boys in their 20s.  The check in was very nice and helpful.  We talked about inner, we reserved a ride in the Tesla, he explained the 20% off.  You come into a bustling place with restaurants, bars, & shops.  Then you go upstairs to your quiet room.  The train stops right in back and it looked like it was easy to get a ticket and go to the airport.  I had a car but never used it because where would I park?  We reserved a ride in the Tesla easily and the driver took our picture.The hotel gym is terrible, but they have an arrangement with a very nice gym across the street in a spa.  They have classes you could go to.One tip, you get priority at Snooze, but make your reservation the night before.  It was an hour wait for breakfast on a sunny Saturday & you can't walk in and get priority.It's a short walk to Rockies Stadium.  Lot's of good bars & restaurants.  Walk over & check out the food hall called Milk Bar.  So many places to eat, but not enough local shops to keep you out walking.  You can only eat and drink so much!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Historic Luxury,"Before our train trip we had an over night in The Crawford Hotel.  It was beautiful.  Mara at the front personally made sure our stay went smoothly.  The room decor was stunning and they really took the time to make all the little touches feel nice.I felt right at home with my morning chat with Chet while Lynn brewed up a perfect cup of coffee.The train was delayed but Tara and Dominic helped pass the time by telling us about some of the special parts of the historic building.  The property is spectacular and the staff is extrodiary.  Make this a stop on any visit to Denver, even to grab a scoop of ice cream or a beer in one of the restaurants in Union Station.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,UPS and downs ,"Downs:This place is a mess if you arrive by car and you need assistance with your luggage. The valet guys are overwhelmed by the amount of clients they have . At the desk a rude employee couldn’t even explain to us what to do with the car and the luggage, couldn’t respond to the simple question: there is anybody helping with the luggage?. She just kept saying she was busy. And than, after we asked somebody else what to do , she just asked: are you staying here? Which kind of question is that? Obviously if I’m asking you for help with the bags I’m not staying in the hotel across the street! UPS:On the other hand the gentleman that later checked us in was really nice and took good care of us.The room was a suite, so it was very big but unfortunately not view of any kind. To be precise in the bedroom part of the room no windows at all. But two bathrooms and a comfortable area where you can prepare your coffee( nespresso machine). Very quiet, couldn’t hear a thing, which is very good if you have troubles sleeping.I don’t think I would stay here again, better to try the Oxford Hotel, that, by the way, is a sister property.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anytime in Denver this is the place to stay,Welcoming staff. Lovely amenities. Rooms are beautifully designed and quiet. In addition you have the fun of the train station complete with delicious restaurants and shops. Great stay. Looking forward to our retun,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Had a very nice stay,This hotel was great and a ton of fun to stay at. I used to live in the area and miss my old apartment.. this was a nice throw back to the neighborhood. The room was excellent. Very high end and nice - even enjoyed the bath robe which I don't think I've ever done. They had a Tesla X private car and it was awesome to pull up to the restaurant and have the automatic gull wing doors open. After dinner I was able to call Riley the driver and he was there in less than 5 minutes. I think this was probably the coolest part of the stay. Couldn't be happier!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exploring Colorado,My girlfriend and I spent 3 days in Denver exploring breweries and cocktail bars. We had the pleasure of being helped by a valet driver named Riley. He recommended several places that we ate and drank at. He helped us enjoy Denver to its fullest. Our vacation was better because of his service and expertise. Thank you Riley!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Grand and refreshing,This is the second time I've stayed at the Crawford hotel and each time now I feel so happy and so relaxed thanks to the wonderful staff and the charming environment of a refurbished Grand train station. Sometimes it's just nice to experience the unconventional such as the main desk being just one Alcove of many in the Grand Central area of the station or the Tesla Model X as a courtesy car with a driver named Riley who is absolutely gracious and concerned about how well you're doing and even folks like Sydney at check-in who has a sixth sense to know when you might have had the worst experience with an airline and helps you with a wonderful room so that your troubles can begin to go away. Hang out at the outside fountains and get you feet wet.  So why not try the Crawford and become human once again and not a corporate automaton.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stay here if you are in downtown Denver,"This is my 2nd stay at the hotel and it was wonderful.  Location is excellent, and staff is awesome.  Kyle took great care of us at check in, and Riley gave us lifts around town w the car service.  Lively scene in lobby and lots to do around the hotel.  Free ice cream is a treat as well!The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of room service.  Pretty awful if you love hotel room service (like I do).  Paper containers delivered in a bag w plastic utensils.  However, they corrected our order immediately and did not charge us for the meal.We will always stay here when visiting Denver!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Night Out Retreat,"We had a great stay at The Crawford. While it’s not our first stay (Pullman Room), this one was better than the first. The King Loft room was very well designed and comfortable. We had a drink at The Cooper Lounge, which always amazes us. Dry ice served cocktail shrimp? Very well done. The desk staff was great, especially Sydney and Mara who graciously arranged for us to take a ride in their courtesy Tesla, when our dinner reservation was only 1 block away. Miles took us for a few extra blocks for fun and to enjoy the ride longer than we had planned.  We’ll definitely be back for the great experience and treatment.  Thanks!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The best,This is my favorite place to stay in Denver and there is nowhere I’ve stayed quite like it. They took great care of us on this trip and Mara was particularly helpful and spectacular. Will be back many times in the future!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford Hotel June 2018,"I stayed one night at The Crawford Hotel as part of business travel to Denver.

The room was very comfortable for sleep, relax, and work.",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Historic Hotel, Best Location","Margot and Kyle at the front desk were just fantastic. They always greeted me with a smile, offered water and were more than willing to help with any questions. This hotel overall is just amazing, you can take the train from the airport and it will take you directly to Union Station, a lot traffic in Union Station, plenty of restaurants to eat at, great walking trails nearby as well.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Classy Hotel in Downtown Denver,"We arrived late in Denver after a long and weary journey and were greeted by super friendly staff at checkin of the Crawford Hotel.The hotel is centrally located in the historic Union Station building in Downtown Denver (around 40 minutes drive from the airport).  Having originally booked a “Pullman” room, the hotel graciously upgraded us to a “Classic Guest Room” on the 3rd floor.  Despite our rooms proximity to a bar, we heard absolutely nothing from it for the duration of our stay. The room itself was generously proportioned with a desk, seating area, a large bed and good sized shower room.  The room was clean and well maintained.  We did struggle to get the WIFI to work during the first day, but that issue seemed to resolve itself on the second day.The building in which the hotel resides is magnificent and has been tastefully restored in the spirit of its former life.  The atrium of the hotel features features a bar and cafe amongst other establishments and we found this kind of a neat area to hang out at the end of a long day.  Incidentally, the hotel does charge an amenity fee that includes (amongst other things) a free beer during happy hour at one of the bars in the atrium - kind of a good excuse for a drink.We were very happy with the Crawford Hotel and would stay here again without any hesitation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Family weekend at a fantastic boutique hotel,"A friend recommended this hotel as we wanted to be in the city area for a quick weekend trip to Denver and it was the perfect recommendation! The hotel was very unique and the staff were amazing (Syndey and Courtney at the front desk were very helpful). We were there for 2 nights and had an awesome room close to the Cooper Lounge (where we enjoyed some delicious cocktails). I loved the atmosphere of this place, the room was great and it was walking distance to several great restaurants and activities in Denver. Would highly recommend this hotel.We stayed on the bed and breakfast package and the breakfast at Snooze was delicious!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A great stay experience,"the Crawford anchors the restored Union Station which is the hub now of downtown dining options and a fairly short walk to Coors Field if you're attending a Rockies game.  The Crawford has a very welcoming front desk who were very helpful during the stay.  The room was very well done with all of the options, cleanliness you might expect from a very good hotel.  The shops, eating options, entertainment, etc. in and around Union Station make it a real fun place to spend a few days--had to work on the calorie intake when I got back home.  Oh, the Crawford was extremely helpful when it comes to making short trips within a two mile radius--they have one of those gull winged Teslas to squire you around.  Not a bad stay by any standard.  I give it highest marks.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Staycation Weekend,Had a great time at the Crawford Hotel in Union Station for a weekend getaway! The staff were fantastic and Kyle made sure we were satisfied. Super Location so close to everything and we used their Tesla service to go to dinner too--definitely recommend!,5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford-What a Fantastic Hotel!,"I just returned from a visit to Denver. Staying at the Crawford was a highlight of the trip. The staff was so wonderful and accommodating. We were warmly greeted by Kyle and Dominic at the front desk who gave us promotions and recommendations for a few of the many restaurants and bars in the hotel lobby. They couldn't have been more friendly and accomodating throughout the weekend.. They even informed us about a great tour of the hotel/station which was very informative and interesting. The room and bathroom were large and the bed very comfortable. The hotel is in a wonderful central and exciting  location in the city. Anya, also at the front desk, was fantastic in giving us information we needed as this was our first visit to Denver. She made checkout a breeze, offering us…",5

The staff was exceptional and the location was convenient to many tourist spots and public transportation! Highly recommend this hotel in this historic site.The Fritzes from MN.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Service Ever!,"We recently spent Memorial Day Weekend at The Crawford Hotel. It was one of the best hotel experiences we have had in recent memory. The staff was incredible...making fabulous shopping, activity, and even late, late night dining recommendations and securing difficult to get dining reservations and baseball tickets. They made our weekend and really came through when I left a few things behind. The room was lovely and super quiet despite the really fun and hopping lobby. Loved every minute of our stay, Red Rocks, and Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to stay if you are an Amtrak traveler,"My college age daughter and I traveled to Denver via Amtrak for a Spring Break Trip in March.  The Crawford is part of the train station which made it really convenient.  Our train arrived early morning before our room was available.  Courtney at the front desk was wonderful.  She checked our bags, had the bags delivered to our room when it was ready and let us know with a text message.  At check out, she also checked our bags since our train was leaving several hours later.  She couldn't have been more helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,smack dab in Denver's living room,"Full of vitality, this LoDo area is a fun area to visit and Mrs. Crawford deserves a vote of thanks for largely making it so.  It is conveniently accessible to visitors (via the light rail direct from the airport) and to Denver denizens on their way to or from Coors field.  Security is well thought out with a guest key required to operate the elevator between floors and to access the individual hallways.  The room appointments are beginning to show some wear with some of the furniture trending towards 'shabby' with chips of veneer having been knocked off and drawers that are hard to open.  housekeepers were in short supply, though were often seen in the hallways; the rooms were not thoroughly cleaned (dirty coffee cups left lying about, espresso maker not cleaned) nor were…",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, luxurious rooms, top-notch service!",The Crawford Hotel was the perfect place to stay for our long weekend in Colorado.

Take advantage of all the amenities: Farmer’s market Sat, walk to Rockies game, Tesla ride, nightly ice cream, morning brew, happy hour craft beers and Snooze bfast!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top-notch and so convenient,"We were scheduled to travel by Amtrak the following morning and the Crawford seemed like the most convenient of locations so that we didn't need a taxi from somewhere else to the train station at an early hour.  The price was a little daunting but ultimately convenience won out.  The hotel staff were so friendly, our ""resort amenity fee"" got us a few freebies to offset part of the cost, and the room was lovely and delightfully comfortable.  I think I made the right decision in selecting to stay at the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Hotel,"Pulling up to this hotel, you are amazed by the location, atmosphere, and the train station lobby. The valet staff and check-in staff were nice and friendly. The room was beautiful and comfortable. There are a ton of restaurant options within walking distance, including a whole foods. My room was facing the train tracks, and although you could hear the comings and goings of the trains and the bells, it did not keep me up at night.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Riley saves the day,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Crawford for an evening out in Denver. The hotel is beautiful and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  We loved that we could get a ride in the Tesla on our way to dinner and were lucky enough to get a ride back as well. Riley, our Tesla driver, was fun and professional. On our way back to the hotel, Riley noticed immediately that the car in front of us was driving erratically.  He mentioned that he was going to fall back and give that car space.  Within a couple of blocks the driver of the car in front was hanging out of the car with the driver’s side door open, almost hit another car, then quickly turned the car and ran over the sidewalk and into a building. The situation was terrifying and Riley was very calm throughout everything.  It could have been much worse and we were very thankful for Riley’s quick thinking!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,I must be missing something,"We’ve had excellent stays at 2 other hotels in Denver, that I would just rave about, but their prices had shot way up, so my husband booked this hotel.  We were celebrating an anniversary of sorts...  as I read the other reviews about the amazing management, etc., I wondered if they were talking about a different place.  We had only the most benign and unhelpful interactions with management.  Apart from being in a hotel room, this has never felt like a hotel at all.  Many of the “amenities” they provide are sort of useless for me (I drink tea, so the Nespresso coffee maker in the room was not useful, I have an iPad so I can read and play my own music, I am allergic to dairy products, I don’t drink alcohol, etc.).  If you want to hang out in a crowded, noisy hotel lobby that’s actually a train station, this is the place for you.  (But it’s not your typical Amtrak station, it’s more light rail oriented.). Others have asked if the rooms were noisy here, from the trains (not at all - the noise in our room came from the room next door, with the guy loudly and tunelessly singing and waking us up in the morning - the walls are “thin” - and from another guy sitting in the hall conducting a loud phone conversation).  Otherwise the rooms are quite quiet.  What is also noisy - the lobby and the restaurants, especially the breakfast one.  I really had problems with the lighting in the bathroom (those energy saving LED lights are known for casting strange shadows - hint, you can use your iPad’s camera mode instead of the mirror) and as another person mentioned the pillows are not nice... small and lumpy.  I wouldn’t rate this a zero, but I would never want to stay here again.  We would even have checked out a day early if we hadn’t prepaid.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel in Historic Building,A wonderful Hotel in Old Union Station ... in downtown Denver ... nice rooms ... great service ... friendly & helpful staff!!!  Although you have to pay an extra $20 per day per room as a facility fee you do get perks like a free shuttle ride in a tesla within 2 miles .. great for going to dinner ... free coffee / free ice cream & free beer during happy hour !,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,"I received a free upgrade upon arrival. The room was great and all the amenities were fantastic. I would definitely recommend taking advantage of the ice cream, coffee, and car service. The car service was especially helpful with great restaurants just outside walking distance (1-2 mi away). Our driver Riley was helpful suggesting new places and picking us up quickly. Overall an 5 star experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Gotta be the best hotel in Denver,"the Crawford throws in a lot of nice extras for your stay, and Union station is a great place to spend some time. Lots of good restaurants and bars in the surrounding area. Rooms are charming and modern. Wonderful spot!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun Time,"We arrived in Denver by Plane and took the train to the Hotel Crawford at Union Station. We checked in and they were very pleasant. The room was lovely and bright. Once we unpacked we went downstairs to the train station. whick is now a lively place with lots to do. Several restraunts, deli, drinks and ice cream.  We had made reservations for dinner at The Fort which was about 1/2 hour away. Mara and Courtney at the main desk were extremely helpful in helping us to the restaurant and back. They really went out of the way and made us feel like they appreciated our business.  On monday we had a few errends to take care of and the girls arranged for the hotel's driver to help us. We got to ride in a Tesla which was fun. I would highly recommend this hotel It was very convenient taking the train directly from the airport to there lobby. Also the staff does a great job in making you feel like your wish is taken care of. No stress and very relaxing  Again thank you Mara and Courtney.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic in EVERY way!!!,"My husband and I stayed at The Crawford in April so that we could celebrate his birthday. I had taken him to Vegas the year before, and was worried that I wouldn't be able to do something as special this time around, but I had no idea what was awaiting us. It was honestly one of the most exquisite stays we have ever had at a hotel! We were treated so beautifully from the very start too. After I made the online reservation, I was contacted by Ian from concierge to see if there was anything we needed. Once I told him that it was my husband's birthday, he took it upon himself to have a complimentary bottle of prosecco waiting for us in the room along with a lovely card. But he then went an AMAZING step further...he upgraded us to the most fabulous room we've ever stayed in. We were awestruck when we walked in and I couldn't believe how generous he had been. His kindness allowed me to give my husband a birthday that he will always remember. (Did I mention that Ian came over to introduce himself to us when we first checked in? He also called a few minutes after we got into our room to make sure that we were happy and had everything we needed. I can't say this enough...IAN IS THE BEST!!!!!) As part of our date package, that evening we had drinks and appetizers at The Cooper Lounge. If you ever stay at the hotel, or are even in the area, GO HERE! They reserved a table for us with our last name handwritten on a beautiful place card (which I kept because it was so pretty!). They also have the most delicious cocktails and food that will absolutely blow you away! Their presentation is fantastic! Every single person on their staff was professional and obviously loved what they do. When we checked out the next day, all we could talk about is how we wished we could stay longer. It was an experience we will always treasure and my husband said it was one of the best birthdays he's ever had!!! We're already trying to make plans to go back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Engagement Weekend EVER!!!!!,"I had been planning a weekend proposal getaway with  my now fiance and The Crawford Hotel met every expectation I could have ever had for my proposal weekend. We when checked in, the staffed asked what our plans were for the weekend and what we had going on. I explained that we had gotten engaged earlier that morning and that we were there to celebrate. Everyone stopped what they were doing to congratulate us and tell us how happy they were for us. Our room was not ready due to us arriving a little earlier than expected, but the staff held our bags for us while we went and got spoiled with spa services and once our room was ready they called to let us know. When we got back to The Crawford the night shift staff had taken over and joyfully greeted us and helped us with our check in. Once we got upstairs to the room we were greeted with a chilled bottle of champagne and a beautifully written congratulations card along with the most amazing loft room I had ever seen. After a few hours of drinking and celebrating I went downstairs looking for a place to purchase water, I stopped at the front desk and the night shift staff sprang to action and gladly helped me out with my water needs all the while congratulating me and telling me how excited they were to have been chosen for the weekend getaway. I honestly could not have pictured a more perfect weekend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique hotel experience,"The Crawford hotel was accommodating from the valet to the checkout. Valet was quick and easy, check in super easy. Front desk offers bottled water while you’re waiting and upgraded our room right away. For $20/night convenience fee you get some great deals like free happy hour beer and a scoop of ice cream each night for free along with other great deals! The room was so clean and tidy with an ultra modern bath with great shower! The cooper lounge was cozy to enjoy a cocktail and the pub downstairs had great food. I couldn’t have been more happy with our stay and being our first time in Denver, I would recommend this hotel to anyone!! The concierge offers a free shuttle within 2 miles which is super convenient! Only complaint was there was only an espresso machine in the room and not a coffee maker and the pub offers a free beer but it would be nice to have a cocktail if you are not a beer drinker.",5

The room was beautiful but the bathroom was amazing.  It had a claw foot tub, double sink vanity, and large shower with rain head.  Our room was once the office of Adolph Coors.  We took the history tour of Union Station and were able to learn the history and see some of the other hotel rooms.  Since all the rooms are a little different it was nice to see especially the Pullman room and Attic rooms.  We also received our own copy of the Denver Union Station history book.  Even if you don't stay at the Crawford the history tour is worth the time or just going and seeing the station itself.",5

Located conveniently to the commuter rail connecting travelers directly from Denver International Airport to the hotel. The Crawford Hotel is centrally located to the 16th Street Mall, the mile-long, pedestrian-friendly Mall is filled with shopping, restaurants and attractions.

It goes without saying, the care we received matched the room, Kyle and Courtney at the front desk took care of every request and turned us on to some of the cooler hiking spots in the area.What put the trip over the moon was the perks and thought the hotel put into our stay.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Special Treatment on our Wedding Night,"The Crawford went above and beyond for our wedding night. My now husband called ahead and ordered champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, the works - and when we arrived it was nicely laid out along with rose petals on the bed. Not only this, they had slippers placed on the floor next to the bed for us, water bottles on each nightstand, and... MILK AND COOKIES. I was not expecting that at all but I will not lie I was having some heartburn and felt I needed something to soak up some of the alcohol and I was so thankful for that gesture. What a great midnight snack we had together as husband and wife. Thank you for that extra special touch, Crawford Hotel. :) Also if you're staying here MAKE SURE YOU USE YOUR AMENITIES - you can get preferred seating at Snooze but need to make the arrangements the day before, you can get a free scoop of ice cream, a drink at terminal bar, and others - just know what you get and make sure you use it to your full advantage! Ask a staff member because they are all super helpful. Beautiful property, great location, plenty to do in Denver, and a memorable way to spend a first couple of days as husband and wife.",5

We were so impressed with all the ""perks"" that came with the room.  We took advantage of the free coffee, beer and Tesla rides.  Riley was an amazing driver and was so great to chat with.  This place is first-class and we will return again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for a stay-cation!,"Absolutely everything about The Crawford is calling us back for another stay.  As a Denver native I have fond memories of seeing the growth and change sweep through the Union Station area.  The addition of The Crawford is a crown jewel to the whole area.  Every single staff person was so pleasant and helpful, Austin - one of the Tesla drivers - was an excellent host and guide to the city. The room (424) was magnificent with huge windows overlooking they fountains in front of The Kitchen. We were sure to enjoy the complimentary beers from The Terminal Bar, ice cream from The Milkbox, and priority seating for Sunday brunch at Snooze.  Seriously - who goes from bed to brunch at Snooze on a Sunday in 15 minutes???  We did.  It was awesome. I can die happy now.  But I hope I don't before we get another weekend-long-date & stay-cation at The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotel, even better service","We stayed at The Crawford Hotel for our anniversary. The hotel is ideally located in the LoDo area. It’s also situated atop what seems like a train station (the concept seems to be a smaller scale version of NYC’s Grand Central Station).  The lobby of the hotel has several bars, coffee shops, eateries — you basically take an elevator down into a mini bustling setting. There are also plenty of restaurants, bars, and sites nearby. Larimer Square and the 16th street mall are walkable but there’s also a free bus that takes you close enough. You’re within a 3-mike radius from most of the big pockets of city life. The service at the hotel is probably among the best we’ve had. Courtney and Kyle were super helpful (and even sent us a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine for our anniversary). The hotel offers a bunch of free stuff and discounts at local eateries. There’s also a complimentary Tesla Model X that will take you anywhere within a 2 mile radius. All in all, highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great all around experience.,"Kyle was awesome from start to finish. Was in town for a conference and lucky got upgraded to a suite which made the co-workers jealous! Room was spacious, modern and very clean. Bathroom was newly renovated and absolutely top notch. They kept my bags while my room was being made ready so I was able to go see the city for a couple hours without having to keep up with luggage. Wonderful guest experience all around. 5 stars!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, historic interest, train station","had a great stay at the Crawford, it started when i arrived, Marie at the front desk was very helpful, i had a great room, huge very comfortable. the location if the hotel was fantastic, a few block from the baseball field where i caught a few innings of a game at a very reasonable price",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Everything!,"Our second stay at the Crawford was better then the first!  Everything and everyone at the Crawford was perfect.  The property itself, in the heart of a Denver Union Station, couldn’t be better.  It is walking distance from the 16th Street Mall and Coors Field, and a short distance to everything in downtown.  The station has great amenities that you can research on the Crawford web site.  If you haven’t been to Denver, you will find that Union Station and the Crawford are at the end of the light-rail line from DIA.  You won’t need a car because everything is a $10 or so Uber ride.I would call the rooms at the Crawford throwback modern.  While they give the appearance of being from the stations early days, the room appointments are all modern, new and fresh.  The best part of the Crawford may be the staff.  They put accommodating into accommodations (sorry, couldn’t resist).  The staff will do everything they can to make your stay memorable.  Like us, you will likely find that your first visit to The Crawford will not be your last!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful hotel,"This is a wonderful luxury hotel with great amenities and helpful staff. We flew into Denver and were taking Amtrak out to Sacramento, California. It was very convenient to take RDT from the airport to Union Station and the Crawford Hotel is right there with the front desk on the ground floor of Union Station. For dinner the courtesy car took us to the Buckhorn Exchange and then picked us up after dinner. The next morning we caught Amtrak to Sacramento. Since we are returning the same way we will be staying at the Crawford Hotel on the return trip. We plan to have dinner at the Ultria on the return trip which is also located at Union Station. Many choices. We are already thinking of another trip to Denver with the Crawford Hotel and Union Station as the hub for that trip.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The only downside of staying at the Crawford...,"...is having to check out. Every detail, every contact, every experience during my stay felt designed for me. I guess the other downside is how it raises the bar of my expectations at other hotels. It’s elegantly beautiful, historic, comfortable, welcoming at every turn, at the center of everything, and my favorite hotel. Ever. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Not your ordinary hotel...finally.,"This place is both hip and historic. We came for a night on the town for my husband’s birthday. He is an engineer and historic rebuild manager so it was right up his alley. We so enjoyed just hanging out having cocktails and playing shuffleboard. We loved to tour and look at all of the art and history of the building. The upgraded room was a joy, clean cozy robes and slippers. And the snooze breakfast in bed cannot be beat.  The station is the hub of downtown and you can do anything from there. It was so easy to get around to nightlife, but would have been just as fun to stay put.   One of the highlights of our experience was the integrated nature of “Denvers living room”. The station is filled with people traveling to and from, students studying at the long tables. Young…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Baseball Birthday Getaway,"This was a great experience.  I stayed at this hotel for my 42nd birthday and the Cubs had been in town.  It was an amazingly beautiful hotel room and definitely lived up to the expectation of being a high class and full service hotel.  I enjoyed all of the room, a very comfy bed, amazing shower with a rain shower experience and the many perks of staying at the hotel.  I have always wanted to stay at this hotel.  I feel like this is a dream getaway in the city because it is in Union Station and it did not disappoint.  I really would love to come back and highly recommend this hotel for anyone.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Fantastic Way to Showcase Union Station with a 5-Star Hotel,"We took the train from DIA to Union Station and found ourselves at the Crawford.  A traveler couldn't find a better staff to compliment the facility itself.  Our room was incredible - tall ceiling and floor to ceiling windows.  Don't lay down on the bed - you won't want to leave.  The rooms are spacious.  The hotel's courtesy car is driven by Austin, and there aren't enough words to describe this transplant from N.Y.  The man is extremely friendly and outgoing.  He will meet you at the agreed upon time both to and from your destination.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Felt like stepping into the lobby of the Crawford led to the Orient Express train!,"This is truly a landmark hotel.  Renovations made to take it from near ruin to today make this place an architect's delight.  I took my daughter (adult) and 2 13 yr old grandchildren to Denver on a birthday trip for the 3 of them.  This hotel was what I had hoped for.  The staff was helpful, accommodating when we needed advice, friendly to 2 kids who have very little experience in a city other than their home.  The lobby is beautiful.  You can have a coffee, adult beverage, or ? and sit and watch the world go by.  Because it is still a working train station (Amtrak) it is busy and because there are restaurants than ring the lobby from the inside, you can order a drink and take it to a comfy chair or couch in  the lobby to sit, read, people watch, relax, chat - whatever. …",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Buzzing with Life,"A station hotel with a difference - sheer class and sophistication, pleasant rooms superb staff and a buzz of excitement all around. The images online do not do justice to the reality as they are larger than they look. The classic rooms have vast ceilings and high windows, the Loft rooms are big and airy (beware of rabbits!)  and the Pullman are a great deal bigger than a sleeper compartment on a train. All are very quiet and double glazed to exclude noise from the station. Union Station itself is some station, 5 star deluxe with boutique bars and restaurants of a very high level indeed. Victoria Station this is not! immaculate and interior designed more like a top end hotel lobby with all the trimmings. Once outside you are in the trendiest neighbourhood in town - think Tribeca…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The best place to stay in Denver,"The Crawford Hotel is the best place to stay in Denver when taking the Ski Train the next day to Winter Park. Reception staff were lovely especially Kyle who was warm, funny and shared some great restaurant suggestions for us to explore on Larimer Street. We stay in the Premium Loft Suite and the valet had whisked our luggage up to our room in the short time it took to check in. A lovely card and chilled bottle of sparkling wine welcomed us and the room was full of character and luxe styling. The large soaking tub in the en suite bathroom was divine. Amentities were on point including the lovely C.O. Bigelow toiletries.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Place!!,"We stayed here for our last night in Denver, the hotel was stunning, the room was simply to die for! We had one of the loft rooms, everything we could possibly need was in there! The staff at the desk were AWESOME, I think the gals name was Cindy? She was the bomb.com she checked us in on the 12th of April, last name was Perry, please look her up because she deserves a promotion! Her professionalism was on point! The valet was fast and the different amenities were exactly what we needed after a long week of hiking and driving all over Colorado! The one thing we didn't realize is that the Union Station is still a station so there was a ton of people in the main atrium using the facilities, shops, restaurants, and benches. There were several people pan handling which wasn't really…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great staff!","Every time we have come to Union Station, we have wanted to stay at the Crawford, so we finally decided to have a weekend getaway there!  It has a great vibe and is beautifully appointed. From the 4th floor corridor, we could see down over Cooper Union (classy bar) and the main concourse and we were pleasantly surprised that our room was very quiet despite the station being a bustling place. We also brought our 2 dogs (labradors) and the staff made them feel as welcome as they did us. I would highly recommend the Crawford for both vacation and business travel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Weekend Vaca done right!,Everything was phenomenal! Snooze for breakfast was a major highlight. And the Courtesy car with Tesla was bomb! Shoutout to Riley for being an amazing driver! Great mini vaca and very much needed! :),5

The character of the rooms is fantastic.  The uniqueness of how they have renovated this hotel in Union Station is very cool.We have traveled to many areas and stayed many places.  While a smidge pricy it is easily a top hotel for character, amenities and service!Stay if you get the chance.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very cool hotel,"We spent the weekend in Denver and the Crawford Hotel is such a cool place to stay. It is beautiful, surrounded by cool places to go, shop, and eat. The room was very comfortable and we got little extra bonuses like free coffee and ice cream at the shops in the lobby (Pigtrain Coffee Co and MailboxIce Creamery). We did not end up using the Terminal Bar, but the menu looks great. My tip would be to ask for a room that does not face the mezzanine as that would be much noisier. We were initially given that room but the very helpful front staff charged us to a loft which was spacious and quiet. We will 100% stay here again the next time we go to Denver",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Always great,"We’ve stayed her a few times now, and can’t wait to go back! The staff is friendly, rooms are great and the atmosphere is quintessential Denver. When you go, be sure to take advantage of the freebies for staying at the hotel within union station.",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Absolutely flawless,"You know that you are dealing with a class establishment when all of your needs are met without asking for anything! We checked in yesterday afternoon for my Birthday and our 13th Wedding Anniversary. We were upgraded to a beautiful, spacious, corner room. A bottle of bubbly was awaiting us with a note acknowledging our celebration. It was so incredibly special! So many amenities! You just don't feel like you are being nickeled and dimed. The staff is incredibly attentive, from the front desk to the courtesy driver (Riley). We had gone with the Stranahan's Whiskey Tour package, and our whole stay was absolutely flawless! Renovated Union Station is a breathtaking location, a city within a city. Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful stay at a historic and elegant Denver hotel,"We enjoyed a spectacular room overlooking Denver. It had a super comfortable king size bed and lovely sitting area with an additional tv and space to stretch out. Enormous floor to ceiling(20 feet high maybe?)windows with tons of light. Comfy bed linens and aesthetic lighting. Claw foot tub and dual head shower. Yummy Bigelow bath amenities. We enjoyed the 24/7 workout room and happy hour in the fabulous Cooper Lounge on the hotel 3rd floor. You’ll pay a $20 amenity fee but it includes turn down service with 2 bottles of water, chocolate truffles, coffee in the lobby, a complimentary beer during specific hours as well as transportation in a cool Tesla per availability within 2 mi of the hotel. The hotel is in Union Station, downtown Denver. A couple of blocks from Coors Field. This is perfect if you hop on the A Line train from DIA for $9. Super location, a return to yesteryear as a part of the historic Union Station. Service was impeccable. Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great drivers, worthless concierge","We decided to book the Crawford for a birthday staycation. We chose a package that included a tour of Stranahan's Whiskey. We were told we would need to schedule the tour time with the concierge, Ian. We called several times and he was never at work, left messages and did not hear back. After a few weeks I got frustrated and voiced my concern to a manager as our date was quickly approaching and we had still not been able to book our tour. She assured me he would call back the next day and he did. After a little back and forth he schedule our tour and I thought all was good. Checkin was smooth, the room was beautiful and Riley took us in the Tesla to a concert that evening. He was amazing, friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the area. We called him after the concert and he picked us up and delivered us a bottle of proseco after the show for my birthday! Amazing customer service! The next day Austin picked us up in the Tesla again for our Stranahan tour and again, super friendly and a great ride! When we got to Stranahan they had no reservation for us so the concierge, after all that trouble had dropped the ball again. I had to contact the hotel so they could accomodate us for the tour. This was extremely frustrating as I had already had issues with Ian and he certainly wasn't friendly when dealing with him yet again. Luckily the people at Stranahan's were amazing and super accommodating and saved the day getting us in on the tour and finding a bottle for us to take home. Austin brought us back, again - great ride! The front desk people apologized for the ""hiccup"" as they called it but honestly for that much money the entire thing should have been much more smooth. The hotel was great but if you have to deal with the concierge at all, good luck - he's either not there or doesn't follow through. Huge shout out to the drivers though, if you do stay ask for Ian or Riley to take you for a great ride!",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Wonderful stay, great location!",We stayed at the Crawford on our way through Denver and had a fabulous time! Everyone was very nice and accommodating and the room was excellent. There is even a Tesla that will take you anywhere within a 2-mile radius. There are a ton of amazing restaurants at Union Station and within a close distance to the hotel as well!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.,"We began our honeymoon in Denver and kicked it off at The Crawford. It is such a swanky and modern hotel-we loved it. Immediately upon checking in they informed us our room was upgraded to the Crawford Suite since we were Honeymooning. HOLY CRAP-it was the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in. It had 2 bathrooms, an amazing tub, the bed was so comfortable. They even left chocolates and champagne and a lovely note for us to congratulate us. The service was excellent, and the entire hotel just felt so fancy! The location was perfect as well-many things are walking distance, and they have a Tesla service that you can take if you go within 2 miles. The restaurants surrounding the hotel are awesome as well-We ate at The Terminal Bar & Snooze-both had excellent food. Whenever we return to Denver, we will definitely stay here again!!:)",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Stay-cation!,"We took the train in and stayed for a night for a quick, celebratory stay-cation and it was amazing!! The rooms are gorgeous, the food and drinks and service are absolutely wonderful. The only thing though is that the in-room tablet they provide to place the room service orders didn't work so our food never showed up. We called the desk and they got it to us right away and gave us a complimentary late check out, so everything was awesome! Ooh and we enjoyed our free Milkbox ice cream and  we took the complimentary Tesla downtown!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anniversary Getaway ,"We stayed at the Crawford for a night away to celebrate our 16th anniversary. The staff here are very friendly and so helpful. Sidney checked us in and was so helpful explaining all of the amenities the hotel had to offer (lots of free and discounted items at establishments in Union Station). Sidney upgraded our room and even brought us a bottle of champagne for our anniversary. We are planning on making this an annual trip! *There is a $20 daily resort fee and parking is $45 for the overnight rate. Look for deals online - we were able to get a package that waved both of these fees. Other recommendations:The Cooper Lounge has amazing drinks and appetizers with outstanding service. Ask the front desk at the Crawford to make a reservation for you. If you stay on the third floor of the Crawford Hotel, the lounge is right there - very cool view of Union Station. Stoic & Genuine has amazing seafood and drinks. We love to come here for their great selection of west and east coast oysters. Make your reservation far in advance. Pigtrain Coffee has delicious coffee creations and ice cream. You get a free cup when you stay at the hotel.",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best of Denver,"Amazing location, staff, and amenities.  The atmosphere is vibrant and relaxing at the same time.  The Cooper lounge is a must do.  Tip, make reservations for the lounge.  You do not have to leave the grounds with all the shops and restaurants.  However, if you do the downtown location provides the best Denver has to offer.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to make memories!,"My family visited in March for our second stay at The Crawford Hotel. We were as impressed on this visit as we were a year or two ago on our first visit. Both times we had wonderful service, excellent accommodations, and left with plans to return again. We had a great experience when we made reservations. The front desk greeted us on arrival and provided an early check-in. They responded to all questions and requests. We felt welcomed at The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Such a Disappointment ,"Union station is INCREDIBLE, and I was so excited to stay at The Crawford, but honestly almost every single aspect of my two night stay was terrible... 1st, the rooms on the 2nd floor are really small. 2nd, the Nespresso machine was not working. 3rd, I couldn’t get the iPad to play music in the room. 4th, in-room dining ends, as advertised, at 10pm... I called at 9:38pm and, after being on hold for 9 minutes, was told they were no longer serving food... seriously? 5th, room 236 has a loud rattle in either the walls or AC or something and when I ordered earplugs it took the front desk 50 minutes to deliver them — honestly this is what sent me over the edge :( 6th, the curtains in room 236 do not fully cover the windows. 7th, you’re supposed to get a free beer during happy hour at the terminal bar (I mentioned it right away) and the bartender rang me up for both (I had two). 8th, the shower around 6:30 pm on the first night was not even close to hot. 9th, the phone charger on the bed does not work. 10th, the pillows aren’t great (usually don’t care about this but for the price it’s a little ridiculous not to have nice down pillows). I didn’t expect to have a single complaint at at a place as highly regarded as the Crawford. I am supremely disappointed. There are other cool hotels in Denver that I could have stayed at instead and simply just walked over here to experience the first floor charm. Wish I had stayed at the Kimpton or Art instead.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Made our 30th an anniversary to remember,"Pack Up + Go sent us to Denver for our surprise anniversary trip and selected the Crawford Hotel for our 3-day stay.  They could not have chosen better!  It’s a gorgeous hotel, right in the middle of Union Station, so it’s the perfect place to come and go from no matter which type of transportation you’re using.  From the time we arrived we were delighted with the hotel staff who were welcoming and helpful throughout our stay.  If you need a ride and your destination is within a couple of miles of the hotel, they’ll provide you a ride at no cost.  Their thoughtful touches were evident all weekend from the welcoming note and a plate of wonderful macarons when we arrived to the bottle of champagne hand-delivered to our room.  We stayed in of the loft guest rooms, which was gorgeous and comfortable, all at the same time.  We wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and will stay there again if we’re in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Union Station everything you need,"We took a random trip to Denver to see the mountains and go to a NHL hockey game.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exceptional Hospitality!!,"Amazing!! We stayed here for my best friend's wedding, and the service was exceptional. BIG shout out to KYLE who went above and beyond to ensure our stay, and the bride and groom, was top-notch. The hotel is so charming with original art-deco architecture and decor, and I loved the little cafes, and bar in the lobby (station). Definitely recommend getting a room in the attic space which gives you beautiful vaulted ceilings for a unique, timeless feel.  It's also very convenient to walk to a variety of bars, restaurants, pool halls, and shopping. Will definitely come back the next time we're in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Very unique, historical ... had a great stay.","My wife and I stayed 2 nights for our anniversary and her birthday get away.  The hotel is in historic, renovated Union station in the center of lower downtown.  The lobby is a fun buzz of train riders, hotel guests, locals hanging out and many shops, and places to eat and get an adult beverage.  16th street mall ends right in front, so easy walk to all the activities there.  Our room was very clean, great gym, and the staff was very helpful and professional.  We did the bed and breakfast room package which included a $40 voucher for the Snooze breakfast diner in the hotel ... delivered to out room.  The hotel also had many discounts and free-bees for happy hour drinks, coffee and ice cream at establishments in Union Station.  Did not disappoint.  We highly recommend and will be back.",5

Created in and of Union Station, it's a straight shot from the worst airport in the world, Denver Stapleton. Hop on the metro and you'll be dropped in front of the Crawford. The lobby is within the 'train station' and is architecturally beautiful. It will bring back the by-gone days of rail travel.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,What a time,"“Spoiled” doesn’t suffice as a description for how my wife & I felt after staying at The Crawford Hotel. The amenities? Check. The ambiance? Check. The bed? Absolutely, check. But beyond the room having the cozy feeling of your southern relative’s guest bedroom, or the complimentary food and beverage from the shops in Union Station, the people were simply divine. The hospitality of the entire staff, specifically Lindsey, was refreshing. She was incredibly accommodating, courteous, and helpful. It was an overall amazing stay!! *And eat at Snooze! So much fun!",5

I was knackered, airline had lost luggage and I had a business meeting in the morning. Staff was solution-oriented and very warm. Tara was amazing and helped with business needs as Margaret & Ian made the arrival welcoming. All made me happy to be back in Colorado. The Crawford rocks as does its staff. Vibe is the very Colorado. Highly recommend it and I'm a hotel snob of sorts.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford = Classy!,"Such a great time staying with friends at The Crawford. The room was gorgeous with incredible 20 foot ceilings and huge windows. Way more light than you normally get in a hotel. What really made the trip was the staff. From valet to Myles the Tesla driver, to everyone at the desk. Tara, Sydney, Kyle and Courtney. Everybody was so sincere and helpful. The night was a memorable one thanks to all who were working. Will definitely stay again.",5

Between the grand entry via the gorgeously-renovated train station to the comfortable and spacious rooms, the Crawford Hotel is a special place.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,20th Anniversary - 2-18-18 We were loved as family.,"We enjoyed our stay at The Crawford.  I want to commend Tiffany Owen-Hotel Manager and team for a very positive stay.  My wife and I could not believe the perfect level of service and cleanliness.  We joked about being out of tip money because we tried to tip everyone from the beginning of our stay - as Pete with the Valet service welcomed us and Tara -front desk welcomed us and said, ""thanks for giving us an opportunity"".  The room was stunning...we even left Housekeeping a tip at the front desk as we departed!  Myles was a great driver as he dropped/picked us up while utilizing the courtesy vehicle.  The man was dressed from head to toe and represented his company well.  We loved the way Security was not rude and awkward, and the guys on the late shift advised us on how to get food on a late Sunday.  All the more, as it was near closing time - the bartender gentlemen of the Cooper Lounge invited us to stay if we liked.  As we departed, Kyle smiled and said please come back and the young lady that checked us out (didn't get her name), was very busy but very accommodating.  The amenities of the Hotel will speak for themselves so I will not mention these, but they were stunning, and that Downtown view impeccable.  The product is so good I imagined working there and extending the beauty and service my wife and I received!!!!!  Thanks Tiffany- your team reflects good character and intend to deliver.  Go and see and feel for yourself!  -the Walkers",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome Hotel/Train Station,"Our stay has been awesome. From the moment we checked in the front desk staff made sure all our needs were met. Lindsey became my newest BFF, she asked questions to determine our visit and needs and took charge of us. She made dinner reservations for all four evenings, arranged for the Hotel car, a Tesla, to get us to museum and to dinner. She made our visit memorable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,"The Crawford hotel is simply the best place to stay in Denver! It is the perfect blend of beautifully-archaic architecture and modern convenience: never has it been more tempting to order a glass of champaign at the push of a button while luxuriating in an oversized spa, mesmerized by the century-old exposed brickwork and crossbeams.My wife and I booked this place to enjoy the trendy amenities of downtown Denver and Union Station (you dont even have to leave the building for the latter); but we eventually stayed an extra night (without leaving the room) because the hotel itself was simply the best place we had enjoyed in our 10 years of living in Colorado!I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates antique construction, modern convenience, or simply reveling in the endless supply of walking-distance bars and restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel conveniently located,This hotel was very nice. It was centrally located and offered a variety of things to do within walking distance. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The beds were comfy and the coffee was great. It was a little pricy for what you get but overall very nice.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great place for a ""staycation""","Everything was excellent. Room for improvement: If you want to go to Snooze for breakfast, make sure you tell the hotel staff at least one day in advance. We were told that we could get on the priority seating list for the following morning--we called later that afternoon to set up arrangements and then were told that all priority seating was booked. Poor communication on the part of the hotel staff.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fabulous Location and amenities,"The Crawford Hotel inside historic Union Station is a wonderful place to stay with it's numerous amenities (free coffee, ice cream scoop and beer, percentages off several eateries and  drinking establishments, as well as shops inside the station. Access to the beautiful Copper Lounge and of course luxurious rooms.  The station located in the heart of downtown Denver was opened after extensive and expensive renovations in 2014 and has been a hot spot ever since.  The hotel is one of it's charms with a great staff and rooms you'll want to live in. Kyle, our hotel concierge, who checked us in was delightful and accommodating.  He made sure everything was right and upon arrival we were given early check-in privileges and a room upgrade. Kyle was very friendly and welcoming to our every request.  He certainly helped make a stay a memorable one.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver by train,Arrived on the California Zephyr early in the morning.  Crawford Hotel staff were able to get me into a room right away.  I really appreciated the friendly helpful service from the front desk staff.  The room was small but beautiful with big windows overlooking the train tracks.  When inside the room I didn't hear any noise from the trains.Denver Union station has been transformed into a busy transportation hub.  I would have like more restoration in the main hall but the remodeling is functional and gives hints of the grand days of railroad travel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A little turn of luck on our trip home from Aspen,"My husband and I recently vacationed in Aspen and had a snow delay on our flight home (resulting in an extra night in Aspen). That next day we found out our flight out of the Aspen airport was delayed again, causing us to miss our connection in Denver. During a very unproductive discussion with United Airlines, we were told there were no flights (to about 6 major cities) available out of Denver and that we would have to wait until the next day to leave Denver.  After finding out we would be delayed a 2nd day, we decided to stay at the Crawford Hotel and just enjoy a night in Denver.  I preface this review with our airline troubles to show how upon arriving at the Crawford Hotel we were extremely frustrated, stressed, tired, etc.  Upon arriving at the hotel, we went to the desk to check in and met Paloma.  She was absolutely wonderful.  She went above and beyond to provide us with a wonderful experience at the hotel.  My husband and I both agree that it was the best service we have ever had.  The hotel and its amenities are amazing on their own, but the service and experience we had was absolutely indescribable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Valentine's Day Success,My girlfriend and I stayed the night here for Valentine's day and it was above and beyond. Not only was the staff amazing and helpful but they also had a spectacular Valentine's day deal! Highly recommended,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible!!,This was my first time staying at The Crawford and I absolutely loved it. The room was beautiful and the atmosphere is awesome. Kyle at the front desk was super helpful and wonderful to talk to. I will be visiting again soon!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful hotel and incredibly attentive staff!,"I stayed in a wonderful room, the Superior Classic. I had a wonderful view of the plaza outside the hotel. Just outside my room I could see the entire Union Station. Easy access to everything in and around the hotel. I would like to point out a few things about the staff here vs other properties. Every time I passed a staff member, they said hello and asked how I was. This was not just Front Desk. House Keeping, etc. All of them were wonderful. Speaking of House Keeping, talk about amazing. I setup my room w/ all of my work stuff and personal stuff spread out since I was staying for a week. They are like ninjas. I never saw them near the rooms and when I would return in the afternoon/evening, the room was clean, bed made, towels replaced, items restocked, etc. Which is common, but ALL of this was done w/o disturbing my setup. 50 out of 10, would stay at this property again! Also there is a wonderful placed called Snooze that you can have delivered to your room. This is a MUST TRY while here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Union Station,"Just stayed there Feb 2018, great hotel right in Union Station.First time taking train from airport right to hotel, so easy!!!!!!!Rooms are great, good restaurants!!!!Right downtown!!!Everything you need is right there, don’t even need to go outside if you don’t want too",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Stay,Had such an awesome stay. Couldn’t be easier to get to from the airport. The light rail literally stops in front of it. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and there are so many really nice restaurants and shops in the same building. Convenience galore. Had a blast.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Feel and Location!,"Right IN the Denver train station...the station itself boasts a classic feel, with classy library-style lounge and desk furniture throughout. There are plenty of side shops in the station for food and drinks. The hotel room was a bit small...but to be expected considering the prime real estate. The rooms were clean, quaint and stylish. I especially like that we had access to the hotel gym and wellness center across the street...which helped because we had a nightly beer and daily scoop of ice cream from one of the station's bar and homemade cream spots as part of our package! I also like that the police patrolling the area were always on watch...and did a very good job to control the few homeless folks in a way that allowed them to keep their dignity. There were tons of dining/drinking spots outside the station as well...and the hotel offered their Tesla for locations within 2 miles! I did have to let them know I needed an ironing board...but that was quickly addressed. I already let my wife know we'd stay here if ever in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,My very high expectations exceeded!!!!,"The Crawford hotel had been on my bucket list for a long time.  I luxuriated reading other people's reviews and quite frankly didn't think it could live up to all those positive comments.  It did...and then some.   I chose it for the location and the unique ambiance.Both of those rate high but what we remember the most was the incredible staff that went out of their way to make our stay extraordinary.  Much of what we experienced was not a request from us but rather a volunteered suggestion from the staff.  (Highest level of service provided is that which is not requested ).  We loved the amenities and took advantage of almost all of the ""goodies"" at the various bars, restaurants, and flower shop.  The room was to die for and we take great delight in telling others about our memorable experience.  We took the rail service from the airport which is easy and inexpensive and delighted to get off the train and walk right into Union Station and The Crawford Hotel (we are from Florida and it was 7 degrees outside!)  Can't wait to stay again at this truly unique property and be treated like royalty.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great find!,"I was traveling from NY to Salida to see family and stayed overnight in The Crawford before taking a 4 hour bus ride to my final destination. This is a wonderful hotel, filled with excellent restaurants, shops, kiosks, bars, etc. There is no need to leave the hotel once you check in. The staff, specifically Kyle at the front desk, could not have been more caring and accommodating. I have stayed in Fairmounts, Ritz Carltons, etc, and have not been treated as well. Kyle went out of his way every time I was in contact with him, to see that I was completely satisfied. The restaurants are high quality with equally high prices. It was worth it to me because of the location and the experience. Do not miss Snooze for breakfast. My one negative is not related the hotel but to the exorbitant taxes and fees attached to the hotel stay. My room was $249 but taxes brought it to $317. Do not miss a stay here and ask for Kyle at check in",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place,"We checked in later but were still able to take advantage of the beer, cocktails and ice-cream offered as amenities. The staff is amazing and always available to help or answer questions. We will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel and location.,This hotel was incredible and the location in Union Station was very unique.  The room was incredible and the staff could not be more accommodating and very pleasant.  They showed us a couple of rooms that we could choose from which I thought was very kind of them.  Would definitely come back and will recommend my friends and family to your hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A unique hotel in downtown Denver,"The Crawford Hotel is located in Union Station and I love how they renovated the old train station into a hotel, restaurants, bars, stores, and public space.  The main hall, where the lobby is located, was always very lively with lots of people enjoying themselves.  The hotel itself was great.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the rooms were modern and comfortable.  The only negative was the room was small (we stayed in a Classic Guest room) - fortunately it was for only one night.  I highly recommend if you want a lively hotel in a great downtown Denver location.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lobby lunch and views,"We met some friends for drinks and lunch.  It was the week before Christmas and the lobby was bustling with kids and parents in line to see santa.  Although the lobby was extremely busy, all the staff we interacted with seemed to enjoy what they were doing.  Food and drinks were good too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Outstanding hotel, amenities, and staff, but public transportation is a must","The hotel is extremely unique and lively, especially at night. There are no shortage of fantastic eateries just within the train station alone with even more in walking distance. Despite the noise of the station and city surrounding it, the rooms are nearly silent, letting you retreat into peace whenever you decide. The rooms were impeccably clean, incredibly charming, and, most importantly, always comfortable. The Tesla service would have been a really cool feature, but with only one driver, our schedule was too fluid to take advantage as the slots would fill up really quickly. Despite how wonderful this hotel was, I can't recommend taking public transportation enough. I live in Colorado, but not near downtown, so I chose to drive to the hotel and use the valet. When parking the car one night the valet was really busy. Not wanting to make the valet come over to grab the keys, we got out, went over and just said we'd like to valet the car and asked what he'd like us to do with the keys. His response was, Excuse me, we're really busy and plus, the garage is full (which shouldn't happen since we were staying at the hotel). Instead of fighting with him, we just went in and asked the Margot, one of the hotel staff, if she could help us. She was more than happy to walk outside in the 15 degree weather and make sure our car was valet parked and we were helped. Even though when I went to grab the car later I was accused of not being a guest of the hotel by the valet and had to produce my room card, I was thankful I didn't have to deal with fighting over whether I could valet park. Overall, it was a great hotel but the employees like Margot who would selflessly act in whatever capactiy they could to make the guest experience better was what made it a hotel worth coming back to. I would highly recommend and will certainly stay there again, just maybe without a car next time.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Location,"We had a business meeting for a party of 25.  Members flew in from Alaska to Tampa.  The Crawford was the perfect location.  We all took the train from the airport.  This eliminated the need for rental cars that would sit in the parking lot for 2+ days.  The rooms were well designed and comfortable.  The hotel staff was attentive and pleasant.  The location was great.  Dining and shopping were all within walking distance.  Union Station (The train station) has dining and bars that have a cool vibe.  Overall, a great hotel and location. We did a cost comparison with other hotels in Denver.  The rooms, ease of transportation, the rental of a conference room and meals all made the Crawford the logical value choice. We will go back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,3 nights and will be back,"The Crawford is within Denver’s Union Station, which is a beautiful building. I took a train from the airport right to union station, which is the last stop, 35 minutes and $9.The hotel charged a $20 resort fee or something but its well worth it since you get daily a free beer (choose 1 of 25 on tap, and a $5 Manhattan cocktail (normally ($12) at another bar, a free homemade ice cream, a great happy hour with $1.50 oysters....and you never have to leave Union Station with at least 6 great dining choices. If that’s not enough, you could walk out the door and your within 2 blocks of another 12 places to explore.The room was classic handsome 1920’s decor with a large room and comfortable bed. Ask for a room not over the center of union square. I had a room off of the center (220) and was quiet.I will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Shuffle down for some shuffle board,Well beyond the charm and restored grandeur to Downtown Denver.  We had a fun evening with friends playing shuffle board and people watching.   Service is wonderful - at the hotel Desk clerks really are sensational - rooms comfy and tastefully  decorated.  Great dining experiences in walking distance or at the hotel.  Whether you are travelling or watching those who travel a great spot and our favorite Denver hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful room in a great location!,"We stayed at the Crawford Christmas Eve and although our room was small, it was well appointed and comfortable. Because of the location in Union Station you are a short walk to everything down town. We had drinks at Wyncoop and dinner at Tavernetta, all within a short walk! The front desk receptionist was friendly and quick and gave us all the information necessary. The only negative was there was no restaraunrt open for breakfast because of the Christmas holiday.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Pampered in the heart of Denver,"I booked because I wanted convenience and location but my takeaway will be how comfortable and spoiled I felt here at The Crawford.  Amenities meant to spoil...free scoop of delicious ice cream at the milk box creamery, coffee at the Pigtrain Coffee Co and a drink at the lobby bar are just the start..  while almost everything I could possibly want to do, drink or eat is within a block or two, the Crawford offers a Tesla car service for those slightly longer jaunts.  My drivers made the visit even better - Riley was a great Ambassador of Denver.  The room itself was cozy and quiet even though I was located right over the restaurant with a view of the trains.  I landed in Denver airport, grabbed my luggage and was on one of those trains within minutes and a cheap $9 ticket got me to the Crawford in about a half hour.  The train was clean and safe.   (Union Station) has great restaurants and activities so  staying at the Crawford allows immediate access in a safe, comfortable and fun way.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An amazing stay for our group,We recently had our company holiday party in downtown Denver and reserved a block of rooms at the Crawford Hotel. The sales process was seamless and their entire team was great to work with. Our employees absolutely loved the hotel and they took great care of everyone. The rooms are incredible and the location of the property cannot be beat. Many were grateful to be able to bring their dogs and we all were able to take advantage of the newly renovated Union Station and all it has to offer.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford Delivers,"Our second stay at the Crawford was as good as our first.  We stayed for three nights this time.  The room was well appointed and provided the glimpse of a time gone by. Staff was friendly and helpful.  The property itself could not be better located in Denver.  Smack dab in Union Station, it sits in a hub of buzzing activity with restaurants, pubs and transportation taking center stage.  It is also a five minute walk to several four star restaurants.  Light rail to the Denver airport is right out the door. This place is a must stay for people in their twenties or thirties or people enjoying the buzz of a young vibe.  Full marks to the Crawford.  We can't wait to get back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Nice Historic Location,"I love the historic location and use of space.  We had a room on the top floor, so it also had a fabulous vaulted ceiling.  The rooms were clean and impressive, overall a nice place to stay in a central location.  Good for couples or friends, but I would not recommend for families.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great destination spot!,"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway for his birthday. We live in Denver, so we weren't sure if staying in the city would feel like that much of a getaway. Luckily it did! There was so much to do inside the hotel. It was during the Christmas season, so it was especially festive. We loved our room and the courtesy we received from Marie who helped us book our stay. We can't wait to come back and definitely recommend to others from afar and those who live in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Uninformed,"This hotel is amazing. Beautifully decorated and over the top in regards to aesthetics. It was a comfortable place to spend NYE. I booked the day before. Considering it was NYE, I expected to pay more. Probably the most I’ve ever spent on a room and I’ve stayed in some amazing places. Anyway, what I’m a bit irked about is the lack of information. Upon reading reviews after our stay, I learned about the paid parking across the street (I’m sorry but $45 for valet is the most I’ve ever been charged for downtown hotel parking). I later read about the Snooze priority and Cooper Lounge. Upon check-in, hotel staff was friendly and did show me the amenity card. They did not, however, mention you must have the card when partaking in those amenities. I figured a room key and ID would be used. So, stood in a long line on NYE just to figure this out later. When redeeming our drink comps, the line was outrageously long and they only allowed one drink per guest at a time. The comps were only Denver beers too so meh on that amenity. A separate line or server for hotel guests would make this much better. Ice cream place had wonky hours so we were never able to get those free scoops. With all of the travelers around, it really wasn’t a cozy hotel feeling. Felt like I needed to watch my back and I would never let my kids meander alone. Many homeless people sitting/laying on the benches immediately outside of the elevators leading to the rooms. They just stared at us as we rolled our luggage by (obvious tourists) Now I know there are safety measures (keyed entries) to prevent non-guests from entering the room areas but it did feel like someone could be an easy target here. The room was beautiful. We didn’t use the Tesla. Should have. It’s a great location.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Yearly Visit,"I've stayed here 3 years in a row over the holidays, and I really love it. This year was particularly a standout because I had just come off of a horrific holiday of family medical emergencies, and the staff was exceptionally kind and accommodating. There were also some fun events on NYE night, easy access to great restaurants and bars, and fireworks visible from just outside. Love this place! Will return again and again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Mixed Bag,"It was a mixed bag at the Crawford for us. I was really looking forward to our stay based on what we'd read about, but our experience fell short of what we read about in some respects. We booked through Chase Rewards for a ""Premium Loft"" room. Upon arrival, we were given a ""Premium Classic"" room. When I asked to be put in the same class of room we had reserved, paid, and confirmed over the phone the day before I was told that all of those rooms had been taken, and that there had been ""a mixup"" with in house reservations. It was frustrating that we weren't given the same thing we had paid for, and more so that we had to ask about the change rather than the hotel being honest about the mistake from the beginning. At that point another person at the desk took over and tried her best to mitigate the situation - she comped the valet parking and the amenity fee, offered us our choice between the classic room or a smaller loft, got us the house car for dinner. That brought things back to level, given the room price differences. The space is beautifully renovated and bustling with activity. It was hard to use the beer token given how crowded terminal bar was, we more enjoyed the peace and quiet at Coopers Lounge. (We were able to get off the waitlist, I wish I knew about the reservations). Pigtrain was great. But water never showed up in the room, we had to ask for it at the front desk. When we checked out, as well, the amenity fee had been added back on (and the person we had spoken to the evening before wasn't there). It was removed after we spoke to them, but again an issue with service and communication that I didn't expect from a hotel of this caliber. The house car was great (especially in the snow), bed comfortable, bigelow bath products very nice. If we're back in Denver we'd consider staying again, but would certainly book directly given all the issues we had with the third party treatment.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Surpassed My Expectations !,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our fifth stay at the Crawford last week. We have always found the hotel personnel to be extremely courteous and professional. We have stayed in a number of the different room styles, and are always impressed by the way that they have managed to design them to feel warm and comfortable. The addition of the train line connecting directly with the airport has made the trip in and out so convenient. Really looking forward to our next visit!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,FINEST HOTEL IN DENVER!,"The Crawford Hotel is Fantastic!  The property, staff and amenities are the very best.We arrived on the train directly from the airport to the beautifully restored and decorated Union Station.  It is so easy for traveling. The front desk staff were so nice and welcoming! The rooms at The Crawford Hotel are all unique and lovely. My husband and I stayed in a beautiful Premium Classic style.  Our bed was extremely comfortable! The bathroom offered a beautiful bathtub and a great shower. The double vanity was large and had a lighted makeup mirror, which is just one of the many little things they thought of to make the stay comfortable. All the rooms and halls have very pretty artwork too. The Tesla courtesy car was available and ready to take us and pick us up from our destinations around Denver.  I believe The Crawford Hotel is the finest in Denver!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,One of the best properties  I have stayed at.,"I am a multimillion miles flier with platinum and diamond status at all major national brands.At our sons suggestion, we stayed here and what an exquisite experience. Luxury, comfort, courtesy- thou name is The Crawford, Lauren at the front desk walked in bitter cold across the street to Uber and with her petite frame not only carried our bags but put in room even before we got to room. Thanks, Lauren, you are awesome. What can I say for the drivers David, Miles and Riley- on time, courteous and very professional. Management should be very proud  if I had a hotel in Denver, I will still all of them. Thanks",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique Experience in a Primo Part of Town,"We enjoyed staying at the Crawford in a Deluxe Classic Room for two nights during the holiday season.  Our corner room had two huge, floor to ceiling windows that let in tons of light.  While the bathroom was on the smaller side (no tub), the room itself was spacious and nicely appointed.  Because the hotel is inside Union Station, the place is hopping, which is fun, but it would also be nice to have a private place to hang out (besides the room) and the Crawford doesn’t offer that. The Cooper Lounge, which is a beautiful space, is open after 4 PM, and empty during the day.  It would be an awesome amenity for guests if the Crawford would offer continental breakfast in that space for guests only.  We booked the “Hoilday Package” which included free valet parking (worth $45) and comped the  “Amenity Fee” (worth $20) but the reservation confirmation did not confirm this information so that was a bit confusing.  It would be nice if the hotel reservation system could figure out a way to include exactly what is included in the booked package IN the email confirmation.  Valet service was slow, so we realized after the first time, that we needed to give them 20 minutes to bring the car around.  Crawford guests get priority reservations at Snooze (if you know about Snooze, that is a big deal) and that worked out really well for us.  The Crawford is in a primo part of town, Union Station has been beautifully renovated, and staying at the hotel offers a unique experience.  If you don’t mind lots of action around you (but note, the room itself is very quiet), it would be worth checking out.  If you like a more elegant and quiet hotel experience, then I would recommend that you go elsewhere.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Reservations and details  a problem here,"Nice property, but not quite there with service.  Could be a solid four star, but service is off.  Multiple problems with hotel canceling our reservations.  Hotel offered a credit to order food.  Ordered room service next morning and no food ever arrived - even after calling to find out where it was.  I honestly have no idea how this hotel is considered a top business hotel?  You can be quirky and cool, but you still need the basics.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Xmas in denver ,Got the holiday package for 3 days 2 nights. Stayed in Pullman room. Lunch at merch. Bkfst at snooze. Tesla courtesy ride to and fr theatre priceless. Our driver david was the best. Room was perfect. Thxs,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Shout out to Myles! ,First trip to Denver and we couldn’t be more satisfied with our trip so far! Myles gave us A+ treatment and a great tour of the area in the complimentary Tesla.  Thank you to The Crawford Hotel for a wonderful visit.   ,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique experience,This was a fun place to stay on a quick trip to Denver. The experience was fun. The room was nice and the amenities include free food from surrounding places in union station. It was a fun stay overall. ,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Another Fabulous Holiday Stay,"Just had another wonderful stay! My family and I come every year at Christmas, and this year they we were not disappointed. The hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas. We even got our favorite room. From the drinks at the Terminal bar to our super friendly Tesla Driver, Dave it was a great stay. (Dave was really awesome!) Looking forward to next year.    Only bummer was the two hour wait for Santa.  (Please bring him back on Saturdays and or a few days during the week.)",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Meetings,This was a really nice place to stay. The hotel is located inside Union Station so its really busy near the check in area. Several choices for food and entertainment near the hotel. The staff was really attentive and accommodating. We arrived early so they kept our luggage and then had it delivered to our room for us. The room was nice and clean. It was very well furnished and well maintained. The gym had nice machines but no weights. We had a great time and would stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Mile High Gem,"Fantastic experience from check in to departure.  The hotel is situated downtown and convenient to all the unique local shopping and food. The bonus is the Tesla valet service provided with your stay - the drivers Myles and David were professional, friendly, informative and very helpful.  The entire staff was 5-Star, and I am a tough customer with high expectations.  We will be back.  Oh, and make sure you try the local ice cream from Magill’s, best I’ve ever had.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique experience in downtown Denver,"Recommended if you are not renting a car and either taking Uber or doing a car share (Maven). Good for those who like the nightlife, fancy drinks, and easy access to amenities. Bad if you are getting a car (parking is expensive) and prefer eating at chain restaurants. ARRIVAL/CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUTWe picked The Crawford Hotel because we were not planning to rent a car, and the light rail A line from DIA ends right at the hotel. The light rail was fast and easy (albeit a little steep at $9 a head). Once we exited the station, the hotel was right in front of us. We went into the station through one of the many pairs of double doors and found the front desk on the left side, amongst many shops and restaurants. The check in was easy; even though we arrived at 2, they were able to check us in. They gave us our card keys, told us about the amenities and said they provided some accommodations in the room for our dog as well. Check out was just as easy and we hopped back on the A line to the airport. THE ROOMWe reserved a Pullman Superior room, and it is supposed to look like a train sleeper, long and narrow. I mean, we ARE staying at the train station, right? It was decorated in Art Deco style, with carved wood doors and stylish mirrors. The bathroom is right off the entry, with a sliding door, revealing a subway tiled shower (no tub) and good sized vanity. Straight into the room is a mirrored vanity table with a bench hidden below. Next to that, there is a closet, revealing half a closet for clothes, and the other half holding the coffee pod maker, cups, ice bucket and a mini fridge. Next to that, and in front of the window was a swivel chair, and a side table. There was a dog bed and treats left for our doggo there as well. On the other side of the wall was the bed, with a partition between the bed and desk. The partition had a TV mounted to it, so you could swivel it towards the bed or the desk area. The room itself was not large, but the partition created a nice break up of the space, so you didn’t feel like it was this small, narrow, and long room.  But in fact it was a bit on the small side, and we wished there was more than only one chair to sit on, but the narrow room size wouldn’t have accommodated two chairs. If there ever was a reason to visit Denver again, I’d definitely upgrade to a larger room. THE AMENITIESThis was not a happy visit or a vacation, so we didn’t plan on doing much. That being said, we enjoyed the amenities that were offered through the hotel. Given the $20 daily amenities charge, we partook of the free ice cream and discounts on coffee and pastries in the morning. The whole station was packed and abuzz at night (probably because we were there Friday and Saturday nights) with people enjoying the various eateries, drinking, and hanging around. We had cocktails at the Terminal Bar, and we enjoyed them whilst sitting on a bench, along with some tasty fries. The morning revealed a drastic change; it was very quiet with only a few people waiting for their trains. The coffee place was open from 6 AM, so it was very convenient to go downstairs and grab some coffee and pastries for breakfast. There were a whole lot of other restaurants close by, and we noticed a Whole Foods a block or two away as well. The fact that The Crawford allows doggos was the main reason for staying here. Our usual dog sitter was not available given the last minute trip, so we had to travel with pup in tow. He’s a pretty chill traveler, and he settled right in. The only complaint I have is that there is not a great place for dogs to “relieve” themselves. Actually the whole downtown area was lacking any sort of dog friendly grass patches. The only place that was close for an early morning jaunt was a couple of planters on the northeast side of the station, in front of Snooze eatery. For a longer walk to find some grass, we went over the Millennium Bridge and to Commons Park. The light rail was the other reason for staying here. It was very convenient if you don’t plan on renting a car. However, the light rail must have a lot of issues with people not paying, as we were visited twice each way by the same rail security/operators asking for tickets. We commented to ourselves that we’d gone hundreds of miles in Europe without anyone harassing us twice. We saw them make people download and pay via app, if they had gotten the wrong, less expensive ticket. So be warned—make sure you get yourself the $9 airport ticket.All in all, although the occasion was not happy, we really enjoyed The Crawford Hotel. We’d recommend this hotel to anyone who hates chain hotels and wants a unique experience in downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel. Great Service. Great City.,"I stayed at the Crawford Hotel at the beginning of December 2017 and was left absolutely in awe.  From the moment we walked in, not only did the physical hotel space create a warm and inviting environment, but the staff did as well.  The hotel supervisor, Lindsey Silverman, helped us in every step of the way.  From graciously checking our bags when we arrived before check in time, to orienting us with all of the features of the hotel (the hotel’s free ice cream for guests is a great plus!), to ensuring our room was prepared and well tended to, Lindsey was a gem! Ive stayed in several luxury hotels, all featuring the highest quality room service, hotel amenities and features, but the customer service truly makes or breaks an experience.  We were able to ask questions to all of the Crawford staff when we needed it and they truly exemplified the friendly and welcoming city of Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,NOT hospitable,"My husband and son stayed here from Dec.9 - 11th 2017.  Said the hotel was lovely, that I'd love it.  My husband had to fly back Monday night so checked out and my son stayed elsewhere for the one night.  My husband arranged with the desk staff to have my son leave his bags at the hotel so he could tour around Denver before taking the train to the airport for his flight Tuesday evening.  When my son arrived there Tuesday morning with his bags - he was told by the manager named Lindsay that he could NOT leave his bags, he had not stayed there the night before.  My son said she was not accommodating in any way and was actually MEAN.  REALLY?  In this day and age?  UNFORGIVABLE!  We will be staying at the Brown Palace and the JW Marriott on our next visit (about 4 times/year) - how about you?",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Nice rooms; nice location,"Let me right off the bat say this is a solid 4-star hotel, but I cannot abide by hotels that tack on a ""destination amenity fee"" ($22.95 in this case) to the room price. A ""free"" ice cream scoop? A ""free"" cup of coffee? Let me buy those if I want. With that out of the way...as several reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is almost not a hotel. There is a small reception area and then you take an elevator up to rooms whose front doors often look down over the train station's waiting area. It's a lovely area, so no complaints here, just that it's not what you're used to. The train station feels brand new and has a nice lively buzz to it. Don't think there are many trains - other than the airport train. If you drove here, there's a public parking garage almost immediately across the street if you'd rather not valet park. Lots of restaurants either in the station, or within easy walking distance. There is a lovely bar one floor up (you could see the entire bar from outside our room looking down). It didnt seem too busy (got a place to sit no problem) nor too noisy, so a perfect place for a drink before heading out for dinner, we really liked it.We had a 3rd-floor corner room (premium classic), with one side facing the main street, and our door facing the station lobby. We are very sensitive to noise and had no issues whatsoever. The room was quite large; bed was comfortable; bathroom well lit. No movies on TV (yes, yes, stream your own and all that).We've stayed at the Four Seasons and JW Marriott (plus a bunch of Denver airport hotels), and this is definitely a top choice in Denver. Four Seasons is clearly more elegant, much of which comes down to it's expansive lobby (nice rooms too), and the JW although high-end just feels tired and the rooms feel almost like you could be in any old Marriott/Hilton etc. I reckon we might stay here again next time we come.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Tesla Courtesy Transportation,"The trip to and from the Capital Grille in the Tesla Courtesy car, driven by Riley, was outstanding. Riley was friendly, attentive and quite the host! Please let Riley know how grateful we are for his outstanding customer service! Well done!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Good Central Luxury Hotel in Denver,"I've stayed at the Crawford twice--once for a date night, and once on my wedding night.  The rooms are nice, the beds are very comfortable, and I do like the little additional conveniences provided, such as free or discounted items and services at the shops and restaurants in Union Station.  However, the staff leaves a lot to be desired in terms of a service-oriented attitude.  The check-in associate, Ameena, probably shouldn't be working in hospitality at all, as her favorite word seems to be ""no,"" and I didn't see her smile once at anyone.  Because I do not believe staff with such attitudes should be employed at luxury hotels, I detract one star.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A beautiful venue,"The Crawford is located inside Union Station in Denver.  The lobby is done in turn of the century motif and is spacious, beautiful and comfortable while at the same time useful for the local line as well as Amtrack.  My room was comfortable and quiet.  There was a fully stocked expresso machine in the room and guests had access to two free waters per day.  The fitness room was small but guests had access to a larger center across Wynkoope Street.  The front desk staff as well as all other staff members were courteous and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing room! Amazing experience!,"I stayed one night, and it was incredible! There were two great women who helped us out, Courtney and Amina. They were friendly, and delightful. I was picked up in the Tesla from my restaurant by Myles, and he was conversational, friendly, safe, and engaging. It was so cool to stay in Union Station, and the perks at the restaurants and bars in Union Station are an excellent bonus! Highly recommend!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great Hotel, Good Value","We stayed downtown overnight after my company's Christmas party. We had a great room away from the atrium with a beautiful view of the city. Bed and shower were excellent and we did enjoy some of the ""freebies"" from the $20 destination charge, though I'm not sure that given the choice, I would have paid for that, especially since we're not beer or coffee drinkers. All things considered for the price, it was very good and we'd love to stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Babymoon ,When we got off the train I had no clue what to expect. The staff at check in did a fantastic job getting us into our room early. The setting is awesome especially during Chris. It is located in an old train station and the people are friendly at ever spot from pigtrain coffee to the terminal bar. My favorite is the hotel staff. They treat you like royalty here. Dave is our fav! He drove us around Denver in a Tesla. His conversation this trip has been great. The rooms are awesome. The shower was really cool. The feel is very nostalgic and 1920s sort of. This hotel is perfect for a weekend get away. Just what the wife and I needed. We will be back.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible,"From the moment I stepped inside until the moment I left, everything and everyone was amazing!!!  I received a phone call from the hotel manager herself minutes after walking inside my room after check-in.  I mentioned that there wasn't honey in the room for the espresso, and she had the kitchen make up something unique and delivered it to me herself!  The Tesla ride was also really cool.  The shops, bars, and everything was very unique - highly recommend this place, and I certainly want to return there soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Absolutely amazing!,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Crawford while visiting our son who goes to school in Denver and all I can say is WOW! The hotel is amazing and located in a truly unique space, Denver's Union Station. We loved that the lobby is the old train terminal and was decorated to the nines for Christmas. The room was spotless, comfortable and the bed amazing. The girls at the front desk were very sweet and accommodating and the gentleman driving the courtesy car were prompt and delightful. We also opted to take the history tour of the station which was the highlight of our stay, Ian the tour guide is eccentric and wonderful and brought the station to life for us - so much history hiding in plain sight! If you are looking for the best hotel in Denver, look no further than the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Stay - love the amenities and ambience! ,We loved our stay at The Crawford Hotel!   Great setting at Union Station in LODO.    Outstanding staff that took care of all our needs.  Great amenities included with our stay!  Especially appreciated Dave who ran us around town in the Tesla X that is part of the amenities plan!    It was actually Dave that showed us the car that made us interested in booking a stay while we were in town!   We will be back!     Thanks for a great visit!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Treated like a queen,"Just spent 6 days at the Crawford (again). And again, it was just about perfect. I love staying in Denver's ""living room""- Union Station. We had a gorgeous corner room on the 2nd floor with all the lux amenities. Snooze was right downstairs! The hotel staff could not have been friendlier. They took care of every request with a smile! We used the courtesy car (a Tesla!) and the drivers: Dave, Milo and Riley, were so outgoing and welcoming. You could not ask for a more convenient location when visiting Denver. Treat yourself to a stay here!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Such a treat!,"My girlfriends and I enjoyed a women's getaway here! LOVED all the perks...the happy hour at the speakeasy, free ice cream cone, best latte ever, Tesla car service, walking distance to everything wonderful in Denver. FIVE STAR in every way. Going back and taking my husband for a romantic getaway.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Date Night,"My husband and our two neighbors did a date night at The Crawford Hotel including the Stranahans whiskey tour. The driver of their courtesy car, Riley, was punctual, friendly and great at navigating Friday night traffic to get us there on time for our tour (not to mention the Tesla model X was quite fun). The hotel is beautiful and a great people-watching spot. We tried a room on the third floor this time and it was large, clean and incredibly unique. The two headed shower was wonderful! The Crawford never disappoints, we just need to stay longer next time.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect polished urban getaway!,"The hotel is beautifully situated within historic union station and is the perfect place for a polished and elevated urban getaway. The staff was attentive, polite and professional. The room was warm, lofty and clean. Loved the bathroom and the CO Bigelow bath products - peppermint and lavender. Good bath products are such an appreciated surprise instead of the expected watered down sample sizes given at most hotels! You can order breakfast ahead of time from Snooze on the iPad in the room which was a cool touch. Loved all of the extra amenities like the branded tesla courtesy car which we took to dinner! Also the free ice cream from their partner vendor in Union Station AND a free beer at happy hour in Terminal Bar. Love love love this hotel. It's perfect for a date night, solo staycation, business travel and especially for anyone coming in from out of town as Union Station is the coolest place in Denver right now.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Place,My husband and I just returned from 3 nights in Denver.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Crawford Hotel.  It's so conveniently located in downtown Denver at Union Station.  Our room was spacious and comfortable. We'll definitely be back.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford Hotel at Union Station,"A beautiful hotel in a great location in Denver! Courtney at the front desk was fantastic to talk with and she offered all sorts of accommodations that made staying a breeze. The Crawford has a complimentary Tesla that can be used to get around the city within a 2-mile radius. Our driver, Riley, was extremely friendly and flexible with time when he came by to pick us up at a speak easy that was nearby. The hotel is inside Union Station and they did an incredible job preserving it's historical features and converting old office spaces into rooms. I will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great Room, Perfect Location","I absolutely loved my stay at the Crawford. It is a beautiful hotel, and the rooms perfectly reflect the character of the historic Union Station. As far as convenience for someone trying to experience Denver, you couldn't ask for a better location. In the heart of LoDo, you can easily walk to one of many great night spots, or catch a train/bus to anywhere else you'd like to see.On a personal note, as someone who grew up in Denver, and spent a lot of time at the Union station before renovation, I am amazed at how well this area has turned itself around, and the Crawford Hotel is one of many integral factors in an amazing transformation. Would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stay at the Crawford Hotel,The hotel finishes are beautiful. The Union Station Lobby is magical and the restaurants there and nearby are terrific. Myles and Dave took good care of us getting us where we needed to go and sharing the local knowledge of the area.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Train Station Turned Hotel --- WOW!,"The Crawford Hotel... wow, where do I start? Talk about a beautiful place to stay. When you enter the building you are greeted by an incredible view; an old train station beautifully restored with all of its vintage charm.The rooms are incredible! Beds are super comfortable, showers are spacious and luxurious, and the Voss water is a nice touch.If you are flying into Denver the train will dead end at Union Station (aka the Crawford Hotel). You can't beat the location. You're in the heart of downtown and can easily walk to everything. But if you don't feel like walking, you're in luck! The Crawford Hotel has a courtesy valet service that will drive you anywhere in the downtown area for free. Yeah, it's awesome!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing rooms and location!,"We staying in a suite with a living space, king bed, and large bathroom with soaking tub.  It was prefect and ever better than the pictures. All the amenities were great and perks. This is located inside the train station so it is very busy with lots of people but the room was very quiet. This is a great location for bars and restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel - Super cool,"Biggest disappointment....only got to stay here one night.  This is a great property, right in Union Station.  It is a very lively environment and location is fantastic.  If you are in town for a sporting event you can walk to it no matter what it is, and there are multiple restaurants and bars all walkable.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The rooms are great.  Love the amenities in in the bathrooms.  Even though you are at an active train station you would hardly ever know it.  They have done a great job with insulating the outside world from the room.Walking around the ""lobby"" takes you back to the early 1900's.  Historically and architecturally this place is stunning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Has it all!,"There is really nothing else that could make this hotel any better.  A train directly from the airport to the hotel, accommodating concierge staff, some of the best restaurants in Denver, walking distance to all of downtown, comfy beds, chic rooms and an awesome lounge for a nightcap.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford Hotel,The remodel of what used to be offices in Denver's Union Station is nothing but an unqualified success.  The rooms are beautiful and well appointed and the view overlooking the first floor lobby area is spectacular.  This is a luxury hotel so not inexpensive but worth it for that special stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel and Excellent Staff,"Stayed at The Crawford Hotel for a business meeting. The hotel is in a great location with a lot of amenities.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun place and great location,Very enjoyable place with well designed rooms. Great location for bars and restaurants with the in-house Cooper Bar heading the list.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Downtown Romance,"Amazing visit! Dave and the Tesla was a highlight! Easy check in, great bars, ride to our show and then they picked us up.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stay where it's happening,"So easy! If you are flying in to Denver, you can go down to the ground level and walk 50 yards to the light rail. In 30 minutes you get off at the railroad station where the hotel is for less than $10. The rooms are QUIET and of ample size; the bathroom is clean and spacious and the bed/pillows are outstanding. The railroad station downstairs is filled with restaurants, bars and little shops. The hotel is one block from a free bus system that goes along the length of 16th street. I would stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel with staff that are friendly and professional,"I stayed at the Crawford Hotel twice now when I was in town for business.  It is located in the heart of downtown Denver and the train is very convenient to get you back and forth from the airport for only $9.00 each way (door to door).  The rooms are very clean and decorated nicely.  The lobby is a comfortable gathering place for both the locals and travelers; get a hot cup of coffee from Pigtrain Coffee Company and hang out with your friends, order a great-tasting breakfast at Snooze cafe or get the kids ice cream from the Milkbox Ice Creamery.  The staff is very professional and friendly. On your next visit to the Crawford, say hi to Matt at the front desk for me.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hospitality!,Riley was great! The hotel provided us with a drive in a 2 mile radius and with this location that covers enough! Great room with living room and great view! The lobby reminds you of hogwarts during Christmas time! Great vibe!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best of Denver in one building!,I stayed at The Crawford for a couple's retreat and was blown away.  The staff was incredible and took care of my every need.  I purchased an upgrade at check in and it was a great deal - totally worth it.  We ate and drank at many of the places in Union Station and they were all awesome.  Stay in bed and get room service from Snooze!  I will definitely be back!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful station refurbishment in great location,"Very quiet hotel in an active train station. There are a very wide variety of restaurants and bars in Union Station.

The Light Rail to get to the airport is right there at Union Station",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford,"This was a wonderful addition to the train ride from Glenwood to Denver and back.  After a little opps in our arriving in Denver, we were welcomed by a wonderful person who saw what had happened.  Dominic helped by engaging us and telling a little history on the hotel art, intrigued we asked about rates, then booked us a wonderful room with awesome amenities.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Complete Hospitality,"This could be one of the most unique metropolitan transit stations in the world accented with top notch restaurants, cafes, bars, and bookstores, all centrally located in Downtown Denver. The Crawford Hotel encompasess the entire station which is easily accessible from the Denver Airport, and provides transportation to anywhere in the state. The Crawford Hotel specifically caters to the traveller, the local, and pets. I stayed there with my siberian husky and was provided with instruction cards for easy access to dog parks, a dog bed, food/water bowls, and all around genuine warmth and graciousness. I have stayed at the Crawford 4 times now, and make it a requirement for any stop in denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wow... Denver,My daughter booked this hotel for us and I can honestly say it was a fantastic find.. Great rooms with tall ceilings and beautiful bathrooms.  Quiet !  The train station down stairs is really cool.  We used the Tesla complimentry car driven by David.  Such a nice guy!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Instagram Friendly,"The Crawford hotel is beautiful. WOW.  The City of Denver should be very proud of the renovation of Union Station and the revitalization of the area. It's very impressive. I stayed at the hotel for one night just to check it out!  Gorgeous design.  I had room 238. It is very small. The wood detailing is beautiful. The room feels very inviting. There are two ""free"" Voss water bottles and a great expresso maker. The air conditioning is quiet and comfortable. The TV is way to large for the room. All the information for the room is on an I-Pad. After flying in, renting a car, trying to sync my phone to my rental, driving in downtown Denver to find how to valet the car ($45), I wasn't in the mood to figure out a channel guide on an iPad. I called the front deck to ask what channel the local news was on. They said to check the I pad. The ladies at the front desk were adorable and very helpful. The shower is beautiful. The water pressure was ok, not great, and was lukewarm, I couldn't figure out how to make it hot. The property is expensive and I really  enjoyed the experience but wouldn't stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford Batmobile,"We stayed at the hotel whilst attending the Durango Songwriting Expo. We had a loft room, which was very spacious, comfortable with free water and chocolates each night. The only thing was it was a bit dark. The hotel was an ideal location for us as travellers from London to visit the city. The train from the airport had cross platform access with a 37 minute service to the Union Station. The hotel staff were efficient, courteous whilst providing a first class service. The other plus is the Mercantile Restaurant within the complex their breakfast menu was healthy and wholesome. Let’s not forget Coopers Bar on the third floor that serves a half bottle of Rosé champagne paradise. The city’s free hop on off bus service on 16th Street for shopping is an excellent service with the bus frequency of under 5 minutes duration. For high end shopping Cherry Creek Mall it’s about 10 minutes max in a Uber. The Crawford courtesy gull wing Telsa car aka the Batmobile was a surprise perk taking us to restaurants within a 2 mile radius. The Batmobile was an opportunity for us to imagine we were on a cape crusade mission to bring good to the city only ours was usually to dine and shop!!...",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for a weekend getaway (even if you live in Denver),"We love The Crawford. The location in Union Station is amazing and so close to great places in downtown Denver. The rooms are luxurious and comfortable, the amenities are wonderful (they carry my favorite lotion in the rooms), and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. You get some fun Union Station freebies when you stay at The Crawford and you can pre-book your Snooze reservation and skip the wait for brunch (it can be up to a 2 hour wait one the weekend). We’ll be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful hotel!,"Great location. Lots of amenities in the main area (union station), really bustling scene with great restaurant, coffee, ice cream and bar.  Very unique layout in general, rooms were clean and upscale. And....Coziest bed ever!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love this place,The staff was amazing. The room was above and beyond. The whole atmosphere of the place was fantastic. We probably should be stayed another night so we could explore more. Next time we will for sure! If you need to get to the airport early the train is very convenient for that.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,LETS GO GIANTS,Stayed at The Crawford while attending the Giants vs Broncos game. This is a great hotel. Very convenient to airport and stadium as well as bars and restaurants. Room was very nice with comfortable bed and was very clean. A bit pricey but I think the convenience was worth it.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome stay!,"Loved my stay here! The front desk people were so nice, friendly and always smiling! Lauren who checked us in was so nice and very informative,  Margot who checked us out was awesome, she is so friendly. David who drove the curiosity car made the ride  fun and relaxing, very easy to talk to!  I loved the shower in our room, the rain shower head and the space of shower was very luxurious. We did not hear any noise coming from the great hall, the rooms are very quiet  for all of the hustle and bustle that is around.  Everything we have experienced was unforgettable about the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun In Downtown!,"This place won't be everyone's cup of tea but I've been twice in the past month and a half and really really like it.  In a way it's a bit of a 'deconstructed hotel' smack in the middle of the train station right downtown within walking distance of about everything you'd want to do.  Walk to the ball park? Check.  Walk to LoHi over the highway and thru the park on 17th? Check.  Head up the 16th street mall? or to Larimer Street?  Check and Check.The restaurant scene and about everything else you could want in the hustle and bustle of the town is right at your fingertips.  It's not a Hyatt, Westin, Sheraton, or Marriott. It is so much more fun and a great vibe.  It takes some getting used to because it's in the middle of a station with shops all the way around.  One little entry stall is the check in, concierge, and bell desk all combined and you don't really realize all those services are there until you ask.  The rooms are across the station and up the elevator so that feels different.  You can also take the stairs.  It's relationship with shopkeepers is 'indirect' meaning you can get a drink at the wonderful bar on the second story or get breakfast at Snooze or get a complimentary ice cream or coffee at the local creamery and coffee shop but none of the experiences are actually part of the hotel.  Thats why I say it's like a deconstructed hotel. The lobby is the station area.  But it's LOVELY you just have to accept that you are not contained in a building that is all hotel and nothing but hotel.  But that's the fun of it.The rooms are well appointed. They have coffee, wonderful bath products, and we chose a deluxe room that had a separate seating area and claw tub and shower with double sink.  The beds are yummy - firm, great sheets, and very very comfortable and our room had super high ceilings and the temperature was consistent and lots of natural light. If you like to cocoon I'm told the rooms up in the 'attic' are really cozy and super.  Wasn't our cup of tea because I like windows and up in those rooms the windows are up near the ceiling.  Complimentary waters and also as I said coupons for a drink, coffee, ice-cream and nice treats throughout. They make their car available for a 2 mile radius but a) it wasn't available when we needed it and b) we'd rather walk. Anyway - love this place. The only thing that keeps it in my mind from being a 5 star from a four is there is no turn down service. You get two sets of towels for two people instead of four and on the bed,  I'd rather have a duvet than what felt like a sheet and a heavy duvet in a bedspread like covering.  Was a little heavy.  But who can quibble.It's a bit on the expensive side but worth the experience.  This is my new go-to when I go to Denver and I will definitely be back.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Expensive but quality,"We stayed at the Crawford Hotel before our trip on the Califonia Express because its only a 2 minute walk from the hotel which is based in the station terminal, to the trains. The hotel harks back to a nostalgic era but you do pay for it as its expensive. The rooms are luxurious with big beds and high ceilings. As others have said make sure you ask for a quiet room away from the hassle and bustle of the terminal which the some of the corridors and lifts overlook. We enjoyed the stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Special Experience in Downtown Denver,"Our ""staycation"" for our 3rd Wedding Anniversary included an overnight at the Crawford Hotel. We loved the character and luxury of the 4th level Loft-Style room.  The room is well-designed with spacious sitting area (red leather sofa was a nice touch) and comfy King bed with robes supplied. Gorgeous bathroom with jumbo soaking tub and oversized shower! Very quiet room and the staff was wonderful...made me feel special.  The location is perfectly situated in the renovated Union Station...rode the light trail and everything was smooth and convenient.  Would stay here again for a special occasion.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,As good as it gets!,"A forward thinking hotel experience for the savvy traveler. From the gorgeous rooms to the personalized service, this place has it all. Explore the building, restaurants, amenities and neighborhood. A must for all visiting Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,As overrated as its namesake,Named after Dana Crawford who basically did very little and got credit for a lot - this hotel is just poorly planned poorly laid out and poorly managed -- and it's noisy too.  It does have a great location but that's about it,2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Impersonal ,One you check in you have zero contact with hotel personnel.  The desk is in a small alcove off the huge Union Station and is neither inviting or particularly accessible.Getting to the room took a long walk through the station to the elevator and then a long walk down a sterile corridor to the room.Interaction with the staff has been replaced by an iPad which supposedly does everything.Next time we would look for something more personable.,3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible Hotel with Character,"This hotel offers nostalgia as well as luxury and comfort.  There is so much energy in Union Station along with great restaurants bars and shops, and then when you step in your hotel room it is luxury, peaceful and comfortable!  This is a great place to stay with amazing access to all of downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Hospitality 2.0,My fiancee and I stayed at The Crawford Hotel in Sept. 2017- it was the perfect staycation location! Tara Saldivar was so thoughtful about our stay and set us up in an amazing loft room complete with mini bottles of champagne. We took advantage of the Tesla car service on our way home that night too. Thank you for the great hospitality and accomodations Tara + The Crawford!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Historic Hotel,"First of all, coming into the train station, the lobby area was beautiful, and busy.  Everything looked wonderful.   After check in, the elevator was over to the side, and I went to my room.  When I opened the door, I was ecstatic, the light fixtures were huge and looked great coming down from the high ceilings. Loved the artwork in the hallways and in the room.  The bathroom was large as was the shower, very nice.  The only thing I wish is that there was a 24 hour room service, but there was food available at the various restaurants throughout the station.  My stay was nice, I had a view of Wynkoop street, and several times walked over to the Tattered Cover to purchase a book.  All in all a good stay, and, the train to the airport is conveniently located there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,One Night In Denver ,"Crawford is a beautiful hotel & interesting space. Staff is very friendly & helpful. This hotel is inside of a working train station. Make sure to ask for a room down one of the hallways if you are light sleeper. The rooms that over look the balcony to the down stairs are cool but can be a bit noisy. There are some fun tours & packages that can be added to your stay. Plus shops, coffee, ice cream & restaurants inside the station where you free things from because you are staying at the Crawford. It is an over all unique experince. I'd call the front desk let them know the experince you are looking for and they will take good care of you.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Night on the town ,"If you are wanting night life and a fun atmosphere, this is your place. We checked in a little early and was greeted by Margot, who upgraded us and was as nice as could be.  Our room was beautiful and unique. Had breakfast in the merchantile; the croque madame was very good.  The free Tesla ride to Ruth's Chris was a nice touch. LoVe The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very Funky Hotel with Excellent Service,Imagine walking down to the hotel lobby from your high end hotel room and finding a train station instead.  This is the Crawford.  It is as if you are transported somewhere else in the elevator ride.  The atmosphere is fantastic and very unique.  The staff are constantly checking up on you to ensure a pleasant stay.  I loved it and highly recommend this for a business or pleasure stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Locals can Experience Denver Anew,"I love an adventure!  We've lived in Colorado for over 18 years and Colorado has so many wonderful places to visit and eat and experience. We received a gift for a night away at The Crawford Hotel.  We had visited union station and several restaurants, but had not had an opportunity to stay.    Wow everyone needs to stay.    You arrive and they handle everything from the moment you arrive.  Valeting your car which you don't even need to use until you check out-perfect; water is offered at the front desk and then all the additional perks: beers at the Terminal Bar, Ice cream, coffee plus so much more including free vehicle service to a local restaurant in their Tesla.    The room was unbelievable.  I mentioned that I was thrilled with the claw tub in the room and was hoping to…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Downtown Denver,The room was a little small - no place to put our luggage - but there were lots of great extras. Most fun was the Tesla transport with our great driver Riley. When we were picked up after dinner a lot of people came out to look at our ride! Also ice cream and coffee at Union Station.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wow best hotel surprise I have had in a while. ,"Loving the vibe.  Room is clean and spacious.  Free samples from the shops in union station. Loving it.  Wish I was staying longer. High tech iPad for an alarm clock.  Not sure I would come here with kids, but business for sure.  ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic Location,"You can not beat the location or the vibe of this hotel. The architecture is amazing and the restoration of the union station building into a modern space was done in a way that created a destination point from a destination point. The rooms were comfortable and the staff was friendly. We had brunch the next day at Urban Farmer, just a block away. It was delicious!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location and Friendly Staff",Stayed here for one night while passing through Denver.  The hotel is in the perfect location to walk around downtown Denver.  The room and lobby where beautiful and well maintained.  The team at the front desk was friendly and helpful.  The Terminal Bar offers several local beers and you get two free each night!  We did not utilize the Tesla transportation but it's cool that they offer it.  The hotel lobby serves as an actual train station as well which was entertaining.  I will stay here again!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing hotel,"Beautiful hotel, helpful and professional staff, great location -- this place has it all.  We took advantage of the wealth of great dining options in the hotel and within walking distance.  My go-to next time I'm in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Choo Choo Train,"Imagine staying at the train station! The lobby is like an old station with benches and a ticket window. You can take the train from the airport straight to the hotel! All sorts of fun shops are at the station too! The rooms are above the station yet you cannot hear Amtrak or the train to the hotel! What a comfy room! Wonderful lavender shower gel, shampoo and conditioner! You HAVE to experience this! You can walk to the 16th street mall and enjoy great food! We had amazing sushi at Blu!  Have fun! I think I can, I think I can, I know YOU can! 🚂 ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Staff is always ready to serve you,I always enjoy my stay at the Crawford. It is a beautiful building and a very lively location. The staff is outstanding here. When in Denver I prefer to stay at the Crawford. Easy transportation to and from the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"We were very surprised and thrilled to find such a wonderful hotel in a railway station! It was so much fun and you have everything at your fingertip….bars, restuarants, shops etc. The room was excellent, with a large modern bathroom and so very quiet One of the best things, the train arrives at the door of the Hotel direct from the airiport And takes you back to the airport, so easy and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and will for sure go back Highly recommended",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Mildew and tattered towels,"The Crawford Hotel is cool. It's in a great location in Denver and it's actually in Union Station. Our two rooms were fine, but our shower was full of mildew and the towels in our room were tiny and tattered. The hotel is certainly not luxurious or worth $500 a night. ",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Get A Way,"Great place to stay in the middle of a great city. The staff was outstanding and we loved their great customer service. We will be going back soon. This hotel is in the middle of the union station and is amazing how they set it up. Great amenities all around. You can get coffee, desert, any meal, a cocktail, a book and so on. It's fantastic!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location!,"The Crawford hotel was fantastic. It is located perfectly in union station and was an easy commute from the airport via the train.  Staff was friendly, rooms were clean and nicely appointed.  There is free coffee, ice cream, and a craft beer every day for guests of the hotel. We also took advantage of the complementary Tesla courtesy car to take us to and from local eateries.  I would definitely stay there again. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,None better. And a free Tesla shuttle,"Travels to denver downtown region (or anywhere the lightrail goes) should include this property. Spoil yourself or those you love with subtle luxury and service.  Located inside the main terminal train station, Crawford is plush and convenient. Quiet and located next to crazy, if you want it. So many amenities for your $20 resort fee that you feel a little ashamed. (free ice cream, espresso, Tesla shuttle service, preferred seating, discounted bar tab, flowers and more)  Go to Denver. Stay at The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique Hotel in Denver,"The Crawford Hotel is a very interesting concept. It is a hotel set in the middle of an active train station (which also has shopping, restaurants, and a massive ""waiting room"" which is great for meeting people or just hanging out.)So, although there is much offered here, the whole experience can feel a bit like a circus. Be prepared to navigate a broad mix of people (guests of the hotel, but mostly tourists and train travelers) as you come in and out of the hotel. If you park a car using the hotel valet, allow ample time for your vehicle to be brought up for you.The hotel portion of the building is very nice. Very high ceilinged hallways -- much calmer than the lobby.  The room we had was quite lovely. Again, with high ceilings and sizable queen beds with nice bedding. Our room faced a water park (Room 303) which provided some lively sounds from outside until the fountains were turned off. But it was that or being too close to the elevator.The one hotel services issue we had was housekeeping. When we returned to the hotel at 4:30pm (Our stay in Denver was brief, so this was on our only full day in town and at the hotel), following a long day of exploring (after leaving our room at 10am), our room had not yet been cleaned. We went to the front desk to complain and they oddly asked if we had ""requested an early room cleaning"". Hotels in this price-point should provide their guests with refreshed and cleaned rooms by 2:00pm every day. Period. We found ourselves having to wait in the very busy and chaotic lobby as housekeeping swept our room. We were tired and had been looking forward to relaxing and getting cleaned up before dinner. Unfortunately, in their haste to clean our room, housekeeping failed to remove & replace used coffee cups; no new drinking glasses; and they didn't replace the extra towels we requested following our check-in.  Hopefully management will prioritize the cleaning of current guests rooms in a timely fashion so they can maximize use of their rooms during their stay. Despite that hiccup, the Crawford Hotel is an interesting choice while staying in Denver if you are looking for a fun and active experience.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome,Amazing service and staff. Very helpful and courteous. It was located in an area that was fun and rustic. Many great places to eat within walking distance. Nice amenities on site for exercise and enjoyment,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,So quiet! And you cannot beat that location.,"I would have never thought a hotel in a train station would be that quiet but it was! And the location was perfect, close to everything. We took the train from the airport and less than half hour later, we were in our room. The room itself was well appointed, with good toiletries and good size - although the window was a bit high up but what can you do. And having so many restaurants closed by was great. We walked everywhere.The best part of the room was The Cooper Lounge. Great atmosphere and amazing drinks! I discovered a new favorite - the Bernadette - and my husband (as usual) had a Manhattan, which were superb. We had a nightcap almost every evening we stayed at the hotel.If I ever go back to Denver, I'll be sure to stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A slice of everything at your fingertips. ,"My wife and I recently stayed here for or honeymoon. This is the most impressive hotel I've ever stayed at. The night atmosphere of Union Station was lively and the room overlooked it, but there was no noise penetration into the rooms. The best part though is all of the restaurants and activities nearby. The hotel gives you a welcome cars that gives you discounts and freebies to almost all of the surrounding shops.We will definitely come back later.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford,"I felt the hotel was exceptional.  They did a fantastic job of converting the train station to a hotel.  The rooms were great with very nice décor.  The staff were all friendly and quick to help you.  The only thing I didn't like was the lack of self parking, but that is a problem with most hotels in Denver.  I would definitely stay at the Crawford again",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Little vacation,"Stayed at the Crawford a Wednesday thru Monday so got to experience it weekdays and weekend. Rooms are modern, clean and quiet. The staff is very professional and helpful. It's location is killer with tons of restaurants all within walking distance. They have a fleet of Teslas and offer free rides almost anywhere in the downtown area so no need to rent a car. On Sundays there is a wonderful farmers market right in front of the hotel. If you love people watching as I do this is a great place to people watch. The area around the hotel as well as the lobby has become a place to see and be seen by both visitors and residents of Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An exceptional place stay,"Happily the Crawford delivered all the hoped for benefits of its location, but without the feared downsides of being located actually within Union Station in Denver.  The valet parking staff were friendly and easy to locate on the kerbside outside the station. The only negative was a slow vehicle return when checking out, despite advance notice having been phoned through.  The hotel reception desk is located within the station concourse itself, which is a slightly bizarre arrangement, but it was staffed by friendly individuals throughout our stay,  Perhaps we were lucky, but our room on the 3rd floor towards the rear of the building suffered no noise at all from the trains or noisy station concourse. The beds were comfy and the provided iPad allowed easy access to hotel…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver Diamond,"Excellent location inside beautiful newly renovated Union Station. Loft room was immaculate with spacious bathroom and guest quarters. Delighted by complimentary ice cream, coffee and ride in Tesla Model X. The Cooper Lounge was a nice respite inside the hotel and the access to fine dining and nightlife was terrific. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Denver or anyone needing a little downtown getaway.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Not up to it's ratings,"Located at the Amtrak station in downtown it's become a place, the station that is, where folks go to to meet and greet, eat and drink. Lots of food and drink choices. The Crawford's checkin is in the station. Pull up outside and the baggage people load your baggage and take it to the desk (one tip) . Thats it. They are not allowed to take it to your room. The very busy desk clerks do that, and therein lies one problem. It can take up to a half hour for your luggage to show up at your room if they are busy. When it does...another tip. Same happens when you check out. The room is very nice. Very comfortable. The towels were frayed and there was only two. For what you pay the towels should not be frayed. The tub needed a better cleaning and the floors could have used some more…",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Enjoy being at the center of Union Station in a wonderful hotel,"The newly renovated historic Union Station is filled with places to eat and shop plus the lovely Crawford Hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed out stay, the friendly service, the Tesla shuttle that took us where we wanted to go, and the convenient location.  We even took the train right into the station from the airport.  Doesn't get easier than that.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The hotel is out of this world!!!,"Everything about the Crawford is first-class.  Each member of the staff remembered our names and details about our visit.  We were so pampered in such a luxurious setting.  I will definitely return to this hotel.  I highly recommend it to anybody staying in the Denver area.  RTD lite rail has transportation from Denver airport right to the door at Union Station.  Beautiful, unique rooms (be sure to take the tour), complimentary transportation around the city, extremely knowledgeable and over-the-top staff.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Fun Stay in an Active Hotel and Area!,My first time in Denver.....I studied the reviews on the top hotels before choosing the Crawford.......once booked.....I had 3 friends asks where I was staying in Denver and all 3 said the Crawford was their #1 choice as well......the lobby was actually the train station....so commuters and long distance travelers moved thru day and nights....great people watching.....lots of dining options in the lobby area as well as nearby......my room faced the street and plaza in front of the station.....it was very quiet......no lobby or street noise......others in our party with rooms facing the tracks mentioned the noise was an issue at night...my room was large and very modern......friendly service at the front desk.....I would stay here again!  Tulemar Dave,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Cool but Odd Hotel,"This hotel was very cool located in the actual train station.  Rooms were small but nice.  However, would try it once but never again.  The lobby is the train station and if it is after popular hours security guards make you show id if you sit there even though there are people sleeping around the benches in the station that a not guests, very annoying.  No staff to be found.  It is a hotel desk, a public train station and rooms.  You do NOT feel like you are in an upscale hotel and no hotel vibe. No coffee, water or anything available. There has to be better hotels at this expensive price that come with service.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful restoration, in the heart of town, lots of action","The renovation of this whole building is marvelous. In addition to being the hub for public transit, it's close to lots of nightlife, the baseball stadium, downtown offices and other activity. In addition to the hotel, the station building contains at least two very good restaurants, an ice cream parlor, and a couple of very good coffee places. The desk clerk even dispensed discount coupons for some of them when we checked in. The staff was extremely helpful, the room immaculate and well-furnished, and the convenience factor cannot be beat. Highly recommend and hope to return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Lovely Hotel, Great customer service, Great location!","The Crawford is a beautiful hotel with lots of amenities and excellent customer service. The location in LoDo is choice, and there are lots of great options for coffee, drinks, and food just steps away. Shout out to Jacob who was very helpful during our stay and made us feel right at home. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Denver. Highly recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Stay at The Crawford,We had a wonderful experience at The Crawford Hotel from the time we checked in till we checked out.  The hotel staff is so friendly and helpful.  I forgot my phone charger and there were so nice to deliver 1 to my room.    Loved to convince of the close restaurants and shopping. Urban Farmer is a must try for anyone visiting.  Also enjoyed the complimentary ice cream and coffee provided when staying.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved It,I stayed here for four weeks this summer during business training.  Staff was friendly and very responsive.  Rooms were spectacular.  Really loved the convenience of the restaurants and bars in the Terminal.  Was a great place to relax.  Also enjoyed that it was walking distance to most everywhere.  Would definitely stay again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Another amazing stay at The Crawford,"Coming back to stay at The Crawford is like visiting close friends.  When we checked in everyone was so helpful and happy to see us!  They have the most incredible staff!!  We had a corner room with beautiful views of the city.  The room was fabulous and peaceful!  The beds are so soft and wonderful it was difficult to get up and get moving in the morning!! It's so nice to have the robes and slippers available after the amazing and relaxing shower.  We enjoyed and looked forward to the beer, and ice cream everyday! Being connected to the station is so wonderful for meals as well as just sitting down and enjoying the surroundings.  We had a very nice evening at the Cooper Lounge while visiting with friends.  We loved the complimentary Tesla that picked us up and dropped off…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"The heart of Union Station in downtown Denver...excellent location, great restaurants in the area",The Crawford's 112 rooms are very unique in that they are part of the historic Union Station renovation. Very good restaurants and bars are in Union Station but also within easy walking distance...as is the 16th Street Mall with free bus rides. The Crawford provides a Tesla with driver for trips within 2 miles of the hotel and Union Station is the central location for the RTD light rail system with its A-Line access to DIA plus many other metro Denver locations. The Crawford is an experience you'll definitely enjoy.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Perfect Anniversary Getaway Inside Union Station,"I'm a local and I love this place. My wife and I stayed here in mid-August 2017 and our experience was incredible.   We were greeted in kind by the very attentive front desk staff — who congratulated us on our anniversary and looked into available upgrades for us. Their smiles are genuine. You definitely get the sense that you're being taken care of here.  The room itself (a superior classic) overlooked the rail lines behind Union Station and featured Victorian era details like a pin-tucked headboard and mirrored glass with a few modern touches, such as local urban artwork. Ours even featured an original safe that had been preserved during the renovation of the historic property.  The amenities are great: $5 cocktails at the Cooper Lounge (which features amazing views of 17th…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel!! Loved the proximity to the CA Zephyr.,"I stayed in this hotel on the last night of a three week trip through the central states.  It was so nice to relax in the very comfortable room knowing that I just had to wake up and roll out the back door to catch my train.  The staff was amazing and the $20 worth of perks were great!  I had my free beer, my free ice cream, my free coffee, and my $5 drink at the restaurant.  It all was so nice.  The bed was so comfortable and the room had central air which was great after a trip full of places with no air conditioning.  I'd love to stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,It's the People!,"The people at the Crawford made the experience that much more amazing!  We were traveling to celebrate a birthday and even though it was well past midnight when we finally settled into our room on the first night after checking in, the gentleman who helped us check in arrived with chocolates and a birthday well-wishes card!  We especially enjoyed the courtesy Tesla service and enjoyed chatting with Riley & Myles as we went from place to place.  The service is second to none, the amenities and extras are wonderful, the location is convenient, and the experience is one of a kind!  I highly recommend this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Brilliant hotel,"This is not your typical  hotel, the lobby is actually the lobby of what it was the train station and now is full of lovely restaurants and shops and kind of a common area where you can have a drink and admire this beautiful place.  The rooms are a bit  small but really comfy, the bathroom is super clean and nice.  The hotel is placed right in downtown so you just walk wherever you would like to go everything is really close by or you could just take the free mall bus wich is free for anyone and is always in transit through the main street wich is by the side of the hotel.  Totally worth it and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. ",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,First visit to Crawford Hotel!,"We chose the Crawford Hotel online, because of it's proximity to Coors Field for a Colorado Rockies game.  Absolutely LOVED the hotel!  We received an upgrade upon check-in, due to it being my husbands birthday and our 23rd Wedding Anniversary, and stayed in a Loft room.  Absolutely LOVED the room!  Clean, quaint, quiet rooms and the service upon check-in and during our stay was top notch!  We've already booked another stay at the Crawford Hotel for a stay in Denver in September!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel. Great Location.,"We had an amazing stay at the Crawford. Having the train station that close was very convenient. The bars, shops, and food were all top notch. They have iPads in each room that you can order housekeeping, room service, or just get information about the area. Would highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Close to Everything ,"Fantastic hotel in Denver which is close to breweries, transit, and coors field. You pay a little more to stay here but you get fantastic location, and great amenities/perks. I was a little worried about parking but right across the street is a public parking garage which made the stay even easier. We enjoyed the Terminal bar for happy hour, ice cream from the milk box and the short stroll to Coors Field. The rooms were great with a private elevator tucked away in Union Station. Very relaxing Trip can't wait to stay at again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great spot and service,"My wife and I loved it. We had a loft room and loved the character added by the wooden beams.Also got a free coffee and giant scoop of ice cream for each of us, along with other available freebies and discounts.And being right over Union Station was great because we could just head straight to the airport the next day.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Hip and cool, but not relaxing or kid friendly.","Hello fellow travelers.  I just returned home from a trip to the much-anticipated Crawford Hotel.  I traveled with my husband and 4 children (ages 6 yrs - 4 mo).  This isn't our first rodeo with the kids so you know this review isn't from an overly-dramatic/helicopter mom. This hotel got great reviews and the pictures were outstanding.  For empty-nesters, 20 somethings, or travel without kids or even travel with older kids, it's beautiful.  For our trip, it was good, but couldn't give it a 4/5 star for a couple of reasons.  First, it's a busy, busy, building that also happens to be a hotel.  It is not relaxing or serene.  If you are looking for that, this is NOT the hotel for you. There are people shopping in the market inside of the hotel, people with tons of luggage waiting for the train, people just taking a look around, a guy with a parrot on his shoulder passing through, a lively bar, and overall  just a lot of people in and out.  It was always crowded and loud, and I longed for quiet and less foot-traffic.  Given this, I watched my kiddos closely, and was not at ease while in the ""lobby"", which is really just a desk plopped in the midst of this major thoroughfare.  I thought the hotel was an afterthought, with the real action being the bar, the markets, the shops and the actual functioning train station. I got the impression this was a destination unto itself.  It's great; just not the calm, hip, chill type of great. The rooms were fine with grand high ceilings.  The art was, interesting.  Our room had a very strange red-haired girl print.  It was chilling; she appeared ready to extract a beating heart.  I tried not to look at it.  The housekeeping was meh.  Our floor was not the cleanest.  The bathtub could have been cleaned better.  The towels were in pretty rough shape, with some fraying ends. As for being kid friendly, it's not.  The pac-n-play that they brought to our room looked to be about 20 years old and had the dirt to prove it.  I just went with it because it was likely the only one they had and I covered it with sheets.  There weren't any kid activities here and I just couldn't let my kids be more than 2 feet from me lest they get lost in the crowd. Also, beware of hidden costs at this hotel.  The parking is very expensive, and our bill for two adjoining rooms was not clear.  Management got weird about honoring a AAA discount and they didn't do so despite many vacancies, so my advice would be to get this in writing in advance. Overall, beautiful building, beautiful architecture, and unique concept; but just too crowded, noisy and busy to be a 4/5 star for this price point.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An Overall Great Experience,"Stayed here for two nights while in town for business.  Took the train from airport right into Union Station and walked over.  Great location, close to everything, no car needed.  Nate at check-in was excellent, providing a little history of the hotel.  Love the key and tassel! Large room, clean and comfortable.  Obviously if you are looking for a luxurious resort, this isn't it.  But it is a great hotel in a great location.  I would return again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,parking garage staff,"Parked for a lunch meeting, upon exit my credit card got stuck in the machine and we could not exit.  After a long(hour) wait to get the gate manually opened, Zach - who has nothing to do with parking payment - waited for my credit card to get removed from the machine and delivered it to my office.  Zach truly went above and beyond his duty or responsibility for which I am forever grateful!  Excellent customer service - thank you ZACH!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Soundproofing is a State of Mind,"We were in town to attend a book release party. As an introduction to Denver, this hotel does a great job of capturing the more hip aspects of the local vibe: lots of retro details, handlebar mustaches and locavore dining available in the area. The lobby is bustling at all hours and on Saturday there is a cool farmers' market on the plaza outside. The rail connection to the airport is great, and there is a B-cycle bike stand right out front (bike to City Park, the Botanic Garden or up and down Cherry Creek). Food and drink from the establishments in and around Union Station was spectacular.Hotel staff were very friendly and responsive.We enjoyed the destination amenities, which is a $20 fee tacked on to your bill (I think per person per day, but I don't really want to know) that grants you a coffee, ice cream, beer once a day, some shopping discounts, and a few other perks. This was like the adult version of the Paw Passes our kids made us buy at the Great Wolf Lodge last month. This package helped us get to know the hotel better and gave us something fun to do, but when the room rate is already over $400, learning about this fee at check-in was a bit of a hit. OK, the destination amenities package also covers the car service (awesome Tesla rides within a 2 mile radius) and wifi, but charging for these is a technicality.My complaints would be about guest room comfort. The hallways upstairs were harshly lit (probably older LED bulbs) and to me smelled a bit of tobacco. Our room seemed pretty small for the luxury price point. The bed was up against the wall so one person had to clamber in from the foot of the bed—I guess this is what rail car roomettes are like. One ad I saw for the hotel mentioned the rooms are all ""soundproofed"", which to me should be a given, and I wondered what made them want to underline this point. Sure enough, the people in the room next door could be very clearly heard through the communicating door (with both doors closed). We could hear them watching Animal Planet at 12:30 a.m. (which is 1:30 a.m. Central Time. Did you know that the beaver builds dams with sticks that it gathers from its environment?), snoring and just breathing. Night manager Sean was kind enough to ask them to turn down the TV but they didn't really do it. This is America, watching TV all night is legal but the neighbors shouldn't have to hear it or turn on a white noise machine just to get some rest. We asked to be moved but the hotel was said to be full.Our Voss mineral water was present on check-in but not replenished (there is more in the fitness center), the iPad was a bit fluky (white noise app actually crashed constantly but we had our own) and we had to call about a clogged toilet. The model of Nespresso machine they've installed makes great coffee with a professional head of crema on it, but is super loud; vide supra.Bottom line, the Crawford Hotel has a great location, plugs you into the hipster vibe and is a gateway to fun amenities. Room comfort was about the same as a cheaply built chain hotel at triple the price. We would stay there again if we could have some assurances about our neighbors (e.g., if traveling with another couple) or if thicker doors were to be installed.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford is truly a unique experience with hidden charges,"The Crawford is very conveniently located downtown.  The staff bend over backwards to be pleasant.  We had a loft room which was unique and pleasant.  You are only 4 blocks from Coors Field.  The Farmers Market is located on the front apron on Saturdays.  They say you can check in after 4:00 pm.  They are serious that you cannot check in until after 4:00 pm.  They want you out by 11:00 am.  They are serious about you being out by 11:00 am.There is no parking except Valet.  $45 per day to Valet park.  No choice.  You can try to find a public parking garage somewhere close. Not a good choice.They charge you $20 per day for amenities.  That gets you one free craft beer each from the hotel bar, but only between 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm.  They said that they used to give you $5 off a well drink but it got too expensive for them.  You get one free scoop of ice cream each.  But the ice cream store does not open until 11:00 am.  So if you want ice cream you may need to eat it with your beer.  You get one cup of coffee each.An excellent hotel!  But, watch those hidden charges.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Interesting Concept,"The concept of the hotel within a functioning train station is a cool one!  And the location really is great, central to everything. And though I didn't travel with kids, I think it would be great for families.  My personal opinion on the design, though, is that they took the period piece a little too far and should have punched up the colors to make it less drab - I don't think it feels luxe to be in a room that feels like a converted government office, complete with depressing yellow lighting.  The shower was great, though bathroom overall was cramped. Overall, for proximity to restaurants, etc - great, service - great, luxury/design - ok.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,So beautiful and unique ,"A bustling gorgeous hotel above Union Station.  Tons of things to do, tons of things to eat and drink. Easy walk to Coors Field. Stayed on the 4th floor in a very pretty room, bed was comfortable.  Shower amazing! Service staff cleaned when we were out. I highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Classic Location; Excellent, Focused Customer Service","We stayed at the Crawford, went to a Rockies game, which was a couple of blocks away, and enjoyed the activity in the center of Denver.  I was concerned that it might be noisy since the hotel is based in the historic and continuing train station.  Absolutely no noise problem and truly excellent customer service from the front desk.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique and historic!,"What a cool hotel inside a restored train station!  The lobby is the old train station, which is adjacent to the actual working train station. Cute shops all around (the ice cream shop is amazing and the coffee shop is wonderful). Our room had high ceilings and some old fashioned features, but feels new and fresh and modern.  The Nespresso machine in the room was a hit, and the beds were comfy. Took the light rail to and from the airport (and elsewhere) without incident. I would certainly stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique setting in a great location,"We stayed at the Crawford in December and thoroughly enjoyed the Christmas atmosphere.  Loved the downtown location and didn't even have to leave the station when the weather got bitter cold outside. Several restaurants, bars, and quaint shops to peruse.  Great location for shopping too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Niche Hotel,"This is a very interesting hotel in the Denver Union Station, actually a working rail station. In additional to the hotel, it has retail and some food options.  The lobby is bustling. The room are very well appointed and comfortable.  However, this was not what I expected in terms of service.Prior to my stay, I attempted to contact the concierge for dinner reservations. There is not number on the website, so I sent and email to the only listing, reservations, with my request.  It was never answered. During my stay, I called the Guest Services number on the in room phone. My call was not picked up. Room service has a very limited menu and the food is quite average. All orders are placed on an in room iPad. So, any particulars or modification were not made (an egg on the side, a substitution).  Delivery is more like Post Mates than in room dining. Paper containers and plastic cutlery. No water is included. There is not a newspaper delivered to the room.I would recommend the hotel and may stay there again. However, it is not like some hotels I stay in. The Crawford does not have the level of personal service of most fine hotels and it is difficult to make contact with a human for requests like restaurant recommendations or reservation and calling the valet to have the car ready.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing hotel! ,"My husband and I won a night's stay at The Crawford Hotel through a silent auction, and decided to celebrate our first anniversary there. We live in Denver and have been to Union Station many times, but wow, this hotel is really something special. Historic and ""old timey"", yet modern and posh. Our room was gorgeous and beyond comfortable (as was the claw foot tub!), and the amenities were plentiful (free coffee, ice cream, beer, guaranteed seating at Cooper Lounge, Snooze room service, etc... the list goes on!). Cannot say enough good things about this hotel, we will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Super Hotel,"I've stayed here a couple of times and love it.  Their small room, I think it's called the Pullman is cozy but very nice.  The station lobby downstairs is animated with good food and drink options.     This was the first time I took the train from DEN Airport.  It was cool rolling off the train and right into a room; no taxi, no rental car.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exceptional!,"What a wonderful experience!  So glad to have chosen the Crawford! Everything about it was great - location, customer service, and especially the uniqueness of being in Union Terminal!  Loved it - wish we could have stayed longer!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An amazing stay - you could spend the whole weekend right here!,"The Crawford was amazing - such a great place to stay.  The rooms were lovely and the amenities were unbeatable! You could literally eat and drink your way through the whole weekend at Union Station - such cool restaurants and bars and they give you vouchers for free coffee and ice cream!  We ate at Mercantile, Toast and the Cooper Lounge and all were delicious.  It's also a great location - a perfect starting point to explore the whole city.  We can't wait to go back and highly recommend it to others.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to stay,"A great place to stay, especially if you are traveling west on Amtrak. Friendly staff, and quiet rooms with character. You can watch trains, people or enjoy all that the adjacent mall has to offer. The free MallRide will take you up and down the 16th Street Mall.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Quick work trip, highly accommodating hotel in the middle of the downtown scene.",Rooms are great. Staff is friendly. Very unique hotel with daily coffee and ice cream for free at the parlor shops in union station. Good workout facility. Walking distance to everything downtown or in the highlands.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,So much to do!,"This is a perfect place to stay for a Rockies game!  It's within walking distance of the stadium.  There was everything I needed within the station, really no need to go elsewhere for anything.  Lots of extras were included in the price of the room:  free drinks, free ice cream, 20% of many of the restaurants.  The room was beautiful and very comfortable.  I would definitely book this hotel again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,loved this hotel!,"So many great things about this hotel - ease of getting there from the hotel (A line), the bustling train station lobby with lots of food options, power stations, locale and beauty.  But the rooms are wonderful - high ceilings, nicely decorated, large bathrooms, robes, etc.  And great service.  I'd love to go back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Good if travelling on AMTRAK, otherwise go elsewhere","Helpful desk staff especially Tara and Paulette.Hotel is built into train station and thus convenient if travelling on AMTRAK's California Zephyr.  But over-priced and under-serviced otherwise.  Not 5* as claimed.  More liked 3+*.Specifically:  They try to charge you $20 per day extra as an Amenity Fee for what most hotels now have as basic amenities, e.g: wifi, 800 service, local phone calls, in-town shuttle, etc, etc.  But for this extra $20 per day you get 1 ""free"" beer and 1 ""free"" ice cream --- even if you are a non-drinker and are observing a weigh loss diet!  Other disappointments:  No bellhops to help with baggage;  No curbside taxi access (not good in rain or snow); Out 8 stalls in Ladies toilets in basement 2 had no locks on doors and 2 were otherwise Out-Of-Service; Inexperienced clerk on duty at 11 p.m. on a Saturday; you have to pay 40 cents per day as a Union Station Historic Preservation Fee.  Not Nice!On a positive note: Comfortable bed; Good housekeeping; interesting architecture; good fish feedery adjacent; Food Court type eatery in lobby; You can get out of the $20 Amenity Fee if you protest enough.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Couples Getaway,"My husband and stayed at the Crawford for a long-weekend and had a great time.  It's in a great location, within steps from a train which goes directly to the airport, as well as restaurants and bars.The hotel itself is in the train station -- but I didn't notice any outside noise despite that.Two points off for the lack of blackout shades and the lack of room service.I could have done without the ""resort"" fee too -- I'd happily have given up the scoop of not-very-good ice cream for it.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,So Worth the Splurge,"Wow.  Sensory overload and so much attention to detail at the same time are tough to finesse but this place has accomplished it perfectly.  Union Station has so much to offer, yet its easy to pass the hours away just people watching.  Prices are reasonable throughout the shops at Union Station, and the selections are top quality.  The Crawford Hotel may be a little pricey, but so worth the splurge for a night or 2.  The staff was amazing - customer service excellence!  With such a heavy crowd inside the main level at Union Station, I really liked that you had to use your room key to access other floors (to the hotel).   The room was very, very clean and comfortable with no amenity spared.  If you do decide to book your stay here, make a point of stopping by Cooper Lounge - a 3rd floor bar exclusive to hotel guests that gets an A= for service and selection. Still, there are so many great bars and restaurants within an easy walk of the hotel, and they also have a courtesy driver (in a Tesla!) ready to drop you anywhere within a 3 or 4 mile radius.  It was a little noisy at night in our room, but not enough to keep me awake.  The tram to the airport was $10 (very reasonable) and was so easy to jump on from the hotel.  The staff at reception not only held our bags for us after check out, but brought them to us right by the tram stop so we didn't have to haul it all ourselves.  Loved everything about this place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Mr.,The Crawford stands out among the independent boutique style hotels. It's staff and level of service is in the five star category. The rooms are all new construction and nicely appointed with hardwood floors and marble bathrooms while the common areas retained the original architecture but completely restored. My room came with an iPad to communicate with staff and make reservations. An interesting contrast to the pre-technology era in which the Union Station was built. Not an inexpensive hotel but well worth it if you want modern day luxuries coupled with old world charm.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Business Meeting,I have lived in CO since 1983 and am so impressed with the rebirth of Union Station.  The Crawford is a must see and use hotel facility inside Union Station surrounded by great restaurants and activities.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Extremely nice hotel,"We were very impressed with our room!  We always book nice hotels & this is one of the best.  First, they upgraded us without asking.  We had robes & an expresso machine waiting in the morning.  No need to go buy shampoo.  There are big bottles in the huge shower.  The train station is beyond beautiful.  There are people everywhere & it is wonderful to see this hub brought back to life.  It is extremely clean & private.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic place to stay!,"When I was searching for that special place to take my wife for our 50th anniversary in Denver, The Crawford kept coming to the top of my list.  The fact that it lives in the historic Denver Union Station, just a few blocks from Coors Field, were all major points for me, since we were taking the California Zephyr from Sacramento to Denver. The staff at the Crawford are AMAZING! Super attentive, friendly and very professional. I did splurge on one of the better rooms...which was spacious, full of great amenities with a great corner view of all the action outside. They found us some great restaurants and moved us around town to our destinations in the complementary Crawford Tesla! To top everything else off, when it came time to head to the airport for the flight home...the RTD airport light rail leaves for the airport, right outside the rear door of the hotel! Thanks to everyone at the Crawford! You folks are awesome!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Iconic hotel and location,"The Crawford hotel was recently restored and is beautiful. The location in lower Denver (LODO) at Union Station makes for convenient walking to everything. The station itself has many amenities and restaurants, while nearby to local shopping and museums and parks. The hotel even offers complimentary car service within a 2 mile radius. Above all was the treatment by each and every one of the staff. You are addressed by name and always asked how your stay is going, with recommendations for us tourists. We would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic place to stay for Amtrak travelers - or anyone else wanting a great experience in LoDo,"Wow. How do we even start.  My wife and I were on a cross-country Amtrak journey, with overnight stays in NYC, CHI, DEN, and SFO (at the end of the trip). The Crawford was the most expensive of all the hotels (including NYC and CHI - where we had great rooms) and still definitely worth it. It is so convenient to the train station and everything else downtown Denver has to offer, including the 16th Street shuttle bus.  Rooms are modern, and cool, and the staff is unbelievably friendly and helpful. Denver has done a great job turning Union Station into a jewel, and the Crawford is the center diamond. They even have a Tesla for free shuttle service within 2 miles, though we didn't even need that because of the great (free) public transportation options in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Do it!  You deserve it:),"Why The Crawford?  Well...besides treating yourself and friend to a friendly, beautiful establishment that is perfectly located for travel and fun in Denver, the fact remains that occaisional self indulgence is good medicine!The room was grand and the tub rocks!  An amazing shower is also there.  An espresso machine that starts your morning perfectly is a good thing.Go ahead ..treat yourself!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Miserable 65th B-Day,"stayed here 2 nights in room 433 the LODO Suite for my husbands 65th B-Day which was mentioned when I made the reservation. Checked-in pleasant and efficient. Bellman took us to us to our room and dropped off bags and left. No showing us around. No special treat. Notified desk on way out to dinner. Came back, no treat, no turndown, no robes, towels or slippers. Next day went to gym (located in basement) and shopping Again spoke to desk. Returned several hours later, no treat, no cleaning of room,no towels only bed made. Went to front desk and requested a manager. Explained to Paulette what was going on. She apologized, said things would be taken care of and offered money off for the previous day. We went on a food tour for 3 hrs. Came back. The trash had been taken out . This time brought Paulette to the room and showed her how filthy and no restocking. She again apologized, said things would get straight and wanted to know what we would like to do this evening, that she wanted to make things right. We said that we would just like to have a nice farm to table dinner. Paulette said that would be perfect, she would take care of everything to come to the hotel lobby at 6:20. We were taken to a wonderful restaurant and then presented with a bill. We called the hotel and whomever answered the phone said to pay the bill and the hotel will reimburse us. That of course is not happening. Be careful, these rooms are not being cleaned properly! No pampering here!",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Enjoyable Stay,"We just spent the weekend at this hotel to attend a wedding and celebrate our anniversary.  The hotel had inquired ahead of the stay about any special celebrations, and at check-in we were awarded a room upgrade and given two small bottles of bubbly.  Very nice welcome.  Arriving at this place from the airport on the light rail is the easiest hotel transfer ever and fabulously convenient.  You walk into a bustling station with restaurants and shops, which turns out to the hotel ""lobby"" itself.  The check in desk is tucked away in an alcove at one end.  It felt like this hotel was at the center of everything, and yet the room itself was quiet and comfortable.  Ours had a small sitting area and very high ceilings.  A bad faucet design kept the sink from draining properly, but that was the only room complaint.  Housekeeping came promptly, though for other guests we knew staying there it was non existent.  On Saturday we strolled through the farmer's market and watched the kiddies running through the splash pad.  You can walk  or ride share all over from here. I would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best date night ever!,"We live in the suburbs of Denver, and wanted a special date night out on the town.  Our stay at the Crawford was wonderful... massages at the Oxford spa, semi-private cocktails at the Cooper lounge, large, architecturally interesting room with a great bubble bath in our huge bathroom, and a lively vibe inside and outside the hotel.  Watched kids play in the fountains while we had an amazing bfast at Snooze.  This was just what the doctor ordered for 2 tired parents from the burbs!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Location,Cirque tickets and anniversary celebration ! Our son gave us a gift voucher for the Crawford.  It's a very cool location -  you can walk to any type of restaurant.  The staff is the best!  Check out ice cream at the MilkBox and coffee @ PigTrain - both were excellent. On Saturdays in the summer there's a Farmer's Market in the plaza out front to explore.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,True Revitalization!,"My husband and I stayed for a night to celebrate our anniversary. It was amazing! We remember Union Station ""before"" and our weekend experience was a true revitalization. We had great weather and really enjoyed all the things to do and experience while staying at the Crawford. Our loft room was gorgeous, spacious, and tastefully decorated. The service was wonderful. We loved the ""Denver's living room"" feel of the lobby of the hotel with all the different restaurants and shopping along with lounge space. It was absolutely stunning. We can't wait to go back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"History, Location and Quality at the Crawford","My 'other half' and I stayed at the Crawford this past weekend for three nights in one of the loft rooms on the 4th floor, which was different as it had wood beams and peculiar shaped ceilings.  Very comfortable room.  Can't fault anything about the hotel.  Hotel service and location to downtown Denver were both excellent.  Make sure to spend some time people watching while sitting in luxurious armchairs in the Union Station concourse and sipping on a cocktail or a cup of coffee.  The concourse is very interesting. Bars and restaurants in the Crawford all appear excellent although we only visited ""Snooze"" for breakfast, which gets very busy very early so make a reservation the night before.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"2nd time here, will be back! ","This is the 2nd time our family has stayed at the Crawford and we will definitely be back. At check-in, the friendly staff gave each of my daughters a Beanie Baby as a little welcome gift. So nice! The rooms are spectacular. I mean so well-designed, beautiful furniture, huge windows overlooking the front of Union Station, super high ceilings, gorgeous bathrooms. Since we have 2 young girls, we do spend quite a bit of time in our 2 adjoining rooms (to rest/nap) - so I appreciate a beautiful space in which to relax.   We loved going down to the lobby area for ice cream, coffee, snacks, happy hour and just to people watch. The place is bustling. Then our girls had a blast playing outside in the huge water fountain. We spent an hour and a half playing in it one of the days!  Huge…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Can't wait to go back!!,"My husband and I stayed for the first time about a week ago.  (Suite 314)  Absolutely perfect execution from every direction!  The front desk staff were welcoming, acted glad to have us, let us check in very early, surprised us with an upgrade, the room was impeccably clean, Merchantile restaurant is fantastic, location is perfect, and I could go on and on. Well done. We look forward to returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Was expecting better,"After spending the 5 nights prior in lodges in and around national parks, I was very much looking forward to our one-night stay at The Crawford. Of course the location cannot be beat - especially if you are arriving by train. The lovely front desk girl was professional and welcoming, upgrading us to a king room on the 4th floor.   While on the surface the room seemed to be nice, there were several small things that made the experience less than lovely. The curtains do not adequately come together to block bright morning light from filtering through. The ipad would not work. There was a pretty thick layer of dust on the desk and tv stand. Several pieces of furniture had scrapes and nicks. There was not an outlet or USB ports on my side of the bed (which in 2017 seems like a must…",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A great spot for anyone who loves trains.,"We reached Denver at the end of a vacation that included an overnight stay on an Amtrak Train.  We'd seen the hotel above the Amtrak Station a year ago when we traveled out of Denver by train.  This year we decided to stay.If you do not like the sound of trains, this may not be the place for you; but the sound of the trains during the night gave us the atmosphere of sleeping another night on the train only this time in absolute comfort.The lobby is right in Union Station, adding to the unique atmosphere.  Overlooking the train platform, the ""Pullman"" room was not large, but beautifully decorated and efficient.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Luxury Stay at Union Station,"I was travelling across the US by train, so what better place to stay in Denver than at the Crawford Hotel which is part of the Union Station complex. The room was very comfortable, I had a peaceful night's sleep and the shower was great. So much is happening around the station and at nearby Latimer Square that you really feel part of the Denver landscape. My room actually overlooked the main concourse, which was interesting, but I needed to remember to close the curtains when dressing.  The whole station was abuzz with activity so I really enjoyed my stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent hotel...would highly recommend to people and we will definitely be returning.,"My husband and I had a great time at the Crawford.  Its uniqueness is what initially attracted us to the place.  We loved that the lobby was also an actual Amtrak train station.  The quiet hustle and bustle was so fun.  The amenities and stores that inhabit the lobby were also quite stellar.  From the cordial, efficient bartenders at the Terminal, to the Pig and Whistle daily coffee...we loved it all.  The $20 additional ""destination fee"" was unexpected, but it turns out we loved the fact that we got a free coffee each, free scoop of ice cream each and two beers each, for each night that we stayed.  We ate at the Next Door, one of the eateries attached to the hotel...and was superb. Super friendly staff and the food was amazing.  The rooms were clean, and nicely decorated.  The hotel itself has a great location.  Easy access to everything.   Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique hotel experience in a great section of Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Nice, well located hotel.","This hotel offers valet parking and there are no realistic options. Valet parking is a substantial addition to the daily cost. When I commented to management about this surprising cost it was removed from my bill-fantastic! With this problem aside the hotel staff and management are extremely accommodating. The reception & lobby adjoin the train station waiting area with restaurants in this huge room-very unusual, but interesting. The guest rooms are large, quiet and have all the expected amenities. We will stay here again when we want to frequent lower ""LODO"".",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Grand Hotel in the Union Station,"My wife and I stayed overnight in the Crawford Hotel inside the newly, and excellently, renovated Union Station in downtown Denver. It was a fabulous experience all the way around. Our package included discounted valet parking and an excellent tour of the station's history and renovations, guided by Courtney who did a great job. Our room on the 3rd floor was spacious and had incredibly high ceilings, good closet space, and a very comfortable bathroom. All of the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly. Complementary downtown transportation was provided in the hotel's Tesla. Lastly, we particularly enjoyed drinks and wine at Cooper's Lounge, located on a balcony overlooking the station waiting room. In all, it was a wonderful experience for our anniversary and a visit we will repeat in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel in the heart of Denver,"LOVE this hotel and all of its unique amenities and services. Rooms are lovely, staff was friendly. Location is great - lots of restaurants and breweries near by. Close walk to art museums and the baseball field. But the restaurants, bars and shops off the common area of the hotel make it a really great stay. Love the free perks (cup of coffee, ice cream scoop, happy hour at The Terminal) that are built into your stay 1x per day. Almost gives you no reason to leave the building ;)  There's action going on no matter what time you get in. Big communal area with good wi-fi if you need to hang out between check-out and departure too, especially nice for business travelers.   Great mix of old meets new. Quirky and cool, a must-stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotel, great spot ","We just stayed at the Crawford Hotel for a work/couples getaway and it was a gem.  It is an old train station that has been converted into a hotel. You feel like you are in the center of everything. There are great perks that come with staying there. The bed was not our favorite, however, the room was really unique and special.  We would not hesitate to stay here again in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellant Renovation,"Union Station was very nicely restored. We appreciate old buildings like this being redone. The Crawford Hotel rooms surround the main atrium - don't miss the stairwell with all the original blueprints!  There is a lovely lounge that we suggest for drinks and snacks - the ambiance is very classical but modern. The rooms are very well decorated and spacious. Union Station also has a few small shops and places to eat. Snooze had a great breakfast.  The only thing was evening dining was really limited. I would have liked a more traditional restaurant right there.  You can take the train from the airport straight to the hotel since it's in Union Station.  This area of downtown is right by the 16th street mall and lots of shopping and dining,",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Didn't Get Value for the Dollar,"Room 338, overlooking the train tracks.  My wife and I were expecting a truly quality experience, but we were disappointed.  The hotel location is excellent  However, small things do count when it comes to the actual hotel experience, especially in a supposedly top quality hotel.  The room finish was disappointing.  It looked nice on the surface, but the desk, cabinets, closet doors, etc. were made of cheap material covered in a formica-like overlay.  There was no toilet paper in the room.  The coffee maker was on top of the drawers in the closet, but there is no outlet in the closet.  The lower shelf under the restroom counter was covered in what must have been weeks of dust (and that's where your bathroom towels, etc. are kept.)  Overall, the room looked nice at first glance,…",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Another Terrific Stay!,"Over the past 6 months I have stayed at The Crawford Hotel 6 times. Wonderful rooms that are very clean with great amenities. The staff and management at the hotel are absolutely wonderful and highly customer-centric. The restaurants as well, including both Snooze for breakfast and the Mercantile for dinner are phenomenal. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance of other restaurants, galleries, and shopping. The value for the money is great. I would highly recommend staying at The Crawford!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Impressive,"I cannot write enough words to thank all of the staff at the Crawford Hotel. Held our East and West coast branch manager meeting at this hotel and not only did Kara Akers, the sales manager make sure i was within my budget but had definitely made an impression on how professional this hotel is.  From Chris Luersen keeping track of all our rooms and check-ins to Colleen Barrett doing a spectacular job at assisting me with anything i needed and without hesitation. I would like to also mention that our server Cesar was such a big help in assisting with IT issues to waiting on our every need.  To top it off their rooms are AMAZING! Im so very impressed with this hotel and the location I would love to plan future visits to Denver as long as i am staying at the Crawford!",5

A Wonderful Place For A Special Birthday Celebration,"We made reservations for this hotel 6 months in advance in preparation for a very special birthday celebration road trip. After arrival at the Denver airport and renting a car, we arrived within 30 minutes to this unique hotel. After valet parking we entered the atrium of the hotel and were amazed at the beauty. The restoration of this train station is amazing. Check in was very pleasant, with friendly staff that quickly checked us in and offered cold water and an amenities card that offered 2 free Craft Beers at the Terminal Bar, 2 Ice-cream scoops from the Creamery and 2 coffees from the Pigtrain Coffee Shop.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Christmas Week at The Crawford,"We spent the week before Christmas at The Crawford Hotel and it was just like being at home!  We have stayed here many times before and each time we are reminded of why we continue to come back!  The staff makes everything so wonderful.  They are always so welcoming and accommodating.  The Christmas decorations were amazing and so tastefully done. The amenities are always superior!  Our favorite part about staying here is that we can walk out of our room and take advantage of all the restaurants and shops without leaving the building. The rooms are always fresh, quiet and so comfortable! Everyone and everything at The Crawford is just simply the best!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Peaceful Oasis from Downtown Area ,"If you're a history buff you'll love this place- The Crawford has reimagined all the hustle and bustle of train traveling from 100 years ago with the modern amenities of today. Nestled right in the heart of downtown at Union Station, this hotel inside the lobby is full of frenetic energy including the Amtrak station (which has cars going out daily). The rooms and hallways are completely soundproof however and bathrooms are beautiful with large shower and soaking tub.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Place to Stay!,"My husband and I wanted to take in a couple of San Francisco Giants games and found that the Crawford Hotel is within close walking distance to Coors Field.  We loved the whole atmosphere in which the Crawford is located--The Union Station terminal with its great shops, restaurants, and boutiques.  Our room was clean and overlooked the light rail station, but did not hear any noises from the trains coming and going. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  We also had enough time to walk in the March for Science in downtown Denver, which was both fun and, we felt, sent an important message to the current administration. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Weekend Stay!,"Union Station is fabulous! Staying here was so much fun. Lots of action and people-watching all day. We took advantage of the lobby/station set-up: had coffee in the mornings, ice cream there as a snack, happy hour beers, late night drink at the upstairs bar (Cooper's), morning reservations at the diner! The hotel adds on a surcharge for a bunch of ""freebees"" that we took advantage of, but I think they should add this into the room rate and then call it ""free.""",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfection! ,"Stayed for one night in this amazing hotel! It was vibrant, historic, and fun! We were given a bottle of water at check in. We arrived well before the 4:00pm check in time. They called us when our room was ready. The room was gorgeous and very quiet. We enjoyed the free drink at happy hour, ice cream, and coffee. People watching at Union Station is always fun! It's a great location next to restaurants and shopping. The staff treated us like valued guests. We will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,luxury boutique,"Room - wonderful, but really badly needs a table and a chair for people who travel for business like me. It was uncomfortable propping myself on 2 cushions atop an ottoman just to reach typing height for a small 'table' that was really meant solely for decorative purposes next to the door. The door of the business centre's rooms lock behind you when you leave - so you can't really use the restroom because if you do, you have to go back to reception (which is on another floor) and ask them to let you back in with a key. Cleanliness - hairs and soap stains in the 'clawfoot' bathtub, the main reason why I paid the exorbitant fees to stay in this hotel. The drain plug of the bathtub is difficult to manoeuvre and has a sharp metallic rim. I cut my thumb trying to unplug the bathtub after having a bath - beware! All of the sheets and towels smell like honey. I can't describe how special and wonderful this made me feel. I am going to try and buy some honey-flavoured laundry detergent when I get home to emulate this. The rainfall showerhead directly overhead was amazing. I really appreciated the generous water pressure. It was so relaxing I took the guilty pleasure of returning to my room at lunchtime just to have a shower - sorry Denver, I hope I didn't deplete your water supplies! My room was located behind a sealed door along a quiet corridor away from the main pedestrian area of Union Station. My room was very quiet and even for a fussy, light sleeper like me, the sleep quality was exceptional. The manager (I think her name is Kristin) was firm but very gracious when I turned up 1 day late. I mixed up the date of my arrival in Denver. My room was sold to another person, and I was charged a fair 1 night's fee for not turning up. She then personally walked me to the Crawford's sister hotel the Maven about 2 blocks away to see that I got checked into somewhere for the night. Much appreciated! Location - very, very convenient. This hotel is located amidst the trendiest parts of town. Lower Downtown (LoDo) is to the south along 16th / 17th street, and Lower Highland (LoHi) is a short 15-minute walk to the north across the highway and river passes (very, very trendy). Bars and restaurants were abundant, pricey but often tres chic. The nicest part of town (Cherry brook or Cherry something) was only a 15-minute Uber ride away - wonderful shopping there. Jazz club (Nocturne) - amazing, and the Crawford's free 2-mile radius car service took me there within 10 minutes' drive. Same goes for the Denver Center for Performing Arts (wonderful, highly professional and impressive local and international talent), and the LoDo comedy venue (I forget the name). The Crawford made my memory of Denver a very memorable and treasured holiday. Thank you! Free ice cream everyday - YAY!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top Notch!,"Beautiful hotel! The location is perfect just steps from Light Rail to Airport, Coors Field, an array of eateries, and Union Station (actually IN Union Station).  The staff is hospitable and accommodating. Convenient to riverfront running. Great selections of beverages at hotel bar. Highly recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,one night more please,"Really great stay, put in for (and received) an upgrade to the Superior Loft. Amazingly quiet and serene given the constant activity in the great main hall there. Room was wonderfully appointed, food in Union Station is amazing, and lots of great stuff around there. Have stayed all over Denver, and there are no shortage of nice places, but this one easily is my favorite. Front desk staff wonderful and helpful throughout.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome hotel but......,"First off, this is a fantastic, trendy hotel in vibrant location. If you want quiet serenity, this is not the place. Plenty of people and nightlife right downstairs. Front desk was awesome, super friendly. Room was modern with nice furnishing, high ceilings bathroom was great with good amenities. I would recommend higher floor since it is an open air concept in that you walk out of your room and can see down into the station/atrium. In the evenings, it can get quite noisy.  Love the daily free ice cream. It was delicious. Shoe shiny right off the elevator bay and Snooze Restaurant for breakfast was fantastic. So you ask, with all the positive comments why the 4 out of 5 stars?  Housekeeping is failing this hotel. I'm not sure if the person who stayed before me had a hair loss problem but I found hair in the shower drain and in the sink. There was toilet paper in the toilet that was not flushed. Lastly, the kicker, I placed the ""Rest"" sign on the door, it's the do not disturb sign, and still housekeeping entered my room and went about their business. The do not disturb sign is up for a reason!  Had the bathroom been clean and housekeeping honor the sign hanging on the door, this hotel would def be a 5 star.  Would I stay here again, absolutely. I hope next time they get the housekeeping situation all figured out.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful and perfect,"I was in Denver on business and stayed in a Pullman room.  The train station was outside my window but I never heard any noise.  It was quiet and peaceful.  The room was impeccably clean and comfortable.  The lobby area was beautiful and Snooze is the perfect breakfast spot.  The food was perfect and the staff was very friendly.  My only complaint is, I didn't get to stay longer!  I will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Moving to the right side of the Tracks,"My husband and I flew into Denver to surprise our daughter who lives there. The hotel where we originally planned our 4 day stay, was not very satisfactory and just across the tracks from them was the Crawford. We called to see about availability and spoke with the delightful, Cassidy who invited us to stop by and check out the rooms. What can I say? EXCEPTIONAL! Everything was outstanding. They are in the coolest location. The room we checked into was beautiful with floor to ceiling windows, super airy with great views and fun for people watching. The bathroom was very spacious and while my husband appreciated the rain shower I was in heaven with the claw-foot tub.  We used their car service several times and the gentlemen who drove us were very professional and charming unfortunately I can only remember Riley's name.Every day I checked in with the front desk for one reason or another and everyone was very kind, courteous and helpful. Their concierge gave us excellent restaurant recommendations.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The best of the best of the best,"Fantastic old hotel, updated but definitley not losing its charm.  Came in for Business - flew top Denver and took the new train from airport to hotel.  Winning!! The hotel is centrally located in downtown Denver, close to shops, restaurants, and of course the ballpark.  The train statyion has many eating establishments and bars.  The rooms are incredibly nice, I will surely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to stay,"This hotel is right next to the train station and bus station which is convenient when your traveling. The rooms are very nice and quiet even though downstairs is full of life. There are many  restaurants that  are so close.  You do pay a destination fee of $20 but you get free ice cream, beer and coffee and more discounts.  It is a great place to stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel, Very cute!,My boyfriend and I had a great time while staying here. Being in Union Station and enjoying the surrounding restaurants was great for our short stay in Denver! The bar at the Crawford had amazing drinks and a cool Gatsby feel to it.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautifully Restored Classic,"Stayed here for a New Year's eve trip with friends.  The rooms were beautifully restored and had every amenity we could ask for, the staff has very attentive in fulfilling our requests and answered all of our questions and recommendations for restaurants in the neighborhood. The setting in the train station is beautiful and every detail has been taken into account in creating a unique and lively space.  We finished our night out with great cocktails at the classic bar and had a delicious breakfast at Snooze, the next day.  Can't wait to go back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A romantic stay at an amazing venue,This hotel is vey new but is filled with a great deal of history and character.  One of the best parts of the hotel is the easy access to the swanky Cooper Lounge and the fab restaurants Mercantile and Stoic & Genuine.  Rooms are spacious and filled with rich decor.  Customer service is too not bc.  Get room service from Snooze!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Old World Elegance,"Really enjoyed my short, one-night stay at the Crawford. The hotel setting in the old Union Station has a unique feel. Makes you want to spend a night and then jump on the ""Flyer"" to California....The room had unique proportions but was well-appointed and elegant. The free coffee, ice cream and a happy hour brew were all nice touches. It was also very nice to have a driver available for quick transport back and forth to a meeting downtown. I'll plan to stay again on my next visit to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Hotel and Customer Service,"After a negative experience at the Crawford several years ago, Frederick responded to my three star Trip Advisor review and I reached out to him as per his request.  Ultimately, the hotel wanted to make it right and invited my husband and I back for two nights of our choice.  We opted to return in July 2016 (sorry for failing to write this sooner) for our anniversary and had a wonderful time.  The rooms are beautiful and the hotel is in the perfect location for enjoying all downtown Denver has to offer.  Knowing how much the hotel values its patrons just solidifies The Crawford Hotel as our ""go to"" hotel when staying downtown.  Excellent all around.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Outstanding Service,"Perfect location for those downtown for business or to party.Great restaurants and bars nearby, bus shuttle very close, light rail very close.Rooms are unique and very nice.Staff beyond good.The restaurants downstairs are fantastic.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Urban Staycation Done Right!,"We opted to stay in town and enjoy some amazing restaurants--couldn't have picked a better hotel to base ourselves.  Awesome room in an historic building. Wonderful service and amenities for days! See attached photo for the list of benefits.  And I encourage you to use them... the car (Tesla) service is delightful (thank you, Myles) & the ice cream is yummy.The rooms are equipped with a rain shower head and the water pressure to make it awesome. Comfy robes, Nesprssso coffee maker and beautiful design make the room a delight to come back to.Th restaurants are all great but ""Mercantile Provisions"" and ""Stoic & Genuine"" are the must visits. Also the ""Cooper Lounge"" was fabulous!Finally, take an hour and take the history tour of the building. Delightful Michael was a superb guide. Gorgeous hotel with a fantastic staff!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Helpful, well pri.ced, well situated","Having not been to Denver before, and wanting to get a little acclimatized before Aspen and skiing, this seemed like a good spot to spend a couple of days somewhere new.At the time, this hotel was new and boutique style which suited what we were looking for.We were not disappointed either. Well appointed split level suite, dark for the most part at night, although a skylight in the bathroom with a opaque door may be problematic during the summer.All the team on hand were very helpful from the curbside to the room.  Comfy bed, decent TV offerings, able to play my own media too, a great stay, and recommended hotel for this town",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Perfect location, Amenities Unnecessary.","Pros: Location, location. Incredibly easy access via train from the airport; in LoDo at the beginning of the 16th Street Pedestrian Mall and easy walks to Larimar Square, the Capital area, the Denver Art Museum, the Rino district, Coors Field and several wonderful restaurants. Union Station serves as the lobby and is lively all day and much of the evening. Take care not to trip over charging cords stretched from tables and sitting areas across walkways to outlets. The security staff is friendly and helpful. Our room was good sized, very clean and extremely quiet. Hotel front desk staff and drivers were very nice and helpful, especially Dominic and Cameron.Cons: The daily $20 amenity fee is excessive and unnecessary. The fee far exceeds the costs of the so called amenities offered.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great time!,"Location was fantastic, took the train into Denver The Crawford is in the renovated Union Station.  Rooms are clean and quiet.  Great amenities at the Station, great food, great bar and perfect for setting off on Denver adventures.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location,We had an overnight stay with grandsons.  The hotel is beautiful and the ambience of Union Station is lovely.  Room was very clean and quiet.  Nice shower with waterfall shower head and lots of pressure.  Extra measures taken to provide security for upper floors.  Breakfast at Snooze was great and as a hotel guest you can make an advance reservation for a very busy breakfast place.  Hotel provides car service rides within two miles - in a Tessa no less.  Look forward to a future stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Location is the only reason to stay,"This hotel is just above an amazing destination in Denver, Union Station. There are great restaurants, vibrant bars, and constant activation. The hotel itself is just ok. Amenity products are poor, sliding bathroom door looks cool but is not great functionally, and there is little attention to detail. There are better hotels in Denver, but it is worth it for the location alone. The resort fee is annoying but forces you to go try a few places like the ice cream shop - so maybe it's not so bad.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unlike Any Hotel I've Stayed At Before,It was a different experience mostly because it was a combo hotel and train station but that added to the charm and uniqueness. Everyone was friendly and they gave me a free room upgrade. It was a marvelous stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great stay,"We arrived very late for our stay and was greeted promptly and let eight in. The staff was very helpful with checking in and the offered a car service the next day. The room was incredible-2 bathrooms, huge bathtub, comfortable bed-reminded me of a mountain chalet!highly recommend staying",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A different kind of hotel--in a good way!,"A hotel inside a bustling train station?  I had no idea what to expect, but based on good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I was not disappointed. My deluxe loft room overlooked the train tracks not the station interior, and it was very spacious and comfortable. I did not hear any station noise, just a train whistle or bells once in a while. Very quiet. The only thing I did not like about the room was that it was dark.  There was only a small, very high window, which kept the sound out, but didn't let much light in.  The room lighting helped, but I prefer natural light. I suspect the non-loft rooms are better in this regard. Hotel staff was amazing, and although you do pay a daily ""fee,"" there are some bonuses to staying here, including free ice cream. Great location for everything--take the train from the airport, and it drops you off here. 16th street mall shuttle is free and stops at the corner.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Only Place to Stay In Denver,"Loved! Loved! Loved staying at the Crawford. The revamp to Union Station is just incredible ... think airy modern art deco. While still an active train station you don't really get lost in that hubbub, instead the lobby feels more like a giant atrium with restaurants, bars and coffee shops at your disposal. Location is hard to beat as you're in the trendy LoDo neighborhood, with lots of things in walking distance. Hotel staff was super accommodating from arranging free Tesla rides to dinner to letting us have a late checkout so we didn't have to change our plans. Highly recommended and definitely will stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Hands Down THE Best!!!,"This is my first time staying at The Crawford Hotel, which is conveniently located at the newly redone Union Station. From when I first set foot in the hotel to when I departed, the service and facilities were incredible! I arrived quit early and had the pleasure of being checked in with Tara. Tara could have not been more accommodating. She informed me that there were two different room types available with 2 beds. Once corner room was ready, but there was a loft style room that was going to be a little bit of a wait. I decided to wait, and boy was the wait worth it! She immediately asked if I would like to store any luggage, which I did. After having lunch, I then came back to check on the status of the room. They were just finishing up the room and it was going to be a a few more moments. This is when I decided to take the hotel courtesy car to the store. The Telsa was immediately available to pick me up. The driver (my apologies I have misplaced his name) could not have been nicer! We went to one store where he then waited for me! After that there was one other thing I needed, and without a hesitation, took me to one more store and waited AGAIN! I was thoroughly impressed. Once arriving back at the hotel, I stopped by the Front Desk to check on my room. It was ready, they had already taken my bags up to the room, and put my beverages in the refrigerator!! The room could not have been nicer. The dark hardwood floors, the exposed wooden beams and brick walls really made the room have a homey feeling. Then within 10 minutes of being in the room, i received a phone call from the front desk asking how the room was and if there was anything they could do to make it better. Again, I was just floored on the level of service. They way the staff had been anticipating my needs really made my stay!Throughout the rest of my stay, it was just one pleasure after another. Lauren and Paulette at the Front Desk could not have been more accommodating and nice. Their never ending attention to detail really made my stay memorable. Working for a top tier hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, I can be VERY picky and cannot help but critique. I have to say this was the FIRST time that I did not have anything negative/reconstructive to say at all. The service, the facility, and overall vibe of this hotel is absolutely impeccable! You would be doing yourself a disservice if you chose anywhere else to stay!This will be the only place I stay when traveling to the Mile High City!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel Stay during our Spring Break Vacation,"This hotel is AMAZING.  Based on all of the favorable comments from other visitors my girlfriend, college daughter, and my 16 year old son decided to book a night's stay during our 5 nights in Colorado.  We booked 2 hotel rooms (double beds in their room a king size in ours).  We honestly wished we had spent more days in Denver and specifically at this hotel.  The renovation work and the historical touch and feel of this hotel is off the charts.  We took so many great pictures from the first and second floor.  The rooms were spacious, well decorated and the wood interior beams added so much character.  The beds were super comfortable and I had my best sleep in it throughout my vacation.  The architect (Dana Crawford) who fought to preserve this building is a legend for her work in downtown Denver and with other buildings and we were so impressed with her work that we had to google her and we ended up purchasing one of the books about the history of the hotel.The front receptionists were kind and friendly and immediately made us feel welcome.  They explained a number of extra perks and amenities we received as guests including free beers, free ice cream, and the use of a TESLA CAR at NO CHARGE with a driver to take us anywhere around downtown.  That alone was worth the cost of the hotel.  We were chaufferred around town including the downtown mall, the Art Museum, several restaurants and the Pepsi Center for the Nuggets game.  The staff was knowledgeable and eager to recommend places to visit.  If you use the TESLA, make sure you tip the drivers.  Its the least you can do for the experience of driving around in a Tesla, at no charge. I would HIGHLY recommend this luxury hotel.  One small exception-- do not use the complimentary razors given at the front desk.  It is worse than shaving with sandpaper.  For the prestige that it carries, I would much rather that they sell a good razor rather than provide a complimentary one that is of no use.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing!! Beyond comparison!,"In town just to visit and the room and amenities are unbeatable. Very clean and a bathroom to die for! The luxury rooms are amazing while still holding on to the historic value of the building. The building really has everything you need, plus right in the center of everything!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wow - best room anywhere!,"We were fortunate to be able to use the Crawford Suite, a most beautiful and luxurious space - in fact, I can't imagine any room, anywhere, being finer than this.  We had stayed in a Pullman room when we were in Denver before; it was nice but quite small. This had an elegant living/dining area with powder room and a very large bedroom.  Its bathroom had the finest of fixtures including a claw-foot tub. Large windows overlooked the train tracks, but the room was soundproof.  All the staff we encountered were amazing.  When we had trouble using the Nexpresso machine in the Butler's Pantry, Housekeeping brought instructions as well as a Keurig machine. Our check in and out were speedy, friendly, and seamless.  As you would expect, everything in the room was spotless and comfortable.  We were taking an early-morning Amtrak from the station, so the location was perfect.  A light rail runs from the airport to Union Station, which made getting to the hotel quick, easy, and inexpensive.  Union Station's surrounding area is a vibrant place and you can find any type of cuisine within walking distance. If you are looking for a very special stay, The Crawford is the place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Nailed it,"This is the spot. The location, the amenities, the vibe, the staff. I live in Denver and got put up at this hotel for the weekend. It made for a luxurious vacation in my own city. Being in and around Union Station is such a treat and the rooms at the Crawford are soooo nice. Super high ceilings, cool art, mattresses that are way better than my own...had a blast. Can't wait to go back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"An Experience, not just a bed.","I had a conference in Denver but wanted to stay someplace special to show off Denver to an out of town colleague.  The Crawford was the PERFECT choice.  The staff is amazing - efficient and courteous.  We stayed in one of the loft rooms and it was charming, unique and extremely well appointed.  As part of our ""Art and History"" package, we were given a personal tour (set according to our schedule) by Mike, who was fantastic.  We enjoyed several perks from the Union Station businesses - including a free coffee, a free scoop of ice cream and priority seating at Snooze for breakfast.  The Copper Lounge was top notch.  The drinks were prepared with precision and presented in the most elegant manner - we were wowed!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hotel.  Can't wait to go back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Weekend away with Girlfriends,"The location of this hotel is perfect.  Right in the middle of the LoDO area with all of the shopping and great restaurants.  Very clean and well appointed.  I loved the vibe of the Union Station Terminal.  The shops and eateries in the station are fantastic.  Also, taking the A Line train in from the airport could NOT be easier.  $9 each way directly to the station/ hotel.  Very convenient!Would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, quirky room","This hotel is definitely centrally located!  Right in Union Station actually.  It's a little weird to walk into a train station to check into your hotel, but it was just fine.  I was staying in a ""loft room"" when I was there, so it was the top floor, a very large room, very comfortable.  The only thing that I thought was a little odd was that there was just one window, and it was at the end of the hallway entrance next to a table.  There was a step down into the actual room where the bed/closet/etc are, and there was no window there...so it was a bit of a cave.  But it was clearly very recently redone, so it was beautiful and comfortable.  I like a light bright room, so I probably would try a different room next time.  Lots of great restaurants right in Union Station, and again great walking options.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Perfect ,convenient location","Stayed one night at the Crawford, overall ambiance was excellent. Great concierge, very accommodating Lots of places close by and inside Union Terminal to eat, have a drink and just people watch. Valet parking was a great service, which came in handy.My complaint of the hotel... the room wasn't as clean as I expected. Being in the hospitality business myself these are things I noticed:bathroom had hair on the floor, the shower had streak marks on glass, shower walls had stuff on them (wasn't sure if it was shampoo-conditioner-soap residue.) just had a dull look to it, and some things were dusty. The room had areas that needed dusting. I could be knit picking but since I'm in the business these are things I found the Crawford lacking. Bed was comfortable and lots of great amenities so it's worth staying at. Hopefully these things could be tweaked and I would gladly stay at The Crawford again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique, beautiful, outstanding","In a world full of cookie-cutter hotels, the Crawford is a refreshing change of pace. Constructed in the historic Denver train station, with shops and drinking establishments all around the inner lobby area, the Crawford is an interesting, beautiful, and comfortable hotel.  Our high-ceilinged room was lovely, and the staff was as outstanding as the station itself. We were greeted by very friendly front-desk people, led by the lovely and welcoming manager, Marie. And later, we were given a tour of the station itself by a young man named Mike, who regaled us with a history of the trains and the structure itself. His tour was first-rate, and I highly recommend it.  Centrally located, the Crawford has character and a unique charm. We enjoyed our stay immensely.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,This. Place!,"This place was EVERYTHING I was hoping for! The historic architecture, incredible design and comprehensive art programming knocked my socks off! From breakfast in bed, to drinks at Cooper Lounge, this place was amazing. So much romance, so much charm, and the SERVICE! When are we going back?!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Location,"I've stayed at quite a few hotels in Denver, but this is my favorite. The hotel is right in the heart of Lodo (Lower Downtown) district, and it's attached to the train station - the hotel lobby is the station. You can take a train directly from the airport to the hotel for only $9/person. The hotel is fun and beautiful. We stayed in the Loft rooms, and they are comfortable and unique. It's located in a great area. The 16th Street is within blocks of the hotel, so you can use the shuttle to get around. It's a great place to stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Everything you'd hope for in a luxury hotel plus unique setting,"We loved our stay at the Crawford. Everything we would hope for in a luxury hotel, and we loved the setting of Union Station with the stores, restaurants, bars and people watching - truly the 'living room of Denver' as Ms Dana Crawford imagined. The whole place is imaginative design and so well done.Loved the tour and Mr Mike the tour guide to tell us about the history and the renewal of Union Station.Great room, loved the bathtub and shower, hospitality and friendliness of staff, all of them.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Luxury Found!,"We stayed at the Beautiful Crawford Hotel for two nights celebrating 50 years of friendship! Both of us are Denver natives but my friend now lives in New Jersey so It was a perfect weekend to remember the good ol' days and be pampered by the most amazing staff. Our room had champagne to toast our occasion and a personal note welcoming us. We had the most amazing massage and facial at the Oxford spa which I will be returning to monthly... I was so impressed! The Oxford Hotel is a sister hotel to the Crawford and is right across the street where we had full access to the workout facilities and steam room. The beds were without a doubt the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the rooms were large and quiet. We loved watching the trains out our window! The bathroom was huge, had a clawfoot tub and two sinks and the shower had wonderful pressure. Union Station has so much history and we enjoyed being right in the middle of everything. There are many restaurants to choose from....Breakfast at Snooze is a great way to start the day and seafood at Stoic and Genuine for dinner was first class.Our late snack was at the ice creme shop.....SO delicious! We were given a coupon at check-in, so.... two cups with two scoops was free and so was coffee and bottled water!We went to a show at Temple Buell one night and Bellco Theatre the other.....both are within walking distance although we opted for the bicycle that pulls the carriage which we loved. The nightlife is non-stop and full of choices.........I wish we could have stayed longer! It was a perfect weekend!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Great Place to Stay,"With my attending a three-day conference being held in a meeting room at the Crawford Hotel, I experienced a wonderful room with all the amenities and a very personable and responsive staff at a terrific location in downtown Denver.  Taking the rail from Denver Airport directly to Union Station and just a short walk into a decorative and historic building, I enjoyed having lots of food and store options, along with close proximity to major restaurants in the area.  The hotel provided a driver to locations within a two-mile radius, which was most helpful.  It was a truly great place to stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent stay,Customer service was excellent.  Complimentary champagne for our anniversary.  Comfortable and beautiful room.  Convenient for taking the train from the airport.  A coffee and beer free each day at the terminal.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing venue!,Sometimes it's just reassuring to be someplace where people care about every detail and want it to be perfect. We were delighted with this beautiful hotel and every aspect of Union Station. The restaurants and bars are varied and great-you don't have to leave the building to have  a terrific weekend. Then they hung the whole center of this cavernous art deco space with lighted gossamer curtains for a wedding that must have been amazing. Tried to pass myself off as the bride to no avail. Staff in all venues over the top.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Funky and brilliant,"Best location possible.Marvellous, characterful rooms are interesting, luxurious, clean and homely.The staff are so helpful it's amazing.Courtesy car, whenever and wherever.The real ale at the Terminal Bar.I really, really loved this hotel",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotel, loud rooms","I booked this hotel due to its proximity to my meeting location and the rail line from the airport.  The hotel was very nice and the choices for food/etc in Union Station were great.  Tried two restaurants and they were both very good.  Front desk will even deliver takeout to your room.  Everyone was very friendly. Unfortunately, the doors that connect rooms are super thin and I could hear everything going on with the couple next to me.  my room also faced the rail station where there is a short street, and anyone walking along the sidewalk I could hear very clearly.  great hotel just needs lots of sound-proofing.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Near perfect,"I travel for a living and like many people who do, many of the properties I stay in seem to run together. It takes something special, or bad, to stand out when you work in the air and on the road. The Crawford is such a place. Full disclosure.....I'm a Denver native and spent a lot of time in lower downtown Denver before it became Lodo. At that time there were a select few establishments down here. The Oxford Hotel and the Cruise Room were part of the rotation and Union Station always stood guard over the landscape that had an edge to it in those ""early days"".Today most of the creative, independent places are gone and have been replaced by Chipotle's and Starbucks. The refurbishment of Union Station has created an island of unique and quality establishments in LODO with the Crawford playing a large role in that play. The idea of putting a hotel in the middle of a working train station is brilliant and it works very well. The furnishings and design are fantastic. 2 wonderful restaurants are located here. Perfect home base for visiting the city. Treat yourself, you will remember this fondly.I stayed here for a birthday. Staff could not have been better. Thank you.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lovely Experience not just a hotel! A Destination!,"Take train From Airport lobby is on your left. Enjoyed our room inside towards Station  No noise as others have stated  Free Coffee, ice cream, beer, discounts on food.  All are part of your experience.  Met Guy the Amtrak worker.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great way to start a ski trip!,"Staying at the Crawford was a huge treat for me and my family...and it was worth every penny!  The staff generously accommodated our need for extra space and we loved the comfort of the Pullman room. Being part of Union Station was an energizing plus!  The excitement of being near the ski train was practically intoxicating for a life-long skier like me!  If you can swing it, go to the Crawford. You will be so glad you did. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,One night to catch train to airport,"Great hotel. We had a small room which we knew in advance, and it was really designed for maximum space. Nespresso machine and great bath amenities, clean and comfortable. Enjoyed the lobby and train station, many choices and the free ice cream and coffee with room was welcome. Will be back",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Service!,I proposed to my girlfriend while staying at The Crawford and in Union Station.  The staff was very supportive and made this a memorable experience.  All of our needs were met.  Thank you for taking care of all of my questions as I planned out the big ask!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Art & History Tour Package of Union Station and the Crawford Hotel,"Many cities have cool hotels, but I doubt few places in the US could compete with the kind of fun history and ambiance that The Crawford Hotel at Denver's Union Station offers. For a discriminating traveler who is looking for a unique experience, The Crawford Hotel truly has that in spades! It combines the best of modern features (the hotel was finished in 2014) in a historically preserved setting (Denver's original train station from the 1880's) that boasts not only a thriving hub of hip local restaurants and retailers, but the hotel is literally at the center of the transportation network for EVERY mode of travel in Denver - Amtrak, light rail, a commuter train straight to the airport, regional and local buses, Pedicab's, taxis and Uber. But those aren't the only things that…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Place !,"WOW! The Crawford was the most amazing place I have stayed at here in Colorado. We stayed here for a couple of nights after our small wedding ceremony and the staff made it an amazing unforgettable stay. Amina, Aaron, Cameron and Lauren were the absolute best during our stay. They all went above and beyond to ensure that we did not have to lift a finger in order to enjoy our stay. They have a Tesla car as the courtesy car that was really easy to book ! You can order Snooze for room service or go down and get priority sitting , we did both and it was great both ways . The bath tub and shower are to die for,  I am sure this was my favorite part. I enjoyed every moment of it and I will be back for many more staycations and specials stays !",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience,"We flew into Denver and wanted to spend a night to get use to the elevation before heading to the ski slopes.  We saw on Trip Advisor that The Crawford was a top choice.  We had a great time.  The historic building is exquisite and the Main Hall felt like 'Denver's living room' with comfortable seating, restaurants and shops.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful.  Our lovely room was small but very comfortable and decorated like an pullman car.  On our next trip to Denver we have decided to stay for longer then one night at The Crawford.   I truly exciting hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique, luxurious, beautiful at an amazing location","If you are going to Denver - do yourself a favor and go to The Crawford. The hotel is located inside Union Station - beautifully appointed swanky transportation center loaded with coffee spots, bars, restaurants, and shops. The rooms are unique with exposed wood beams, brick in the rooms. Super comfortable beds, yummy towels and high end soaps and lotions. Your hotel guide is an ipad like device that allows you to place room service requests, wake up calls, or if you need extra towels. We had notified them we were coming in for Valentine's Day and they had a small bottle of champagne waiting for us on ice with a tray of chocolates with a nice personalized note. The list of details is endless - as is the choices for food and things to do in Downtown Denver during your stay. High…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Valentine's Staycation,"We had a lovely trip and truly felt special staying in such a beautiful hotel and location.  Surrounded by both history and nightlife, we couldn't miss the opportunity to stay at the Crawford, even as locals.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Stay in the Heart of Denver!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this unique stay at The Crawford Hotel. I'm a sucker for an old, majestic space given new life and this place does just that. What it may lack in a central lobby or common space, is more than made up for with the draw of the Union Station Courtyard - the bustle of activity at restaurants and coffee shops just outside your door.   When I checked in, the room I was assigned wasn't quite what I expected. I had booked a Loft Room. The description and photos I remembered online did not reflect the room I was in. I had thought there was a free standing tub in the room that I booked and a separate seating area. The one I was assigned had neither.     I wasn't entirely sure though if I was remembering correctly. And I really didn't want to sound obnoxious. But I…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Interesting, not for the budget minded","No continental breakfast if your into that sort of thing, free coffee at the union station coffee shop, nespresso machines in the rooms, the upstairs lounge, bar was fun, the terminal bar takes over the open lobby, very lively, had a queen bed room on the 2nd floor wich is a glass enclosed lobby where you are on display to downstairs, we would have loved one with the door overlooking the terminal or better view, we looked back onto the train station.  Rooms were quiet, bed very comfortable and nice bathrooms although our faucet was loose.  There are lots of garages in the area or the train gives you lots of options.  ",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anniversary stay,"We stayed for our 10th wedding anniversary and everything was great.  They have valet parking which we did since there really isn't parking available and it was $42/night which seemed pricey.  All of the staff were friendly and helpful.  The fact that it's part of Union Station was why we stayed.  The terminal/lobby is lively and has plenty of seating for people to meet for a cocktail or coffee.  There is an ice cream shop, coffee shop, deli and bar in the terminal.  Plenty of restaurants, we ate at Snooze and was excellent.  The room is very cool and has great TV, IPORT device to order room service, play music and find out what's going on at the hotel. Great location I think walking distance to great restaurants, 16th St mall, Cooks field and plenty of bars.  We will stay here…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Art/Tour Package at the Crawford was Excellent,"My high school aged son and I traveled to Denver for my work.  We stayed at the Crawford Hotel for 2 nights.  It was an amazing experience.  The ""lobby"" is really a meeting place of the downtown area.  There are coffee shops, book stores, a flower vendor, and huge benches for the people waiting for their trains.  We booked an ""Art/Tour Package"".  Michael Schmidt did the tour for us when we arrived.  This 1 hour tour was awesome!  He pointed out unique features of the renovated building, the artwork, and was super energetic about this marvelous property and its history.  Highly recommend doing this tour if you are able - it's educational and fun!  Also, with our Tour Package, we were given a linen-covered, color-picture book.  The hotel rooms at the Crawford are clean and…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very cool atmosphere,"Union Station is awesome! There's a hotel, bar and at least 2 full service restaurants. There's also a coffee shop, ice cream store and several boutiques. We rode the California Zephyr into the station, stayed in the hotel for 2 days, and rode the train the the airport. We ventured out to go to RMNP one day, and to dinner one night. Otherwise, everything we needed was in the building. Very cool place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Christmas night,My experience at Crawford was amazing! The rooms are historic with an amazing view and that staff was beyond helpful and available. The manager Paulette stood out to me the most and was extremely professional and helpful to whatever we needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Unique Place to Stay,"It was a trip to celebrate our 52nd anniversary. I wanted to do something unique for my wife. I selected The Crawford as we had not been to Union Station, even though we live 30 minutes away. I wanted to learn about the Station and also to explore it. It far exceeded my expectations.I signed up for the Art and History tour package. They upgraded our room to a deluxe loft and there was bubbly waiting in the room when we arrived. The room was spotless and the hotel security excellent three electronic key locks (elevator, hallway and room) to shield the rooms from the mass of train travelers. There was also a lot of security people in and around the Station and train platforms.The pillow and bed were the best I have ever had at a hotel. We first had a glass of wine in the Cooper Lounge, which overlooked the central lobby area - good wine selection. Then it was dinner at a seafood restaurant in the hotel - Stoic & Genuine - fabulous (subject of another review). Breakfast followed the next day at Snooze, where we got preferred seating as a result of staying at The Crawford. There were other free food - drink extras included as a hotel guest in the Station concessions.The Art and History tour was excellent. Michael Schmidt was our guide - well versed and informative. We loved it and learned a lot.My only complaint was the parking situation. The valet parking was $42.00 per day (plus tip). We parked free on the street as it was Sunday but had to plug the meter on Monday every two hours.I highly recommend the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,OUTSTANDING HOTEL!,"My family and friends stayed at The Crawford Hotel recently for a wedding.The staff went out of their way to make everyone welcome.  They delivered our gift bags, arranged and delivered personalized amenities for each of our guests.  We all loved the different style rooms and beautiful decor!  Our family and friends really enjoyed the extra perk of a coffee, ice cream, beer and other items that were definitely worth the nightly fee.  We would meet everyone in the ""The Great Hall"" of the awesome Union Station. I highly recommend this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel; Fantastic Staff and Service; Tremendous access to first class dining. Highly recommend,"First stay the The Crawford and will definitely return. Beautiful, exceptionally clean and totally newly updated room with great amenities. The staff, from the moment that I checked in through my departure, were exceptional, friendly, and went out of their way to assist and please me. Ate at three on-site restaurants, all outstanding. Breakfast at Snooze is not to be missed from pancakes to omelettes, all great. Both the Mercantile and Stoic and Genuine had excellent dinner options. Would highly recommend a stay at The Crawford and I will be returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beware extra charges,"Don't get me wrong, lovely hotel in a fantastic historic railway station. We were completely happy until we checked out. On our arrival we were handed a little card telling us all these great 'free' things we could get and discounts in shops and restaurants in the complex. We didn't use many of them, but we used one discount for breakfast. Then when we checked out we were told we needed to pay $20 per day for the privilege of using this discount card. This was definitely not made clear to us on arrival, and as they already had our bank card details stored for incidentals we could not refuse to pay. Very poor customer service and it soured what had been a nice stay up till then. You need to be more transparent about this - had I known I would have declined the discount card. But it was presented as just an automatic complimentary benefit.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,LOVED it!,"I just loved staying at The Crawford! We decided to book a night just to get away and picked The Crawford especially because of its location in the heart of downtown. Its location is primo, with almost too much to do in about a half mile radius! But no worries, the concierge, Mike, directed us to some lovely restaurants and did all of the work of choosing the best options for us... Thank you!! To top off our experience that evening, The Crawford supplies a Telsa as a courtesy vehicle to get you wherever you need to go in the downtown area. Our driver that night, Cameron, was very charming and always arrived to bring us to our next destination right when we needed him. Now onto the hotel, it is beautiful!! I loved the classic architecture and how modern amenities are incorporated to provide a refined but cozy environment. We received nothing but smiles and courtesy from the ladies at the front desk and they were able to provide a wealth of information. I loved our room, the decor was very tasteful and had every amenity you would ever need. After a wonderful night out and an uninterrupted sleep, we ordered breakfast in bed from Snooze, that arrived promptly at our door. When it was time to check out, my husband and I both agreed that we wished we booked a longer stay. We will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Terrible Experience,"In the spirit of giving an honest review, I will start by saying this is a beautiful hotel. Convenient with a lot of perks with it being in Union Station & nice rooms. My low rating is for the experience & staff. I came here to stay the first night of my honeymoon before we took off for Breckenridge and Beaver Creek. We were told we were getting a complimentary updgrade but when we got to our room it was the room we paid for, but no big deal. When we checked out we noticed we were charged twice on our bill. We took it down for them to ""fix"", they said they did but then it was still wrong. They assured us it was all taken care of a second time and we left for Breckenridge. On our 3rd night of our honeymoon our card that we got specifically for this trip began getting declined. We checked with our bank & The Crawford Hotel had posted nearly $2000 to our credit card. I called & was assured they were reversed. So, imagine our surprise when our card was again declined a few days later. I called & spoke to the manager Tara, who essentially told me she didn't know what I was talking about & there was nothing she could do. She was very rude & I explained to her that the charges were clogging up our card & making things very inconvenient & all she would say is ""I don't know what to tell you.""  We spent 2 days of our honeymoon on the phone with banks and the hotel, trying to figure this out and transferring money. Its been over a week now & the charges are still on our card & we cant get anyone from The Crawford to help so we have to do a charge back through our bank. It was a terrible start to our Honeymoon and Tara was a nightmare to deal with.",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loft Premium ,"Beautiful hotel and room. The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of downtown with plenty of restaurants to go to. When you stay here you get a free beer, ice cream and coffee each day you stay. The bed in the room was super comfortable and the bathtub was huge! My 6'4 husband still had room in the soaking tub. Very quiet  (never heard the trains). We will definitely stay here again next time we are in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Updated and lovely location,"This was our first stay at this interesting hotel.  Key card secure and security always visible but not obtrusive .  The atrium is open to public and train weary travelers between connections.  It's also a gathering place for business appts. and mtgs.  I saw and spoke to many people who found the soaring ceilings and amazing restaurants to be irresistible .  The hotel and staff are quite lovely .  Your bags can be stored securely and retrieved by your claim tkt from a staff member.  We never had a problem and the location was the best.  Close to shopping venues, Coors Stadium and many restaurants walking was extremely pleasant .  The reading chair and ottoman was so comfortable!!! In-room Nespresso and fridge was convenient.  Tablet in room for info on hotel, restaurants, etc.  Will love returning to this unique property!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Diminishing Returns…,"It isn’t about what the Crawford Hotel has done. It’s about what they didn’t do.The hotel is elegant, centrally located and has a solid staff. Additionally, it is clean, quiet and comfortable but none of these things are enough to compel my wife and I to stay there again. At this price point, all of the aforementioned things should be a given – especially in a hotel at this price-point. Our stay-cation included a trip on the Ski Train. Michael, our concierge helped with getting us tickets on the Snow Cat and arranged for flowers, charcuterie, a bottle of wine and a welcoming, hand-written note. However, the promised breakfast to go for the train ride wasn’t waiting at the front desk as promised.  The staff did their best to get us the food items from the Pig Train coffee shop but the results turned out incomplete and slapdash at best. The free drink coupons at the Terminal Bar went unused. A crucial aspect of our stay that was terribly out of step for a hotel of this caliber was the room service or the lack thereof. Restricted hours, limited choices and coffee that was only available in to-go cups. Really? The staff kept reiterating that the coffee was in “recyclable containers”. That was beside the point. We didn’t want to participate in the eco-disaster of to-go packaging or Keurig cups.  We were told of the in-room coffee maker, a Keurig knock-off. Again, really? At best, you’d find maybe 2 examples of coffee you wanted and in the demitasse-sized amount it’s not going to satisfy anyone’s’ caffeine fix. Getting a simple cup of coffee in the morning at a fine hotel shouldn’t be this odious. But wait, we could eat at Snooze. It’s just off the lobby. The staff uselessly told us if we would have told them the night before, they could have made us reservations.  How were we supposed to know that? That should have been an option on the home screen of the in-room iPad. This is a colossal misstep of marketing and lost opportunity for customer service. The miscues like these degraded the experience and seem hardly befitting a hotel with aspirations to be the premier destination of travelers. We upgraded our room to one of the attic, 4th story, deluxe rooms.  It was spacious, well appointed and featured the exposed, original structural beams and brickwork accented with walnut trim. An elegant space but be advised: there are 3 steps separating the entry and bathroom area from the bed and desk. I would wager few hotels have this feature and you could slip and fall in the dark as I did.  (Twisted the hell out of my ankle.) I didn’t turn on a light because I didn’t want to see the ugly wall art. A mirror image of two bleached out, buck deer, joined at the neck and shoulder with big, doey eyes that follow you. The nightstands are the nested type but the inner section weighs more than the slight pull can withstand and it isn’t simple or easy to pull out. Like other hotels, the bathrooms at the Crawford feature a conspicuous lack of towel racks or hangers. The generous size of the shower with dual showerheads is a nice touch and is a preferred use of bathroom space in my opinion. It is kind of tragic that a place that started out with such promise devolved into a place we couldn't wait to leave. I have had 5-star hotel experiences in Denver but this stay wasn't one of them.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Stay!!!,"We stayed at the Crawford and loved the hotel! Great location, new rooms and super clean! We stayed in a loft style room and had plenty of room! The bathroom was a great size too. Had a dual shower head which was really nice. Loved having a Nespresso machine in the room!! Staying at the Crawford you get a free beer at the Terminal bar, a coffee each morning at Pig Train Coffee Co., and a scoop of ice cream at Milkbox creamery. Loved sitting in union station and watching the world go by! Also, you must try Mercantile and The Kitchen for dinner! Both were amazing! I highly recommend this hotel if your staying in downtown Denver!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Charming,"Very nice and charming hotel located in Union Station Great if you're arriving from the airport and want to just jump on the train.  Brings you right to the hotel.Rooms are nice and clean.  I was in a room that reminded you of a train car.Amenities are great.  Everything you would expect in an upscale hotel.Free internet,  lots of food choices in the same building or right outside the door.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved the Crawford!,"What a wonderful property!  From the well appointed room to the available Tesla to take you around town, there was so much to love about this hotel.  Right at the station, you only need walk across the platform from the new airport light rail or one of the many other buses or trains and you are at your home away from home.  From there is is only a short walk to the 16th street mall and the free bus that takes you up and down it to all the shops and restaurants.  But we chose to take the hotel's Tesla the day we went downtown sightseeing.  The car was prompt and took us down to the state capitol building so we could stand one mile high.  Later after visiting the Art Museum and a few other attractions and getting dinner, the car was available then as well to come pick us up and get us safely back to the hotel.  Service by the rest of the staff was wonderful and the 2nd floor lounge was a gem.The room has very nice furnishings, an iPad, a Nespresso machine, nice flat screen tv and a gorgeous bathroom with a rain shower.  Plus all the shops, cafes and bars of Union station right downstairs.  You do need a room key to use the elevator or doors to get up to the hotel levels, so there is some security.But because you are at Union Station there will be some noise.  The hotel backs to where the trains pull in, fronts to Wynkoop street with all its traffic and bars and the interior rooms look right down over Union Station where travelers come and go all day and night.  It didn't bother us, but if you are looking for a much more quiet location, you may wish to rethink this choice.  Otherwise I highly recommend this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Good choice for our family; details in review,"First, we enjoyed the train from the airport to Union Station.  Second, we found Union Station outstanding: several restaurants/bars, tons of seating, a small bookstore, 2 shuffleboard tables, a deli, a coffee shop, and an ice cream place that we visited 3 times.  Third, the Crawford Hotel exceeded expectations: great service, reasonably large and nicely appointed room, large bathroom, no street noise (despite outward-facing room), clean, comfortable beds, small fridge, good-sized safe.  Fourth, we liked downtown Denver and found plenty within walking distance, like the Avalanche game and spending quarters at the 1Up classic arcade/bar.  One thing worth knowing is that Union Station is a working Amtrak station -- you will find backpackers spending time there.  Not a bad thing, but do not expect the ""lobby"" of the Crawford (which is not really a lobby) to be as serene [read: boring] as the Four Seasons.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Came in on Amtrak from Emeryville California,"The Crawford was a great destination after 30+ hours on a train!  The renovated Union Station is very nice and downtown Denver has quite a bit to offer.   The hotel was fine...old building but modern renovations.   Our 'attic' room was more of a suite than a room, with lots of interesting angles, more bathrooms and television sets than we needed, but fun nonetheless.  If in Denver we will check out the Crawford again.   We ate at Mercantile and enjoyed it!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Anniversary getaway,"We took the train to Union Station a couple of weeks ago.  Wandered over to the front desk of this Hotel, and had a great conversation with the wonderful young lady who told us all about the hotel.  As our anniversary was coming up, we decided to book a room.  When we arrived to our room, we were greeted with a chilled bottle of champagne and a personalized card for our Anniversary.  The room was amazing, very historic, and the location was perfect.  I couldn't have been happier with my stay.  Highly recommend this Hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing stay,"My husband and I stayed at The Crawford Hotel for the first leg of our cross-country honeymoon. I used the concierge services even before I arrived to arrange some surprise activities for us to do when we arrived. The concierge and front desk personnel were incredibly kind, helpful, and seemed genuinely pleased to be able to assist me. The hotel itself is unbelievable...Dominic and Bree (front desk and sales) went above and beyond to make sure that we had an amazing experience. I cannot thank them enough or more highly recommend this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Must See,"My wife and I stayed at The Crawford last month for her birthday. We enjoyed our stay, and we both felt that the amenity/resort fee was absolutely worth it. We've stayed at 3 different hotels that charged an amenity/resort fee. The amenities provided at The Crawford were exceptional.My wife and I both work in the hotel industry, so it was very nice to experience why The Crawford is rated #1 on TripAdvisor. With our experience and knowledge, we appreciated all of the tiny details that they look for. All of the small details and amenities are what make The Crawford so successful.I also had the pleasure of briefly meeting the Hotel Manager, Tiffany O. She is very kind and intelligent. With her leadership, it is no wonder why they have a great staff as well.Thanks for everything! It was wonderful!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,5 Star Treatment!,All I can say is WOW! This hotel was absolutely outstanding. My boyfriend and I were so torn on where to stay in Denver based on location. It was between the Crawford and The Four Seasons and I am so so so happy we chose The Crawford. First of all the staff is OUTSTANDING. Chris made a great impression when I called and booked up to our driver tall blonde gentleman. I wish I could remember his name!!!! So courteous! Take advantage of the courtesy car and tip your driver! Our room was fabulous. We stayed in the Pullman room and the decor and bed were superb. You have to go to Snooze downstairs for breakfast. BEST BREAKFAST IN THE WORLD! The hotel even puts guests on a priority list for the morning. Also make sure and play shuffleboard while you have some cocktails from The Terminal Bar. My boyfriend and I loved the hustle and bustle of the Hotel and loved the fact that we could not hear a sound from downstairs. We arrived about 2 hours before check in and our room was ready. We were so pleased. We had a fantastic time in Denver and will ONLY stay at the Crawford because of this outstanding experience. Thank you to all staff for making this the stay of a life time!!!!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing staycation!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at The Crawford Jan. 2017 and it was amazing! I love that you can go straight from the airport to the hotel at Union Station. When I checked in, Alison was so wonderful and friendly. Everytime i saw her, she was smiling. I was a little concerned about ths noise when i saw where our king room was, but as soon as we closed the door, it was silent! The room was great, the bed was very comfortable and I love the location of the hotel. Will definitely recommend this hotel to others",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Holiday Downtown Stay,"My husband and daughter and I stayed at the Crawford for a night downtown to take in the Christmas lights and be together for the holiday.  The staff was warm and friendly, the room was comfortable and stylish, and the location is magical.  Union Station was lit up with a picture perfect Christmas tree and the hustle and bustle of families meeting up at the train station made for a really memorable night.  We will definitely make this a tradition.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,"I stay in quite a few excellent hotels around the world & the Crawford is head & shoulders among the best!  The staff does an excellent job of anticipating ones needs & desires, making one quite comfortable!The rooms are gorgeous, clean, & well appointed.  I was amazed at how completed quiet the room was despite the fantastic downtown, Union Station location.  A perfect retreat in the best part of Lower Downtown Denver.More about the location: Union Station is quite good.  Excellent coffee, food, & beverage set in a beautiful open, yet comfortable seating area.  Great for work or social.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,This is a must stay again and again hotel!,"We were first timers in town for the bull riding @ the Denver Coliseum.  The valet was friendly and helpful.  The front desk person, Erin, was to be very honest,  so great and helpful!!!   He assisted us with our belongings to our room.  He drove us to the Coliseum;with the promise of having a driver pick us up.  We have stayed at other hotels that shuttled us and they either forgot us or they were confused on where to pick us up or they had to pick up several people from the 16th St. Mall and would get around to us.  Miles called us within 10 minutes of our pickup call and found us right away!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Erin made sure everything was explained to us and answered all of our questions!  We do believe that he is an outstanding host that deserves praise and a raise would be nice!  Both Erin and Miles were pleasant and made our stay extra enjoyable!!!!Our room faced where we had boarded trains to go to Glennwood in the past.   the room was clean and very aswesome considering it was a knockoff of staying in the pullman car on the train.  All of the old pictures and articles were interesting. The property is everything you could ask for, clean, friendly with everything you need .  The Snooze is the place for breakfast.  There are so many employees to serve you, and they were all taking care of business well!  They brought everything out the way it was ordered and even gave us an extra pickle(house made of course, and so yummy)and waters to go were offered without our having to ask!  The hotel gave us discounts on the establishments in the depot.  Free beer@the Tavern with a great and knowledgeable bartender, free coffee and a hand dipped scoop of ice cream @ the Creamery.  We had the best Reuben sandwiches @ Acme and was waited on by the friendliest person also!  I can't say how great the Crawford and their staff and establishments within the property were to us.  It was truly and experience that we won't ever forget!  THANK ALL OF YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Everything under one roof - fun time in Denver!,"Weekend getaway to Denver the weekend before Christmas with my husband. We took the train from airport to the hotel, train dropped us off right at the hotel which is located inside of union station. Lobby was beautifully decorated with an enormous Christmas tree and large ""santa bench"" which was perfect for picture taking. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. A few freebies (ice-cream, beer, coffee) were given to us. Rooms were small but clean. Quality bath products and good water pressure in shower. Overall pricey rooms but great place to splurge for a special occasion. We tried to use the hotels free ride service but he was booked up so we ended up using the local bus system and it worked perfectly. Plenty of shops, restaurants, and live music within walking distance. We loved breakfast at Snooze inside union station but be ready to wait about an hour if you don't arrive early....food and mimosas definitely worth the wait. Great place for a weekend get away if you want to be amidst people, food, and shopping venues.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at the Crawford to celebrate my birthday. I was pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail of the hotel. The hotel is inside of Union Station (which has been revitalized) and the ""lobby"" is small and along side the many eating establishments. The staff was impeccable. We booked a King room and got an upgrade to a larger King room. The hotel, although new, kept a lot of the vintage charm of the old times. The elevator had the old style dial indicator that showed which floor the elevator was on. Inside the elevator was a subtle etching of people on the back elevator wall. The room was large with very tall ceilings, a sliding barn type door to the bathroom, hexagon tile in the bathroom, dual shower heads, and Bigelow Apothecary toiletries. The hotel even allowed the guests the ability the use of a car  (Tesla) and the driver would take you if going within 2 miles of the hotel. Great perk!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Hotel - Amazing Service,"As a hotel to stay at, this was a perfect property.  It has everything you could possibly want.  The train from the airport in Denver stops directly at the hotel.  (Avoid rooms facing the train station if the sound is going to bother you)  The hotel itself offers great amenities like free beer, ice cream, and discounts on food on the property.  Be sure to take advantage of it.  In addition you are centrally located to all the great food, the stadium, and lots of museums.  Many things are walkable but uber is also readily available.The rooms are beautiful, clean, and pleasant.  For a relatively ""rustic"" feel, the rooms had all the modern conveniences I would expect and want.  Truly well done.  Tip - It's hard to find check-in desk when you walk in and the station has so many distractions.  They are off to one side next to the elevator bank.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved it!,"Stayed at The Crawford with my three year old son and husband after Christmas and we loved it. Union Station is definitely a hot spot. The hotel is cool and eclectic. Rooms are spacious with nice bath products, an iPad and a Nespresso machine. When we checked in they wheeled out a wagon of toys and let my son pick whatever he wanted. If you want to be in the center of bustling LoDo then this is the place to stay. It's not a traditional hotel with a lobby, the train station is the lobby, quiet luxury it is not, but fun and cool it is. The restaurants in  Union Station are good, Mercantile and Snooze for sure and the Cooper Lounge is a great place for a drink. Only thing to note is the valet parking is pricey at $42 a day, but it's comparable to the parking garages in the area and…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Worth every dollar,"This was one of my favorite places to stay.  This hotel is located inside Union Station. A few years ago they renovated Union Station and included this hotel along with several restaurants, shops and a bar.   It is such a great idea to have all of these services under one roof. The great room as its called is the main area inside Union Station that allows for guests,tourists or passengers to sit and you can eat, drink or just read.   This area was always hopping no matter what time of day but not to a chaotic point just people in and out coming to enjoy one of the services.  I cannot thank all the staff enough for their friendliness and attention to customer service.   They also offer a complimentary car service with a Tesla that will drive you anywhere within 2 miles of the…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Ah-mazing!,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It is probably one of the best hotel's I have ever stayed at. From the great location in the center of downtown to the great amenities located at our doorstep downstairs inside the train station to the décor and little touches inside the room itself.. we were only sad we had to leave so early the next morning to go to the airport instead of sleeping in and enjoying our stay even longer. I thought the price was good especially for what you get it was well worth it. Of course there was a $40 a night charge for the car, but they had it ready for us out front at 2:30am so can't complain about that. They provided 2 free Voss waters in the mini fridge which I thought was nice considering most places charge you for water. There were…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful hotel in a historic building ,"The Crawford hotel is top notch and I can't wait to stay there again. Situated in Union Station, it is in the perfect location to walk to pretty much everything in downtown Denver. You can also stay put in the hotel itself because there are several restaurants and cafes onsite. The Acme deli has great sandwiches and Snooze is worth the wait for breakfast/brunch, but I would give Terminal bar a pass except for a late night drink.     My room was spotless and well appointed with top of the line amenities. There is a great shower, an espresso machine, and the bed was very comfortable. The view was of the train tracks but there were no issues with noise. The only thing I did have a problem with were that the doors are so heavy and slam every time some goes in and out of their rooms,…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience,"Amenities were great, loved the Nespresso maker in the room. Wonderful location for all that LoDo has to offer. Loved the shops and we had a fun afternoon playing shuffleboard. Snooze was great for breakfast and as a hotel guest we were offered priority seating.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Industrial Chic in LoDo,"In a word, disappointing even though I've given the hotel a 4 rating. The renovated Union Station is really amazing and the hotel is located right in the station. We were catching Amtrak's California Zephyr to San Francisco the next morning and from the room to the train was a five minute leisurely walk.The room rate was $279, good for a luxury hotel in downtown Denver, but the Union Station Historic Preservation Fee, State Tax, Lodger's Tax, and Amenities and Services Fee added $70 to that and caused it to be not particularly good value. Just what amenities and services did I pay $20 for that other hotels provide without additional charge? While I like the industrial chic ambience and feel, the room didn't have windows and didn't feel particularly cozy. Maybe ""industrial"" isn't supposed to. So all in all location, location, location is great but I think I'll stay somewhere else next time.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel and location,"This was our second stay at the Crawford.  It is a great location with easy access to everything in Denver.  Also, just a great atmosphere with it being in Union Station.  The rooms are very nice and the iPad mini in the room is a nice touch.  Great showers that are large.  Staff was super helpful going over all of the amenities and setting up some dining and transportation for us.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Industrial Chic, Contemporary Historical setting","We booked the Date Night package and were upgraded to the Crawford Suite!  The amenities and décor were tasteful and well done.  As part of the package, we had cocktails at the Cooper Lounge (spot on as always!).  It was the night after Thanksgiving and they lit up Union Station and had a performance and Santa on sight.  Delightful.  Would highly recommend a stay at the Crawford if you are into the hustle and bustle of downtown, but enjoy more posh finishes and a bit of distance from the crowds!  We fell in love with the painting in the dining area of the room, and after our stay were contacted by the staff who found out the (local) artists' name so we could contact her.  Service was impeccable, our experience divine.  Several nearby dining choices, as well as fabulous dining in Union Station (Mercantile is wonderful!) Would definitely recommend and hope to do this again something for another staycation in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Staycation,"Best of old world and new world. Beautiful hotel with all the amenities, old charm, you never have to leave with all the bar and restaurant options. Best hotel in Denver!! Make sure to make a reservation a day in advance at Snooze for breakfast.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic Hotel and Venue!,"We love The Crawford and it's location at Union Station.  Rooms are beautiful, the amenities are great and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The whole venue is perfect for just hanging out or grabbing a cocktail and dinner, or coffee and breakfast.  One of our absolute favorites!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lovely and So Convenient,"The historic Crawford Hotel in Union Station is so special!  The staff provided exemplary service from early check-in to delayed check-out.  We were surprised to receive a complimentary ride in a Tesla to the Denver Art Museum.   The best parts are the location in Union Station and all of the amenities so close at hand.  We were concerned our lovely room would be noisy since we overlooked the train depot, but no so.  It was so quiet and relaxing.  We will definitely return!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Enjoy the history with your stay!,"This hotel takes you back in time.  As smaller but modern boutique hotel, this hotel is hustling and bustling with travelers, tourists and history.  Staying in the central location of the city, it's the train station ""Union station"".  The rooms are spacious and modern, with historic doors and history on the walls.  Can be a little noisy, but that should not stop you from this beautiful hotel with stores, bars and restaurants for your entrainment.  They offer a car service to take you around town to local establishments when the weather is cold.  But everything is a walk away.  Downtown Denver has so much to enjoy.  We highly recommend the Crawford Hotel.   Not recommended for small children.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love this hotel,"The Crawford is located in Union Station. We loved the atmosphere and all of the options located in one spot.  Great restaurants, coffee shop and ice cream! Something for the whole family.  The most comfortable bed I have slept on in a hotel in a very long time.  Quiet, clean and thoughtful staff!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome romantic hotel in a great location,"One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.  It was a nice romantic getaway for my wife and I.  I's so nice to know that there are still hotels out there that provide impeccable, personalized service, including a private ride in the hotel Tesla within a 2 mile radius.  We truly felt we stepped back in time, with the art deco motif and the tasteful, luxurious room.  Ordering Snooze to be delivered using the provided iPad in the room was a plus.  We'll definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best spot in Denver!,"Everything about The Crawford is next level! From the wonderful staff to the excellent amenities, this hotel is MUST if you are staying in Denver. Plus it is conveniently located near some of the top restaurants in the city. I will definitely stay at The Crawford again.",5

The decor very hip and beds super comfy. Used the services of the hotel driver and Tesla. Very nice benefit. Will be back for a longer stay. ,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,great location,"very cool location in Union station. Very close to great restaurants, bars, and shops. Flying into Denver airport we just took the train straight to union station ($9 per person). I found this to be very convenient. Check in was quick and easy. The girl at the front desk asked if we needed the complimentary driver which was cool. He drives a red Tesla. The regular rooms are small but cozy. I think it must have been a double bed. Very small but comfortable. Our room was very quaint and comfortable. After putting our bags down and getting settled we headed to cooper lounge for a drink. I am not sure if they are trying to make this bar some super exclusive vibe but the whole checking in thing is stupid. The girl at the check asked if we had a reservation. I told her no. she then…",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Place,"Located within Union Station, the Crawford Hotel was a wonderful place to spend a few days. The staff was friendly and efficient, the room was quiet and relaxing, and the location was perfect. We decided to upgrade to a much larger room.  Check in was very efficient. The front desk is a little hidden in the airing room of the station, on the right wall. We arrived late morning and our room was not ready, and they asked for my mobile number to inform us when it was available. They checked our luggage. Since we were hungry from our cross-country flight, we decided to enjoy a beautiful day and lunch outdoors at one of the many restaurants in Union Station. The call arrived around 130 and when we went to the front desk they told us the luggage was already in the room.  The room…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Night out downtown with stay at the Crawford,Myself and some friends stayed downtown for the avalanche game and decided to stay the night at the Crawford. Room was amazing and the Cooper lounge was magnificent. Front desk agent was extremely helpful and courteous!!! Can't wait to stay at the Crawford again!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,My favorite hotel yet!!,"The Crawford is right off the light rail station and perfect for guests who want to enjoy beautiful downtown Denver.  Fantastic restaurants, shops and places to hang out and enjoy a coffee or pint of beer.  The Crawford offers short distance valet in a Tesla with some of the nicest drivers around.  We celebrated a birthday with the Infinite Monkey Theorem Urban Winery tour package and had an excellent tour and wine tasting with Jazmine.  Michael, the concierge was very helpful.  Our room was quiet, tastefully decorated and very comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Date Night Getaway,This is the second time we spent the night at The Crawford Hotel. It's such a fun place to relax and enjoy downtown Denver. The rooms are spacious and very quiet. The staff is friendly. It's a very cool vibe being in the train station. We were there at Christmas time and it had beautiful decorations. We also ate at Mercantile in Union Station which was fabulous! The only down side was waiting for valet at check out. It took longer than we anticipated.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,So LOUD,How can you rent a hotel room at a premium rate and then have a VERY LOUD event in the atrium that the rooms face out on? I have never been in a hotel that was so loud.  We also had asked for adjoining rooms as we were traveling with family -- this didn't happen.  Stay away from this venue unless you just plan to party all night.,1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for Downtown Date,"We stayed at the Crawford on a Saturday night as part of a 24-hour downtown holiday date. Check-in for our room took all of 2 minutes. We'd reserved a ""Superior Classic"" room, which was small but elegant, clean, and nicely decorated. I had requested an extra blanket during reservation, and they provided two, We discovered neither of us had packed toothpaste. The Crawford provides an ipad in the rooms and I used their app to request a dental kit, which was delivered within a half hour. I liked that the bathroom had a spacious, walk-in shower with two shower heads because who really ever uses the small tubs usually found in hotel bathrooms?After our activities around downtown we went to the Cooper Lounge for some cocktails (had made reservations). The bartenders were super nice, and the drinks were great. The Union Station lobby was hopping with activity, including a private holiday party right in the center. It was also beautifully decorated for the holidays, and the whole atmosphere was very festive. We were concerned about the noise once we finally decided to retire, since our room was literally 3 doors down the hall from Cooper Lounge but the walls and door were pretty noise tight. We heard a little noise but nothing that kept us awake, in spite of the crowd that was still in the station lobby.We enjoyed our stay very much, and would definitely return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Perfect Hotel, Location, Luxury, and Excellence","I stayed at the Crawford Hotel with a group of friends.  We all had a great time at this beautiful hotel.  It was so convenient to be able to take the train from the airport straight to the hotel where we were greeted by the pleasant, kind, and accommodating staff of the Crawford.  The lobby was beautifully decorated for the Holidays and had great restaurants, cafes, kiosks, and coffee shops!  The hotel room was stunning with floor to ceiling windows, super comfortable beds, and a shower I could have spent all day in.  Not to mention, just outside the hotel are all the conveniences of downtown with tons of options for shops, restaurants, and bars all close by within walking distance!  I have nothing but nice things to say about the hotel and its staff.  I would recommend this to anybody wanting to stay at the perfect hotel in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Weekend Getaway,"""Wow""I was impressed with the first step into the Union Station in the heart of Denver. There was a private office party with a band and it looked right at home in the center of the station floor. The energy was fantastic. We found the front desk tucked into the side and was in our room on the 4th floor within minutes. The room was near sound proof but you can always walk out to the atrium and enjoy the architecture and the buzz below.The rooms themselves were well appointed and very generous with the high ceilings (at least our suite was) which was I believe an upgrade with the date night package (worth it!).To say that the rooms and hotel were nice is missing the point. I gave this place 5 stars for the service. From the valet to the desk staff and even the cleaning staff everyone was friendly and helpful. Special shout out to the concierge staff (Michael was outstanding) for their attention to detail and ability to problem shoot and make our trip especially special and unique.A must stay/see for those wanting a jaunt into town and want to have quick access to a variety of quaint shops within walking and fantastic food. To go further afield they provide included car service with a Tesla! Our driver was fantastic (Erin, I believe) and really made haunting around for dinner easy and exciting.Great location, staff and service!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Very ""Happening"" Hotel",Didn't realize from hotels.com info that The Crawford is actually part of the renovated Union Station....now a multi-faceted gathering place with a big pulse rate.  Room itself was of the European style....quite compact but otherwise fine.  Staff was helpful when needed.  Excellent location.  Courtesy shuttle Tesla when available for up to 2 miles.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Business Trip,"Great room....took pictures for my wife. I needed to use the hotel automobile (red Tesla....nice ride) to get across town for a cocktail party at the Art Hotel. The driver, Miles, was a great guy. We had excellent conversations going both ways. The rest of the staff was also very friendly. Nice stay, great ambience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Room in a Unique Setting,"Room was beautiful! Very comfortable bed.  Extremely clean & quiet.  Although it was only the third floor and it was the corner of the building there was no street noise.  Had a great night's rest, which to me is the most important thing. Very centrally located. Amenities were very nice.  Staff couldn't be more courteous and helpful. Just two comments for those traveling with children: 1. I couldn't find a night light in the bathroom and 2. I couldn't find where there were any movies offered for purchase. Having been to Denver many times I am comfortable saying that this is the best place to stay if you have to be in downtown Denver on business.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Delightful Environment and Convenience.,"We flew to Denver and stayed at Black Hawk, about an hour west of Denver for three days.  We returned to Denver to catch the California Zephyr.  We dropped our luggage with the hotel valet and returned the rental car to the airport.  We had a difficult time finding the valet.  We were given the coordinates of the street running parallel to Union Station and an intersecting street that dead ends into Union Station.  The valet station is on the sidewalk across from that corner.  The sign is small and not at all prominent.After dropping the luggage, we returned the rental to the airport.  We walked the short distance to the light rail the travels from the airport to Union Station.  The light rail drops you a short walk from Union Station.  The registration desk is just off the waiting room of the station.  It is inconspicuous, so be on the lookout.   The check-in was brilliantly handled by a pleasant young lady.  Our luggage was waiting in the room.We were assigned a room on the second floor.  The room had been recently renovated, and was tastefully furnished.  The room was small but with all the expected amenities.  We checked our luggage for the next-day train trip that evening.  The next morning, the train was just a short walk.Union Station has a deli, coffee station, and a couple of popular restaurants.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Excellent service, wonderful rooms","This is the nicest place to stay in Denver!

I would highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great room and location,"Loved the Crawford. The room was awesome. They upgraded us to a loft suite.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stately Rooms and Amazing Service,"I had a wonderful stay at the Crawford with my wife several weeks ago. We're from Denver and decided to have ourselves a little ""staycation"" downtown to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the loft-style rooms with cool exposed beams/brick and and hip interior design. It was a stately blend of old and new. On to the service: Upon checking in we were escorted up to our room (via private elevator, no less!) by Mike, one of the concierges. Mike would go on to make sure that our every comfort was taken care of over the next 24 hours. He helped us to make reservations for dinner, reservations for massages the next day, recommended a great bar for after dinner drinks, and even made sure that we had a bottle of champagne in our room to celebrate our anniversary. He was truly one of a kind and seemed to work around the clock too! How surprised we were when we went to check out the next morning and Mike was back again to send us off with a smile :)The Crawford is an amazing hotel in an incredibly vibrant part of town. There are amazing dining options right onsite from casual to fine-dining. We opted for the seafood restaurant that is operated by one of Denver's local celebrity chefs. We also stopped into the Terminal Bar for a casual drink and some shuffleboard. Can't wait to come back again soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great staycation at the Crawford,We had a wonderful staycation at the Crawford. Our room was beautiful and it was great to stay right in the middle of everything downtown. We had only positive interactions with Crawford staff - Mike at the front desk even helped us to track down gluten free pizza close by! Absolutely will come back to decompress from a long week.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great stay at the Crawford,"We had a wonderful stay at the Crawford. The hotel is beautifully decorated for the holidays. We were greeted by Lauren who welcomed us, reviewed all the amenities, sent us to the bar for a ""welcome beer"" while she took our bags up to our room and later made reservations for the hotel Tesla to take us to a nearby holiday party. She has great attention to detail, as does the rest of the staff. The room is beautifully decorated and the entire hotel has a balance between modern rooms and a classic traditional feel through out the rest of the hotel and station. We will make this stay an annual tradition. Thank you.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect weekend retreat,Don't overlook a stay at the Crawford. We booked a small suite in a quiet section of the hotel. Room service for breakfast from the Snooze is the way to go. If you're interested in an evening night cap that's available as well. Great restaurants all around.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great place, great location","Recently stayed here and went to a football game. Very convenient to take the rail from the airport to the hotel at union station. Ate at the kitchen next door and mercantile and both where very good and reasonably priced. The lounges were great to have close by. Overall a very pleasant and unique set up with the hotel, bars, restaurants etc. The rooms are up to date and very comfortable. This will be my first choice in Denver. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A wonderful experience ,"We had a great stay at the Crawford. What a wonderful place to spend a quick stay, a fancy night out, a business trip, or any other trip at all. The service is out of this world with Mike's beautiful face greeting us with a smile, to Dominic being patient with our requests. At every turn they had someone ready to answer questions and help with whatever we wanted. I remember Myles and Cassidy answering questions about what food we might want for dinner around the area. Their knowledge and commitment to service made our stay that much more relaxing. I cannot recommend a better, more accommodating stay than the Crawford. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Embedded Culture in Union Station,"This is a first class hotel catering to the traveler or to those just wanting a romantic getaway.  It occupies floors 2-6 in Union station and is the hub of a very busy downtown district in Denver called LoDo. The hotel itself has roomed elegantly appointed and even at least one with a railroad theme called the Pullman.  Beautifully done and the hotel offers complimentary beers, coffee's, ice creams at close by vendors with the station in addition the use of a Tesla & driver to take you various places. Staff are well informed, dressed to the nines and would fit in any of the worlds' hotels.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Renovated Beauty,"I spent 5 nights at the Crawford during the kick of to the holiday season and it was magical. Being that the hotel is situated in the upper levels of the redone union station, it is nicely decorated and always has an energy going through it, I was lucky enough to stay in one of the Attic rooms. There were exposed beams and plenty of room to move around and not feel cramped. The amenities that the Crawford offered were just what I needed throughout my stay. Sometimes a good cup of coffee was all I needed from Pig train, or a nice scoop of ice cream to end my day as I made my way to my room (both were free because I was staying at the Crawford). The rooms were quiet and you wouldn't know you were staying at a train station until you walked out of the hallways. The front desk staff…",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Simply the best!!!!!!,"I recently returned from a 3 week journey by car. I have again stayed in numerous establishments. The Crawford in all her beauty has by far surpassed any and all expectations. The current holiday decorations provide quite the Christmas spirit. There are multiple places to eat from quick service to full service 5 star restaurants all located within the confines of the magnificent Union Station. I highly recommend any of them. They will not disappoint. But, back to the subject at hand. She is a true beauty. I have previously stayed here and am thoroughly impressed with the rooms. They are spacious and a true delight to enjoy. You must understand, this is not simply a hotel stay, its an experience. The staff is by far the best. They all appear to be hand picked personnel. There are three staff members that stand out, Dominick, Tara and Aaron (I apologize if I have misspelled your names).  These three represent what ALL hospitality professionals should be.  Knowledgeable, kind, genuine and very personable.  You will immediately feel at home.  I am not in anyway intending on taking away from the rest of the staff.  These three are simply exceptional if not the best in their field.  Regardless of the staff member, all guests are treated with the utmost respect, courtesy and compassion.  I truly appreciate not being just another person at the hotel.  I feel more like a house guest, truly treated special.  I can go on and on about all the extra special experiences in store for those who elect to stay here but I will leave that for the next time I have the privilege of staying under her roof.If you have the opportunity to stay here and have the time, there is an available tour that I would highly recommend.    At the risk of sounding like a commercial, I wish to make mention that a courtesy car (a Tesla I might add) is available to take you anywhere within a couple miles and a train directly to and from the airport.  Also, the 16th Street Mall is but a block away, with outstanding shopping and food.   I will be returning to The Crawford Hotel the next opportunity that arises, simply to stay with the best.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Overall great hotel from ambiance to location,"Stayed the hotel for a business mtg and was very impressed on all aspects of my stay from check-in, to room, to service.  Such a visually pleasing place.  Loved the proximity to lots of activity and the selection of different vendor locations in the lobby.  Not to mention the convenience of using the train for the Denver Airport that delivers you right to the door of the hotel!!  Not your typical hotel room, the design is awesome.  I will definitely return!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Experience Ever!,"I don't write reviews unless I am absolutely happy with a service or product.  This hotel and their level of customer service will surpass your expectations.  We had the opportunity to stay 4 nights over the Thanksgiving Weekend and it was a memorable experience.  At check in, we were greeted like valued customers and our bags were immediately loaded onto a cart and taken away to our room.  The room we stayed in is bigger than my condo.  Seriously!  It was not only huge but had a great vibe and cool amenities like an amazing coffee maker, an IPAD, refrigerator and a type of bathroom you would see in a million dollar home.  Our stay came with daily free coffee, beer at the hip Terminal Bar, free scoop of local ice cream, 24 hour access to the gym (which by the way is the nicest gym I've ever been to) and pretty much a personal Tesla Driver.  Yes, your personal Tesla Driver.  What hotel does that?  The location of the hotel is central to everything and you can take the train directly to Denver airport.  Who needs Uber if you have a personal driver and the train? During checkout, the attendant checked to see how busy the airport was.  I didn't even ask.  Go there and experience Denver.  It's well worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"If you're visiting Denver, this is the spot","As a former Denver resident, the transformation of Union Station is truly remarkable and the Crawford Hotel as part of that was really well done.  The hotel was top notch from start to finish and you don't have to go very far for anything.  To start, you can take a 30 min light rail ride from DIA right to the hotel for $9.   Union station now has a great scene with several bars & restaurants including Mercantile Dining & Provisions as well as Snooze.  Both are top notch.  The Crawford Hotel itself has a really cool vibe to it and great service.  I was staying in the Classic Guest Room and it was top notch.   If you make it out of the hotel you're walking distance or a short Uber ride from everything in downtown Denver.   Great spot and looking forward to stopping back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Impressive!,"I really can not think of a negative to staying at The Crawford.  Our girls night out was spent in splendor here and we felt spoiled by the amazing accommodations. The hotel and every one of the employees we encountered were the best! The double queen room that we had was clean and nicely furnished. The location is perfect to get a feel for the LoDo scene. If you want to explore the area in style the hotel provides a driver and a Tesla within roughly 2 miles and we took full advantage of it(Thank you Cameron and Miles!!!) The concierge offers great suggestions for dining and entertainment and we got 5 star treatment at locations where they made reservations for us(especially at Vesta).  A part from The Crawford, Union Station offers plenty of options for gift shopping, eating, and drinking.  The Kitchen Next Door was a good restaurant with healthy options, terminal bar made decent drinks, we never ate at Snooze because it had a 2 hour wait for breakfast.  We are already thinking we'll stay here again for our next girls night out!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,At the hub of activity!,"The Crawford is a comfortable and elegant stay. It is located right at the hub of transportation- I was able to take a bus to Boulder for the day and a train/complimentary bus to Golden for the day. So much to do in the area! The rooms are chic and the beds are dreamy. Included in the daily hotel amenities fee, are free Milkbox Ice Cream, craft beer, Pig Train coffee and a discount at certain restaurants. Had a perfectly wonderful time, staying at the Crawford Hotel and experiencing Colorado!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stunning hotel with amazing service,"We have stayed at The Crawford twice now and one experience has been better than the next.  The rooms are beautiful, chic, clean and full of lovely amenities and the location cannot be beat.  During this visit we actually just spent the entire day in our hotel room and Union Station because there was so much to do and we were enjoying ourselves so much!Dominic at the front desk was absolutely amazing.  He got us into a spectacular corner room, walked us to the room and then called to make sure we were settled in and comfortable. Upon leaving he came to our room, helped us with our luggage and was genuinely pleased we had a good stay and told us to ask for him again by name the next time we stay there and we will!  We will certainly be back and we will ask for Dominic - you should do the same!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,In the lap of luxury,"Recently got to stay at the Crawford in Union Station. We had a loft room that was not only huge but unique. The room was decorated in a sleek modern way, but the beds were sooooo comfortable. Loved being in Union Station. The hotel gives it's guests all kinds of goodies like free ice cream, craft beer, coffee and 25% off at dining establishments. We also got priority seating at Snooze. The hotel staff is top notch. Friendly, welcoming and accommodating. We used the free courtesy car (it's a freaking Tesla!) and the drivers were so charming. With all the bustle in the main hall of the station, our room was super quiet. Everything is just steps away and there is easy access to all kinds of transportation. Stay here for a totally different kind of hotel stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The very best that Denver has to offer!,"In recent years we have visited Denver often and love staying at the Crawford!  The rooms are beautiful and spacious.  The beds are so comfortable that it makes it difficult to get up and begin your day!  The bathrooms are attractively designed and always clean. The large windows provide amazing views and a great spot for people watching up and down the streets. There are many options for dining right in the hotel.  Because the location is so great, you can walk almost anywhere you need to go.  If you need a ride within a 2 mile radius, they have an elegant Tesla courtesy car that will take you and pick you up as need be.  The staff here always exceeds our expectations!  They continually go above and beyond to make sure our stay is the best that it can be.  The lobby is always a bustling place filled with people that seem to be truly enjoying themselves especially while sitting among the elegant Christmas decorations.  We will be back again to stay at the Crawford and highly recommend to everyone!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Make a point to stay here!,"Got off the train at Union Station from the airport,as we waited for our ride we notice The Crawford Hotel in the terminal and was smitten by the beauty of the the whole station. Reserved the Date Night Package, it's a bargain. Dined at The Mercantile and wasn't disappointed,breakfasted at Snooze,great way to start the day. Walked all over the downtown area. So much to do and not have to drive or hunt for parking.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A must for train lovers,"The room was small but comfortable.  I looked at a room advertised as a ""pullman car"" design but it wasn't anything special (maybe there are other ""pullman"" rooms which are more distinctive).  The point of staying at this hotel is not the room itself, but the location, which is the actual original Union Station, with the trains still active.  The atmosphere is worth every penny.  There is a nice list of amenities and free treats from the many really cool restaurants, bar, shops in the station.  The courtesy car will take you around town and to/from events - it's a Tesla!.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Fun, hip, clean, great service","I stayed here for a friends wedding and it was fantastic. It's so convenient to take the lightrail directly from the airport. Great location in Denver: the Crawford is in Union Station, with all the hipster delicacies you could ever want! I'm from San Francisco and i felt right at home. Amazing rooms, free wifi, great service. Five stars for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful hotel retrofitted into a restored historic building,"I had read many positive things about the Crawford and Union Station, so it was my first choice for my visit to Denver for a convention.  Alas, I needed to be a bit closer to the Convention Center, so I had a ""meh"" 5-night stay at the Ritz Carlton Denver, then spent my last night at the Crawford because I wanted to try it out and because I'd be taking the new (opened this year) RTD Light Rail line A to the airport.  My last night by far was the best of my stay.   I am often attracted to hotels that arise in historic or architecturally significant buildings (the Hotel Burnham in Burnham and Root's Reliance Building in Chicago, the Langham Chicago in Mies van der Rohe's IBM Building),  and the Denver Union Station renovation complete with the retrofit of the Crawford Hotel within its historic exoskeleton certainly fits the bill. Union Station has a fantastic location in the vibrant LoDo area of Denver.  Many attractions and eateries are within walking distance.  First opened in 1881, the Station remains a transit hub for Amtrak, RTD buses and Light Rail.  I personally arrived in Denver on Amtrak's California Zephyr from Emeryville, CA.  The Crawford opened about 2 years ago.  The Union Station structure consists of a main building with 2 wings on either side.  The main building has 3 stories, the wings have 2, yet the Crawford has 4 floors.  This is accomplished because the hotel's 2nd floor is actually a mezzanine level over the rear of the 2 wings; the low-ceilinged spaces below are the kitchen areas of retaurants and the Amtrak ticket office and baggage claim.  So the ""second"" floor of the main building and wings are actually the 3rd floor of the hotel, while the hotel's 4th floor is the main building's ""third"" floor and the wing's attic spaces.  This sounds and is confusing--I only figured it out due to my casual interest in architecture and because I did extensive snooping around the hotel's public areas and exterior.  I basically opened whatever door was unlocked or accessible with my room key.   I gained much more admiration for the hotel's design--it truly was a retrofit and a very ingenious one at that.  A prior TA review mentions a hotel tour and tour concierge.  I heard and knew NOTHING about this--I would have been EXTREMELY interested had I known such a thing existed.Union Station is now a clever mix of restaurants, lounges, shops and the Amtrak facilities.  The main building's original waiting area now holds a variety of seating areas and options, plus the Terminal Bar.  Around its periphery are the Crawford Hotel's front desk, 2 shops (check out Bloom), a deli (Acme), a coffee place (Pigtrain), an ice cream shop (Milkbox Ice Creamery), a floral stand, snack stand, tourist desk, and a tapas eatery under construction.  On a balcony over the Terminal Bar is the elegant Cooper Lounge, a fancier retro space where reservations are helpful.The two wings house the complex's table-service restaurants.  On one side there is  the Kitchen Next Door (casual pub/eatery) and Stoic & Genuine (seafood and oyster bar).  On the other side are Snooze-An AM Eatery (wildly popular breakfast and lunch spot) and Mercantile Dining and Provision, which itself it divided into a food shop/casual eatery and a full dinner-only restaurant.  Also on this side is a branch of the Tattered Cover Book Store.  All the table service restaurants plus Pigtrain and Milkbox have outdoor patios.  Note that none of the restaurants have restrooms.  There are HEAVILY used restrooms for all in both wings; in one wing the restrooms are in the basement.The Crawford has 3 basic room types, plus a couple specialty suites.  1)  Pullman rooms are the smallest, all located on the 2nd floor, all facing the train tracks.2) Classic rooms are the most plentiful, located on the 3rd floor main building and wings, and the 4th floor main building.  These Victorian-style rooms all have very high ceilings and face either the front plazas or the train tracks.  They come in Superior, Deluxe and Premium categories based on the size of both the living space and bathroom--I think only the Premiums have a tub.  Note that the  Classic rooms that are in the main building seem less secure that those in the wings because they are accessible by a public staircase used to access the Cooper Lounge, while the wings have additional key-access doors.  These central rooms may be noisier as well, especially those on the 3rd floor, because folks heading to the Cooper Lounge walk right past these rooms.3) Loft rooms occupy the former attic spaces of the wings (4th floor).  As such, these rooms have vaulted ceilings and high windows that are well above eye-level (ie, more for natural light than views).  These rooms also have Superior, Deluxe and Premium categories.  As stated before, the hotel's front desk is really an alcove within the main building; there is no dedicated lobby space.  It seems the folks staffing the desk are concierges and luggage handlers as well--all I encountered were quite friendly in a casual, informal way.  My room was not ready when I checked-in.  I was contacted by phone a short while later while I was finishing a delicious lunch at Stoic & Genuine, which has Happy Hour all day on Sundays.My room was a Pullman room. As stated before these rooms are on the 2nd floor of the wings, really a mezzanine level.  They are accessed by glass-walled hallways that overlook the dining rooms of the 4 table-service restaurants.  While these are the hotel's smallest and least expensive rooms, they are by no means tiny, and the thought put into their design (meant to evoke an old-fashioned luxury train sleeping car) is admirable.  The narrow room is divided into 3 sections:  1) the entry foyer with a table and lamp and well-lit bathroom with sliding door alongside.  The bathroom had a large shower with pump-dispensers for shower gel, shampoo and conditioner by C.O. Bigelow.  A wrapped box set of toiletries for you to take (for a fee) is on the bathroom counter.  2) the sleeping area with a queen bed pushed against the wall (this may be a problem for a couple if the person against the wall needs to use the bathroom), and a large mirrored vanity opposite.  The vanity holds a tablet with hotel information, alarm clock, area information, guest folio info, newspapers, and room service menus and ordering procedures for Snooze and the Kitchen Next Door.   The closet is a wooden armoire with Art Deco doors that houses a too-narrow hanging rod as well as a safe, Nespresso machine, slippers, robe and minifridge with 2 bottles of Voss water.  There is no turndown service.3) a sitting area with a decent-sized desk and chair with floor lamp, plus the window.  A flat-screen TV separates the bedroom from the sitting area, and it swivels so is visible from both areas.There is a nightly $20 ""services and amenities"" fee, which includes:  courtesy transportation within a 2-mile radius in a Tesla, WiFI, the aforementioned daily water and Nespresso machiine, one select craft beer per guest at the Terminal Bar during Happy Hour, one scoop of ice cream per guest per day at Milkbox, one small drip coffee per guest at Pigtrain, priority seating at Snooze (must request one day prior via the front desk), 25% off food and non-alcoholic beverages at Pigtrain, Milkbox, Acme and Terminal Bar, 20% off at Bloom, 10% off at the Flower Kiosk, access to the Oxford Club Fitness Center and classes (this may be in the nearby Oxford Hotel) with discounts on services and merchandise, unlimited local and 800 calls.I personally used enough of these services to justify the $20 fee.   I dined/snacked/shopped at Mercantile, Stoic & Genuine, Acme, Milkbox and Bloom.  I priority-booked for breakfast atSnooze on my day of departure but overslept and didn't make it.  One has so many options without having to ever leave the building.  Overall a fabulous albeit short stay.  Should I return to Denver, the Crawford will be my first choice for lodging.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent service,"Stayed for one night with business. Great spacious rooms, free wifi and perfect service. The location was conveniently close to the station making my trip to the airport so much easier. Have already booked to stay there on the next work trip.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Spectacular hotel in the perfect location!,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it was our first stop on a wonderful tour of Utah and Arizona.  We chose the Crawford due to its positive online reviews and its central location in downtown Denver.  We were not disappointed.  The hotel is located in a historic train station building that contains a plethora of fantastic restaurants and shops.  You can find some awesome food here no doubt!  Also, the rooms were modern, spacious and well appointed.  Not to mention the service of the hotel staff was amazing.  If you're headed to Denver, you should consider this hotel---we highly recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Just Great,A trip to Denver always states off with a night at The Crawford. Great staff and a warm welcome greets everyone there every time. The location is ideal within Union Station. Close to the Cherry Creek path for a run. And convenient to the art museums.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Addendum - prior review,"After posting my previous review of this hotel, the management responded quickly and superbly by discounting our stay and apologizing. Unfortunately at the time, the service was still struggling - we arranged a pick up by the hotel car (a Tesla) from dinner on our last night and then watched the driver pick up a different couple, drive off, and not pick up the phone when we called repeatedly. Even after getting a cab back the hotel car had not yet returned. However, management made sincere efforts to ease the sting of our experience and I hope that if I return to Denver the hotel is everything I believed it can be.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Escape Awaits at the Crawford,"I was fortunate to find this gem of a hotel for my business travel to Denver. The Crawford is conveniently located at the end of a short and pleasant train ride from the airport. You'll then have numerous commute options including a quick walk or courtesy car hop to nearby businesses. The hotel is perfect for work given the excellent sound-proofing in every room and corridor. With the upscale amenities and room service menu, they make it hard to leave the comfort of your room.  You will want to take part in the camaraderie that awaits in the lobby where the selection of food and amenities -all local - is vast and delightful. During my most recent stay, I was able to tour the hotel with Tour Concierge Michael Schmidt - see picture. His knowledge and presentation made the hotel come alive. Ask about an impromptu tour if you miss the scheduled tour days or times. Do treat yourself to this one-of-a-kind hotel experience next time you're in Denver; you'll be glad you did!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anniversary ,"We live in Denver suburbs and love coming downtown for a special night.  The ambience, rooms, restaurants, staff and location make this our favorite downtown destination.  Whether it dinner at The Mercantile or Stoic &a Genuine, drinks at in the lobby bar, breakfast at Snooze or late night coffee and ice cream, this place has it all.  The loft rooms on the 4th floor are unique and beautifully appointed.  There is no noise from the train station when in your room.  If you want to dine outside the hotel there are great restaurants and bars all around Union Station.  This is a must stay property.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved it - So cool to be in Union Station!,"Amazing location, rooms were huge and we loved the decor. The lobby is the terminal of Union Station and it is swanky and fabulous. The Snooze breakfast was delicious and we were so lucky that the concierge got us into a fully packed Mercantile. We loved our stay - everyone was so friendly.  We ordered flowers for a birthday celebration from the in house florist and they were gorgeous and so thoughful.  Thank you, Crawford Hotel.  We will definitely be back.",5
