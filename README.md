Project: Hotel/Hospitality Sentiment Classifier

Stakeholder: Company building a filter for hotel email/social media feeds to recognize low sentiment/upset customers to flag and bring to staff attention. 

End user: Hotel/hospitality industry

Business problem: Customer retention

Business solution:
1) Brand management: Word of mouth repuation is just as important as published reviews. Filter aims to eventually scan twitter, facebook, etc. for mentions of property and flag negative sentiment for staff to address.
2) Email filter: Flag emails containing negative hotel sentiment/issues and flag for quick response by staff. 

Limitations: Proof of concept focused on metro Denver area to keep sites/atractions mentioned consistent.
