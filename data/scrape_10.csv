"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Basic airport lodging,This property is showing its age but it was clean and comfortable and that's really all we cared about. We live in Denver but were scheduled to fly out in a big snowstorm and wanted to be close to the airport the night before. We got a same-day reservation and had a comfortable stay here. There are restaurants nearby and it's a quick 5-7 miles or so to the airport. Breakast is your basic free breakfast. Nothing super great but for an airport hotel it was clean and suited our needs. They do have a shuttle to the hotel and onsite parking for a reasonable price if you want to leave your car there while you are away.,3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Management completely ignoerd my complaint.,"Customer service at the Quality Inn & Suites, Denver International Airport, Denver, Co. is deplorable. I am a 78-year-old Disabled Vietnam War Veteran and have been ignored, first by the General Manager, Mr. Tomo Kentera and then by the parent company Choice Hotels International, Inc, specifically the Mr. Steve Joyce the President and CEO of Choice Hotels which is a very major hotel chain. . In effort to return to California for a family funeral on, I purchased airline tickets for my wife and myself on Wednesday, Sept 7, 2019 for a flight from LaGuardia airport to Los Angeles departing on the same day. The flight was scheduled to depart at 5:15 pm with a plane change in Denver but was cancelled due to severe weather in the New York area. We were rebooked for the next day (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons. The plane finally departed LaGuardia four hours late and arrived in Denver after the connecting flight to Los Angeles had departed.  We were basically stranded after midnight in Denver.  With the help of airline personnel, we found a grossly over-priced room at the Quality Inn & Suites some 10 miles away and checked in after 1:30 am. We finally slept at 2:15 am and arose at 7:00 am to catch our onward flight.  The next morning upon check out I complained about the non-working lighting system in the room to the clerk on duty (Denise) and asked for some sort of compensation. She said she could take down the information and have the lighting problem fixed, which obviously did not help us since we were checking out. I asked to speak to a manager whereupon Denise said there wasn't one available and the General Manager would not be in until 3 pm. She was polite but seemed not to care in the least about any type of solution and did not even apologize for any inconvenience. I asked her again if she was sure the General Manager would not be available until 3 pm and there was no one else who could approve any type some sort of compensation. A few days later I sent an email  to the GM, Mr. Kentera. He did not respond, so I sent a second request five days later – also no response.  After being ignored by Mr. Kentera, I wrote to Mr. Steve Joyce but after two months I never received acknowledgment   of my complaint. I believe I am entitled to, at the very least, a response from someone, anyone, regarding this unprofessional event. It is equally disturbing to be totally ignored – on purpose.… (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons.

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,The word airport shuttle service I’ve ever experienced,"First I want to say that I travel for a living spending 200 + nights a year in choice hotels. I have been a continuous Diamond member since 2004 and in 2017 earned over 1 million points in one calendar year. Over the past 15 years I’ve had a few bad stays and on occasion had to check out and leave a hotel a few minutes after checking in but I’ve never written a bad review. This is the first time I’ve been so aggravated that I’m using this platform to vent.    I arrived at Denver airport and while waiting for my luggage I called the Quality Inn and Suites to inquire where I should go to get the shuttle. This was at 11:41pm. While I was on the phone my bag appeared  and I followed the directions to door 505 island 3 Hotel pickup. This took about 3 minutes from my phone call. I waited approximately 20 minutes and called the front desk again asking if the shuttle was dispatched because only 2 shuttles came by in that time and I asked both drivers if they picked up for my hotel and they said “No”. I waited another 15 minutes and called the hotel again. I explained that it was now over 35 minutes and I was getting aggravated. I asked the clerk to call dispatch and please get them over here. He never gave an explanation or apologized for the inconvenience he told me that the shuttle was white in color and had just dropped off someone. I told him that absolutely no shuttle that was white or said western shuttle per his description had ever come past. This was now almost 12:15am and in this complete time only 3 shuttles came past and none were fir the Quality Inn. After 50 minutes I opened up my Uber app and while I was looking for the address of the hotel the shuttle finally pulled in. The shuttle was clearly marked “western shuttle” and Quality Inn was clearly listed on the side along with all the other hotels. This shuttle was not white but there was no doubt that this shuttle had never driven by. In the 50 minutes that I waited, this was only the 4th shuttle to come down the shuttle lane. I asked the driver why it took 50 + minutes and he said they don’t get dispatched they just drive around and around. I asked again saying that this was the first time he had been thru in 59 minutes and he offered no explanation . When I arrived at the hotel desk I asked the clerk how they could provide such a service. He did not apologize or offer any explanation. I told him that after my second phone call I would expect him to tell me that the circuit they drive picking up and dropping off for multiple hotel can take 45+ minutes. He offered no explanation or apology. I then realized that this clerk had no clue about customer service and how a simple apology could have prevented me from writing this. He then had the nerve to ask me if I needed a shuttle back to the airport in the morning. I just looked at him and told him “ I’ll take Uber“. I was thinking to myself  “this guy told me on 2 of my 3 phone calls that they don’t dispatch the shuttles they just “come around”! now he’s asking me if I need the shuttle in the morning. I place the blame directly on the Hotel Management for having a shuttle system that can have a guest standing at the curb for 50 minutes. I place the blame directly on management for having a hotel clerk that has absolutely no idea about good customer service. If a hotel offers a free shuttle service I would expect to be picked up within 20 minutes and if I call back to inquire About the delay I expect an apology for the inconvenience and if they are using a multi hotel shuttle service to explain that to me so I can decide if I should take Uber. I travel to Denver quite often but have always rented a car. Tonight’s trip was just a layover so no car was needed.  I have stayed in this hotel before and have no complaints about the room or other issues. I will be returning to Denver on the 11th of November for 4 nights and because of this situation I will never stay in this hotel again. Tomorrow I will also copy and past this review directly on the Choice Hotels web site. I hope that this review will prevent just a few customers that need to use the shuttle service to look elsewhere.

The flight was scheduled to depart at 5:15 pm with a plane change in Denver but was cancelled due to severe weather in the New York area.We were rebooked for the next day (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons. The plane finally departed LaGuardia four hours late and arrived in Denver after the connecting flight to Los Angeles had departed.  We were basically stranded after midnight in Denver.  With the help of airline personnel, we found a grossly over-priced room at the Quality Inn & Suites some 10 miles away and checked in after 1:30 am. We finally slept at 2:15 am and arose at 7:00 am to catch our onward flight. The next morning upon check out I complained about the non-working lighting system in the room to the clerk on duty (Denise) and asked for some sort of compensation. She said she could take down the information and have the lighting problem fixed, which obviously did not help us since we were checking out. I asked to speak to a manager whereupon Denise said there wasn't one available and the General Manager would not be in until 3 pm. She was polite but seemed not to care in the least about any type of solution and did not even apologize for any inconvenience. I asked her again if she was sure the General Manager would not be available until 3 pm and there was no one else who could approve any type some sort of compensation. A few days later I sent an email  to the GM, Mr. Kentera. He did not respond, so I sent a second request five days later – also no response. After being ignored by Mr. Kentera, I wrote to Mr. Steve Joyce but after two months I never received acknowledgment   of my complaint. I believe I am entitled to, at the very least, a response from someone, anyone, regarding this unprofessional event. It is equally disturbing to be totally ignored – on purpose.",1
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,The word airport shuttle service I’ve ever experienced,"First I want to say that I travel for a living spending 200 + nights a year in choice hotels. I have been a continuous Diamond member since 2004 and in 2017 earned over 1 million points in one calendar year. Over the past 15 years I’ve had a few bad stays and on occasion had to check out and leave a hotel a few minutes after checking in but I’ve never written a bad review. This is the first time I’ve been so aggravated that I’m using this platform to vent.  I arrived at Denver airport and while waiting for my luggage I called the Quality Inn and Suites to inquire where I should go to get the shuttle. This was at 11:41pm. While I was on the phone my bag appeared  and I followed the directions to door 505 island 3 Hotel pickup. This took about 3 minutes from my phone call. I waited approximately 20 minutes and called the front desk again asking if the shuttle was dispatched because only 2 shuttles came by in that time and I asked both drivers if they picked up for my hotel and they said “No”. I waited another 15 minutes and called the hotel again. I explained that it was now over 35 minutes and I was getting aggravated. I asked the clerk to call dispatch and please get them over here. He never gave an explanation or apologized for the inconvenience he told me that the shuttle was white in color and had just dropped off someone. I told him that absolutely no shuttle that was white or said western shuttle per his description had ever come past. This was now almost 12:15am and in this complete time only 3 shuttles came past and none were fir the Quality Inn. After 50 minutes I opened up my Uber app and while I was looking for the address of the hotel the shuttle finally pulled in. The shuttle was clearly marked “western shuttle” and Quality Inn was clearly listed on the side along with all the other hotels. This shuttle was not white but there was no doubt that this shuttle had never driven by. In the 50 minutes that I waited, this was only the 4th shuttle to come down the shuttle lane. I asked the driver why it took 50 + minutes and he said they don’t get dispatched they just drive around and around. I asked again saying that this was the first time he had been thru in 59 minutes and he offered no explanation . When I arrived at the hotel desk I asked the clerk how they could provide such a service. He did not apologize or offer any explanation. I told him that after my second phone call I would expect him to tell me that the circuit they drive picking up and dropping off for multiple hotel can take 45+ minutes. He offered no explanation or apology. I then realized that this clerk had no clue about customer service and how a simple apology could have prevented me from writing this. He then had the nerve to ask me if I needed a shuttle back to the airport in the morning. I just looked at him and told him “ I’ll take Uber“. I was thinking to myself  “this guy told me on 2 of my 3 phone calls that they don’t dispatch the shuttles they just “come around”! now he’s asking me if I need the shuttle in the morning. I place the blame directly on the Hotel Management for having a shuttle system that can have a guest standing at the curb for 50 minutes. I place the blame directly on management for having a hotel clerk that has absolutely no idea about good customer service. If a hotel offers a free shuttle service I would expect to be picked up within 20 minutes and if I call back to inquire About the delay I expect an apology for the inconvenience and if they are using a multi hotel shuttle service to explain that to me so I can decide if I should take Uber. I travel to Denver quite often but have always rented a car. Tonight’s trip was just a layover so no car was needed.  I have stayed in this hotel before and have no complaints about the room or other issues. I will be returning to Denver on the 11th of November for 4 nights and because of this situation I will never stay in this hotel again. Tomorrow I will also copy and past this review directly on the Choice Hotels web site. I hope that this review will prevent just a few customers that need to use the shuttle service to look elsewhere. Spend your money in another hotel.",1

(Always wear a mask).... Also very friendly staff, my main problem was that I had a scheduled ride back to airport and they never sent my reminder to my phone so I had to pay a uber to give me a ride. Wasn't too happy with that. Also I loved the rooms: they're pretty decent size, clean and well maintained.  DEFINITELY should stay at this hotel again",4
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,A Fabulous experience,"Our stay at Quality Inn & Suites Denver was exceptional. To Mario, Thank you so much for all of your help in our booking, the shuttle, and parking. In all my years of traveling I/we have never had someone take such great care of us. Our room was fabulous, our experience fantabulous.   I have to share that we used to stay at Quality Inns/Comfort Inns all.the time; however we stopped because the customer service and hotels/ rooms were so poor. Our faith was restored a bit by you and your attention to our needs, you are so very appreciated. ",5
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Very convenient to airport,"This hotel seemed very clean and conscientious of covid safety protocol.  I felt safe staying here.  It was close to the airport which was what we needed.  I believe they offer a shuttle but we did not need that.  I was here in 6/2020 and during that time the pool was closed and breakfast was limited to bagel,juice & coffee.  The area around this hotel is nice and there are restaurants, gas stations & discount stores if you need to do any of that kind of thing.

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Good enough for the price,"After a missed connection I ended up here via my airline's helpline. There was a shuttle, which was helpful getting there along with a bunch of other stranded travelers. There were two clerks at the desk, one super helpful and quick, and the one who helped me, not so much. Shuttle times were extremely limited, especially considering the number of people stranded. The room was clean, but showing its age. By the time I got there, I was just glad not to be sleeping on the floor at DIA.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Basic airport lodging,This property is showing its age but it was clean and comfortable and that's really all we cared about. We live in Denver but were scheduled to fly out in a big snowstorm and wanted to be close to the airport the night before. We got a same-day reservation and had a comfortable stay here. There are restaurants nearby and it's a quick 5-7 miles or so to the airport. Breakast is your basic free breakfast. Nothing super great but for an airport hotel it was clean and suited our needs. They do have a shuttle to the hotel and onsite parking for a reasonable price if you want to leave your car there while you are away.,3

We have four. They allowed her to check in with the 4 dogs but informed her of the $200 fee plus taxes.Could not reason with either Hotwire or Quality Inn, and ended up paying the $200 plus $16 tax.

Tried to talk to management, Peter was no help at all. Hot tub and pool smell like a mix of bad body odour and old socks. Rooms reek like old cigarettes covered up by car air fresheners despite it saying non smoking. Pick any other hotel in the area for the same price, avoid at all costs.",1

We spent one night ahead of our trip tell.   The women who took our reservation over the phone with extremely helpful and follow through with our special request.  Nice and comfortable room. Simple breakfast.  One word of advice is make sure when you're taking the shuttle to United Airlines you understand where you're being dropped off.  For departures you want the West side and the shuttle driver said they only drop off on the east side.  We had too much luggage to haul across the terminal.  The driver was extremely helpful since no one else was on the bus and accommodated our request.  Double-check your arrival location as well. We had to wait 30 minutes for the shuttle in 28°,4

Convenient to airport. The big problem was parking. As in there was none for customers as they rent out parking short term for airport parking. This would be fine if they had extra parking available, but they do not. They had us and many others parking in ALL of the fire lanes, which is not only illegal, but inconvenient for us and a hazard should a fire truck actually be needed.

Once assigned a room we opened the door to see that the room was not made up so went  back down to the lobby and had to wait in line again.  One of the housekeeping staff expressed frustration to my wife about rooms being assigned and keys issued before the rooms are ready so apparently this has happened to other guests.We were given a different room that had two queen beds rather than the reserved king but was not going to make another trip to the desk so just accepted the room.The beds were comfortable and the A/C worked well.  The lighting in the room was minimal and the bathroom was small and not well designed, including the faucet at the sink. The towels were thin.Staff was ok but not overly friendly, except for the desk clerk who was nice.Breakfast consisted of eggs, sausage, cereals, fruit, donuts and pastries.  There was not a lot of seating but we were there at opening time so not an issue for us.For a one night stay wanting to be close to the airport this hotel was ok, but with so many hotels in the area we would probably look elsewhere for a future stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,GOOD FOR OVERNIGHT,"I was brought to this hotel for a layover. The desk clerks were very friendly. They provided us with personal items since our luggage was on the way to Vegas. The rooms were spacious and clean. However, the hotel could use some updating. The elevator space looked like it used to be a hall closet. Because we had to leave so early, we didn't get to experience the entire continental breakfast, but the juice and donut I had was okay. This hotel is great if you are looking for a place that is close to the airport and doesn't break the bank.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Decent motel,"Nice friendly staff. Our 3:00am check in after the eclipse was no problem. The room (a suite) was very spacious but a bit run down, but fine for a one night stay. There was in room coffee and a fridge as well as an included breakfast near the lobby.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Don’t waste your money,"It took us 35 mins just to check in as only 1 person was working, a/c leaked, toilet was leaking, table in room fell over when my child went to eat, blower dryer didn’t work.        Won’t stay again, parking sucked as they let people keep their cars here as they fly.",1
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Good enough for the price,"After a missed connection I ended up here via my airline's helpline.

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Basic airport lodging,This property is showing its age but it was clean and comfortable and that's really all we cared about. We live in Denver but were scheduled to fly out in a big snowstorm and wanted to be close to the airport the night before. We got a same-day reservation and had a comfortable stay here. There are restaurants nearby and it's a quick 5-7 miles or so to the airport. Breakast is your basic free breakfast. Nothing super great but for an airport hotel it was clean and suited our needs. They do have a shuttle to the hotel and onsite parking for a reasonable price if you want to leave your car there while you are away.,3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Management completely ignoerd my complaint.,"Customer service at the Quality Inn & Suites, Denver International Airport, Denver, Co. is deplorable. I am a 78-year-old Disabled Vietnam War Veteran and have been ignored, first by the General Manager, Mr. Tomo Kentera and then by the parent company Choice Hotels International, Inc, specifically the Mr. Steve Joyce the President and CEO of Choice Hotels which is a very major hotel chain. . In effort to return to California for a family funeral on, I purchased airline tickets for my wife and myself on Wednesday, Sept 7, 2019 for a flight from LaGuardia airport to Los Angeles departing on the same day. The flight was scheduled to depart at 5:15 pm with a plane change in Denver but was cancelled due to severe weather in the New York area. We were rebooked for the next day (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons. The plane finally departed LaGuardia four hours late and arrived in Denver after the connecting flight to Los Angeles had departed.  We were basically stranded after midnight in Denver.  With the help of airline personnel, we found a grossly over-priced room at the Quality Inn & Suites some 10 miles away and checked in after 1:30 am. We finally slept at 2:15 am and arose at 7:00 am to catch our onward flight.  The next morning upon check out I complained about the non-working lighting system in the room to the clerk on duty (Denise) and asked for some sort of compensation. She said she could take down the information and have the lighting problem fixed, which obviously did not help us since we were checking out. I asked to speak to a manager whereupon Denise said there wasn't one available and the General Manager would not be in until 3 pm. She was polite but seemed not to care in the least about any type of solution and did not even apologize for any inconvenience. I asked her again if she was sure the General Manager would not be available until 3 pm and there was no one else who could approve any type some sort of compensation. A few days later I sent an email  to the GM, Mr. Kentera. He did not respond, so I sent a second request five days later – also no response.  After being ignored by Mr. Kentera, I wrote to Mr. Steve Joyce but after two months I never received acknowledgment   of my complaint. I believe I am entitled to, at the very least, a response from someone, anyone, regarding this unprofessional event. It is equally disturbing to be totally ignored – on purpose.… (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons.

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,The word airport shuttle service I’ve ever experienced,"First I want to say that I travel for a living spending 200 + nights a year in choice hotels. I have been a continuous Diamond member since 2004 and in 2017 earned over 1 million points in one calendar year. Over the past 15 years I’ve had a few bad stays and on occasion had to check out and leave a hotel a few minutes after checking in but I’ve never written a bad review. This is the first time I’ve been so aggravated that I’m using this platform to vent.    I arrived at Denver airport and while waiting for my luggage I called the Quality Inn and Suites to inquire where I should go to get the shuttle. This was at 11:41pm. While I was on the phone my bag appeared  and I followed the directions to door 505 island 3 Hotel pickup. This took about 3 minutes from my phone call. I waited approximately 20 minutes and called the front desk again asking if the shuttle was dispatched because only 2 shuttles came by in that time and I asked both drivers if they picked up for my hotel and they said “No”. I waited another 15 minutes and called the hotel again. I explained that it was now over 35 minutes and I was getting aggravated. I asked the clerk to call dispatch and please get them over here. He never gave an explanation or apologized for the inconvenience he told me that the shuttle was white in color and had just dropped off someone. I told him that absolutely no shuttle that was white or said western shuttle per his description had ever come past. This was now almost 12:15am and in this complete time only 3 shuttles came past and none were fir the Quality Inn. After 50 minutes I opened up my Uber app and while I was looking for the address of the hotel the shuttle finally pulled in. The shuttle was clearly marked “western shuttle” and Quality Inn was clearly listed on the side along with all the other hotels. This shuttle was not white but there was no doubt that this shuttle had never driven by. In the 50 minutes that I waited, this was only the 4th shuttle to come down the shuttle lane. I asked the driver why it took 50 + minutes and he said they don’t get dispatched they just drive around and around. I asked again saying that this was the first time he had been thru in 59 minutes and he offered no explanation . When I arrived at the hotel desk I asked the clerk how they could provide such a service. He did not apologize or offer any explanation. I told him that after my second phone call I would expect him to tell me that the circuit they drive picking up and dropping off for multiple hotel can take 45+ minutes. He offered no explanation or apology. I then realized that this clerk had no clue about customer service and how a simple apology could have prevented me from writing this. He then had the nerve to ask me if I needed a shuttle back to the airport in the morning. I just looked at him and told him “ I’ll take Uber“. I was thinking to myself  “this guy told me on 2 of my 3 phone calls that they don’t dispatch the shuttles they just “come around”! now he’s asking me if I need the shuttle in the morning. I place the blame directly on the Hotel Management for having a shuttle system that can have a guest standing at the curb for 50 minutes. I place the blame directly on management for having a hotel clerk that has absolutely no idea about good customer service. If a hotel offers a free shuttle service I would expect to be picked up within 20 minutes and if I call back to inquire About the delay I expect an apology for the inconvenience and if they are using a multi hotel shuttle service to explain that to me so I can decide if I should take Uber. I travel to Denver quite often but have always rented a car. Tonight’s trip was just a layover so no car was needed.  I have stayed in this hotel before and have no complaints about the room or other issues. I will be returning to Denver on the 11th of November for 4 nights and because of this situation I will never stay in this hotel again. Tomorrow I will also copy and past this review directly on the Choice Hotels web site. I hope that this review will prevent just a few customers that need to use the shuttle service to look elsewhere.

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,"Good room, Ok Service, Shuttle is a Joke",I arrived in DEN and called the hotel to arrange the shuttle from the airport. The front desk said it would be about 20-25 minutes so I waited. 30 minutes passed and I called and he finally said that the shuttle should have been there and that the driver said had be there 10 minutes ago. What the front desk failed to tell me is that they use a contractor for their shuttle service and that it didn't say quality inn on the side of it. The front desk said he would call again. So another 30 minutes passed and the shuttle finally arrived but it was filled with people going to other hotels. The driver said I would fit and took my bag. I went to the door and there was not a seat open. The driver told me to stand in the small aisle of the van. Not a bus but a small van!!!!! I said no and that I would feel unsafe. The driver became very irritated and angry that I wouldn't do this and that he would have to unload my bag for me to take it. He gave me my bag and I ended up taking a $16 lyft. I got there and the front desk man was very nice and claimed they would reimburse me ( still hasn't happened). Check in was a breeze and the room was very nice. I stayed in a suite and it was gigantic for a hotel room. The bed was comfortable and the room looked very clean. Overall I would have loved the property but the arrival experience with the shuttle forces me to reconsider my accommodations when I come back to DEN. Would not recommend because management hasn't even reached out about the concerns.,2
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Average Choice,My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel prior to an early morning flight.The hotel advertised that check in began at 3 pm yet when we checked in at 3:30 we had to wait twenty minutes in the lobby for our room to be ready.The employees at the front desk seemed distant and not attentive.Our King Suite was large but the flat screen TV was placed ninety degrees from the bed which made it difficult to watch from the bed. The pillows were thin.Our room faced Tower road and the traffic noise was loud all night.The breakfast was a good selection but the eggs were cold.We will stay elsewhere for our next early morning flight.,3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Perfect for staying near the airport,"This is a perfect place to stay of you have an early morning flight and don't live near Denver. The shuttle is convenient and is cheaper than parking your car at one of the airport lots. The rooms were roomy for a family with kids and is friendly to those on a budget. Beyond that, it won't wow you, but works for its purpose.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Worst Hotel Service Ever,"Can I give this Hotel a zero rating? We were late due to a United fiasco that caused us to miss our connecting flight. I made what I THOUGHT was a reservation. We called for the shuttle & were bumped as it was too full. The driver said another would be around in 10 minutes. Ten minutes later we call the hotel and the clerk said said 15 minutes. We sat for an hour or more. Finally, after getting very upset & calling the hotel for about the 4th time, the clerk informed me that they were shuttling for another hotel I will admit I lost my cool then asked why. I was told they were full . WTH?  I had a reservation...with a confirmation number.  She told me that wasn't their reservation, but the airlines reservation. Again, WTH?Once the van did arrive, I jumped on hurriedly & the driver said to calm down as there was another shuttle right behind him. I replied, ""Yeah right"" (I'd waited an hour for Pete sake) and he asked if I wanted a ride or not. BTW, the other shuttle just drove on by. I called the airline hotel voucher people who finally investigated enough to tell me the Quality Inn had oversold their rooms & we were being sent to another hotel. So honestly, I can't speak to the quality of the ""Inn"" only to the quality of their customer service, which frankly, is terrible. Now, before you think, ""she's just an angry woman who is probably never satisfied, check out my other reviews. I'm a 4 & 5 star review kind of girl. So trust me when I tell you it was awful.",1
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,1 night stay on way to airport,"We stayed here for the night on the way to the airport.  There is a free shuttle to and from the airport, but the shuttle is NOT labeled so if you are expecting to see it and know that's the one you what, you'll need to ask.  The one we had was a black van with no markings.  Early flight so we did not get to eat breakfast.  Bathrooms were very cramped, almost to the point where you had to stand in the corner while opening the door to get out.  Beds were comfortable though.  Internet Wi-Fi didn't seem to be working, limited bandwidth?  Fridge in the room, but no microwave.  There is one in the lobby though.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Don’t waste your money,"It took us 35 mins just to check in as only 1 person was working, a/c leaked, toilet was leaking, table in room fell over when my child went to eat, blower dryer didn’t work.        Won’t stay again, parking sucked as they let people keep their cars here as they fly.",1

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Great experience,"Shuttle to pick you up from airport.   Clean, welcoming,  helpful staff.  Close enough to restaurants to walk.  The whole neighborhood feels very safe.  The staff will make you comfortable and will  resolve any problems and answer any question",5
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,New Memories,"Very clean place. As soon as you walk in building the front desk are on it when it comes to the Coronavirus. (Always wear a mask).... Also very friendly staff, my main problem was that I had a scheduled ride back to airport and they never sent my reminder to my phone so I had to pay a uber to give me a ride. Wasn't too happy with that. Also I loved the rooms: they're pretty decent size, clean and well maintained.  DEFINITELY should stay at this hotel again",4
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,A Fabulous experience,"Our stay at Quality Inn & Suites Denver was exceptional. To Mario, Thank you so much for all of your help in our booking, the shuttle, and parking. In all my years of traveling I/we have never had someone take such great care of us. Our room was fabulous, our experience fantabulous.   I have to share that we used to stay at Quality Inns/Comfort Inns all.the time; however we stopped because the customer service and hotels/ rooms were so poor. Our faith was restored a bit by you and your attention to our needs, you are so very appreciated. ",5
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Very convenient to airport,"This hotel seemed very clean and conscientious of covid safety protocol.  I felt safe staying here.  It was close to the airport which was what we needed.  I believe they offer a shuttle but we did not need that.  I was here in 6/2020 and during that time the pool was closed and breakfast was limited to bagel,juice & coffee.  The area around this hotel is nice and there are restaurants, gas stations & discount stores if you need to do any of that kind of thing.  The staff were friendly and all was fine w/ our stay during the time of covid.",5

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Good enough for the price,"After a missed connection I ended up here via my airline's helpline. There was a shuttle, which was helpful getting there along with a bunch of other stranded travelers. There were two clerks at the desk, one super helpful and quick, and the one who helped me, not so much. Shuttle times were extremely limited, especially considering the number of people stranded. The room was clean, but showing its age. By the time I got there, I was just glad not to be sleeping on the floor at DIA.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Basic airport lodging,This property is showing its age but it was clean and comfortable and that's really all we cared about. We live in Denver but were scheduled to fly out in a big snowstorm and wanted to be close to the airport the night before. We got a same-day reservation and had a comfortable stay here. There are restaurants nearby and it's a quick 5-7 miles or so to the airport. Breakast is your basic free breakfast. Nothing super great but for an airport hotel it was clean and suited our needs. They do have a shuttle to the hotel and onsite parking for a reasonable price if you want to leave your car there while you are away.,3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Management completely ignoerd my complaint.,"Customer service at the Quality Inn & Suites, Denver International Airport, Denver, Co. is deplorable. I am a 78-year-old Disabled Vietnam War Veteran and have been ignored, first by the General Manager, Mr. Tomo Kentera and then by the parent company Choice Hotels International, Inc, specifically the Mr. Steve Joyce the President and CEO of Choice Hotels which is a very major hotel chain. . In effort to return to California for a family funeral on, I purchased airline tickets for my wife and myself on Wednesday, Sept 7, 2019 for a flight from LaGuardia airport to Los Angeles departing on the same day. The flight was scheduled to depart at 5:15 pm with a plane change in Denver but was cancelled due to severe weather in the New York area. We were rebooked for the next day (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons. The plane finally departed LaGuardia four hours late and arrived in Denver after the connecting flight to Los Angeles had departed.  We were basically stranded after midnight in Denver.  With the help of airline personnel, we found a grossly over-priced room at the Quality Inn & Suites some 10 miles away and checked in after 1:30 am. We finally slept at 2:15 am and arose at 7:00 am to catch our onward flight.  The next morning upon check out I complained about the non-working lighting system in the room to the clerk on duty (Denise) and asked for some sort of compensation. She said she could take down the information and have the lighting problem fixed, which obviously did not help us since we were checking out. I asked to speak to a manager whereupon Denise said there wasn't one available and the General Manager would not be in until 3 pm. She was polite but seemed not to care in the least about any type of solution and did not even apologize for any inconvenience. I asked her again if she was sure the General Manager would not be available until 3 pm and there was no one else who could approve any type some sort of compensation. A few days later I sent an email  to the GM, Mr. Kentera. He did not respond, so I sent a second request five days later – also no response.  After being ignored by Mr. Kentera, I wrote to Mr. Steve Joyce but after two months I never received acknowledgment   of my complaint. I believe I am entitled to, at the very least, a response from someone, anyone, regarding this unprofessional event. It is equally disturbing to be totally ignored – on purpose.… (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons.

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,The word airport shuttle service I’ve ever experienced,"First I want to say that I travel for a living spending 200 + nights a year in choice hotels. I have been a continuous Diamond member since 2004 and in 2017 earned over 1 million points in one calendar year. Over the past 15 years I’ve had a few bad stays and on occasion had to check out and leave a hotel a few minutes after checking in but I’ve never written a bad review. This is the first time I’ve been so aggravated that I’m using this platform to vent.    I arrived at Denver airport and while waiting for my luggage I called the Quality Inn and Suites to inquire where I should go to get the shuttle. This was at 11:41pm. While I was on the phone my bag appeared  and I followed the directions to door 505 island 3 Hotel pickup. This took about 3 minutes from my phone call. I waited approximately 20 minutes and called the front desk again asking if the shuttle was dispatched because only 2 shuttles came by in that time and I asked both drivers if they picked up for my hotel and they said “No”. I waited another 15 minutes and called the hotel again. I explained that it was now over 35 minutes and I was getting aggravated. I asked the clerk to call dispatch and please get them over here. He never gave an explanation or apologized for the inconvenience he told me that the shuttle was white in color and had just dropped off someone. I told him that absolutely no shuttle that was white or said western shuttle per his description had ever come past. This was now almost 12:15am and in this complete time only 3 shuttles came past and none were fir the Quality Inn. After 50 minutes I opened up my Uber app and while I was looking for the address of the hotel the shuttle finally pulled in. The shuttle was clearly marked “western shuttle” and Quality Inn was clearly listed on the side along with all the other hotels. This shuttle was not white but there was no doubt that this shuttle had never driven by. In the 50 minutes that I waited, this was only the 4th shuttle to come down the shuttle lane. I asked the driver why it took 50 + minutes and he said they don’t get dispatched they just drive around and around. I asked again saying that this was the first time he had been thru in 59 minutes and he offered no explanation . When I arrived at the hotel desk I asked the clerk how they could provide such a service. He did not apologize or offer any explanation. I told him that after my second phone call I would expect him to tell me that the circuit they drive picking up and dropping off for multiple hotel can take 45+ minutes. He offered no explanation or apology. I then realized that this clerk had no clue about customer service and how a simple apology could have prevented me from writing this. He then had the nerve to ask me if I needed a shuttle back to the airport in the morning. I just looked at him and told him “ I’ll take Uber“. I was thinking to myself  “this guy told me on 2 of my 3 phone calls that they don’t dispatch the shuttles they just “come around”! now he’s asking me if I need the shuttle in the morning. I place the blame directly on the Hotel Management for having a shuttle system that can have a guest standing at the curb for 50 minutes. I place the blame directly on management for having a hotel clerk that has absolutely no idea about good customer service. If a hotel offers a free shuttle service I would expect to be picked up within 20 minutes and if I call back to inquire About the delay I expect an apology for the inconvenience and if they are using a multi hotel shuttle service to explain that to me so I can decide if I should take Uber. I travel to Denver quite often but have always rented a car. Tonight’s trip was just a layover so no car was needed.  I have stayed in this hotel before and have no complaints about the room or other issues. I will be returning to Denver on the 11th of November for 4 nights and because of this situation I will never stay in this hotel again. Tomorrow I will also copy and past this review directly on the Choice Hotels web site. I hope that this review will prevent just a few customers that need to use the shuttle service to look elsewhere.

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,ONLY ONE COMPLAINT,"We were upgraded to a suite, so I can't attest to rest of rooms, but ours was beautifully decorated and spacious. This property has a very friendly staff and decent breakfast. Please note that the airport transportation can be confusing...there are 2 sides to the Denver airport and we waited on the wrong one for a long time. Caught a shuttle ride with another company because of this. Only complaint was our room faced a major thoroughfare, it was very noisy.",4
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Overnight stay ,"Very nice hotel for an overnight stay while awaiting our flight next morning.  Very nice, clean and spacious room with a very comfortable king size bed.Good breakfast and coffee available 24/7.  Close to a number of decent eateries as well.  All in all, I’d book into this hotel again whenever I’m in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Ok,"I stayed here for one night. The staff was friendly. The room was average. The hairdryer didn't work, but they did bring me a new one right away. I didn't have the breakfast in the morning so I can't report on that. It is close to the airport, which is convenient.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Works for overnight airport stay,"The staff and service at the hotel was excellent. The hotel itself is a little tired. All of the ice machines were broken (yes I checked every floor). The room was nice, comfortable and clean. We did check the beds and no issues. We didn't try the breakfast so I can't comment but the area looked nice enough.Just to be clear, even though the hotel was a little tired it wasn't bad. I'd stay there again and I liked it well enough.Things I wasn't thrilled with...we couldn't figure out the TV and living in a house that has a very complicated system I was surprised my electronics experts couldn't get it to work. The shuttle... it gets a big thumbs down. The hotels share a shuttle and the workers obviously don't care. We got there at midnight and waited a long time for a shuttle and then the driver was fussing because we had too much luggage and wanted us to wait another 20 minutes for the next one. I'll manage my flight schedules better next time so we aren't there so late.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Felt like Sardines!,"We stayed at this Quality Inn & Suites on arrival from the Denver airport and then again a week later for a return flight.  This hotel is very convenient for rental car lots and the Denver airport.  It is an older hotel and showing some wear.  On both occasions our two queen rooms were very small with no place to put open luggage except on the beds.  The bathroom was so small you had to lean into the tub/toilet to get the door all the way open so you could get out, and the door didn't lock. The tub didn't drain properly, filled up the tub while we showered.  Took us over half an hour and two calls to the desk to get the TV working.   Beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Wifi was good.  Dead bolt on the door wouldn't work, so we propped suitcases against the door. We are rewards members for this chain and were staying on rewards points, so we may have been given the worst of the rooms; however, these were the smallest rooms we've ever had with Choice Hotels.  Fine for one person, but there were three of us and it was really cramped.  We certainly won't stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Dirty Bed & Dirty Non Functioning Shower,"We arrived late and were tired. Pulled back the covers on bed 1 and found a dirty sheet, dirty as in visibly soiled. Tried bed 2 and it was fine. We went to take showers in the morning but found tub dirty including pubic hair. Tried to clean tub but the drain was not functioning and would not drain water. Complained at front desk but they were unsympathetic and did not act surprised. Wrote at letter of complaint and sent photos but the letter was never answered. Filled in an on line survey, received a reply from Mr. David Kang on July 24, 2015, apologizing and promising a fuller reply and an offer of compensation by latest July 27. I sent one reminder because the fuller response never materialized and today decided everyone who considers this hotel should know our experience.",1
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Stayed overnight prior to early flight - and parked car,"Stayed overnight due to an early flight the next morning.  Room was fine for what we needed - overall, was clean, beds were adequate, breakfast was the usual breakfast bar.  Parked our car for 4 days.   Only snafu was we got home at 11:00 pm, shuttles run every 30 minutes, and the first one was full.  Ended up taking a cab back to the property.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Efficient and affordable,"Nice staff. Location was easy to find. But the wifi wasn't working and the evening manager was no help. I finally got a tech support number to call and after he did all he could to help, he had to put a call into Comcast. After 15 minutes we had wifi. The rooms were clean and the family enjoyed the pool.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Don’t waste your money,"It took us 35 mins just to check in as only 1 person was working, a/c leaked, toilet was leaking, table in room fell over when my child went to eat, blower dryer didn’t work.        Won’t stay again, parking sucked as they let people keep their cars here as they fly.",1
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Good enough for the price,"After a missed connection I ended up here via my airline's helpline. There was a shuttle, which was helpful getting there along with a bunch of other stranded travelers. There were two clerks at the desk, one super helpful and quick, and the one who helped me, not so much. Shuttle times were extremely limited, especially considering the number of people stranded. The room was clean, but showing its age. By the time I got there, I was just glad not to be sleeping on the floor at DIA.",3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Basic airport lodging,This property is showing its age but it was clean and comfortable and that's really all we cared about. We live in Denver but were scheduled to fly out in a big snowstorm and wanted to be close to the airport the night before. We got a same-day reservation and had a comfortable stay here. There are restaurants nearby and it's a quick 5-7 miles or so to the airport. Breakast is your basic free breakfast. Nothing super great but for an airport hotel it was clean and suited our needs. They do have a shuttle to the hotel and onsite parking for a reasonable price if you want to leave your car there while you are away.,3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Management completely ignoerd my complaint.,"Customer service at the Quality Inn & Suites, Denver International Airport, Denver, Co. is deplorable. I am a 78-year-old Disabled Vietnam War Veteran and have been ignored, first by the General Manager, Mr. Tomo Kentera and then by the parent company Choice Hotels International, Inc, specifically the Mr. Steve Joyce the President and CEO of Choice Hotels which is a very major hotel chain. . In effort to return to California for a family funeral on, I purchased airline tickets for my wife and myself on Wednesday, Sept 7, 2019 for a flight from LaGuardia airport to Los Angeles departing on the same day. The flight was scheduled to depart at 5:15 pm with a plane change in Denver but was cancelled due to severe weather in the New York area. We were rebooked for the next day (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons. The plane finally departed LaGuardia four hours late and arrived in Denver after the connecting flight to Los Angeles had departed.  We were basically stranded after midnight in Denver.  With the help of airline personnel, we found a grossly over-priced room at the Quality Inn & Suites some 10 miles away and checked in after 1:30 am. We finally slept at 2:15 am and arose at 7:00 am to catch our onward flight.  The next morning upon check out I complained about the non-working lighting system in the room to the clerk on duty (Denise) and asked for some sort of compensation. She said she could take down the information and have the lighting problem fixed, which obviously did not help us since we were checking out. I asked to speak to a manager whereupon Denise said there wasn't one available and the General Manager would not be in until 3 pm. She was polite but seemed not to care in the least about any type of solution and did not even apologize for any inconvenience. I asked her again if she was sure the General Manager would not be available until 3 pm and there was no one else who could approve any type some sort of compensation. A few days later I sent an email  to the GM, Mr. Kentera. He did not respond, so I sent a second request five days later – also no response.  After being ignored by Mr. Kentera, I wrote to Mr. Steve Joyce but after two months I never received acknowledgment   of my complaint. I believe I am entitled to, at the very least, a response from someone, anyone, regarding this unprofessional event. It is equally disturbing to be totally ignored – on purpose.… (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons.

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,The word airport shuttle service I’ve ever experienced,"First I want to say that I travel for a living spending 200 + nights a year in choice hotels. I have been a continuous Diamond member since 2004 and in 2017 earned over 1 million points in one calendar year. Over the past 15 years I’ve had a few bad stays and on occasion had to check out and leave a hotel a few minutes after checking in but I’ve never written a bad review. This is the first time I’ve been so aggravated that I’m using this platform to vent.    I arrived at Denver airport and while waiting for my luggage I called the Quality Inn and Suites to inquire where I should go to get the shuttle. This was at 11:41pm. While I was on the phone my bag appeared  and I followed the directions to door 505 island 3 Hotel pickup. This took about 3 minutes from my phone call. I waited approximately 20 minutes and called the front desk again asking if the shuttle was dispatched because only 2 shuttles came by in that time and I asked both drivers if they picked up for my hotel and they said “No”. I waited another 15 minutes and called the hotel again. I explained that it was now over 35 minutes and I was getting aggravated. I asked the clerk to call dispatch and please get them over here. He never gave an explanation or apologized for the inconvenience he told me that the shuttle was white in color and had just dropped off someone. I told him that absolutely no shuttle that was white or said western shuttle per his description had ever come past. This was now almost 12:15am and in this complete time only 3 shuttles came past and none were fir the Quality Inn. After 50 minutes I opened up my Uber app and while I was looking for the address of the hotel the shuttle finally pulled in. The shuttle was clearly marked “western shuttle” and Quality Inn was clearly listed on the side along with all the other hotels. This shuttle was not white but there was no doubt that this shuttle had never driven by. In the 50 minutes that I waited, this was only the 4th shuttle to come down the shuttle lane. I asked the driver why it took 50 + minutes and he said they don’t get dispatched they just drive around and around. I asked again saying that this was the first time he had been thru in 59 minutes and he offered no explanation . When I arrived at the hotel desk I asked the clerk how they could provide such a service. He did not apologize or offer any explanation. I told him that after my second phone call I would expect him to tell me that the circuit they drive picking up and dropping off for multiple hotel can take 45+ minutes. He offered no explanation or apology. I then realized that this clerk had no clue about customer service and how a simple apology could have prevented me from writing this. He then had the nerve to ask me if I needed a shuttle back to the airport in the morning. I just looked at him and told him “ I’ll take Uber“. I was thinking to myself  “this guy told me on 2 of my 3 phone calls that they don’t dispatch the shuttles they just “come around”! now he’s asking me if I need the shuttle in the morning. I place the blame directly on the Hotel Management for having a shuttle system that can have a guest standing at the curb for 50 minutes. I place the blame directly on management for having a hotel clerk that has absolutely no idea about good customer service. If a hotel offers a free shuttle service I would expect to be picked up within 20 minutes and if I call back to inquire About the delay I expect an apology for the inconvenience and if they are using a multi hotel shuttle service to explain that to me so I can decide if I should take Uber. I travel to Denver quite often but have always rented a car. Tonight’s trip was just a layover so no car was needed.  I have stayed in this hotel before and have no complaints about the room or other issues. I will be returning to Denver on the 11th of November for 4 nights and because of this situation I will never stay in this hotel again. Tomorrow I will also copy and past this review directly on the Choice Hotels web site. I hope that this review will prevent just a few customers that need to use the shuttle service to look elsewhere.

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Basic airport lodging,This property is showing its age but it was clean and comfortable and that's really all we cared about. We live in Denver but were scheduled to fly out in a big snowstorm and wanted to be close to the airport the night before. We got a same-day reservation and had a comfortable stay here. There are restaurants nearby and it's a quick 5-7 miles or so to the airport. Breakast is your basic free breakfast. Nothing super great but for an airport hotel it was clean and suited our needs. They do have a shuttle to the hotel and onsite parking for a reasonable price if you want to leave your car there while you are away.,3
"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,Management completely ignoerd my complaint.,"Customer service at the Quality Inn & Suites, Denver International Airport, Denver, Co. is deplorable. I am a 78-year-old Disabled Vietnam War Veteran and have been ignored, first by the General Manager, Mr. Tomo Kentera and then by the parent company Choice Hotels International, Inc, specifically the Mr. Steve Joyce the President and CEO of Choice Hotels which is a very major hotel chain. . In effort to return to California for a family funeral on, I purchased airline tickets for my wife and myself on Wednesday, Sept 7, 2019 for a flight from LaGuardia airport to Los Angeles departing on the same day. The flight was scheduled to depart at 5:15 pm with a plane change in Denver but was cancelled due to severe weather in the New York area. We were rebooked for the next day (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons. The plane finally departed LaGuardia four hours late and arrived in Denver after the connecting flight to Los Angeles had departed.  We were basically stranded after midnight in Denver.  With the help of airline personnel, we found a grossly over-priced room at the Quality Inn & Suites some 10 miles away and checked in after 1:30 am. We finally slept at 2:15 am and arose at 7:00 am to catch our onward flight.  The next morning upon check out I complained about the non-working lighting system in the room to the clerk on duty (Denise) and asked for some sort of compensation. She said she could take down the information and have the lighting problem fixed, which obviously did not help us since we were checking out. I asked to speak to a manager whereupon Denise said there wasn't one available and the General Manager would not be in until 3 pm. She was polite but seemed not to care in the least about any type of solution and did not even apologize for any inconvenience. I asked her again if she was sure the General Manager would not be available until 3 pm and there was no one else who could approve any type some sort of compensation. A few days later I sent an email  to the GM, Mr. Kentera. He did not respond, so I sent a second request five days later – also no response.  After being ignored by Mr. Kentera, I wrote to Mr. Steve Joyce but after two months I never received acknowledgment   of my complaint. I believe I am entitled to, at the very least, a response from someone, anyone, regarding this unprofessional event. It is equally disturbing to be totally ignored – on purpose.… (Thursday, September 8) on the same flight but the plane was delayed for various reasons.

"Denver, CO",Quality Inn & Suites Denver International Airport,The word airport shuttle service I’ve ever experienced,"First I want to say that I travel for a living spending 200 + nights a year in choice hotels. I have been a continuous Diamond member since 2004 and in 2017 earned over 1 million points in one calendar year. Over the past 15 years I’ve had a few bad stays and on occasion had to check out and leave a hotel a few minutes after checking in but I’ve never written a bad review. This is the first time I’ve been so aggravated that I’m using this platform to vent.    I arrived at Denver airport and while waiting for my luggage I called the Quality Inn and Suites to inquire where I should go to get the shuttle. This was at 11:41pm. While I was on the phone my bag appeared  and I followed the directions to door 505 island 3 Hotel pickup. This took about 3 minutes from my phone call. I waited approximately 20 minutes and called the front desk again asking if the shuttle was dispatched because only 2 shuttles came by in that time and I asked both drivers if they picked up for my hotel and they said “No”. I waited another 15 minutes and called the hotel again. I explained that it was now over 35 minutes and I was getting aggravated. I asked the clerk to call dispatch and please get them over here. He never gave an explanation or apologized for the inconvenience he told me that the shuttle was white in color and had just dropped off someone. I told him that absolutely no shuttle that was white or said western shuttle per his description had ever come past. This was now almost 12:15am and in this complete time only 3 shuttles came past and none were fir the Quality Inn. After 50 minutes I opened up my Uber app and while I was looking for the address of the hotel the shuttle finally pulled in. The shuttle was clearly marked “western shuttle” and Quality Inn was clearly listed on the side along with all the other hotels. This shuttle was not white but there was no doubt that this shuttle had never driven by. In the 50 minutes that I waited, this was only the 4th shuttle to come down the shuttle lane. I asked the driver why it took 50 + minutes and he said they don’t get dispatched they just drive around and around. I asked again saying that this was the first time he had been thru in 59 minutes and he offered no explanation . When I arrived at the hotel desk I asked the clerk how they could provide such a service. He did not apologize or offer any explanation. I told him that after my second phone call I would expect him to tell me that the circuit they drive picking up and dropping off for multiple hotel can take 45+ minutes. He offered no explanation or apology. I then realized that this clerk had no clue about customer service and how a simple apology could have prevented me from writing this. He then had the nerve to ask me if I needed a shuttle back to the airport in the morning. I just looked at him and told him “ I’ll take Uber“. I was thinking to myself  “this guy told me on 2 of my 3 phone calls that they don’t dispatch the shuttles they just “come around”! now he’s asking me if I need the shuttle in the morning. I place the blame directly on the Hotel Management for having a shuttle system that can have a guest standing at the curb for 50 minutes. I place the blame directly on management for having a hotel clerk that has absolutely no idea about good customer service. If a hotel offers a free shuttle service I would expect to be picked up within 20 minutes and if I call back to inquire About the delay I expect an apology for the inconvenience and if they are using a multi hotel shuttle service to explain that to me so I can decide if I should take Uber. I travel to Denver quite often but have always rented a car. Tonight’s trip was just a layover so no car was needed.  I have stayed in this hotel before and have no complaints about the room or other issues. I will be returning to Denver on the 11th of November for 4 nights and because of this situation I will never stay in this hotel again. Tomorrow I will also copy and past this review directly on the Choice Hotels web site. I hope that this review will prevent just a few customers that need to use the shuttle service to look elsewhere.

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,fire department was frustrated,"This hotel had great reviews, so I was pretty confident when booking this hotel that it would be a great stay.  Checking in was a breeze and the young lady behind the counter did a great job.  However, after we returned from our game  we were in town to attend we arrived back at the hotel at about 12:45 p.m.  At 2:10 a.m. I woke up to the fire alarms going off.  My husband and I rushed outside.  He threw on some pants, and I threw on a hoodie and we ran outside.  It was freezing outside, but there we student my husband without a coat, and me in shorts.  The worst part is that the man working the counter could not find the key to disengage the fire alarm.  The lobby smelled of marijuana and there is no way the desk clerk could have not know someone was smoking it.   The fire department showed up and after the alarm finally disengaged the clerk told people to go back to their rooms, but we did not because the fire department had not given the all clear.  I have a feeling that this hotel is soon going to get a visit from the Fire Marshall because the department was very upset at the lack of cooperation from the clerk.  We finally got the all clear to go back to our rooms at 2:50 after freezing outside for almost 40 minutes.  It was a terrible experience and one I will not be repeating at this hotel ever again.",1
"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,STAY ELSEWHERE!!,"We chose this location because of the affordable rates. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" certainly applies. This place was far less than desirable.   Our first couple of days were fine. The bed was comfortable and everything appeared to be clean. There were issues, however. The shower handle was loose and nearly impossible to turn on. The towel bars were hung so low it is impossible to hang towels to dry. I also noticed damage to the wall & ceiling that appeared to be old water damage (remember that).   On our 3rd day we requested housekeeping. No problems there.

He gave us a 25% discount for the last night and suggested we call the corporate office, which we fully intend to do.

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Good enough...Traveling with CAT (declawed),"Well, it was a bit of a headache trying to find a place that accepts ""cat"". Usually when pets ok it means a dog. Pet fee is $25 PER NIGHT, which was ok for us. We stayed 4 nights in a King Room. I called ahead to make sure we had a fridge and I think because of that we got a ""suite"". It had a livingroom area w/tv that opened to a dining room with dining table that was huge! There was a microwave, bar sink & tiny counter and small fridge in a corner along a wall. The bedroom was separated by a door, so that made it extra quite. The bathroom and the whole room was dated. All of the art work was missing from the walls, wall paper peeling and worn areas in rug, tub had visible repair, shower curtain was torn. It was not super clean but it wasn't creepy. We had prepaid on booking.com so it was non-refundable. It was okay after the first day and comfortable in general. It had a wall thermostat so it kept it super cool as it was 100 degrees outside. The space was good for our cat, she had plenty of space to explore and a huge window ledge to look out while we were gone during the day. The bathroom was large so it was perfect for litter box and had ""exhaust"". The area can be considered ""busy"" so close to chaotic freeway or ""questionable"" but it was not. Shopping closeby, Walmart & Ross and even a Sams Club for liquor. Grocery Stores do not sell liquor just beer, FYI. If you stay here you can avoid the congestion on the 70 freeway by taking Quebec down to Colfax and taking that to all areas of downtown. We went to cherry creek, zoo, botantical union station, Larimer Sq all in 15-20 min, after 10am and even back at rush hour. Denver freeways are a hot mess so we figured this out first day and were glad we did. The staff at hotel were friendly. We did not have linens changed but got fresh towels from laundry room as needed. Breakfast runs out about 9-9:15 if you happen to sleep in. They do not replenish that late. Variety, eggs, meat changed everyday from ham, sausage or bacon, biscuits, yogurt bananas, waffles. Coffee is decent. Parking can be a pain if alot of trucks pull in on their side and take up multiple spaces. We found a small lot in the back and parked under the lights one night, it was ok. Non smoking was a plus and quiet time appeared to be respected as I was not bothered by anyone and our room was right in front of elevator. We did have living room as buffer but I did not hear our tv from hallway. Bed was comfortable and we also had a tv in bedroom so 2 tv's! I would stay here again as it was convenient and for the cost compared to downtown. Tho pictures makes this appear newer an cleaner than it was, or atleast compared to the room I stayed in. Could have been a room used for people traveling with pets? I did not ask or complain.… so it was non-refundable. It was okay after the first day and comfortable in general.

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Amazing place in Stapleton area of Denver,"I stay at this location every time I come to Denver and I come to Denver about every 2 months.  This Comfort Suites is the old Drury hotel so its built very well and has very nice amenities.  The evening reception cant be done right now because of the Covid outbreak, but eventually it will be back at some time.   They kept the Drury idea of an evening reception with drinks and food even though they are a totally different brand.  So this brings this place a step above the rest.  The beds are fantastic, and bathrooms, tubs are in great shape and clean durable and tidy.",5

My husband and I rushed outside.  He threw on some pants, and I threw on a hoodie and we ran outside.  It was freezing outside, but there we student my husband without a coat, and me in shorts.  The worst part is that the man working the counter could not find the key to disengage the fire alarm.  The lobby smelled of marijuana and there is no way the desk clerk could have not know someone was smoking it.   The fire department showed up and after the alarm finally disengaged the clerk told people to go back to their rooms, but we did not because the fire department had not given the all clear.  I have a feeling that this hotel is soon going to get a visit from the Fire Marshall because the department was very upset at the lack of cooperation from the clerk.  We finally got the all clear to go back to our rooms at 2:50 after freezing outside for almost 40 minutes.

This place was far less than desirable.   Our first couple of days were fine. The bed was comfortable and everything appeared to be clean. There were issues, however.

Denver freeways are a hot mess so we figured this out first day and were glad we did. The staff at hotel were friendly. We did not have linens changed but got fresh towels from laundry room as needed. Breakfast runs out about 9-9:15 if you happen to sleep in. They do not replenish that late. Variety, eggs, meat changed everyday from ham, sausage or bacon, biscuits, yogurt bananas, waffles. Coffee is decent. Parking can be a pain if alot of trucks pull in on their side and take up multiple spaces. We found a small lot in the back and parked under the lights one night, it was ok. Non smoking was a plus and quiet time appeared to be respected as I was not bothered by anyone and our room was right in front of elevator. We did have living room as buffer but I did not hear our tv from hallway. Bed was comfortable and we also had a tv in bedroom so 2 tv's!

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Amazing place in Stapleton area of Denver,"I stay at this location every time I come to Denver and I come to Denver about every 2 months.  This Comfort Suites is the old Drury hotel so its built very well and has very nice amenities.  The evening reception cant be done right now because of the Covid outbreak, but eventually it will be back at some time.   They kept the Drury idea of an evening reception with drinks and food even though they are a totally different brand.  So this brings this place a step above the rest.

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Good enough...Traveling with CAT (declawed),"Well, it was a bit of a headache trying to find a place that accepts ""cat"". Usually when pets ok it means a dog. Pet fee is $25 PER NIGHT, which was ok for us. We stayed 4 nights in a King Room. I called ahead to make sure we had a fridge and I think because of that we got a ""suite"". It had a livingroom area w/tv that opened to a dining room with dining table that was huge! There was a microwave, bar sink & tiny counter and small fridge in a corner along a wall. The bedroom was separated by a door, so that made it extra quite. The bathroom and the whole room was dated. All of the art work was missing from the walls, wall paper peeling and worn areas in rug, tub had visible repair, shower curtain was torn. It was not super clean but it wasn't creepy. We had prepaid on booking.com so it was non-refundable. It was okay after the first day and comfortable in general. It had a wall thermostat so it kept it super cool as it was 100 degrees outside. The space was good for our cat, she had plenty of space to explore and a huge window ledge to look out while we were gone during the day. The bathroom was large so it was perfect for litter box and had ""exhaust"". The area can be considered ""busy"" so close to chaotic freeway or ""questionable"" but it was not. Shopping closeby, Walmart & Ross and even a Sams Club for liquor. Grocery Stores do not sell liquor just beer, FYI. If you stay here you can avoid the congestion on the 70 freeway by taking Quebec down to Colfax and taking that to all areas of downtown. We went to cherry creek, zoo, botantical union station, Larimer Sq all in 15-20 min, after 10am and even back at rush hour. Denver freeways are a hot mess so we figured this out first day and were glad we did. The staff at hotel were friendly. We did not have linens changed but got fresh towels from laundry room as needed. Breakfast runs out about 9-9:15 if you happen to sleep in. They do not replenish that late. Variety, eggs, meat changed everyday from ham, sausage or bacon, biscuits, yogurt bananas, waffles. Coffee is decent. Parking can be a pain if alot of trucks pull in on their side and take up multiple spaces. We found a small lot in the back and parked under the lights one night, it was ok. Non smoking was a plus and quiet time appeared to be respected as I was not bothered by anyone and our room was right in front of elevator. We did have living room as buffer but I did not hear our tv from hallway. Bed was comfortable and we also had a tv in bedroom so 2 tv's! I would stay here again as it was convenient and for the cost compared to downtown. Tho pictures makes this appear newer an cleaner than it was, or atleast compared to the room I stayed in.

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Amazing place in Stapleton area of Denver,"I stay at this location every time I come to Denver and I come to Denver about every 2 months.  This Comfort Suites is the old Drury hotel so its built very well and has very nice amenities.  The evening reception cant be done right now because of the Covid outbreak, but eventually it will be back at some time.   They kept the Drury idea of an evening reception with drinks and food even though they are a totally different brand.  So this brings this place a step above the rest.

My husband and I rushed outside.  He threw on some pants, and I threw on a hoodie and we ran outside.  It was freezing outside, but there we student my husband without a coat, and me in shorts.  The worst part is that the man working the counter could not find the key to disengage the fire alarm.  The lobby smelled of marijuana and there is no way the desk clerk could have not know someone was smoking it.   The fire department showed up and after the alarm finally disengaged the clerk told people to go back to their rooms, but we did not because the fire department had not given the all clear.  I have a feeling that this hotel is soon going to get a visit from the Fire Marshall because the department was very upset at the lack of cooperation from the clerk.  We finally got the all clear to go back to our rooms at 2:50 after freezing outside for almost 40 minutes.

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,STAY ELSEWHERE!!,"We chose this location because of the affordable rates. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" certainly applies. This place was far less than desirable.   Our first couple of days were fine. The bed was comfortable and everything appeared to be clean. There were issues, however. The shower handle was loose and nearly impossible to turn on. The towel bars were hung so low it is impossible to hang towels to dry. I also noticed damage to the wall & ceiling that appeared to be old water damage (remember that).   On our 3rd day we requested housekeeping. No problems there. However, on the 4th day we kept our do not disturb sign up. We returned to discover that housekeeping had been in our room. We left bags open, and my expensive laptop was in the room. NOT OK!!   Later that night it rained very heavily. We returned to the room after dinner to discover water leaking from the ceiling (see photos). It leaked all into one of our bags, and we had several pieces of wet clothing. Note we were on the 2nd floor, and the ceiling was leaking. Not sure what the room above us must have looked like. When we complained to the front desk, all the half-asleep employee could muster was a half-hearted ""I'm sorry"". She moved us to another room, but offered nothing else. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!   Upon checkout we complained again, and the young man at the desk offered a sincere apology. He gave us a 25% discount for the last night and suggested we call the corporate office, which we fully intend to do.   While the place seems nice, and the rates are great, remember you get what you pay for. I will NEVER stay at a Comfort Inn again! A more expensive option is well worth it.

Too bad, just a little extra attention would have made the difference.  We'll try a different spot next trip.",2
"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Convenient enough.,"Awkward location, specifically, but generally convenient (less than five minutes from shopping and restaurants). Room was okay. I had one with a balcony, and the sliding glass door's security lock was difficult to line up. Nothing special, but nothing to avoid either.",3
"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Good Value,Close to shopping and restaurants.  Room was nice and clean.  There was a lack of power receptacles so there were lighting cords exposed.  WI-FI worked well.,3
"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,AWFUL,"We stayed at this hotel because of its location we got into town late and we were attending a funeral mass early the next morning . First we wake up to a spider in the bed ! so we call the front desk and he sends a maid to come look at it and tell us its just a spider no big deal yeah not for her she didnt wake up in bed with a spider! gross. next go in the bathroom for the first time and theres someones fingernails on top of the coffe maker in the bathroom. ok so take a shower and the smoke alarm starts going off and is loud and wont turn off so i call the front desk and the alarm turned off by itself, so i get back to finish my shower and it goes off again so i call the front desk and he calls me a liar and says theres no way for the alarm to be going off hello im on the phone with him and he can hear it! just an awful experince there customer serivce is so bad! their rooms are dirty ! wont ever stay there again! stay away from this bug infested dirty place!",1
"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Families Beware!,"We had an online reservation for a room ""with a crib"", which we discovered was meaningless because cribs are given out on a first come first served basis.  What's worse, there is only one crib in this hotel. The front desk attendent was unhelpful and downright hostile when we said we absolutely needed a crib for our 1-year-old.  We were about to leave for another hotel when he finally called his boss, who arranged for a crib to be brought from another hotel.  When the crib arrived, there were no sheets (just a plastic mat) and when we asked the front desk for an extra sheet, he told us we were unhappy people who should not stay at his hotel ever again.  All because we needed a crib and a sheet for a baby??? This was one of the most bizzarre incidents in my entire life.",1
"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,fire department was frustrated,"This hotel had great reviews, so I was pretty confident when booking this hotel that it would be a great stay.

However, after we returned from our game  we were in town to attend we arrived back at the hotel at about 12:45 p.m.  At 2:10 a.m. I woke up to the fire alarms going off.  My husband and I rushed outside.  He threw on some pants, and I threw on a hoodie and we ran outside.  It was freezing outside, but there we student my husband without a coat, and me in shorts.  The worst part is that the man working the counter could not find the key to disengage the fire alarm.  The lobby smelled of marijuana and there is no way the desk clerk could have not know someone was smoking it.   The fire department showed up and after the alarm finally disengaged the clerk told people to go back to their rooms, but we did not because the fire department had not given the all clear.  I have a feeling that this hotel is soon going to get a visit from the Fire Marshall because the department was very upset at the lack of cooperation from the clerk.  We finally got the all clear to go back to our rooms at 2:50 after freezing outside for almost 40 minutes.  It was a terrible experience and one I will not be repeating at this hotel ever again.… department showed up and after the alarm finally disengaged the clerk told people to go back to their rooms, but we did not because the fire department had not given the all clear.

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,STAY ELSEWHERE!!,"We chose this location because of the affordable rates. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" certainly applies. This place was far less than desirable.   Our first couple of days were fine. The bed was comfortable and everything appeared to be clean. There were issues, however. The shower handle was loose and nearly impossible to turn on. The towel bars were hung so low it is impossible to hang towels to dry. I also noticed damage to the wall & ceiling that appeared to be old water damage (remember that).   On our 3rd day we requested housekeeping. No problems there. However, on the 4th day we kept our do not disturb sign up. We returned to discover that housekeeping had been in our room. We left bags open, and my expensive laptop was in the room. NOT OK!!   Later that night it rained very heavily. We returned to the room after dinner to discover water leaking from the ceiling (see photos). It leaked all into one of our bags, and we had several pieces of wet clothing. Note we were on the 2nd floor, and the ceiling was leaking. Not sure what the room above us must have looked like. When we complained to the front desk, all the half-asleep employee could muster was a half-hearted ""I'm sorry"". She moved us to another room, but offered nothing else. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!   Upon checkout we complained again, and the young man at the desk offered a sincere apology. He gave us a 25% discount for the last night and suggested we call the corporate office, which we fully intend to do.   While the place seems nice, and the rates are great, remember you get what you pay for. I will NEVER stay at a Comfort Inn again! A more expensive option is well worth it.

If i could give it a zero star, i would !!",1
"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Good enough...Traveling with CAT (declawed),"Well, it was a bit of a headache trying to find a place that accepts ""cat"". Usually when pets ok it means a dog. Pet fee is $25 PER NIGHT, which was ok for us. We stayed 4 nights in a King Room. I called ahead to make sure we had a fridge and I think because of that we got a ""suite"". It had a livingroom area w/tv that opened to a dining room with dining table that was huge! There was a microwave, bar sink & tiny counter and small fridge in a corner along a wall. The bedroom was separated by a door, so that made it extra quite. The bathroom and the whole room was dated. All of the art work was missing from the walls, wall paper peeling and worn areas in rug, tub had visible repair, shower curtain was torn. It was not super clean but it wasn't creepy. We had prepaid on booking.com so it was non-refundable. It was okay after the first day and comfortable in general. It had a wall thermostat so it kept it super cool as it was 100 degrees outside. The space was good for our cat, she had plenty of space to explore and a huge window ledge to look out while we were gone during the day. The bathroom was large so it was perfect for litter box and had ""exhaust"". The area can be considered ""busy"" so close to chaotic freeway or ""questionable"" but it was not. Shopping closeby, Walmart & Ross and even a Sams Club for liquor. Grocery Stores do not sell liquor just beer, FYI. If you stay here you can avoid the congestion on the 70 freeway by taking Quebec down to Colfax and taking that to all areas of downtown. We went to cherry creek, zoo, botantical union station, Larimer Sq all in 15-20 min, after 10am and even back at rush hour. Denver freeways are a hot mess so we figured this out first day and were glad we did. The staff at hotel were friendly. We did not have linens changed but got fresh towels from laundry room as needed. Breakfast runs out about 9-9:15 if you happen to sleep in. They do not replenish that late. Variety, eggs, meat changed everyday from ham, sausage or bacon, biscuits, yogurt bananas, waffles. Coffee is decent. Parking can be a pain if alot of trucks pull in on their side and take up multiple spaces. We found a small lot in the back and parked under the lights one night, it was ok. Non smoking was a plus and quiet time appeared to be respected as I was not bothered by anyone and our room was right in front of elevator. We did have living room as buffer but I did not hear our tv from hallway. Bed was comfortable and we also had a tv in bedroom so 2 tv's! I would stay here again as it was convenient and for the cost compared to downtown. Tho pictures makes this appear newer an cleaner than it was, or atleast compared to the room I stayed in. Could have been a room used for people traveling with pets? I did not ask or complain.… so it was non-refundable. It was okay after the first day and comfortable in general.

The breakfast ample and better than average hotel  offering.  Eggs, bacon  potatoes  waffles fresh fruit yogurts and more.  The room had been recently remodeled and was clean and had refrigerator and microwave. Wish the water temperature was hotter but it didn't get colder either.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.

The free dinner was a super unexpected treat! Not fancy, but as long as you're not extremely picky you should be able to find something and be full. The hotel itself was a little worn and could use the love of a couple maintenance people with a steady budget. But it had everything necessary and the bed was nice and comfy. We would stay here again without hesitation.",4

Shopping, restaurants, and more near by and just off the highway.",5
"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Dinner too???,"We had just gotten into town after a flight from Iceland. Our home is on the Western Slope so we stayed overnight before the trip home.The lobby is inviting and large with a warm fireplace and seating area as you come in. Our room was nice sized and I would say that the room has been updated in the last 3-5 years. Nice. Bathroom had all the amenities we needed and the shower had good pressure. I also liked that there was a night light in the bathroom. We travel a lot and after a while, you need to know where the current bathroom is in the middle of the night.Breakfast was very nice including biscuits, gravy, scrambled eggs, sausage links and patties, hash browns, plus the regular bill d'affair of waffles, cereal etc. The breakfast room hostess, Angie was the best marketer for the hotel. She continuously circled the room, cleaning up and asking guests if they were enjoying their breakfast? She stopped at our table and asked if we were staying that evening? We said that we were on our way home and would not be staying. Well, she said, do remember that the next time you stay with us, we also serve dinner! Really??? That was great to know and we will stay there again when we fly out of Denver, because we always come the night before our flight. As you can see, we would stay here again! Thanks, Angie for the tip!",5
"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Visit to Family,"This was the first time we have stayed here. It was good for the value. We come out frequently to see our son in college. Like other contributors, we were pleasantly surprised with the hot dinner along with the breakfast. Only downfall was that although it is a ""non-smoking"" hotel, our hallway was filled with the smell of marijuana every day. We understand it is legal in Colorado but it was an unwelcome downfall. Not sure how well they monitor it. There's no way they couldn't smell it themselves.",4

It leaked all into one of our bags, and we had several pieces of wet clothing. Note we were on the 2nd floor, and the ceiling was leaking. Not sure what the room above us must have looked like. When we complained to the front desk, all the half-asleep employee could muster was a half-hearted ""I'm sorry"". She moved us to another room, but offered nothing else. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!   Upon checkout we complained again, and the young man at the desk offered a sincere apology. He gave us a 25% discount for the last night and suggested we call the corporate office, which we fully intend to do.   While the place seems nice, and the rates are great, remember you get what you pay for. I will NEVER stay at a Comfort Inn again! A more expensive option is well worth it.

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Good enough...Traveling with CAT (declawed),"Well, it was a bit of a headache trying to find a place that accepts ""cat"". Usually when pets ok it means a dog. Pet fee is $25 PER NIGHT, which was ok for us. We stayed 4 nights in a King Room. I called ahead to make sure we had a fridge and I think because of that we got a ""suite"". It had a livingroom area w/tv that opened to a dining room with dining table that was huge! There was a microwave, bar sink & tiny counter and small fridge in a corner along a wall. The bedroom was separated by a door, so that made it extra quite. The bathroom and the whole room was dated. All of the art work was missing from the walls, wall paper peeling and worn areas in rug, tub had visible repair, shower curtain was torn. It was not super clean but it wasn't creepy. We had prepaid on booking.com so it was non-refundable. It was okay after the first day and comfortable in general. It had a wall thermostat so it kept it super cool as it was 100 degrees outside. The space was good for our cat, she had plenty of space to explore and a huge window ledge to look out while we were gone during the day. The bathroom was large so it was perfect for litter box and had ""exhaust"". The area can be considered ""busy"" so close to chaotic freeway or ""questionable"" but it was not. Shopping closeby, Walmart & Ross and even a Sams Club for liquor. Grocery Stores do not sell liquor just beer, FYI. If you stay here you can avoid the congestion on the 70 freeway by taking Quebec down to Colfax and taking that to all areas of downtown. We went to cherry creek, zoo, botantical union station, Larimer Sq all in 15-20 min, after 10am and even back at rush hour. Denver freeways are a hot mess so we figured this out first day and were glad we did. The staff at hotel were friendly. We did not have linens changed but got fresh towels from laundry room as needed. Breakfast runs out about 9-9:15 if you happen to sleep in. They do not replenish that late. Variety, eggs, meat changed everyday from ham, sausage or bacon, biscuits, yogurt bananas, waffles. Coffee is decent. Parking can be a pain if alot of trucks pull in on their side and take up multiple spaces. We found a small lot in the back and parked under the lights one night, it was ok. Non smoking was a plus and quiet time appeared to be respected as I was not bothered by anyone and our room was right in front of elevator. We did have living room as buffer but I did not hear our tv from hallway. Bed was comfortable and we also had a tv in bedroom so 2 tv's! I would stay here again as it was convenient and for the cost compared to downtown. Tho pictures makes this appear newer an cleaner than it was, or atleast compared to the room I stayed in. Could have been a room used for people traveling with pets? I did not ask or complain.… so it was non-refundable. It was okay after the first day and comfortable in general.

Pet fee is $25 PER NIGHT, which was ok for us. We stayed 4 nights in a King Room. I called ahead to make sure we had a fridge and I think because of that we got a ""suite"". It had a livingroom area w/tv that opened to a dining room with dining table that was huge! There was a microwave, bar sink & tiny counter and small fridge in a corner along a wall. The bedroom was separated by a door, so that made it extra quite. The bathroom and the whole room was dated. All of the art work was missing from the walls, wall paper peeling and worn areas in rug, tub had visible repair, shower curtain was torn. It was not super clean but it wasn't creepy. We had prepaid on booking.com so it was non-refundable. It was okay after the first day and comfortable in general. It had a wall thermostat so it kept it super cool as it was 100 degrees outside. The space was good for our cat, she had plenty of space to explore and a huge window ledge to look out while we were gone during the day. The bathroom was large so it was perfect for litter box and had ""exhaust"". The area can be considered ""busy"" so close to chaotic freeway or ""questionable"" but it was not. Shopping closeby, Walmart & Ross and even a Sams Club for liquor. Grocery Stores do not sell liquor just beer, FYI. If you stay here you can avoid the congestion on the 70 freeway by taking Quebec down to Colfax and taking that to all areas of downtown. We went to cherry creek, zoo, botantical union station, Larimer Sq all in 15-20 min, after 10am and even back at rush hour. Denver freeways are a hot mess so we figured this out first day and were glad we did. The staff at hotel were friendly. We did not have linens changed but got fresh towels from laundry room as needed. Breakfast runs out about 9-9:15 if you happen to sleep in. They do not replenish that late. Variety, eggs, meat changed everyday from ham, sausage or bacon, biscuits, yogurt bananas, waffles. Coffee is decent. Parking can be a pain if alot of trucks pull in on their side and take up multiple spaces. We found a small lot in the back and parked under the lights one night, it was ok. Non smoking was a plus and quiet time appeared to be respected as I was not bothered by anyone and our room was right in front of elevator. We did have living room as buffer but I did not hear our tv from hallway. Bed was comfortable and we also had a tv in bedroom so 2 tv's! I would stay here again as it was convenient and for the cost compared to downtown. Tho pictures makes this appear newer an cleaner than it was, or atleast compared to the room I stayed in. Could have been a room used for people traveling with pets? I did not ask or complain.… so it was non-refundable. It was okay after the first day and comfortable in general.

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,Amazing place in Stapleton area of Denver,"I stay at this location every time I come to Denver and I come to Denver about every 2 months.  This Comfort Suites is the old Drury hotel so its built very well and has very nice amenities.  The evening reception cant be done right now because of the Covid outbreak, but eventually it will be back at some time.   They kept the Drury idea of an evening reception with drinks and food even though they are a totally different brand.  So this brings this place a step above the rest.  The beds are fantastic, and bathrooms, tubs are in great shape and clean durable and tidy.",5

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,fire department was frustrated,"This hotel had great reviews, so I was pretty confident when booking this hotel that it would be a great stay.  Checking in was a breeze and the young lady behind the counter did a great job.  However, after we returned from our game  we were in town to attend we arrived back at the hotel at about 12:45 p.m.  At 2:10 a.m. I woke up to the fire alarms going off.  My husband and I rushed outside.  He threw on some pants, and I threw on a hoodie and we ran outside.  It was freezing outside, but there we student my husband without a coat, and me in shorts.  The worst part is that the man working the counter could not find the key to disengage the fire alarm.  The lobby smelled of marijuana and there is no way the desk clerk could have not know someone was smoking it.   The fire department showed up and after the alarm finally disengaged the clerk told people to go back to their rooms, but we did not because the fire department had not given the all clear.  I have a feeling that this hotel is soon going to get a visit from the Fire Marshall because the department was very upset at the lack of cooperation from the clerk.  We finally got the all clear to go back to our rooms at 2:50 after freezing outside for almost 40 minutes.  It was a terrible experience and one I will not be repeating at this hotel ever again.",1

"Denver, CO",Comfort Inn & Suites,STAY ELSEWHERE!!,"We chose this location because of the affordable rates. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" certainly applies. This place was far less than desirable.   Our first couple of days were fine. The bed was comfortable and everything appeared to be clean. There were issues, however. The shower handle was loose and nearly impossible to turn on. The towel bars were hung so low it is impossible to hang towels to dry. I also noticed damage to the wall & ceiling that appeared to be old water damage (remember that).   On our 3rd day we requested housekeeping. No problems there. However, on the 4th day we kept our do not disturb sign up. We returned to discover that housekeeping had been in our room. We left bags open, and my expensive laptop was in the room. NOT OK!!   Later that night it rained very heavily. We returned to the room after dinner to discover water leaking from the ceiling (see photos). It leaked all into one of our bags, and we had several pieces of wet clothing. Note we were on the 2nd floor, and the ceiling was leaking. Not sure what the room above us must have looked like. When we complained to the front desk, all the half-asleep employee could muster was a half-hearted ""I'm sorry"". She moved us to another room, but offered nothing else. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!   Upon checkout we complained again, and the young man at the desk offered a sincere apology. He gave us a 25% discount for the last night and suggested we call the corporate office, which we fully intend to do.   While the place seems nice, and the rates are great, remember you get what you pay for. I will NEVER stay at a Comfort Inn again! A more expensive option is well worth it.

"Denver, CO ",La Quinta Inn by Wyndham Denver Central,Gets the job done but run down in questionable area. Not worth the $30 per night your might be saving.,"Stayed here for two nights, mainly to crash between a red eye flight and early morning all day training, then booked next 3 nights elsewhere. Lobby is decent and welcoming, room from afar looks fine.  Most of the rooms open to the outside, must walk through dirty indoor stairs that smell of marijuana to get to lobby or take elevator from outside by the pool. Room has musky smelling carpet, old rough balled-up sheets with lumpy pillows, loud buzzing sound coming from outside the room, old beat-up doors, outdated bath.  Got poked by the pillow as I was going to sleep and found a tiny course sharp hair sticking out. Breakfast is bread heavy, with waffle maker, bagels, muffins, cereal, but for someone like me who is gluten free, my only option was a hard boiled egg or yogurt (no fruit, not even a banana). I stayed elsewhere for only $30 more per night that was brand new, with full breakfast included and in the heart of downtown.",2

The front desk lady said, “people always leave their soap so we often throw them away.” I understand that hotels are not responsible for any lost stuff, but they can’t even keep a full amount of soap that wasn’t even in a trash can?

"Denver, CO ",La Quinta Inn by Wyndham Denver Central,Terrible,I haven’t stayed in a La Quinta in years but this was far below what I would have expected for any hotel! Being an older building we expected a few quirks but this was terrible!  The pictures are only a few examples.,1
"Denver, CO ",La Quinta Inn by Wyndham Denver Central,You get what you pay for,"You Get what you pay for, hotel is on the opposite side of street from BNSF railroad,  room was big and clean, carpet had stains,pool was not in use which we have really liked to use being its June and hot already",3

"Denver, CO ",La Quinta Inn by Wyndham Denver Central,Better than the reviews say it is,"I picked this hotel for my recent trip to Denver because I wanted to be near Coors Field and while that's true, I didn't bring or rent a car, and I found the 15 minute walk to be slightly hostile going uphill from the hotel to the stadium; coming back wasn't as bad. Also, public transit is not great; two bus routes stop at the door but offer terrible service levels at all hours of the day and night; the new train station up the street may help somewhat in that area.As for the hotel, I was pleased with the room and amenities - the bed was comfortable, wifi was good, TV had a lot of channels, water pressure was good although the hot water was slow to activate at times, the breakfast was simple but had lots of options and the staff were generally helpful and courteous when I needed them. The bathroom could have used a little TLC, as the wallpaper was peeling and there were some hard water stains in the tub; some parts of the property were also a little tired looking, but none of these things were a big deal to me. Also, if you're sensitive to outside noise, the proximity to a train yard may disturb you, especially if you face the back. Overall, I was happy here and would consider staying here again - don't believe all of the negative reviews.",3
"Denver, CO ",La Quinta Inn by Wyndham Denver Central,dirty,Dirty rooms and lots of deferred maintenance.  Corners of bathroom were caked in dirt and grime. Bathroom smelled horrible.

As for the room itself, the bathroom smelled strongly of cigarette smoke, the sheets were stained and threadbare and the mattress felt like it should have been replaced a long time ago.

The building is a bit older, the area can seem a bit sketchy to some and the staff was mediocre.  Location wise, its only a few minutes drive to downtown which was convenient.

The shower ceiling was peeling, moldy, and a window panel of glass was missing. When the front desk was called, a JAMES answered and began questioning the allegations, never apologized, and offered no more assistance then a snarky have a “nice night” as I, a young woman, left angry, disgusted, and visibly upset.

"Denver, CO ",La Quinta Inn by Wyndham Denver Central,Service and room ok. Noisy neighbourhood. ,Good service by the staff. Can be noisy if your room is facing the train.

"Denver, CO ",La Quinta Inn by Wyndham Denver Central,Terrible room and unsafe area,"I stayed here last week and this place was horrible. I didn't realize this place had outside entrance. I stayed on the first floor and my door opened up to the parking lot. When I closed my door it looked like light could enter from the bottom part do the door side. It did not feel secure - in fact when I slept I took a chair and placed it under the door to feel somewhat safe.It was my first trip to Denver and I was there for work. The area does not looks safe.The room smelled terrible and it was not clean. I found plastic tags (from clothes or items) on the carpet. There was hair in the bathroom floor. The sink was dirty, the bathtub was stained. It was so disgusting that I went and purchased flip flops as I didn't want to step in there with out shoes.The pictures displayed on the website are not accurate. The room may look like that, but the smell the dirtiness and damp feeing can't be seen. There are train tracks somewhere near as you could hear train horns all night. You can hear people walking along outside your room at all times of the night and it did not feel safe.I got the sense that this place is for long term residents and not meant to be a place for guests to come stay. The breakfast is not good. The food is stale. The packaged jelly must be old as it is not even spreadable. The table was sticky and unclean. I ended up not eating the food and left. Worst experience ever. The only reason I booked La Quinta was because I had previously stayed in one and had a great experience - clean room and great food. Will not be staying here again.",1

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Treated more like an inmate than a guest,"I have stayed in a few hostels before. This hotel required me to prove that I was travelling, which I had never experienced. The evening desk manager was very rude, demanding that I pay my outstanding balance, making me wait at the desk until he realized I was not the person who had an outstanding balance. I got back late one evening to find the doors locked. The same man acknowledged I was outside, then continued to help a guest, crossing in front of the door multiple times while I waited for about 15 minutes in the snow. When he finally finished, he made me show my key before he opened the door for me.",2
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Terrible room quality,"Bunk beds are unstable, if you are unlucky to get the top bunk then prepare to get blisters on your feet due to poor ladder design. Not to mention no control over the radiator which makes the people on the top bunk sweat while sleeping.",1
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Old building but reasonable,"This is an old building that hasn’t been gutted but has been maintained and renovated some. It had its flaws but maintains character, too. It was pretty clean, but there is the lingering old smell lurking beneath the surface. Again, typical of such buildings but in far better shape than comparable places I’ve stayed in in San Francisco. For food: There’s a cheese steak place next door that was fair. Across the street is Torchy’s tacos. 3 min walk to Lincoln you can catch the 0 or 6 and get to Sam’s No. 3 diner at 16th & Curtis in about 9 minutes (get there before 10am and you can get 2 eggs, potatoes & toast for 3.99!). The cons? No elevator and the shared toilets remind me of elementary school — so tiny! The shared showers had the typical creepiness to them, but they were relatively clean. The beds were comfy. It was a steal and I booked through Air BnB. Fairly simple check in process. Oh, and if you don’t like city noise, grab a pair of earplugs at the front desk. It doesn’t bother me at all, but there was someone ratcheting outside my wooden at 3:45 am. I can only assume they were trying to steel some scrap metal.",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Cheap but not very clean,"I understand that when a hotel is so cheap you can’t expect much, but a certain level of cleanliness should be standard. There were several hairs on the bed and in the bathroom, the bathroom was very old. No room service even when you stay several nights. The area feels quite safe, it is a close walking distance to the centre and the staff is very friendly and helpful.",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Great location-heat was a problem,"Our first time in Denver, so we were not sure of where to stay. The 11th Avenue Hostel  is on the ""0"" line, which got us to/from many places-GREAT transit system. Hostel is just 3 blocks from the DAM (Denver Art Musem), so we walked to/from. There is a Torchy's fast food (breakfast and coffee @7am) across the street. 2 blocks down is the Broadway Market, where you have your choice of pizza, pasta, sushi, empanadas, beer, and more. Amethyst Coffee is across the street, too. I was not impressed. WAY over priced ($21 for a bag of beans!). The guy waiting on us leaned toward arrogant and not forthcoming with answers to questions (like I should know why their coffee shop is so highly rated). Coffee was bought as a 'thank you' gift and I'm embarrassed to give, without explaining (I had considered returning coffee, especially after we were given a free 16 oz cup of same coffee). My biggest complaint is the heat (radiators). One night, the heat was turned on by 7pm, off by 7am. The next night it didn't get turned on until past 9 pm. The next morning I asked for an extra blanket-not a problem-and if the heat was on some kind of a schedule. The answer was, ""the front desk turns on the heat according to the number of people in the lobby (for their comfort?).""! WHAT THE H---?! Too cold in the room to heat the bathroom (ensuite) so considered using the shower down the hallway, but the other 'guests' just leave towels, everywhere, after their showers (not management's fault). We waited for a few hrs. after the heat did come on, to do quick showers. We'll be back to Denver and we'll stay at the 11th Avenue Hostel.",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Friendship Room,"My friend and I booked a Friendship Room, i.e. twin sized bunk beds for about $50/night. The room was acceptable for the price and location. But be prepared for the heat! We were placed on the third floor, and it was a really warm night in August. Additionally, the hostel does not provide parking. We were lucky to find a spot the next street over (11th). Overnight parking is not available on the street in front of the hotel because of the street sweepers. Keeping in mind that this is an antiquated building, the bathrooms were a little awkward. The toilet does not have a sink, but there are sinks in the rooms.My top two pros for this hostel were: 1) They kept my bike in a locked room with two other bikes from guests; 2) The staff was SO friendly. If you need to be downtown for cheap, its not a bad option.",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Checking out Denver,I stayed at the 11th st hostel for two nights. The rooms were clean but the ventilation not so great which made for a hot room at night even with the mini fans provided. The hostel is undergoing renovation so there is plywood up in the hallways. Other than that no other complaints about the room. In the lobby downstairs they have vending machines and coffee. As for the location it is near convenience stores and restaurants and a short walking distance to the 16 th Street mall. Thanks for the hospitality.,3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Good hostel in the heart of Denver,"Good location, spacious dorms with comfortable beds, good bathrooms. Clean. It is not cheap... but Denver is a vey expensive city.

I am a college student, so used to living with roommates so I picked the 4-person option and had a great time. It is nice and quiet at night, showers are hot, and the people at the front desk were really friendly. My favorite part was the kitchen, which was honestly the cleanest kitchen I have ever seen. There were a bunch of cooking utensils and dishes to use and places to store my food, which was extremely helpful since it meant I didn't have to eat out for every meal.

Its low cost means not everything is completely perfect, but as far as basics goes, it pretty much has everything covered. Staff were friendly whenever we interacted with them, always happy to ask how we were or help with any questions we had for them. Toilets and shower rooms are available on each floor, but I did find that one or two showers didn't work- but there were alternates available if not on your desired floor.Location wise I thought this place was great, only a ten minute walk from 16th and an even shorter walk to the central bus station. Our only real downside of the stay was that opposite our room was Club Vinyl, which, on a Friday and Saturday has a rooftop terrace which plays music until 3/4 A.M. -we were unaware of this beforehand, but thankfully brought earplugs with us. I cannot recommend enough having something with you to try and drown this sound out!Otherwise, a cheap and cheerful hostel, would return again if I was confident my room was facing away from the roadside.",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Interesting building,No air conditioner or elevator. We were put in a room at the end of the hallway right outside the ally. We could here people walking up fire scapes and throwing glass and garbage into dumpsters early in the morning and throughout the day. The front desk was nice and helpful. A good location but rooms are over priced.,2
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Nicer Hostel but shower problems,"For a hostel it is definitely nicer than your average place. As a couple we got a room with a queen size bed and didn’t have to share it which is very nice (European room). The staff was extremely nice and helpful. The only issue would be the bathrooms. Even if we didn’t mind sharing then with other people, which we knew ment having other people’s hair when we shower, the water was cold in some of them and you could see they needed to be updated. Appart from that the price was really worth the stay and the area it is located at is very convenient (many restaurants, bars, etc).",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,"Bathrooms didnt work, canceled later reservation, no refund given","Was promised a dual and charged for a quad, they lost my res due to their misspelling, finally got in to discover all but one toilet on our floor was overflowing.

I've stayed at a lot of hostels, and this was by far the worst service and amenities yet.  Stay away.",1

We were lucky to find a spot the next street over (11th). Overnight parking is not available on the street in front of the hotel because of the street sweepers. Keeping in mind that this is an antiquated building, the bathrooms were a little awkward. The toilet does not have a sink, but there are sinks in the rooms.

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Checking out Denver,I stayed at the 11th st hostel for two nights.

After a long time working with the airline we finally got to an Uber and took it to the 11th Ave hostel.

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Worth it!,"My husband and I had a great experience at the 11th Ave Hostel. We stayed in a private room with shared bathrooms, it was a perfect set up for our weekend trip to Denver. Our bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. The staff was very nice and accommodating. There is no air conditioning in the building, but this wasn't a problem for us in early October. My only complaint is this: there was a lot of noise outside at night. I think there is a club next door, so I had some trouble sleeping the first night. However, the hostel provides free ear plugs and it really isn't their fault, so I don't hold it against them!",4
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Great for the price!,"I stayed at the 11th Avenue Hostel on a Thursday. My friend and I shared a room with two beds and a private bathroom, so we didn't really do the hostel thing -- it was more like a hotel room -- for a lot less money! I found the room to be totally sufficient. Not sparkling clean, but clean enough. I thought the beds were comfortable and the sheets were nice. I would totally stay here again. If saving money is more important to you than having a really nice hotel room, this is probably a good option for you.",4
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Coming through for the win!,We had a last minute flight change and ended up having a 14 hour layover in Colorado. I made a reservation at 4 am and they were able to hook me up with an early check in so we were able to rest and shower before exploring and heading back to the airport.

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Do not stay here.,"We were looking for a basic no frills room to get some solid sleep. Saw that 11th ave seemed to be the cheapest option. We checked in to the hostel just after midnight--and after paying more than the advertised amount (listed on their website) and looking forever for a place to park overnight (the staff gave us no guidance whatsoever) we began noticing things that were ""off"" about the hostel...there was a homeless man hanging around in the lobby, and we hadn't seen any travelers like ourselves. But we were exhausted and tried brushing it off. Got to the private room we booked-which the first thing I noticed was not the room itself, but the door. It was a very old wooden door that with minimal force, could easily be broken down. And the tiny deadbolt lock was a joke. The bed was gross and had hairs all over. Went looking for a bathroom, and they were all DISGUSTING. I avoided the bathroom that looked like the toilet had been clogged and almost overflowing for days, and settled for the working toilet that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. Went back to the room--meanwhile noting the people I passed still not looking like travelers. After 30 minutes in the hostel, we made the decision to leave immediately first thing in the morning and cancel our reservation and plans with them from then on. I am from a city larger than Denver and have had my fair share of experiences with hostels in Central/South America...I think the 11th ave hostel is overpriced, unclean, and unsafe. Spend the extra money and go someplace clean/safe.",1
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,I could have overlooked the nasty had it been cheap,"Awful value for money. Nasty is fine when you're not paying a great deal to stay here. Bed linen is old and gives you the creeps.  The place feels dirty and unsafe.  All these negative comments would not be warranted had I paid very little for the room, however the cost of staying here makes the place total unacceptable.",1
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Hair EVERYWHERE on the sheets and pillowcase..,"My fiancé and I booked our last night in Denver here, we were looking for a good deal and have stayed in at least 20 other hostels internationally so thought we'd give 11th Avenue a chance.  We came up to the room that night after dinner and immediately thought everything looked dinghy but we were still positive.... until we pulled back the sheets to get into bed.  There were hairs ALL OVER the sheets and pillowcases, little brown ones and longer strands.. the more we examined the more we found.  After complaining to the front desk and asking for a refund, we were told they couldn't honor the refund.. so we asked for a fresh set of sheets.  I died laughing because my fiancé brought the fresh set up and there was a huge curly brown hair resting right on top and little curly ones in the folds.  Needless to say we packed, left right then, and found a different hotel to stay in. It was worth it to us to take the loss on the hostel and even pay for a new place to stay... that's how gross the hair situation was.",1
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Cheap and well located ,"Cheap, bear bones hostel with no extras. But it offers a warm bed and is relatively clean. Staff are friendly but a little overbearing. Not too many food options that close but well located especially for the NFL. Would stay again if just needing a bed.",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Bed Bugs! Poor customer service. Highly disappointed.,"I had high hopes for this hotel/hostel (decent website, great location, decent reviews) but was sorely disappointed when I arrived. Once you leave the lobby the place looks pretty shoddy (which was fine, I don't need much) and the noise level (even in private rooms) is pretty high. I had seen one review that had mentioned bed bugs so when I first called I asked how they would respond if I found bed bugs and of course they said they would bend over backward to accommodate me in that type of situation. Well, my bed was covered with bed bugs and their first solution was to just switch out my mattress, then they suggested charging me extra to move to their one available room, and ultimately they were refusing to refund my three nights payment. They refused to call a manager and told me I'd have to wait until morning to speak with one. Eventually I got a full refund but I had to push and push for it. The only positive out of all of this was that the maintenance guy who came to check the room saw the problem, totally empathized, and treated me with respect, as if he wanted to take care of the customer. He ought to be promoted. On another note, I should have known better with it being a hostel, but if you want to fight through crowds of 18 year olds, this is the place for you.",1
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Awesome hostel in the middle of the city!,"I stayed in 11th Avenue Hostel overnight for a long layover and had a wonderful experience!

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,ONLY if you're on a tight budget,"Don't get me wrong, the place was cheap to stay at, and clean as well, but that's as good as it gets. It's populated by locals who work all day and get cranky if you have the TV on past 9.30pm. Don't expect them to take you out and show you the town.There is zero activities organised by the ""hostel"" which is actually more like a halfway house. There are next to no kitchen facilities; no hot plate to boil water for pasta, no bowls, not even a bloody can opener in sight. Effectively means that all your meals you have to buy in town or make in the microwave. The rooms (I was in a 12 bed dorm) have these beds with plastic coverings on them which crackle every time you move making it feel like you're sleeping between two radios turned between stations. Finally, I'm not going to say that all the staff were rude, in fact most of them that I had dealings with were fine. However one lady seemed to take personal offense to me checking out and then going back upstairs to get my bags. Remember, Colorado has legalized weed, so if you're not comfortable around the stuff then you're at the wrong hostel...probably the wrong state.",2
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,"VERY RUDE STAFF, SKETCHY PLACE!","My experience here was far from uplifting! Front desk check in was nice, but the trouble started after I got to my room. My pillows were discustingly stained so I found an employee by the name of Mary. I tried to explain to her I would like a clean pillow, the response I got was FAR from friendly! She looked at me and said where the hell do you think your staying the Sheridan? She smelled like she had just walked out of a bar! VERY RUDE SERVICE on her part! The host of guests staying there looked like they all just got done shooting up some strong drugs, pretty scary! I found a used needle under the mattress when I pulled on the blankets it fell out! I would not recommend this hotel to anybody!",1
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,It's what I expected,"I was traveling solo, and after reading the reviews I decided that I would take my chances.  I stayed in a 4 person room, so we had our own bathroom.  It had all the amenities that I needed, and I liked the location to downtown.  It's about on par with a lot of college off-campus housing that I've seen, so that's okay.  The front-desk staff were friendly to me.There wasn't air conditioning, so we ended up having to open up the window at night.  It made it pretty noisy, especially when a bunch of kids decided to drag race down the street at 2am.  I had 2 roommates who were ""between housing"", but they were considerate enough so I didn't have any problems.For me, this was all part of the adventure, so I was okay with it.  If my budget were better, I would go elsewhere.",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,like prison,"If you are travelling and consider this hostel - please go somewhere else. I's the most unfriendly place you can think of and they'll try to trick you any way possible. I am guessing that most of their clients are homeless people who get vouchers to stay there. At least that could explain why the staff act as if they are doing you a favor letting you stay there and try to command you around constantly.My personal experience was as follows:I had initially made a reservation for a dorm bed. Three days before my reservation I changed this to a single room with shared bathroom. I first called them, then emailed them with the reservation number. They replied they couldn't find my reservation number whereupon I sent them  the entire reservation email I had received from them. I then received an email confirming that I had now reserved a single room.I arrived a day late, due to a fly delay. I emailed the reservation email immediately saying the plane as late, but received no response. When I arrived midday the next day at the hostel there was a sign to please wait 30 mins due to a shift in staff. After about that time I was attended. They wanted to charge for the first night that I hadn't arrived yet, to which I agreed immediately. But then things started getting weird. After paying I noticed the amount was a bit too low for three nights in the single room. I asked the guy attending me and he confirmed that this was just a dorm bed. I told him about the changes he had made and at first he denied it. When I offered to show the email, he finally went to his computer, made a noise of surprise and came back to me and told me the booking people should have told me that I couldn't do the change because they had no rooms. He then tried to get me to just accept the dorm bed. he tried acting as if he and the hostel and little or nothing to do with the booking system. I said that this was surely and issue between the hostel and the booking system and that they needed to resolve this in-between themselves. Then he tried saying that it would take at least a day to resolve it, and I countered that I didn't care if they put me up in a different hostel/motel, but that surely they would reserve this today. Seeing that he couldn't convince me, he asked to please sit down and wait. The lobby had been filled with people up until now. Once they had left he called me back and suddenly announced that I would get a room. I had to pay extra, also for the night that I hadn't made it, but eventually everything was set up. He apologized but added ""I have only been on duty since 1, and this has happened 3 times already.""The room (319) was dirty, the shower outside of it was constantly occupied  and the restroom a fair bit. When they say it is a shared bathroom, they really mean it. I must have been sharing with at least 50 people given that the shower was locked at all times during the day and night.I didn't talk more to the staff until the night of the next day. I had bought some food at the place next door. The hostel has carpets, so I didn't want to make it smell and said down on a chair in the lobby to it eat. The night shift (different person than last time) called me over. He asked me for my room number and told me ""... checked you in, he is our senior ..  he should have told you that there is no loitering in the lobby and you can't sit down here. There is a communal room in room ..."" None of this information had been given to me earlier and the tone of what he said was as if we were in a youth jail and he had caught me stealing food. I didn't say anything, said thank you and went to the ""communal room.""The next morning I tried to check out fairly early, 6:15 or so. The same person from the night before was in charge. He took my key, but then said he couldn't see I had paid any deposit (which of course I had) so he wouldn't give me any, but at 9 am I could call the hostel manager to discuss with him.I protested saying that they probably wouldn't have given me the key if hadn't given them the key deposit. He then answered that there were two cameras filming us making sure that he didn't do anything wrong. I said that I wasn't threatening him in any way, upon which he responded that he had pepper spray to defend himself! How in the world he thought he needed to threaten me with pepper spray, I will never understand, but after that I made a quick exit before he would get any ideas of using it on me.  But as a prison guard this would be completely acceptable behavior.My flight out of the US was that same night and I wouldn't have been able to come back at 9am to talk to any manager or receive the key deposit. So they took that.Could you imagine any of this happening at a hotel or even a motel? Of course not. Seriously - don't ever go there.",1

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,They're doing you a favor by letting you stay there....,"This seemed to be the predominant attitude during my stay at the 11th avenue hotel.

I also encountered a someone I thought might well be homeless while using the microwave oven. She told me to ""stop whistling"" and then called me a ""BI@CH"" when I refused along with some other choice words. Theres also a night supervisor named Frank that is Barney Fiffe incarnate with the personality of an ashtray. Anyway, for the money you can do much better unless of course you don't mind paying both a key and towell deposit and interacting with recent parolees that get a voucher to stay there. Finally, whatever you do, make sure you have shoes or flip-flops on when you go into the lobby; they come unglued about that too. Even if you get locked out of your room and left the key inside.

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Not a good place if you ever want to sleep.,Me and my friends stayed here over new years.

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Solid Hostel with a Great Location,"I stayed here one night while I was visiting Denver.  If you remember that it is a hostel, you won't be disappointed.

Tenants are an eclectic bunch.  The location is great--just a few blocks south of the capitol and within walking distance of almost anything you would want to see in town.  However, it is between two night clubs, which might be a problem if you are a light sleeper.",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Great location and great price.,Private room was clean and comfortable.  Stayed for 4 nights.  No maid service and no air conditioning.  It can get warm in Denver.

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Ok for Just someplace to crash.,"First off let me say that I worked in hotels for 18 years, and have stayed in everything from 5 star to the only flophouse in town with a room left! As others have said, this property is indeed old. It could stand some TLC. My experience with the staff was just as everyone has said; they were very nice and engaged. You could tell that if you had questions or issues, they would earnestly try and assist you. Probably my biggest gripe would be the wifi  If you advertise free Wi-Fi, it should work well. The first night I couldn't get on at all. When I questioned it, the nice guy at the front desk explained that if the weather is bad, it will sometimes go out. Also, if there are a lot of people using it, you can't log on! C'mon! This is an easy fix! Management can pop for some better Wi-Fi reception! Once I did get on, it was the slowest I've encountered since dial up! I also did not appreciate that the system uses ""Sonic Wall"", which blocks some content. Some of the other pretty easy fixes are purchasing new linens. The bed linens that I encountered were old and used way too much. Once a property has gotten this old, there's no way around doing a good re-model. I understand that you're trying to keep costs down, but - in the long run - you'll make the money back that you put into an extreme facelift. The community room was ok; it could benefit from a larger refrigerator and maybe a couple more microwaves. The plastic cutlery dispenser was a nice touch. All in all, it's certainly not the worst place that I've ever stayed, but I can see a lot of opportunities for improvement. It's in a WONDERFUL location, and - with the bodega right there on the corner - I can see the chance to really shine there.",3

I stayed in a 8 bed dorm which was divide it by a wall with 4 beds on each side. The beds were very uncomfortable hard . I was in the room charging my phone when the cleaning lady came in and started cleaning, I Witness her take the blankets off of 2  beds that  people check out refold  them and put them back on the beds like I wasn't even there.

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Clean Basic Room,Budget 1/4 star semi residential hotel. The only really bad I can say is at the time I visited the hotel the manager would not rent to a same sex couple. This may have changed with new management on this side of the Milenieum.,2
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,staff,"I have stayed at this hotel/hostel many times, I have met great employees, from a young african maintance man who helped carey my luggage, friendly front desk staff members, Alison and Brenda are the best! If not for them three, I would not be returning.  I checked in with Alison and wanted to check out when I could not bare my room anymore. Brenda steped in and made sure I was ok and if there was anything at all she could do, unfortunately there was no other rooms to switch to that were better than mine. I give the management staff an applaud for training such great team members look forward to seeing them all again! hopefully will return this August from my trip. ",5
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Very helpful staff,I got off my flight from Ohio to Denver and was in a hurry for a place to stay. Then I found the 11th Ave. And Brenda at the front desk was very nice and helpfull thank you so much Brenda my stay was enjoyable because of you.  ,4
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,"Real Estate Rule; Location, Location, Location","I've stayed at this location several times in the last few years and I must say the location is GREAT. The central downtown hotels are nice but clustery and a little too busy to be comfortable. This place is a ""work in progress"" and so it has a nice quirkiness that adds charm. It's  just far enough from the center to not be cluttered with all the people and traffic but very close to the library, the art museum, history museum and the capitol. The 16th street mall is a 10 minute walk.   This time I had a problem with the room I booked. The room only had a bathtub and no shower. It was an elegant room but since I am a very active person I have to have a shower otherwise the alternative is not good. I spoke to the assistant manager Casper and after a bit of negotiation he was able…",4

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Excellent price for basic lodging in great location,"My husband and I needed an affordable, nearby place to stay after a late club show.  We had a private room with a private bathroom.  The building is an older one and the amenities are basic.  The staff was friendly, the front door unlocked all night (a security person stays in lobby) and we encountered few other people.  The location was ridiculously convenient for us and the price was by far the best I found for a private room in Denver proper.  There were no frills-- plastic covered the older mattress and the sheets were very thin-- but it was acceptably clean, the window opened, and we had what we needed.  Opt for dormitory accommodations to pay even less.",4

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Friendship Room,"My friend and I booked a Friendship Room, i.e. twin sized bunk beds for about $50/night. The room was acceptable for the price and location. But be prepared for the heat! We were placed on the third floor, and it was a really warm night in August. Additionally, the hostel does not provide parking. We were lucky to find a spot the next street over (11th). Overnight parking is not available on the street in front of the hotel because of the street sweepers. Keeping in mind that this is an antiquated building, the bathrooms were a little awkward. The toilet does not have a sink, but there are sinks in the rooms.  My top two pros for this hostel were: 1) They kept my bike in a locked room with two other bikes from guests; 2) The staff was SO friendly. If you need to be downtown for cheap, its not a bad option.… cheap, its not a bad option.",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Checking out Denver,I stayed at the 11th st hostel for two nights. The rooms were clean but the ventilation not so great which made for a hot room at night even with the mini fans provided. The hostel is undergoing renovation so there is plywood up in the hallways. Other than that no other complaints about the room. In the lobby downstairs they have vending machines and coffee. As for the location it is near convenience stores and restaurants and a short walking distance to the 16 th Street mall. Thanks for the hospitality.,3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Friend lost his ID on the airplane and they wouldn't let us stay,"My friend lost his ID when we were traveling into Denver this past week. He was unable to find it when we landed and the airline said they had not had anyone turn it in.   After a long time working with the airline we finally got to an Uber and took it to the 11th Ave hostel. We were not allowed to check in even though the reservation was under my name and I had my ID and credit card. They would not let anyone else into the building unless they had a valid ID on them. Since we are poorer than the average Traveller (which is why we were at the hostel in the first place), we could not afford another room somewhere else, and we had to wait 1-2 business days to get the money we had used to purchase the the room back on my card. After explaining all of this to the front desk, they still would not let us stay there, and instead, my friend and I had to stay in the park and sleep outside in the cold.… still would not let us stay there, and instead, my friend and I had to stay in the park and sleep outside in the cold.",1

"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,On Broadway,Friendly staff. Cute rooms. Great location. Good deal. I enjoyed reading their books. The Art is fantastic. I felt like I was in NYC in the 20’s. Not that I was alive then.. it reminds me of an Ella Fitzgerald record.,5
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Good location,"Location is perfect, 10 mins walk to 16th street mall, 5 mins walk to the museum quarter to include Denver Art Museum. Stayed for 3 nights, had my private room with double bed, quiet spacious with its own sink, study desk and cable TV.  Bathroom and toilet are shared but I never had to queue, they're standard & clean.Room is hot, no AC but fan is provided. Friday and Saturday night, the club across the street is super noisy with its music! Even when I closed my window, the noise stops at 2 am. Maybe rooms facing the other side are quieter? Please ask them!",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,"No frills, great value.","We loved this place for its location, in walking distance from great food, art, history and views.  Airport shuttles or buses are convenient. I will warn though, it isn't for everyone:  it is primarily a hostel, and very basic.  Heat in the winter but no air conditioning in summer (there are fans in every room though).  No maid service during short stays, and most private rooms have shared bathrooms down the hall but you can ask for a room with a bath.  Bring your own towels or rent them.  A few doors down is a convenience store where you can buy anything a normal hotel ordinarily supplies.  There is a community room where you can keep food in a fridge or cook.  The desk staff are very friendly and able to help you find whatever you need around the city.  If you want to save room money to spend on other things during your time in Denver, this is a great place!",4
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Fine cheap accommodation,"This accommodation is more hostel than hotel, so if you are expecting a hostel, you will be fine. The rooms are sparsely furnished but they are clean. My room was a bit noisy that is to the air conditioner outside, but it was a continuous noise so I could sleep. I probably would have given this a more negative review except that the price was cheap, the location excellent and the staff really nice anf helpful.",3
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Extremely rude!! Terrible!,"If you want to be treated like garbage, go to this hotel. The night lady screamed and cursed at us while my 5 month old son was sleeping strapped to me. When we told her she was rude and that our baby was sleeping, she got in my face and screamed more, then threatened to call the cops and told us to leave the hotel immediately. Then later told us to ""go to your room."" I've never been treated so rudely in my life for a simple misunderstanding.",1
"Denver, CO",11th Avenue Hostel,Room okay but location was too noisy- no sleep,"We booked a private room (unfortunately only had the shared bath option). We had tours planned all day so didn't want to spend above a 100$/night just to sleep in.. Yes sleep is all we wanted. Out of the 3 nights we didn't get a wink of sleep on any of the nights, because of loud thumping music blasting from a neighboring disco that started from 9PM and ended after 3AM. We know the exact time because we were wide awake each night. There was no AC so we couldn't close the window either Apart from the discotheque music, drunk people (men and women) were shouting extremely loudly all night. The first night the cops came in at 3AM and quietened things down, so we hoped things would be better next night and took our chance to complete the stay- but that was a mistake.. After three nights of no sleep, we were ready to leave!!The room was clean and bathrooms surprising clean as well (considering they were unisex).The linens were old and smelly.. but didn't expect anything better since it was a hostel. On our last night the hot water was out, but it was warm outside so we took a cold shower. Its walking distance to many Denver attractions, so that way the location was very convenient for us.",3

Everything in the room worked. Bed very firm. HVAC worked well. Good complimentary internet and good Verizon signal strength  Phone based key never worked. Physical key didn't work and I had to go back to the desk for them to try again. You have to have a key to access the elevator to the upper floors.

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Very busy and seemingly understaffed hotel.,"I booked this Hampton Inn thinking that I was at the convention center location.  This hotel is not easily accessible to the true downtown area.  We stayed one night although we booked two.  This hotel is very clean and the breakfast was more than adequate.  The room I booked was a bi-level king room.  The bathroom was upstairs with the king bed and the downstairs had a full sized refrigerator, wet bar area, with a sleeper sofa and a chair.  At one point, I was witness to one of the staff at the front desk, Anastasia, take a thorough lashing from an unhappy guest that was perturbed about his room not being cleaned during the course of the day.  She was amazing in the fact that she managed to keep her cool. The guest was so irate I thought to tell him that he shouldn't take it out on her, she was just the person at the front desk, but she handled herself very well.  Due to price of parking and location, this just wasn't what we were looking for.  Mia at the front desk was also very nice, but I felt like these girls were frazzled by the incoming guests and the issues that were arising from housekeeping.  I probably wouldn't stay here again, but that is basically due to location.",3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Not your typical comfy Hampton beds!,"Upon arrival we paid to park and checked in. Lobby was decorated cute for Christmas, and check in was fine. We get to our room and it was average, until I noticed hairs on the shower curtain. We were all tired and just ready to go to bed, checked to be sure the sheets were clean after tarring the shower curtain, and they were! But these beds are definitely not what we were used to sleeping on at any Hampton! And we stay quite often. Extremely uncomfortable!

You can catch the #20 bus to Union Station and take the RTD to and from the airport. The hotel is nice. Very quiet. Staff is friendly. Bed slip did not fit the bed. Window was smudged and not cleaned despite repeated requests. Breakfast was good.

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,High Price for Volleyball Tournament - Overall Good Stay,"Traveled with our volleyball team from Texas to Denver. Overall good stay at this hotel. Above average breakfast with many options. Our team price was high and my family got stuck with a small double queen room while many others in our party had much bigger rooms (just a luck of the draw thing while checking in type of thing). Clean hotel and very friendly staff.   Parking - Downtown Denver hotels charge crazy prices everywhere. This hotel is no exception. $30 per night for an open lot beside the hotel. We opted to use SpotHero and park a three minute walk away in an open lot for $38 for the three days we were there. We were allowed in and out privileges. I used the out privilege once to get chicken wings at Wing Stop and restock at Safeway up the road.   In Room 224 - Large screen TV, Microwave, Fridge, Coffee Maker. Our bathroom door would not stay open - downward slope by the front door. Beds were comfortable - not too firm, nor too soft. Narrow room but comfortable. Coffee and Tea was available in the lobby AM and PM - loved that.   Used the gym once. One of the three treadmills did not have a functioning elevation option (a few of the dads did a WOD - thus the knowledge of one dysfunctional treadmills). Full rack of dumbbells. Multi-function weight station in the corner. Indoor pool on the same floor (basement) as the weight room.   Nearby restaurants. Up the street by our parking spot is a new restaurant named Campfire (something). It was good, but the portions were small. Full bar with many beer options. 5 to 10 minute walk to many restaurants near or on 16th Street.   Depending on when you go this hotel is either going to be a great deal or overpriced. For our stay it was overpriced but still a good experience. Don't know if we'll stay here again next year for the tournament, but if we do, I won't object.    The staff and the AM/PM coffee station were the highlights of our experience at this hotel.

Everything in the room worked. Bed very firm. HVAC worked well. Good complimentary internet and good Verizon signal strength  Phone based key never worked. Physical key didn't work and I had to go back to the desk for them to try again. You have to have a key to access the elevator to the upper floors.  Downtown location with lots of good dining spots within a 10 minute walk plus the 16th street mall with free bus service up and down the mall.  Lots of homeless people in area but no aggressive pan handling that I ran into. Also heavy police presence on the mall.  Most of the staff was friendly.  I would stay again.,3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Hampton stay,The staff was very helpful. The breakfast area was clean and organized and the food was good. The hotel is located in an area easy to access from union station via a hired car/ride. Based on the price I considered it a good value.,1
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Decent Hotel in a good location,"The hotel is in a very good location, everything was within walking distance. The staff was very friendly.

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Under much needed construction,"The location was good, close to downtown.  The 16th Street Mall, however needs to be avoided.  One has to run a gauntlet of so called homeless with hands out.  What a dump; the free bus to Union Station was great, too far for the bums to travel I would guess.",3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,"Great location, clean, but some issues","I was very pleased with the cleanliness of the room, linens, etc.  I did not like that the door allowed light and noise into the room from the hallway.  The security and valet situation made me uncomfortable checking in around 10pm on a weekend.  There was an unidentifiable man lurking near the front door when I pulled up. I decided to lock my car and go check in rather than try to use the valet service.  The man later appeared to be a taxi driver loitering in front of the building.  But he made no attempt to clarify who he was.  There were a few other men outside that made me uneasy as I walked into the lobby. A man who may have been security or a valet was alongside the back wall of the lobby and did not appear to be doing either job very well.  The desk clerk was friendly and relied on the hotel map to confirm my request for a quiet room. Unfor., the map did not accurately show the layout of the floor.  The door of my room allowed light and noise in and the wall was thin enough that music played at a low volume could be heard through the wall. I liked the appearance of the room, layout, and hotel location, but the noise and security mean I am likely to look elsewhere next time.",3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Just barely average ,When I checked in the trash hadn't been removed from the room but otherwise the room was clean. One day of my stay they forgot to service my room. The carpets are worn and fraying. The location was convenient. There are better hotels in the area for the same price range.,3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,A very nice hotel,"An excellent hotel, close to the attractions, but in great shape and quiet. The breakfast was very good.

What made the difference was the helpful and friendly staff. Kudos to Sara for working with us so amicably on the arrangements, and to Jeremy and Anastasia for cheerful assistance during the meeting.",5
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Check the fees before you book,"The parking situation was ridiculous. It should clearly state when booking a room that you either have to pay $30 for valet parking or take your chances trying to find metered parking on the street. And although you’re paying outrageous Hilton prices, you’re still only getting a Hampton level room with terrible amenities, bad tissue paper and in room coffee service with powdered creamer.",2
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,"Good visit, not perfect","As always, I'll tell you the good and the bad about our stay.  Good:-Great downtown location, quiet area-Many public parking lots/garages next to hotel if you wish to avoid paying the $30.00 valet fee the hotel charges.-Great room, huge sitting area.-Room was CLEAN.  -Bed was CLEAN and comfortable.-Bathroom was CLEAN.  -Hilton Honor digital key is always easy here.-Refrigerator and Microwave in room w/ counter and sink.-Main elevators require a key for every trip up, great security feature.Bad:-Breakfast food was average.-Breakfast area was a disaster, food on floor, not kept at all.  Surprising for a Hampton Inn-typically they're spotless.  -Fruit bowl containing the bananas were brown and were never touched in the four days we stayed there.  Disappointed again, time for new ones Hampton.-Over charged for parking.  Only parked for one night but was charged for multiple nights.Overall a good stay.  We're partial to Hampton and was surprised that Denver Hampton dropped the ball.  Besides the breakfast area and overcharging us on the parking (which was resolved after checking out and reviewing bill), the room was clean and we slept well.  I would visit here again but hope for a few fixes to be done.",4

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,High Price for Volleyball Tournament - Overall Good Stay,"Traveled with our volleyball team from Texas to Denver. Overall good stay at this hotel. Above average breakfast with many options. Our team price was high and my family got stuck with a small double queen room while many others in our party had much bigger rooms (just a luck of the draw thing while checking in type of thing). Clean hotel and very friendly staff.   Parking - Downtown Denver hotels charge crazy prices everywhere. This hotel is no exception. $30 per night for an open lot beside the hotel. We opted to use SpotHero and park a three minute walk away in an open lot for $38 for the three days we were there. We were allowed in and out privileges. I used the out privilege once to get chicken wings at Wing Stop and restock at Safeway up the road.   In Room 224 - Large screen TV, Microwave, Fridge, Coffee Maker. Our bathroom door would not stay open - downward slope by the front door. Beds were comfortable - not too firm, nor too soft. Narrow room but comfortable. Coffee and Tea was available in the lobby AM and PM - loved that.   Used the gym once. One of the three treadmills did not have a functioning elevation option (a few of the dads did a WOD - thus the knowledge of one dysfunctional treadmills). Full rack of dumbbells. Multi-function weight station in the corner. Indoor pool on the same floor (basement) as the weight room.   Nearby restaurants. Up the street by our parking spot is a new restaurant named Campfire (something). It was good, but the portions were small. Full bar with many beer options. 5 to 10 minute walk to many restaurants near or on 16th Street.   Depending on when you go this hotel is either going to be a great deal or overpriced. For our stay it was overpriced but still a good experience. Don't know if we'll stay here again next year for the tournament, but if we do, I won't object.

If I ever stay at a HI in the future, I will go out and buy my own pillow for the stay.The room was exactly as I booked - as a Diamond HH guest this was a little disappointing as our travel mate booked the same type of room as us and was upgraded (as a Gold HH) to a much larger room - there's something wrong there in the method (if any) of how upgrades are allocated.75% of the front desk staff I interacted with were wonderful, the other acted as though she had been force fed a sack of lemons right before work started - quite sour, not rude as such.",3

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Average Hampton Inn,This was a typical Hampton Inn. Average but far from outstanding breakfast. Comfortable lobby. Relatively new appearing rooms. Everything in the room worked. Bed very firm. HVAC worked well. Good complimentary internet and good Verizon signal strength  Phone based key never worked. Physical key didn't work and I had to go back to the desk for them to try again. You have to have a key to access the elevator to the upper floors.  Downtown location with lots of good dining spots within a 10 minute walk plus the 16th street mall with free bus service up and down the mall.  Lots of homeless people in area but no aggressive pan handling that I ran into. Also heavy police presence on the mall.  Most of the staff was friendly.  I would stay again.,3

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,High Price for Volleyball Tournament - Overall Good Stay,"Traveled with our volleyball team from Texas to Denver. Overall good stay at this hotel. Above average breakfast with many options.

Clean hotel and very friendly staff. Parking - Downtown Denver hotels charge crazy prices everywhere. This hotel is no exception. $30 per night for an open lot beside the hotel. We opted to use SpotHero and park a three minute walk away in an open lot for $38 for the three days we were there. We were allowed in and out privileges. I used the out privilege once to get chicken wings at Wing Stop and restock at Safeway up the road. In Room 224 - Large screen TV, Microwave, Fridge, Coffee Maker. Our bathroom door would not stay open - downward slope by the front door. Beds were comfortable - not too firm, nor too soft. Narrow room but comfortable. Coffee and Tea was available in the lobby AM and PM - loved that. Used the gym once. One of the three treadmills did not have a functioning elevation option (a few of the dads did a WOD - thus the knowledge of one dysfunctional treadmills). Full rack of dumbbells. Multi-function weight station in the corner. Indoor pool on the same floor (basement) as the weight room. Nearby restaurants. Up the street by our parking spot is a new restaurant named Campfire (something). It was good, but the portions were small. Full bar with many beer options. 5 to 10 minute walk to many restaurants near or on 16th Street. Depending on when you go this hotel is either going to be a great deal or overpriced. For our stay it was overpriced but still a good experience. Don't know if we'll stay here again next year for the tournament, but if we do, I won't object.

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Thanks Hampton Inn for the $25.00 Parking Tkt and blaming Trip Advisor for not being able to credit acct,"I used Trip Advisor to select the Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown due to mostly positive reviews, reasonable price and courteous staff.  Staff was the finally decision maker because I knew we would be checking in late.  Unfortunately that staff is what caused my brother and I to get hit with a $25 parking ticket.My brother and I were staying in Denver for 1 night - 8 hours to be exact - as we arrived at the Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown around 10:30pm Thursday night  8/27 and had to depart for the airport by 7:00a.m. the next morning.Earlier in the day I called ahead and explained that we would be checking in late.  There was no mention of parking that late or the garage issues we may encounter.When I reached the front desk to check in, the night person checked me in quickly but explained that their garage was full so we would not be able to park in the garage for free.  Instead we had to either pay $13 for the overnight parking next store or we could park on the street.  She explained the meters are free after 8pm.  As we were only staying for a 8 hours we decided to park the rental car on the street.I headed back outside to inform my brother when we came across another Hamptons Inn employee outside.  This individual was not helpful at all as to where we should park simply suggested we try Sherman or 19th streets and that all meters were free after 8pm.  The Hamptons Inn employee did not mention that certain meters were not free or that we should avoid other streets close to the hotel.I proceeded to unload the luggage from the car, going inside and getting the luggage trolley with no offer of help from either/any staff person and rolled the luggage up to the room.My brother made two right turns and parked at a meter on Lincoln Street for the night as there were no spaces on Sherman or 19th. Room was neat and clean.  No issues.Next morning we checked out at 7a.m. and found a ticket for $25 on the windshield.  The ticket was issued at 2:45a.m.  Apparently the meters are not free.  You have to pay for the entire period of time you park at them after 8pm. - they are just not limited to 1 hour.  The meters are not clearly marked and we called the parking authority to dispute.When I called Hamptons Inn shortly after receiving the ticket and spoke to the manager she was friendly, but basically said that she could not do anything about crediting me back the $25 because I booked my hotel through Trip Advisor.So I am now out the $25 because of a Hamptons Inn's full parking lot, bad information from a hotel employee and Hamptons Inn blaming Trip Advisor for the reason why my credit card can not be credit the $25 ticket.Since this forum is now my only recourse I hope people read this and do not make the same mistake by heeding my warming about the meters, the staff at the Hamptons Inn and Hampton Inn's claim that they could not credit the room because it was booked through Trip Advisor.",3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Bugs,"I stayed at this hotel at the insistence of my company. Apparently they have negotiated rates. I booked a five day stay. After the first night there, I awoke to find a roach in the bathroom. After the second night, I got in the shower to find a large spider looking insect with extremely long, skinny legs hanging on the shower curtain. Both instances were reported to the front desk however they did not attempt to make any type of compensation for me except to remove the bugs from the room. The morning of my last days stay, I decided to partake in the buffet breakfast for the first time. I took a bite of potatoes and found a long hair in it. Will never stay at this hotel again.",2

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Did I Ask for a 5AM Wake-Up Call?,A very nice Hampton Inn in downtown Denver. My room was very quiet - which I have found is rare for Hamptons! I enjoyed walking to the 16th Street Mall and to Coors Field. The breakfast was average. I chose to pay for Valet parking to save time and the hassle since parking is non-existent. The only BIG draw back for my visit was the 5 AM fire alarm going off! The only explanation was from the Fire Dept who said it had been an alarm malfunction  -there was no explanation from the management or expression of regret for the inconvenience.,3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,One of the worst hotel experiences in the last several years,"1. Unusual Wake-up Call I was awakened early in the morning by a loud, metallic vibrating noise coming from the a/c unit every 10-20 seconds. I finally just got up and took a shower. 15 minutes later when I was just about to call the desk, it stopped. Of course.2. Revolting FoodWhy would any hotel assume that all travelers want super spicy ""Tex-Mex"" style eggs? If someone wants spicy, put some hot sauces out. Just thoughtless. Got the eggs anyway. And with the first bite, pulled out a long hair. Gross.Moreover, one of the cut-up fruits had gone bad. And the cream for the coffee was sour. Walked out.3. Signs of Poor MaintenanceI've stayed in Hilton flags before and am familiar with the ""arty"" placards mounted on the insidde of the elevator doors. Not necessary but fine. These were peeled back at the edges and made the place feel shabby, like no one cares. If you can't maintain your posters, just take em down.4. No Morning NewspapersAll hotels provide this as a basic service. The person at the desk just shrugged and said the delivery was unpredictable.. No suggestion as to where to buy one.

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Great choice for a nite.,"It was not too far to the 16th street mall, but not something we’d want to do at night. Subway subs is across the street.

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Horrible Service. Overcharged Me $300+.,"I was overcharged by over $300 and they couldn’t tell me why. I got three different charges: one at check in, during the stay, and upon checkout. It took about an hour at checkout to get to any kind of resolution, and it took three different people to help. I wasn’t greeted as a Hilton Honors member upon check in. The service was terrible. The staff could barely direct me to where we could get additional help or a razor. The night shift staff guy could never answer a simple question and looked upset when we asked him if he could find out from someone. I won’t be recommending this hotel to even my worst enemy.",1
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Great spot,We were a party of 5. Typically its hard to find accommodations to sleep 5 especially in the heart of a big city. Room was amazing! 2 stories (which the kids loved) and 2 full bathrooms. Location was great. Walking distance to restaurants and a grocery store. I'd love to stay here again!!,5
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Nice Hotel at Reasonable Price in the Heart of Downtown Denver.,"We arrived very late (early in morning). The staff was professional and very helpful. The location is perfect if you are going to downtown Denver. Parking was at an additional cost (in a lot adjacent to the hotel), but was only $5 per day due to the weekend. I believe the parking meters are free on the weekend. The rooms were comfortable. The staff at checkout was also very professional. I would definitely stay here again.",5

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Hampton Inn Uptown,This hotel isn't in downtown. It's in Uptown-a cute neighborhood northeast from downtown. The area is full of interesting shops and restaurants. You can walk to downtown but you are away from the touristy and not very interesting 16th Mall Street area. You can catch the #20 bus to Union Station and take the RTD to and from the airport. The hotel is nice. Very quiet. Staff is friendly. Bed slip did not fit the bed. Window was smudged and not cleaned despite repeated requests. Breakfast was good. Will return since the only other hotel in the area--the Warwick --charges a resort fee and puts food for sale in the room. ( I don't like either.),5
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,High Price for Volleyball Tournament - Overall Good Stay,"Traveled with our volleyball team from Texas to Denver. Overall good stay at this hotel. Above average breakfast with many options. Our team price was high and my family got stuck with a small double queen room while many others in our party had much bigger rooms (just a luck of the draw thing while checking in type of thing). Clean hotel and very friendly staff.   Parking - Downtown Denver hotels charge crazy prices everywhere. This hotel is no exception. $30 per night for an open lot beside the hotel. We opted to use SpotHero and park a three minute walk away in an open lot for $38 for the three days we were there. We were allowed in and out privileges. I used the out privilege once to get chicken wings at Wing Stop and restock at Safeway up the road.   In Room 224 - Large screen TV, Microwave, Fridge, Coffee Maker. Our bathroom door would not stay open - downward slope by the front door. Beds were comfortable - not too firm, nor too soft. Narrow room but comfortable. Coffee and Tea was available in the lobby AM and PM - loved that.   Used the gym once. One of the three treadmills did not have a functioning elevation option (a few of the dads did a WOD - thus the knowledge of one dysfunctional treadmills). Full rack of dumbbells. Multi-function weight station in the corner. Indoor pool on the same floor (basement) as the weight room.   Nearby restaurants. Up the street by our parking spot is a new restaurant named Campfire (something). It was good, but the portions were small. Full bar with many beer options. 5 to 10 minute walk to many restaurants near or on 16th Street.   Depending on when you go this hotel is either going to be a great deal or overpriced. For our stay it was overpriced but still a good experience. Don't know if we'll stay here again next year for the tournament, but if we do, I won't object.    The staff and the AM/PM coffee station were the highlights of our experience at this hotel.

"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Won’t be paying to stay at this one again.,"The floor in the bathroom was dirty when we arrived. I didn’t get a Hilton honors bag and had to ask for one later that night. We had to pay for parking and didn’t realize that we could only pay until 6am until I had already paid. (Who wants to get up at 6am on their vacation to move a car?)  The hotel in Albuquerque I stayed at was amazing in every way and I wanted to become a Hilton honors member because of it and comparatively, this Hilton missed the mark. Better than a motel 6 but nowhere near of the level of the Hilton in Albuquerque. Pathetic for almost $200 a night",2
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Disappointed in this property.,We had a two-story suite that was extremely dark. The furnishings were substandard. We ended up not even using the lower floor because it was so depressing. The hotel was chilly throughout. We had a guaranteed 3 pm arrival time but our room was not available until 4 pm.,2
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Stay in Downtown Denver,"The beds are terrible and the service was poor. I would never stay at this hotel again. The location was poor and we were uncomfortable with walking to downtown areas of interest. Breakfast was included in the room rate, but was almost uneatable. We ate an apple. (The pile of bananas were rotten)",1
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Take your chance. Catch this one on sale only.,"No meat at breakfast.This was the smallest Hamptons inn breakfast ever. My room heater did not work on my bottom floor of my room. very very cold in the winter in Denver. Uncomfortably cold. I spent the stay upstairs for most of my trip. Which was a waste of the $400 spent. I could have stayed at a basic Hampton Inn for half the price. Better breakfast. Better room. Without the huge Valet charge for DAY INSTEAD OF PER STAY. Had they explained this before. I would not have rented a car. The night light upstairs was broken and the fridge door was faulty aka opened on it's own. I had to prop a trash can in front to keep my salad and fruits from spoiling. The shower handle was broken. The cap was off. I told and shown the front desk. They did not care about the maintenance. Didn't offer to fix, repair, or replace. So I ask myself why did I pay $400 for a bed and shower? 1 star for location. That's all I can say. I'm overwhelmed by all this. As my wife. We both decided not to make too big a deal. But here we are.",3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Average Hampton Inn,This was a typical Hampton Inn. Average but far from outstanding breakfast. Comfortable lobby. Relatively new appearing rooms. Everything in the room worked. Bed very firm. HVAC worked well. Good complimentary internet and good Verizon signal strengthPhone based key never worked. Physical key didn't work and I had to go back to the desk for them to try again. You have to have a key to access the elevator to the upper floors.Downtown location with lots of good dining spots within a 10 minute walk plus the 16th street mall with free bus service up and down the mall.Lots of homeless people in area but no aggressive pan handling that I ran into. Also heavy police presence on the mall.Most of the staff was friendly.I would stay again.,3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Not a Recommendation,"The beds are not Hampton quality, the hot tub sucks the bath tub would have been better and they don't pay attention to notes that the staff entered into the notes on the computer, as stated in the check in process.  The shower had no pressure and the adjustment was either all hot or all cold.",2
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Issues with staff,"We experienced the most rude person I have ever encountered at a Hampton Inn. We usually have great service, but the lady checking in that evening was disrespectful and arrogant. I would stay there again as long as I'm not dealing with her. The manager I spoke with the next day was apologetic and took care of everything from that point.",3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Nice but do your home work,"Location is just close and just far enough from main downtown. If you want to be in the middle of everything not the place, if youre ok walking a few blocks to get there this might be it. The hotel wont mention it, on weekends meters in the area are free. They would prefer you pay the $20 a day valet fee. Sign in lobby suggest parking options that are not the same for weekends, meters by hour are actually free and parking lots are half price, their price remains same as weekdays. Rooms are nice, location good, parking sucks.",3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,Great downtown location but  . . .,"The location of this downtown HI&S puts you within 3 - 4   blocks of the 16th Street Mall where there are a myriad of stores and restuarants to choose from. Not sure the age of this property but it appears relatively new as all the public areas and room accomodations are in good condition and well maintained. The lobby is relatively small but it serves the purpose. Valet parking only at $20/night.So what separates a HI&S from its peers and makes a traveler like myself rave about a property is THE STAFF - the men and women charged with making maybe only a one night stay a truly memorable experience. This is where this property needs serious improvement.For example:1. As an Honors member they did not accommodate my room preferences as other properties always do. They did not offer a room upgrade or even a simple bottle of water to compensate. Instead, I was left with only a few room choices the best of which was on the back side of the bldg. facing the wall of the adjoining building. This is not the Hilton Honors way. The room itself was fine except for no exhaust in the bathrooms. 2. When I needed my car from valet parking, I personally handed my claim ticket to the young man behind the front desk and waited for his return. He returned and instead of personally handing me the keys with ""have a nice day "" etc., he walked right past me and dropped them off at the front desk where I then had to request them. He was oblivious to how this situation should have been handled.3. The two mornings we had breakfast the eating area was a disaster. Food was all over the floor, tables were not wiped, the trash cans were overflowing and they RAN OUT OF COFFEE. On top of that, other hotel team members (including managers) casually walked past all these issues, didn't jump in to personally help or even redirect others to remedy until a hotel guest brought it to their attention. In the hospitality business it all eyes and ears on the guest - something this team needs to better understand.Summary: the location here is good and so are the accomodations but reserve here knowing that you will not be serviced like you should when spending in excess of $ 200/night. The team at a HI&S in Missouri we stayed in recently and which cost us less than $ 100/night ran rings around this team. This team is unattentive, lacks casual engagement with the guests, is impersonal and in serious need of training to meet Hilton standards.",3
"Denver, CO",Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Downtown,"Very dark room, but good value","Hotel was more than adequate for my stay, staff were friendly and the hotel was clean. Reasonable breakfast as well (by non-UK standards anyway!). It was also very reasonable for a hotel so close to downtown. However, it may have just been the side of the hotel I was staying on but the room was so dark even with the curtains/blinds open. Even with the lights on, it was quite a depressing room to be in. In addition, again it may have just been my room but the air conditioning unit was incredibly loud, every 45 minutes or so throughout the night it sounded like a 747 was coming into land through the window. I was only here for one night so didn't make a fuss, but had I been there for longer I would've wanted it either fixing or moving to a different room. Still, for the money I can't complain too much and would probably stay here again and hope that I got a better room next time.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Holiday visit  ,"We live in the area and love to do a family staycation downtown each year for the holidays. Location is great, right on the 16th street mall and near the city and county building, which has a great light display. This year was like no other and first time for us downtown in nearly nine months. While things have certainly changed with this pandemic Marriott did not. While the hotel itself is old, it has been recently renovated and has some of the biggest rooms downtown. Very nice. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to frequenting downtown as we hope to turn the corner on this mess. We love our tourism industry and can’t wait to support it!",4
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,The gym is AWESOME,"It’s a full size gym with all the machines and free weight you could possibly need! I was in there on. Saturday mid morning and had the place to myself. Definitely in my happy place! They provide foam rollers, mats, big stability balls, tons of plates, Smith machine,...I really can’t say enough about this facility. Plus it was clean and had plenty of cleaning wipes and towels.",5
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Outstanding Staff & Hotel,"It has been a while since I have been back to this Sheraton downtown.  It looks like they are doing a little remodeling (as of September 2020) and it looks like it will be nice.  The hotel is very spacious and clean. I was surprised at how clean it was and not once did I see a housekeeping or cleaning crew!  Our first impression was a good one.  We were met at the desk by Veronica from Ecuador.  She was very helpful with local area information as well as directions to our elevators/rooms.  She also explained the dining area which was very helpful.  I was really impressed at her friendliness and professionalism.  She was very nice and I hope that this Sheraton recognizes her as an outstanding Ambassador for their awesome hotel chain.  It doesn't matter how nice a hotel is; but with a profession staff, that is the icing on the cake!  Well done Veronica and thank you for welcoming us!The clean and long hallways are the first thing you will notice when you get off the elevators. There are plenty of signs to direct you in the right direction.  Once in the room, I was very impressed. This is definitely one of the cleanest and nicest rooms that I have stayed in and all of the necessary amenities were there.  I always notice the door locks for security.  I like their secondary locks.  Next was the air conditioner controls. They were easy to control and they accurately kept the set temperature.  One thing that I just NEVER see in hotels anymore are microwaves.  This room had one!!!  That is really great for warming up food to eat later.  I also loved the electrical outlets on the sides of the bed!  I normally only see that in Europe!  The flat screen was nice and it has plenty of channels to choose from.  There is a guide on the TV itself, but it would be nice if there was a pamphlet with the TV stations listed.  That would make selections easier.The bathroom was large and the counter space was plentiful enough to store all toiletries.  The showers have large glass doors that is much nicer than the ones with the curtains that tend to drag in the shower and create tripping hazards.  There is plenty to do around the local area and lots of places to eat.  For breakfast, there is an area in the middle just across from the front desk that can provide coffee, breakfast sandwiches, etc.  Overall, this is a very nice hotel and I'm looking forwards to my next visit.  It doesn't matter if you want to hit the road running or just relaxing after a long business day. This hotel provides all options!  If you have any questions, but sure to ask the awesome staff and say hello to Veronica!I'd highly recommend this hotel to all of my friends!",5
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"My ""birthday getaway""",The hotel staff are very robotic and rude. I had to pay for two rooms and only got to check into one of them and I have not been refunded for the room that was unoccupied all night long.

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Wonderful stay!,"Our room was so comfy and cute! We stopped in to break up a 2 week long trip in a camper van, and let me tell you, it did the trick!! We ate at the yardbird restaurant attached to the hotel, SO DELICIOUS!! I highly recommend the ahi tuna nachos. We can’t stop talking about them!  Everything was clean and everyone was friendly. Hope you guys enjoy your stay as much as we did!",5
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"Good location, OK hotel but pricey","The Downtown Sheraton is a large hotel and conference center.  The rooms are OK, not great and it is expensive for what you get.   There is construction going on what used to be the main lobby and on the third floor there is a walkway leading over to the main convention area and the tower of the hotel. Everything is an added $$.  If you want the continental breakfast it is an additional $30. You can find cheaper breakfasts around the hotel and across the street. Parking is an additional $40 per day. (Most large hotels in city charge around $20.) I would avoid bringing a car and use public transportation.  Parking at one of the park and ride parking lots and taking light rail or bus would be much cheaper than paying for parking at the hotel.The cleaning of the room was OK, but I had a placard on the door (the one's showing exits in case of a fire) and it dropped off the door in the middle of the night and woke me up.  I placed it next to the door, thinking housekeeping might take care of it, but nope.  I had to report it when I left. My main concern is I never felt safe walking to my room.  Because the hotel is a convention center, the hallways are very long and have several turns. With the construction on the main floors, there was a constant sense of many people walking through the building. There were several loud groups hanging out in the hallway late at night as well making it hard to sleep. I had stayed here before for another convention and not felt unsafe but I did this time and I would not stay here again until the construction was over.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Lipstick on a Pig,"I’ll start by saying that as I checked in, the staff was really nice.  People who work here seem to beautify what lies beneath.  This is a property that needs help.  First is it’s ability to take care of some insect issues.  Nothing can hide this.  Rooms have a musty smell - which means either the carpeting or bed needs to be replaced.  One colleague of mine was not able to have hot water delivered to his shower.  In my shower, a pump would turn on in the wall - making a loud sound and constant sputtering of water.  A lot needs to be done with this space.  It’s in a good location, but updates are drastically needed.",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,JUST DON'T DO IT,"Arrived late at night, poor staff, rude.  Sketchy people lurking around.   Parking lot is so far from the lobby.  Went to check in had issues ended up leaving and then still was charged $12.00 to get out of the parking garage for 20 minutes.  Had great success speaking with Marriott Bonvoy Customer Care.  They were wonderful to solve the situation and moved me to another hotel in the downtown area.   Much nicer too.",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Great location! ,"Stayed here on my 4 day trip to Denver with my boyfriend & we have no complaints. The rooms were clean, it was super close to everything & the concierge was very helpful. He recommended quite a few places to eat at & we weren’t disappointed. Take note- the elevators are a little confusing",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Security staff profiling,"I was out smoking and it was very cold so I had a couple jackets on.  As I walked back in, the security stopped me and asked if I was staying at the hotel.  The security person would not leave me alone until I told him what room I was in.  Not sure if he thought I was homeless since it was 5 degrees outside and I have jackets on and it was about 11pm.  His approach made it seem like he already had determined I did not belong in the hotel.  Will not be back, there are a lot of other nicer hotels with more hospitality in the area.  Sheraton should be a last resort. Check in personnel are very nice and friendly but security staff need some training.",1

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,No flexibility in hard times,"Given the Coronavirus concern, I tried to call in to cancel my reservation on the day checkin. A few hours ago national emergency was declared and all flights are readily giving credits but the Sheraton Denver manager would not budge.  On top of that she tells me that I would’ve made an exception if I would’ve called 24 hours before. I am like no mam, that would’ve been allowed in policy per my rate, but I am requesting you to make an exception given the circumstances. No help from their side. This is when I am a titanium elite member with them. It’s times like this when you can show compassion but you guys failed.  Had to finally call Marriott customer service who helped.",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Staff not helpful at all!!,"I am attending a rather large conference next week. Understanding there are two ""towers"" and lots of construction going on I called a head to ask that my room be in the same tower as the conference and that I be closer to the elevator, due to some mobility issues. No one (front desk or sales) could even tell me which tower the conference is in. I was also told there is no way to be sure I can the location I am requesting. ""There are 1500 rooms in this hotel and we can not promise you anything! We noted your request but there are no guarantees."" I explained I would not be getting there until 11 PM and would be unable to walk a very long distance to a room. Was there no way to reserve a room nearer the elevators? NOPE!  Not helpful and not looking forward to this stay.",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Water temperature fluctuations,"The hotel has major water temperature problems.  First, it can take upwards of 5 minutes before hot water ever reaches your shower head.  I called the front desk and was told to give it 10 minutes and if still no hot water to call back.  10 minutes!!  Talk about a waste of water.Once hot water reached your shower the temperature fluctuated from warm to scalding hot.  There was no warning, just hot to cold to hot to cold to hot.  Front desk acts like it's isolated yet read here and you'll see it is a major problem.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Cold showers and no Taxis ,"This hotel is under major renovations and there is a lot of construction activity.  Every morning there was no hot water in the shower.  When it was time to leave there also no taxis available at the hotel.  As a result I almost missed my flight and had to pay $$$ for an Uber,",2

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Outstanding Staff & Hotel,"It has been a while since I have been back to this Sheraton downtown.  It looks like they are doing a little remodeling (as of September 2020) and it looks like it will be nice.    The hotel is very spacious and clean. I was surprised at how clean it was and not once did I see a housekeeping or cleaning crew!  Our first impression was a good one.  We were met at the desk by Veronica from Ecuador.  She was very helpful with local area information as well as directions to our elevators/rooms.  She also explained the dining area which was very helpful.  I was really impressed at her friendliness and professionalism.  She was very nice and I hope that this Sheraton recognizes her as an outstanding Ambassador for their awesome hotel chain.  It doesn't matter how nice a hotel is; but with a profession staff, that is the icing on the cake!  Well done Veronica and thank you for welcoming us!  The clean and long hallways are the first thing you will notice when you get off the elevators. There are plenty of signs to direct you in the right direction.  Once in the room, I was very impressed. This is definitely one of the cleanest and nicest rooms that I have stayed in and all of the necessary amenities were there.  I always notice the door locks for security.  I like their secondary locks.  Next was the air conditioner controls. They were easy to control and they accurately kept the set temperature.    One thing that I just NEVER see in hotels anymore are microwaves.  This room had one!!!  That is really great for warming up food to eat later.  I also loved the electrical outlets on the sides of the bed!  I normally only see that in Europe!    The flat screen was nice and it has plenty of channels to choose from.  There is a guide on the TV itself, but it would be nice if there was a pamphlet with the TV stations listed.  That would make selections easier.  The bathroom was large and the counter space was plentiful enough to store all toiletries.  The showers have large glass doors that is much nicer than the ones with the curtains that tend to drag in the shower and create tripping hazards.    There is plenty to do around the local area and lots of places to eat.  For breakfast, there is an area in the middle just across from the front desk that can provide coffee, breakfast sandwiches, etc.    Overall, this is a very nice hotel and I'm looking forwards to my next visit.  It doesn't matter if you want to hit the road running or just relaxing after a long business day. This hotel provides all options!  If you have any questions, but sure to ask the awesome staff and say hello to Veronica!  I'd highly recommend this hotel to all of my friends!… with a profession staff, that is the icing on the cake!  Well done Veronica and thank you for welcoming us!

This year was like no other and first time for us downtown in nearly nine months. While things have certainly changed with this pandemic Marriott did not. While the hotel itself is old, it has been recently renovated and has some of the biggest rooms downtown. Very nice.

Rooms have a musty smell - which means either the carpeting or bed needs to be replaced.  One colleague of mine was not able to have hot water delivered to his shower.  In my shower, a pump would turn on in the wall - making a loud sound and constant sputtering of water.    A lot needs to be done with this space.

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,needs updating / customer service,"The room I stayed is outdated, the bathroom tub faucet drips which has a rusted stain depicting this.

Staff not friendly does not engage with guests (I said good morning ) no response or reply. crickets... Marriott rule 5-10 feet engage with staff. I had several concerns however no one took ownership, it was easier to push the opportunity to someone else.I left my key and ID in the room went to desk and  had my I phone with me Identification, plus picture (on phone) , I had show my Facebook page, photo with my name, given my Marriott Id ect.. which it would have been simpler to have security to go with me to my room to get my ID which I suggested when I arrived at the desk.

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Disappointing,"Paid 200+ a night, scheduled for about four or five nights. Got a hotel room smaller than many hundred dollar hotels, with rather uncomfortable bed. Thrown in the side tower building for an extra distance stroll and seven floors away, then given a rather insulting room size- twice the size of the bathroom that only had enough standing space for two people. Moreover, the two beds I scheduled for cosplay arrangement room was downgraded to single bed for some reason?! If there's any saving grace good natured staff and clean bedroom.

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,No flexibility in hard times,"Given the Coronavirus concern, I tried to call in to cancel my reservation on the day checkin. A few hours ago national emergency was declared and all flights are readily giving credits but the Sheraton Denver manager would not budge.  On top of that she tells me that I would’ve made an exception if I would’ve called 24 hours before. I am like no mam, that would’ve been allowed in policy per my rate, but I am requesting you to make an exception given the circumstances. No help from their side. This is when I am a titanium elite member with them. It’s times like this when you can show compassion but you guys failed.  Had to finally call Marriott customer service who helped.",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Staff not helpful at all!!,"I am attending a rather large conference next week. Understanding there are two ""towers"" and lots of construction going on I called a head to ask that my room be in the same tower as the conference and that I be closer to the elevator, due to some mobility issues. No one (front desk or sales) could even tell me which tower the conference is in. I was also told there is no way to be sure I can the location I am requesting. ""There are 1500 rooms in this hotel and we can not promise you anything! We noted your request but there are no guarantees."" I explained I would not be getting there until 11 PM and would be unable to walk a very long distance to a room. Was there no way to reserve a room nearer the elevators? NOPE!  Not helpful and not looking forward to this stay.",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Cold showers and no Taxis ,"This hotel is under major renovations and there is a lot of construction activity.

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Lipstick on a Pig,"I’ll start by saying that as I checked in, the staff was really nice.  People who work here seem to beautify what lies beneath.  This is a property that needs help.  First is it’s ability to take care of some insect issues.  Nothing can hide this.  Rooms have a musty smell - which means either the carpeting or bed needs to be replaced.  One colleague of mine was not able to have hot water delivered to his shower.  In my shower, a pump would turn on in the wall - making a loud sound and constant sputtering of water.    A lot needs to be done with this space.  It’s in a good location, but updates are drastically needed.",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,It should not be named Sheraton,An hotel which is correct apparently . However You have water falling or leaking in various places in the hallways. The smell of moisture in the room was strong and when I mentioned this to the cleaning lady  ( at least that is her title even if the cleaning was approximate) she told me to ask the front desk and that someone will come and vaporize something in my room to cover the odor.My room was supposed to be a room for handicaped person even if I am not handicaped but the door is so heavy and difficult to push that I do not know how an handicapped person can use itOtherwise the concierge is nice when you can find him and he is often away.,2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,This place is a dump.,"The rooms are small with small windows.   We booked a 610 SF corner suite, and they put us in a tiny 130SF room with little windows for over $300/night.    Also, they forgot to clean 1 day, even though we called twice.   Out toilet was broken.   Room Service was like fast food with plastic flatware. Badly needs updating.Don't stay here!",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Sad business hotel,"Yes, it’s a business hotel. Two towers worth.  But sad.... needs updating.

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Travelers Beware- Pictures are deceiving!,"If you are looking for an upscale, CLEAN, modern room do not stay here! Pictures on website and internet are VERY misleading- what you see is NOT what you get. I am not usually the type to write a review or to complain, but my family was thoroughly disappointed with our accommodation at this hotel. This was our first and last time to stay at any Sheraton hotel. I hope to save someone else the headache, money & disappointment by writing this review. We booked for a 2 night stay & were Initially checked into an extremely small & DIRTY king room on the 17th floor (mind you we have a family of 4), after being sold a $45 dollar (per night) upgrade fee. The room had a terrible musty smelled mixed with an over powering cologne smell over the top, the AC appeared to not be functioning and there was dirty qtips on the floor. 🤢I called down to the front desk and we were apologized to and moved to what was apparently considered one of their ""suites"" on the 19th floor. This room did have spectacular views (would be more spectacular if the windows were clean), but again the cleanliness was less then par. The room is very worn and dated and has a few issues that are very concerning & potentially to someone's health! 1. The AC leaked and the carpet was completely  saturated and wet the entire stay-- I would not doubt this is where the mildew smell derives from. There was clearly water damage from the windows above as well. 2. The bathroom was not cleaned properly and the light fixture was broken on one side. The size of the bathroom is also ridiculous- very poor design. 3. The carpet, walls and wallpaper were filthy, worn and abused. 4. Glass on tables & mirrors were finger printed up & clearly had not been wiped prior to our arrival. 5. Furniture & bedding  was stained and had not been cleaned in who knows how long. 6. Remote worked 50% of the time for TV in ""suite"" area. 7. Hotel layout and overall elevator system is extremely confusing. 8. We got sold into purchasing an upgrade to apparently save us money and offer a fast running wifi- internet was the slowest I have ever seen-- ended up getting of of their wifi to even browse the web! I could not even load a photo onto my messaging. If you are looking to get your monies worth and to enjoy a nice place, please look further! This hotel ruined part of our trip as we had planned and looked forward to enjoying and spending quality time at what appeared to be a nice room--- front desk staff and employees all seemed to be very nice and helpful, but they all appear to also be aware of the negative aspects and MAJOR revamping this establishment needs- front desk manager also agreed that their pictures are deceiving and said the pictures you see are ""model"" rooms, not what you will actually will be staying in. If you wanna pay 5 star prices with 1 star quality this is your place, if you're looking for quality and CLEANLINESS, do your research beyond being sold on MISLEADING non exsistent rooms presented in their photos.",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Allergies beware - All rooms are pet friendly!,"Overall mediocre stay for a business conference. Requested a non-pet friendly room because I have asthma/allergies, and was notified that all rooms are pet-friendly.  This is not ideal and is frankly a liability given that rooms are fully carpeted and blankets are not cleaned between guests.  Room smelled of mildew and the desk did not have any electronic outlets, so was not very useful for doing work.  The air conditioning was very noisy and turned on and off all through the night. I called and requested a new room daily for 3 days in a row, and was told no room was available. Was on 2nd floor, view was of a wall.",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Rooms are tired and dark,"The desk staff at check in were very nice and helpful. For the price, the room was very disappointing. The hotel has two building and in one of the buildings a large number of the rooms look into a large interior light well that doesn’t offer much light. That made the rooms feel dark even during the day. While rooms feel clean it all felt a bit dated. Unless you are a fan of chain restaurants and stores the location is not all that special. While the hotel is on a predistrian mall. The restraurants are mainly big national chains and the shopes are fast fashion chains that are in every city in America. The hotel was full with people going to conferences in the hotel (which is why I was there) so I think the hotel can get away with the high room rate, but I suspect if I had done a bit of looking around I could of found other options within walking distance that felt more special or were a better value.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"I like the Place, but.....","We went for a play, ""Book of Mormon"" (a must see by the way) on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Upon arrival I was greeted by a very nice front desk lady and the process of checking in began. I had searched the hotel before coming to see what the going rate was on this particular day, and, I found it to be much cheaper than when I booked back in February. For whatever reason I still do not understand, they refused to just book me at the lower rate. Instead, I was to receive a few benefits to offset the cost. First one mentioned was complimentary Wi-Fi.....awesome. Some places charge $25 a day, especially the more luxury hotels. Well, come to find out, Wi-Fi is already complimentary anyway....fib # 1.As the booking progressed, I was then told that my parking would be reduced to $20 instead of the $40 they charge.....sweet. We had two vehicles and two rooms so she said just insert the card and all would be well. Well, upon leaving, the machine would not open the gate forcing me to use my credit card. Instead of $20 for parking, I paid $60, $20 on the bill, $40 at the gate, Times 2=$120 for 22 hours of parking.....Fib # 2.The last one was that we would have access to the 22nd floor lounge, a normally $50 charge to get in.  Anything I could find on it said absolutely nothing about a fee to get in and use the lounge.  We did not get to that point so I don't know if it would have worked or not, considering the track record so far, I'm thinking not. Listen, I love this hotel, I love the Yard House attached to it and I love the location, right where we want to be.But don't lie to me....It makes me seek out other places to stay/eat, plus, it's just bad business. It was a busy day and she said there were only two rooms left, ok, but why can't I just have the rooms I booked for the price posted online that day? On the HOTEL WEBSITE?  She said I could cancel that booking and make a new one, but was not going to be guaranteed I get the rooms I asked for, and, I may not get a room at all as they had experienced an influx of walk-ins that morning. It basically forced me to accept the higher cost booking I had made months ago. Seems very confusing, a bit shady and just not right. The way I see it, they owe me $80 for parking, $106 back on the two rooms, which that particular day, right on the hotel website, were going for &179. I paid $265 when all was said and done (212 room, 20 parking, 33 tax).Trying to get someone on the phone to work it out is IMPOSSIBLE...I sat on hold for 40 MINUTES the other day and never once did anyone come on the phone. I hung up and called back, waited another 15 minutes and hung up, I just don't have time for that. They have no email....well, they do show an address when they send you your bill of course, but it is not a deliverable address and replies get rejected.Disappointing stay for sure. Probably going to look at a different place next time, which saddens me. I know the hotel very well, know where to park efficiently and really like it overall, it's a great place which is why I stay there every time in town.I don't like being cheated though, so you've lost me.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Large impersonal hotel,Stayed here as part of a group tour. Room was nice up to date with plently of places to plug in . Nice in room coffee service with tea bags and Starbucks coffee. Good sized bathroom nicely fitted out. nice up market toilet items. Good view of city and Mts in the distance. Poll are was small and in the tower across the street but was nice and had a friendly bar.  Our room door did not close right at first and calls to the desk for maintence  went no wear until we went down in person after this the door was fixed quickly.  Staff was young friendly helpful but not well trained or experienced in the hotel trade,3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Tower Room: Dated and Dreary,"I don't know why you'd stay here unless you were attending a conference in the building or had some other need to be specifically at the Sheraton. It's a huge, charmless box of a hotel, and yeah, I suppose it's pretty centrally located downtown, but the rooms are outdated, frayed and a bit depressing. The wallpaper was stained in the room I stayed in, the carpet had seen better days and I nearly punctured my foot stepping on a staple that had not been cleaned from the floor (there was also a huge moth in the bathroom!). The room was a nice size, but beyond that....The elevators are super slow, too, which gets annoying. I happened to visit a friend who was at the Hyatt Regency down the street. and wish i'd stay there. While it also wouldn't have been my first choice, if you're looking for a big, brand-name hotel it's a little nicer. But why not stay someplace that has some personality or some local flavor? It's not the worst place to stay, but you could do better.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Great location to 16th Street Mall but that's all,"Let me first say that the location is hard to beat.  You have access to everything you would want on 16th including the great restaurants, bars, shopping, etc.  The walkability factor is really important to me as a business traveler.The hotel appears to have two towers with one being across the street.  After you check in, you either have to go outside to cross the street or take an elevator down the hall to the second floor and then cross over the pedestrian bridge.  I'm not sure if there was a way to just walk up stairs but I did not see it immediately so after a few days that got annoying.The room I got was uneventful.  It was a decent size, but it overlooked nothing but a roof top even though I was on the 9th floor.  Maybe I got this clunky room because I opted to not upgrade to a club level room for an extra $45 per day.  But the room served its purpose.I would say the only initial distasteful thing was that the bathroom was not cleaned very well.  And by this I mean after lifting the toilet seat, there were still urine stains from the previous guest on the rim.  Yes, it leaves an even grosser perception than it sounds in writing.  But I got over it and the rest of the stay was fine.  I opted for the ""green"" option so I did not use housekeeping services for the three nights I stayed and that was fine.The staff was friendly and they check on your often by text to see how you are doing.  That is a nice touch.Overall, I would stay here again if only for the location.  But honestly, I would likely try another hotel just the same.",3

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Lack of consideration for business travelers,"In the midst of a major conference that I was attending, management rented out the lobby dining area INCLUDING THE HOTEL'S BUSINESS CENTER to a private party at a time that was after-hours for the commercial business center that rents space in the hotel. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. I had urgent business to conduct but was told at 7pm that I would have to come back in an hour and a half. I went out to dinner and, on my return, asked the concierge if I could use the Business Center.  I was told that I could, but no sooner did I sit at a computer than an enraged, inebriated man approached me menacingly and snarled: ""Get out of here. I have rented this space for a private party."" Aside from my having been given the green light by the concierge, there were exactly FOUR PEOPLE in the entire area so there was NO REASON why this individual needed to preempt people from using the lobby business center at that time. I returned to the reception desk and was on the verge of being sent to the Tower Club Business Center, in an adjacent building, when I was informed that I could now use the lobby business center. Leaving aside the menacing behavior of the guest, this was profit-mongering at its worst by the hotel. It is entirely unprofessional for a major hotel hosting a large conference to place an essential resource such as this off-bounds to its guests.",3

The meeting rooms are far apart, and it is very hard to figure out where to find the next session.  You kind of feel like you are wandering in a maze, and the conference attendees have a look of confusion on their face as they try to find their way from one conference session to the next.(2) It would have really helped me to have a late checkout, but the hotel decided they would offer no late check outs.

It was more than fine, and was quite spacious. The fitness center deserves special praise: it was the largest, best equipped, and tidiest gym I have ever experienced at a non-resort (i.e. business) hotel. Lots of Hammer Strength, two(!!) double pulleys, a Smith machine, and dumbbells over 100 lbs. This is truly exceptional. I will echo a complaint seen in other reviews: The TV being parallel to the long axis of the bed is -- regardless of the structure of the room -- ridiculous. My number one complaint has nothing to do with my room, however: The signage in the hotel is not adequate given the labyrinthine nature of the twin-building setup.

The cleaning of the room was OK, but I had a placard on the door (the one's showing exits in case of a fire) and it dropped off the door in the middle of the night and woke me up.  I placed it next to the door, thinking housekeeping might take care of it, but nope.  I had to report it when I left.   My main concern is I never felt safe walking to my room.  Because the hotel is a convention center, the hallways are very long and have several turns.

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"My ""birthday getaway""",The hotel staff are very robotic and rude.

Also I spent half my night lost in the elevators because its like a labyrinth in the place! Outrageous!,1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,No flexibility in hard times,"Given the Coronavirus concern, I tried to call in to cancel my reservation on the day checkin. A few hours ago national emergency was declared and all flights are readily giving credits but the Sheraton Denver manager would not budge.  On top of that she tells me that I would’ve made an exception if I would’ve called 24 hours before. I am like no mam, that would’ve been allowed in policy per my rate, but I am requesting you to make an exception given the circumstances. No help from their side. This is when I am a titanium elite member with them. It’s times like this when you can show compassion but you guys failed.  Had to finally call Marriott customer service who helped.",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Staff not helpful at all!!,"I am attending a rather large conference next week. Understanding there are two ""towers"" and lots of construction going on I called a head to ask that my room be in the same tower as the conference and that I be closer to the elevator, due to some mobility issues. No one (front desk or sales) could even tell me which tower the conference is in. I was also told there is no way to be sure I can the location I am requesting. ""There are 1500 rooms in this hotel and we can not promise you anything! We noted your request but there are no guarantees."" I explained I would not be getting there until 11 PM and would be unable to walk a very long distance to a room. Was there no way to reserve a room nearer the elevators? NOPE!  Not helpful and not looking forward to this stay.",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Cold showers and no Taxis ,"This hotel is under major renovations and there is a lot of construction activity.  Every morning there was no hot water in the shower.  When it was time to leave there also no taxis available at the hotel.  As a result I almost missed my flight and had to pay $$$ for an Uber,",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Lipstick on a Pig,"I’ll start by saying that as I checked in, the staff was really nice.  People who work here seem to beautify what lies beneath.  This is a property that needs help.  First is it’s ability to take care of some insect issues.  Nothing can hide this.  Rooms have a musty smell - which means either the carpeting or bed needs to be replaced.  One colleague of mine was not able to have hot water delivered to his shower.  In my shower, a pump would turn on in the wall - making a loud sound and constant sputtering of water.    A lot needs to be done with this space.  It’s in a good location, but updates are drastically needed.",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Not a good experience ,Not very happy with our stay. I booked this hotel because I got a good deal. Big mistake. I didn't know there was an Anime convention going on. No one who worked there knew how to get around. We spent at least 30 min looking for our room in the mist of all of those people. Valet was $49/night. The room is not up to date. I guess my husband and I are just spoiled from where we've stayed in the past. It was just a madhouse and waiting for the elevators was just as bad. We will not come back. I hope whoever stays here next has a better experience.,2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Nothing a complete demolition of the property and start over wouldn't fix.,"The rooms were unkempt. The towels were worn so thin we could see through them. The door of the rooms opened to a direct view of the bed. Furnishings were old, maintenance appeared nonexistent. Sink was partially clogged and toilet seat was cheap and loose. Called for attention and got nothing attended to. Housekeeping didn't even make the bed for our second night. Room service breakfast was over priced and we were over charged for it. Breakfast in the restaurant next morning was a mess. An hour before ending half the food and one slice of bread left and three wait staff said they were very busy and none brought out replacements. When I spoke to the manager he said he would see to it. 20 minutes later I hunted him down in the bar area and he didn't even have the decency to apologize. Staff??? Friendliest bunch of lazy do-nothings.",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Not the cleanest or quietest.,"Stayed here for a convention between the 29th of July, through the 6th of August. Changed rooms 3 times due to mechanical noise adjoining our assigned room, finally giving up and accepting one at the tower section by paying an upgrade of $35 a night. This room was a smoking room that was never sanitized and smelled badly every time we came in. Complained but nothing happened.In general, this hotel is run down and in need of a facelift badly!",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Is this the worse hotel ever?,"Where do I start. We stayed for 7 nights. Our room was not made up for 3 days in a row, even though we left at 10 and returned after 4. Our keys (including replacements) did not work for three days. They did not put through our wakeup calls twice. They did deduct $100 from our bill and gave us both free breakfasts (but poor buffet--little choice and items were cold). There were signs for a restaurant in the hotel even though it has been closed for a year. Shower had no pressure. NOT RECOMMENDED.",1

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,A Good Downtown Location,We picked this hotel because of its location to the 16th Street Mall. Also we used SPG points and got it free for two nights. However we did have to pay for parking $40 per night self park or $49 valet. We choose valet. The hotel is rather large and we stayed in the tower. Quite a lot of walking but we did not mind. The rooms are small with no refrigerator which I thought was odd. The bathroom very basic and small. Nothing fancy but clean. Our king bed was comfortable and the room had a large TV. Nice outdoor pool on the 5th floor. Basically simple and clean. Really no complaints and probably would stay here again.,3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Pick for the location,"We were in town for a bachelorette party and we picked this hotel for 2 reasons, the location and the pool. First, the location was absolutely perfect for us to get to all the places we planned to go, and also offered a large workout area for us to have a private yoga session while there. We could hop on to the 16th Street Mall bus to get to restaurants a little faster, and were super pleased that it was across from a Krispy Kream in the morning. The pool, however, should not be one of the selling points for this hotel. It is a smaller pool and was not well taken care of when we went. We had to clean trash off of the cabana we were going to be using. They also had a DJ ""mixing"" music poolside which made it too loud to talk comfortably AND made it sound like the music was just skipping over and over. There is a bartender out by the pool but they do not let you bring in any drinks of your own, even if they are not in bottles. The one thing I do want to mention is that the parking, although difficult to find, is half price if you stay at the hotel. I didn't know this and was pleasantly surprised when we checked in and they told us.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Not great,"Two positive comments.  Staff is exceptionally friendly. The fitness center is phenomenal, amazing variety of machines. BUT, the hotel has problems. It's actually two separate hotels. A newer one, and an older one across the street. If you get a room  in the older, tower property, you have a long hike to your room.The outdoor pool is at the older property. Ok but only has a temporary bar that closes at 5:00 pm. After 5 pm, you are out of luck. The bathroom in the older section is ridiculously small. Sink, toilet and shower crammed in small space. If at the ""tower"" hotel, avoid the lower floors or you get a view of a roof. With other hotel options in the downtown area, will definitely never stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Disappointed,"Traveling to Denver for a national convention, the Sheraton was the host hotel.  On arrival, the check in was very smooth and quick.  The rooms looked like a typical hotel.  I have stayed in much lower class hotels and they were as nice as this Sheraton.  No refrigerators in the room.  what looked like a refrigerator was a cabinet with shelves.  Storage was lacking a lot.  The closet was fine, however, a very small three drawer chest for clothing.  No microwave, even cheap hotels have more immensities in the room.  The pillows were the worst I have ever come across in any city in the world.  Flat, Flat, Flat.  I requested foam pillows and they were brought up.  The foam pillows was at best bad.  The foam was chunks of foam broken up and stuffed into the pillow.  Very Sad!!!  The fire alarm went off at two a.m. and we were told that we would be advised of of further actions.  This was for 10 minutes. I was on the 7th floor, those from 10th floor and up did not get an alarm or any warnings at all.  Scary!!!  We had our banquet in the hotel and the disappoint continued.  Many of us requested ice tea and was were told that they did not have any.  Only water and coffee!!  Really????  There is a restaurant two floors below.  I have never, ever been to a banquet that ice tea was not available upon request.  Would I stay in this hotel again?  Not in this life time!",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Not what you expect from the downtown Sheraton,"Hotel is looking very pretentious and flashy inside out, but when you look close and start your stay there you will find a lots of inconveniences and things that you rather find in 2 stars suburbs hotels, but not in the downtown luxury places. Rooms are very small and not comfortable, bathrooms packed very poorly, you will pay everything extra for the comfort stay, before you will get any comfort. Pool on the 5 floor doesn't have any attention from the personnel. Area around it looked not very clean nor attempting.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Water temperature fluctuations,"The hotel has major water temperature problems.  First, it can take upwards of 5 minutes before hot water ever reaches your shower head.  I called the front desk and was told to give it 10 minutes and if still no hot water to call back.  10 minutes!!  Talk about a waste of water.  Once hot water reached your shower the temperature fluctuated from warm to scalding hot.  There was no warning, just hot to cold to hot to cold to hot.  Front desk acts like it's isolated yet read here and you'll see it is a major problem.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"Good location, OK hotel but pricey","The Downtown Sheraton is a large hotel and conference center.  The rooms are OK, not great and it is expensive for what you get.   There is construction going on what used to be the main lobby and on the third floor there is a walkway leading over to the main convention area and the tower of the hotel. Everything is an added $$.  If you want the continental breakfast it is an additional $30. You can find cheaper breakfasts around the hotel and across the street. Parking is an additional $40 per day. (Most large hotels in city charge around $20.) I would avoid bringing a car and use public transportation.

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Ok for largest hotel in the state,"Stayed there on business. The service at the conference center was top notch. The staff, in general, was very helpful and friendly. The front desk staff constantly tried to get you to pay more and upgrade and seemed to feel a bit superior to the rest of us. Rust stains in the bathtub? Really? The restroom outside the Grand Ballroom stunk to high heaven for the days that I was there-not just after someone was in there-smelled like rotten fish. Cabbies we like in a third world country trying to get you to use their service. The strip or mall in front of the hotel was pretty cool. Several places to eat and drink either inside the hotel or very close by. Navigating between the tower and main hotel was a bit cumbersome; 2 elevator rides to your room and a bit of a walk. People were constantly missing their floors-one guy gave up and took the stairs-as their keys would not work in the elevator to allow access to their floors. I didn't drive but good luck if you do-I didn't see a parking lot and think you may have to valet park. All in all it was OK. Now that you've achieved biggest why not shoot for best without attitude?",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Not enough bang for your buck,"I was in town for a conference, and the Sheraton was the official hotel. To be perfectly honest, the price is more than I would normally spend on a hotel, but I wanted to be near the conference. I did not get my money's worth. The Sheraton is a hotel that is often used as the main hotel for large conferences, but in my opinion, it just can't keep up with the demand it creates. There were quite a few people checking in at the same time I was, and early check-in was not an option. When I requested a late check-out, I was rudely denied, due to the fact that 800 people were checking in that day. Not that it would have mattered; it took me an hour to get through the check-out line, anyway.I was also bothered that when I checked in and asked about shuttle service to the convention center, the front desk agent shrugged her shoulders and told me she didn't know about it. I suppose I was wrong to think it was her job to know, or at least be able to direct me to someone else who could help me.The room itself was decent; the bed was great. Walls are extremely thin--I could hear my neighbors all night! I was also in a room across from the elevator, which was awful. People coming and going loudly at all hours. I will definitely request a room change next time that happens. Hotel is in a good location on 16th street, but overall, this was not a great experience for me.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Great location - needs an update,"I stayed here for 3 nights in June to attend a conference.   As mentioned the location is great, right in the center of Denver, close to all the good restaurant and bars.  Plus it's something like 6 blocks for the convention center. So the Pros and Cons:Pros: - Location, as said above- Connecting ""Yard House"" restaurant & bar - great place- Really good sized Gym, fully of good quality equipment!- Nice, big Executive loungeCons:- It's an older property and its obvious it needs some investment for an overhaul.   I was on the 21st floor, in what was one of the newly renovated rooms.  If I compare to some recent Marriott properties, not at the same level.  The foyer was nicely appointed, but as you walk around the hotel it's obvious it needs an injection of cash, newer renovations - The staff.    Front Desk were excellent, one male waiter in the Executive Lunge was excellent, everyone one else just seemed like there clocking in.  The staff in the ""Mix Bar"" all three ladies I interacted with and observed over 3 separate days were all a little jumpy, not very friendly and I think left their smiles at home. They've chosen to work in the ""hospitality sector"" which was severely lacking. If they changed their attitudes ever so slightly that could have probably doubled their tips. - The Executive Lounge; the morning breakfast was rather average.  The food seemed old, not particularly fresh and the choice / selection was slightly above a Hampton Inn, really not to the standard it should be. Overall, is was an okay stay, but compared to other properties I've stayed at in the Marriott/ SPG family over the past 6mths, at or below average.  As said the location is great, there are many positives, the hotel/staff just need a shot off rejuvenation!",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Nice hotel with some issues,"While the hotel is very nice and the rooms are nice, we had a few issues.  My husband killed a cockroach in our room, and we had odd charges (not ours) to our bill when we checked out.  The parking garage is pricey and smells horrible.  The staff was constantly standing to the side of the front doors, smoking, also.  I don't think I would return.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"Not bad, not great","Was here for a conference for four nights and that was plenty of time to be in this hotel. The lobby is nice, has a great area to lounge or work from a laptop. I found myself in this area several times during my conference to catch up on work. At check-in the front desk staff person was rude and short at first but then seemed to lighten up. Not the best first impression. My room was in the main building. It was generally quiet aside from street noise which you can't really do anything about. The toilets sounded like a jet engine and was woke up more than once by the next room flushing theirs. The beds were advertised by the reservation staff as ""the best bed you've ever slept in"". They were comfortable but the sheets were scratchy and I never once in my four nights had a good night sleep. The rooms seem outdated and in need of renovations. The TV was probably the highlight of the room; new Samsung with a great picture. The mini fridge was a nice perk and the free small bottles of water (and $2 large bottles of water) were appreciated as hotels seem to mark these up to $10 each.The conference spaces were nice and were on the lower level away from the rest of the guests. The small conference rooms were stuffy and claustrophobic though. The food provided at the conference via the hotel was pretty good and the variety was nice.The area around the hotel seemed like a strange combination of business people, stoners, and homeless people. I did not feel entirely comfortable wandering around without other conference attendees. The Yard House attached to the hotel was a great spot with good food and great beers. The wifi was free and fast.Overall this isn't a bad hotel, just not the greatest either. Paid $195/night for a reduced rate which was a little outrageous.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Stay somewhere else!,"Had to stay here for a volleyball tourn.Before I say anything else, this hotel is completely outdated!  Rooms are old, furniture is all scratched up, beds are bad, bathtub is shallow, coffee is weak. At check in they try and talk you out of maid service "" to go green"" for some ridiculous award points or $5 credit to your bill, it didn't matter because they hadn't gotten to our room anyway by 4:30pm! All thermostats are set so they can't go below 65 degrees. After sweating through the first night, I complained and miraculously a maintenance guy arrived to unlock the thermostat. He said that it was VIP service🙄It didn't matter because the fan barely worked and rattled like a truck, we wore earplugs. Parking was insane $40 for self $45 for valet, and if I was staying at the Ritz it would be understandable, but this was like a low end hotel in every way!  I asked for late checkout because I wasn't sure if we'd be back by noon, and the front desk guys looks at me, rolls his nose, and sais....and I quote "" Ummm...noooooo, we've already given too many out today.""  Okay dude, you just said you have a lot of other people help, but not me????I won't put up with this crap again, you can pay the same rate and stay at one of the nice New Hotels downtown. CHANGE YOUR RESERVATION BEFORE YOU GET HERE!",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,unsanitary room,It was not til the next morning when we woke we realized how dirty the bedding was. in the morning we found a bunch of lipstick on the end of the bedding that we didn't notice when the sheets were tucked in. one of the pillows had been placed under the others and we did not notice the dried blood stain on it. and while picking up the room in the morning before leaving we found under the bed on the floor a used condom! i have never been so grossed out by a room before. such a shame i have stayed at the Sheraton before and have never had this problem.,2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Horrific experience,"We had a terrible and horrific experience at this hotel. Last night we were kicked out of the hotel for being""loud"". I don't like to use this word loosely but it was a complete racist behavior on their part in doing this. We were in the room we just one another couple who were also guess at the hotel and as soon as the staff came to talk to us they were threatening us. Before we could even say anything they called the cops on us. Now we are not some teenagers but working professionals who did not deserve this. It was completely indecent on their part to remove us out like that. If this is what I get for being a SPG member for all these years, I will never stay with them again.",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Denver - Sheraton Dwntwn Old and Bad Stay somewhere ELSE!!!,"We stayed overnight on our way to Avon.  This hotel is old and need renovations BAD!  There were very few guest there.  The room reflected a hotel room from the 90''s.  The bed was horrible.  The furniture was old.  The decor was old. Horrible smell.  Also, the main elevator would not work so we had to use this really really small elevator. The bathroom was very small with rust spots.  We went to breakfast and it was okay.  It may be a great hotel to accommodate mass attended conferences but, this hotel is not for luxury or even pleasure.  Yuck!",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Not great,"I've stayed here several times through Priceline bidding. It is dated, the beds aren't very comfortable, and the layout causes you to have to walk and walk and walk to get to some rooms. I always forget this until, arms full (because I refuse to make more than one trip) I get frustrated when I seem to have to walk endlessly to get to my room before I drop everything!",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Probably better options nearby!,"Earlier this month, I stayed at the Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel for a work-related conference. For a conference setting, I could understand the appeal. There was abundant conference space on the ground level. The hotel complex is quite large, encompassing two buildings that actually span a road. The only ways to cross from one tower of the hotel to the other tower of the hotel is through a covered pedestrian overpass on the second floor, by going all the way to the basement/conference room floor, or by going outside and walking across the road. Needless to say, it was a headache to go to and from my room to any of the hotel's amenities, which were all located in the opposite building.As a guest of the hotel, I found the rooms very cramped and the space poorly appointed. I have stayed in hotels where small rooms were made to feel bigger through the clever arrangement of furniture, but the Sheraton Denver Downtown was not one of those. The furniture barely fit in the room, and there was hardly space for my suitcase. The rooms are so small, that some of them do not include refrigerators, or even luggage racks! Some of the rooms appear as though they have not been updated in at least a decade, and if you get an interior-facing room, you will be staring at nothing but the non-descript wall of the opposite building out of your window.The location is convenient. The hotel is on 16th Street, and it is easily accessible from the airport by a train that brings you to Union Station, at one end of 16th Street. From there, a free bus runs up and down the street pretty much continuously, stopping about every block. There are many shops and restaurants along the stretch of 16th Street near the hotel, but there are also probably other hotels that offer more amenities for a better price. I would do some investigating of other options in the area before I booked a room at the Sheraton Denver Downtown again.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"Convenient, efficient, and good for a business visit","In Denver for a conference, this hotel is located about 10 minutes away (easy walk) from the convention center. It is close to the end of the busy mall street (16th), so it is not too noisy. It is an efficiently-run business hotel with large rooms. The hotel has two buildings, connected by a skyway, so finding the correct room was a challenge for some guests. The workout room is great, with lots of cardio machines and some weights. The service was interesting: I thought that I agreed to the regular service (with the bed made daily), but didn't receive it. No problem for me for a three-night stay, but there are several options, so be sure to clarify what you want.  Also, when I called the front desk to ask for the direction of the workout room, I was told to go to the wrong floor. So maybe the staff could use a bit more training.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"Not bad, but getting a little long in the tooth","This Sheraton is downtown and I was there for a convention. The hotel is across two streets you can access over road or under via the conference level. The rooms are smallish, but clean. It felt more like a New York hotel in size. I would not recommend two people who aren't a couple staying in a room. The Club level offers the Club lounge with a happy hour and breakfast. There isn't anything wrong with the Sheraton, however if I were traveling strictly for leisure I would likely look to stay elsewhere downtown.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Rooms are dated but price was right,"We stayed in the tower section of this hotel.  The main entrance, part of the hotel, and lobby are across the street.  We arrived at the Tower entrance and another guest directed us where to go (no signage).  We checked in and went back across the street to the Tower.  Another guest showed us how to use the elevator, and another guest had showed them.  It was a little confusing.  Rooms were clean but old and dated.  This hotel met our needs as we were able to park at the Denver Post Building for $5/day and walk to the hotel and walk to our event at McNichols Building.  The bed was excellent.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Great for a conference ,"Fantastic hotel for a conference. Within walking distance of restaurants, shops, pubs, museums and ball park. Hotel was convenient for meetings, galas and other events. Room was comfortable but absolutely no view. My window faced a wall. Parking was outrageously priced.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Needs a remodel,"This Sheraton should be ashamed of itself. Old and outdated. They have a 3 star rating but is really a 2 star hotel. It a ""hotwire trap"" if you got stuck with this hotel as a result of a hotwire hidden price you are not alone. Once the staff sees you are a hotwire customer they automatically place you in a crappy room with no view. Don't stand for it complain. My room had a tick in it.  I complained and they moved me to a better room. The next time I came to Denver I stayed at the Hyatt, a much better experience worth the extra money.",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Subpar service ,"The hotel itself is in a great location, but as there are so many in the area, pick a different one. Check in process was ok, but getting to my room was a bit of a hassle. There are 2 towers and you have to go down to go up to the next tower. I'm not used to that. Usually everything conects at the lobby level. My room keys didn't work and when I went to the front to desk to have them reprogrammed, they acted like it was my fault. They told me not to put the keys next to my cell phone. Thanks for the tip. But I didn't do that. Went back with newly reprogrammed keys and still nothing. So I called down to guess services and they had security come up to let me in the room. Turns out the door lock needed to be reprogrammed.  No one was apologetic for the inconvenience. It took over 30 mins before I had a working key and lock. I'm still skeptical and don't trust the door. I would have preferred a different room all together, but since it's a convention weekend it's booked and I don't want to wait for a new room. The room itself is pretty substandard. Nothing special at all. Smaller than the Courtyard a few blocks over that I stayed at a few weeks ago. The room looks outdated and the bathroom is tiny and not well lit. I'd gladly go back to the Courtyard over this Sheraton. It reminds me why I don't book Sheratons.",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"Parking $37 and NOT a four star room. Hotel nice, rooms look sloppy and cheap like a new Hampton Inn","The Location is central for Downtown Denver, but for a vacation weekend well certainly not choose this. I selected a 4 star name my price and am let down for my first time using the feature. The Hotel: Clearly meant for conventions, the hotel parking runs $37 a night, something I certainly wish i'd known for a quick get away weekend. Our hotel preferences are generally Westin, ALoft, Hilton, Marriott. My husband is a consultant and travels a good bit. We just stayed in a Westin for a week in Cancun and I was pleased when my 4Star Name Your Own Price ended up as a Starwood. I was shocked that a Sheraton was ranked that way, but all of the reviews for the location seemed to give it 4 stars, I am unsure why. The hotel is well appointed, but the rooms felt like nothing i've experienced in a Starwood, certainly not a 4 star anything. The bedding and bath were really the only thing that made me think I might be at a Starwood. Inline with the hotel brand, the bedding was nice, comfortable and clean. The furniture and room shape seemed cheap and ill fitting. The room felt more like a mans apartment than hotel. After a long day at Rocky Mountain National Park we were tired and canceled our dinner reservations. My husband ordered a Pepperoni pizza from room service and it was horrible, this is by my husbands fairly low standards on what pizza should taste like.We checked in around 2am and clearly did not receive their cream of the crop at check-in. Upon check-in I found out that the Name My Own Price had given a double room. I noted that it was done through the Name My Own Price and I was not given the option for a king or double, but that my confirmation clearly stated I could have one or the other. The man seemed amendment that I had selected that double and that would be what i received. At this point I noted that my husband and I are newlyweds and this was a quick get away for our 1month anniversary, would he please look to book me in a King of same pricing; especially since he had just noted the hotel was one the company's largest between there and Vegas. At this point he started to push back again and a more senior attendant who was listening stepped in to say he certainly could put me in a room with only one bed. At THIS point the other man says he is new. I don't care if someone is unsure of their options, but to just say no and avoid service while working in the service industry, is not alright. When we started booking I said we wanted to use my husband's starwood account, I was told that would not be a problem. After dealing with the King vs. Double situation I waited for him to take the number. When my husband went to give him his Starwood number, we were told he had already looked up mine and applied it to the account. Since it was well past 3am our local time and we had just struggled to get a king, we let it go and went to our room. By far the most Disappointing Starwood we've stayed in. In the past month this is the third we've been to and the only time our expectations were disappointed by service and room quality.",2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Horrible Check In,"Stayed here for three nights attending an on-site conference. We are Hilton Diamond Members, so I am accustomed to excellent service. Not having any SPG status, I stood in a very long check in line - not a problem. Upon check in I was told by ""Chi"" they were completely sold out of King rooms. This was at 3:30 pm   I questioned this as my reservation was for a King room made over two months ago. I asked if I could postpone check in to await a King room as this was my preference. I was told I could, but there were no guarantees. I stayed I would wait and expect a call on my cell phone when a King room was available. She did not respond and was engrossed in the computer for a few moments u Gil she handed me room keys. I asked if this was for a King room as she had not communicated what task she was completing. She sighed and stated she did not know and proceeded to look it up in her system. She then advised the room was two queens. I asked, again, if I could be advised if a King became available and she responded by stating ""like I said, you can call later and ask, but we are sold out."" I decided a move would be more trouble and walked away. Turns out all of my colleagues who checked in after I did, received their reserved King rooms. To make matters worse, the beds were doubles, not queens. I should have gone to a Hilton.",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Nice hotel but bad service ,I did a booking on here and I booked the hotel and also got a 2 bedroom hotel but only got a 1 bedroom hotel we had three people and one of them had to stay at a friends house because it only had one bed.,2
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"Location is Great, But the Inside is Dated","We stayed here for just a few nights and while the service was good and the upgrades were nice, the interior was a bit dated. We did love the lounge on the 22nd floor that was open 24 hours a day with waters, soda and snacks available, that was a nice touch!",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,average,Lobby is nice & check in smooth & then we were told our room was across the street!  We could cross 4 lanes of traffic dragging our luggage or take the elevator down & take a hallway under the hotel & streets to the other building.  Not very convenient for weary travelers.  The bed sheets were stiff & uncomfortable.  Wrestled with the sheets & pillows all evening.  The rooms were clean.  The location is great as you can walk out the door and hit many restaurants & bars.,3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"Typical Older Hotel, Somewhat Worn","An older hotel, a little out of date appointings.  Nice and helpful front staff.  Very good cleaning staff.  The convention facilities within the hotel are well arranged.  Quite a heavy homeless around, heavy marijuana fumes to walk thru, and so would not walk alone at night other than perhaps on 16th and would avoid areas without people.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Huge Property ,I attended a conference in Denver last month. We stayed at the Sheraton downtown Denver the hotel is OK. I was in The tower that is not closest to the lobby area. If you're in this Tower expect to do some walking. The rooms were a little worn.,3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,In Need of Small but Significant Improvements,"At the outset I have to say that our check-in experience was excellent. We opted for an upgrade as part of an SPG promotion that we really liked! I also liked the speed of my in-room dining delivery. But we also had a series of somewhat disappointing issues. The 15 Fifty staff was slow and seemingly disinterested in taking care of our group. The fitness center had/has 2 exercise bikes with malfunctioning TVs. Our bathroom had a shower head that was broken. And they didn't completely resolve an issue with my bill upon my check out that caused me to have to make a second request to resolve. Granted, I stay in a lot of hotels and my expectations are high. But I know the Sheraton Denver can do much better.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Water temperature fluctuations,"The hotel has major water temperature problems.  First, it can take upwards of 5 minutes before hot water ever reaches your shower head.  I called the front desk and was told to give it 10 minutes and if still no hot water to call back.  10 minutes!!  Talk about a waste of water.  Once hot water reached your shower the temperature fluctuated from warm to scalding hot.  There was no warning, just hot to cold to hot to cold to hot.  Front desk acts like it's isolated yet read here and you'll see it is a major problem.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"Good location, OK hotel but pricey","The Downtown Sheraton is a large hotel and conference center.  The rooms are OK, not great and it is expensive for what you get.   There is construction going on what used to be the main lobby and on the third floor there is a walkway leading over to the main convention area and the tower of the hotel. Everything is an added $$.  If you want the continental breakfast it is an additional $30. You can find cheaper breakfasts around the hotel and across the street. Parking is an additional $40 per day. (Most large hotels in city charge around $20.) I would avoid bringing a car and use public transportation.  Parking at one of the park and ride parking lots and taking light rail or bus would be much cheaper than paying for parking at the hotel.  The cleaning of the room was OK, but I had a placard on the door (the one's showing exits in case of a fire) and it dropped off the door in the middle of the night and woke me up.  I placed it next to the door, thinking housekeeping might take care of it, but nope.  I had to report it when I left.   My main concern is I never felt safe walking to my room.  Because the hotel is a convention center, the hallways are very long and have several turns. With the construction on the main floors, there was a constant sense of many people walking through the building. There were several loud groups hanging out in the hallway late at night as well making it hard to sleep. I had stayed here before for another convention and not felt unsafe but I did this time and I would not stay here again until the construction was over.… I had a placard on the door (the one's showing exits in case of a fire) and it dropped off the door in the middle of the night and woke me up.

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"It's ok, good location, a bit dated, lots of homeless","Stayed here for work in the tower building.  It's a good location and easy to get to, lots of restaurants around and shopping.  Front desk was very nice and helpful.    Rooms and hallways definitely feel old and a bit dreary.  Has all the amenities of modern rooms, just doesn't have that same sparkle as a new place.  That being said, it's an old place so can't expect everything.  Biggest issue for me was safety.  Walking to and from dinner an adventure, lots of homeless folks just outside the doors panhandling somewhat aggressively so safety a concern depending on your comfort level.",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Idea to better utilize space ,"One of the best hotel innovations for guests in recent years has been the introduction of the curved shower rod and curtain.  It’s given travelers more elbow room and increased guest satisfaction.   One of the first things I noted as I entered my king room was it was relatively small and worse yet the folding luggage rack that was stored sideways in the closet, no longer fit in the closet when it folded opened.  It’s about 1 inch too wide.  That meant I had to store my suitcase in plain sight somewhere on the already limited floor instead of in the closet where it would be out of the way.  I’d like to suggest the hotel widen the middle part of the closet and shorten the part where the ironing board is stored by 2 inches. It would be a practical innovation that would make the room feel bigger and likely improve the guest experience. … room feel bigger and likely improve the guest experience. ",3
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,"My ""birthday getaway""",The hotel staff are very robotic and rude.

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,No flexibility in hard times,"Given the Coronavirus concern, I tried to call in to cancel my reservation on the day checkin. A few hours ago national emergency was declared and all flights are readily giving credits but the Sheraton Denver manager would not budge.  On top of that she tells me that I would’ve made an exception if I would’ve called 24 hours before. I am like no mam, that would’ve been allowed in policy per my rate, but I am requesting you to make an exception given the circumstances. No help from their side. This is when I am a titanium elite member with them. It’s times like this when you can show compassion but you guys failed.  Had to finally call Marriott customer service who helped.",1
"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Staff not helpful at all!!,"I am attending a rather large conference next week. Understanding there are two ""towers"" and lots of construction going on I called a head to ask that my room be in the same tower as the conference and that I be closer to the elevator, due to some mobility issues. No one (front desk or sales) could even tell me which tower the conference is in. I was also told there is no way to be sure I can the location I am requesting. ""There are 1500 rooms in this hotel and we can not promise you anything! We noted your request but there are no guarantees."" I explained I would not be getting there until 11 PM and would be unable to walk a very long distance to a room. Was there no way to reserve a room nearer the elevators? NOPE!  Not helpful and not looking forward to this stay.",2

"Denver, CO ",Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel,Lipstick on a Pig,"I’ll start by saying that as I checked in, the staff was really nice.  People who work here seem to beautify what lies beneath.  This is a property that needs help.  First is it’s ability to take care of some insect issues.  Nothing can hide this.  Rooms have a musty smell - which means either the carpeting or bed needs to be replaced.  One colleague of mine was not able to have hot water delivered to his shower.  In my shower, a pump would turn on in the wall - making a loud sound and constant sputtering of water.    A lot needs to be done with this space.  It’s in a good location, but updates are drastically needed.",2

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Haunting experience - stole my belongings,"I’ve been meaning to write this review for over a year. What happened there still truly haunts me and caused me some emotional turmoil. I stayed there in the middle of a move and left personal belongings with valet/baggage storage due to last minute flight snafu. I checked with front desk saying I wasn’t sure when I’d be back but that I would grab them as soon as I came back which would likely be in a month or so. They said totally fine. Circumstances prevented me from coming back for several months but I called twice and they said it was all good.  When I called to say I was coming back to get my things 2 months after my last call in which they had said just come when you can (and gave me NO deadline) they couldn’t find them then said they got rid of them! NOBODY called me! My phone number was written in Black sharpie in HUGE font on 2 of the bags along with my name. my belongings consisted of BRAND NEW ski helmet, brand new ski goggles, very nice powder skis (in a nice ski bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE), very nice ski boots (in a nice boot bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE and my helmet, goggles in same bag), ski clothing, and a box of hugely sentimental belongings from my move (family pictures, documents, etc). Again, my phone number was written in huge letters on both the ski bag and the boot bag and the box. No effort whatsoever to contact me. As if they had called I would have had had a local friend pick up ASAP. Clearly an employee took the skis/boots or sold them.  When I called to say I was getting them they were super vague about what happened but said they did remember the stuff and said someone took them away. Sure policy on tag says not liable but this is robbery by employees in a locked closet and wrong and they shouldn’t have told me on phone not to worry about not picking it up. More importantly, be a decent human and at least make a phone call, some effort when the phone number is screaming to you, before taking them or getting rid of them. This wasn’t just a suitcase or a bag that was a bother to them. This was nice belongings that clearly someone wanted, otherwise they would have at least CALLED ME before taking them even if it's policy. They know given the fact that there was a phone number someone would have come for them. Not to mention if they had just checked with the front desk. But the fact that my contact info was LARGE on every single item means there is ZERO excuse. I cried when I found out and could not believe their lack of care or apology about the situation. This was at LEAST $3.5K worth of belongings PLUS the box of truly irreplaceable family belongings on top of that. They offered NO accommodation whatsoever. Truly abhorrent inexcusable and incredibly sketchy. No integrity. Still in shock.… phone number was written in Black sharpie in HUGE font on 2 of the bags along with my name. my belongings consisted of BRAND NEW ski helmet, brand new ski goggles, very nice powder skis (in a nice ski bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE), very nice ski boots (in a nice boot bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE and my helmet, goggles in same bag), ski clothing, and a box of hugely sentimental belongings from my move (family pictures, documents, etc).

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,NOT worth what we paid for!!,"Our power went out in the first hour from using a blowdryer and there was hardly any apology. That shouldn’t happen in a large hotel, and although someone came to fix it I expected more (he also had to come into our room after it went out again...). Everything is so cheaply made- paint chipping everywhere, shower door didn’t close, 1 towel hook for 2 people, bathroom decor looking so decrepit, and the hallway felt like a cold pool entry way. So unwelcoming when a hotel room is supposed to feel comforting and cozy. I will never stay at a boutique hotel again- just an excuse to use “trendy” aka cheap furniture and decorations to lure in young people. Pictures were so misleading compared to the “deluxe” room we actually got. I wish I had taken pictures. Will not be staying at a Kimpton again anytime soon! Would rather stay at a Hampton or Hilton, at least they’re always clean, cozy and reliable!… Kimpton again anytime soon!

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Nearly Unbelievable,"My partner arrived early and requested a room with two beds and explained I would be in later. She also asked if the metered parking in front was OK as she arrived on Sunday (free parking) and the meters would not take her money.  As I was not there the staff at the desk tried to decline giving her bottled water for both of us (bizarrely petty for a hotel of their purported caliber). When I arrived about an hour later, the same desk staff angrily answered the doorbell and inquired why I didn't use my key.  After making my way to the room, went to wash up and the sink drain was not working.  We had to crawl underneath to open the drain as the linkage was dis-connected.  At that point, also noticed shower curtain was hanging by a couple of rings as if someone had started to hang it and not finished.  Next, the bath spout's copper plumbing line was hanging loose out of the wall and the wallpaper was peeling in several places. After sleeping for about 3 hours, a herd of folks disembarked from the elevator at about 3:00am and started screaming at eachother in the hall for about half an hour.  Up and off in the morning, was greeted with a parking ticket from just after midnight.  Seems as though the hotel would warn you of this ""gotcha"" on Sunday nights (parking meters won't take money until midnight Sunday and then parking enforcement shows up at midnight to ticket everyone in front of the hotel) No one mentioned the problem when asked the night before.  Called IHG to report all this and was told that they couldn't find our reservation----three different times.  It turns out the desk had mispelled my partner's first name and didn't bother equating ""Abby"" with ""Abbey.""  After 6 phone calls and a few hours on the phone, no reasonable resolution.  What a ridiculous circus.  I would whole heartedly recommend not rewarding the specific hotel nor their parent company with your money.  There are a number of hotels on the same street that will earn your business.… it and not finished.

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Super disapponting,"From beginning to end the hotel was a disappointment. I’ve been to many Kimpton’s over the years and this is the first one I will not return to. We checked in on Christmas Eve  and there’s no Christmas tree!  We visited the Four Seasons for brunch, the Meridien and Hyatt Regency for drinks and all were beautifully decorated with Christmas trees. Second problem was that their food service didn’t open until 2pm on Christmas Day so no breakfast in the hotel for any guests. Had to go elsewhere. We put out the Room Service tab on Christmas night to have breakfast brought up at 7am. I get a call at 6:55 that they “forgot”, but they weren’t opening until 8am today.    Other issues included a room next to the elevator, and iffy hot water in the shower.  And I’m a Kimpton member!  A shame but this Kimpton gives them all a bad name.   … shame but this Kimpton gives them all a bad name.   ",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,"Average, not ‘Kimpton’ standard at all. ","Coming from Chicago Kimpton Gray hotel, we kind of expected a similar if not better experience being the same brand and a whole lot more expensive than the Chicago one was. Unfortunately I can’t write anything similar at all to my Gray review as it wasn’t even close, in fact it was quite disappointing. The staff were not very friendly or helpful, the hotel is really dark and old- which is fine and can be nice but if the environment is right which it wasn’t. Comparing again to other Kimpton’s, this falls short from service of the staff, to the room, the overall feel and even the tea and coffee morning. The website states it’s in the living room so one would think it would be there however when it wasn’t and I asked, I received a pretty cold reply saying ‘in the bar.’ And that was it. Was pretty rude. There was no real friendly smiles from any staff, never any door men or luggage assistance and just overall the service lacked a lot. The room we originally were given was absolutely awful, the minute we walked in we called reception and asked for a room change- who wants to stare directly at a super close concrete wall when you open the curtains? The room is really dark as it is so this was pretty frustrating. They were helpful in changing our room to another one with a view to the street. It was an okay room, clean and the bed and pillows were really comfy.Not sure if we were next to a room where staff hung out or storage or something but it was excessively loud with banging all night, the whole time we were there! No idea what it was but it was loud like really loud! The guy at check out (Paul I think his name was) was really helpful and super nice and friendly- pity we didn’t encounter him any other time of the visit because he was great! Overall it was an okay stay but definitely nothing like Chicago which was super disappointing. Wouldn’t stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,The redecorating has killed the pleasure of staying here,"Been staying there for years, we are now looking for a new place. What we always loved about the Monaco was the eclectic vibe   The lobby was a treat to hang out in, very cool Moroccan vibe and the rooms were unlike any other, colorful and fun.  Now, the recent remodel is all monochrome..boring and dull as hell.  Nothing eclectic, nothing charming, just BLAH.  the wall paper in the rooms looks like prison shower room white tile.  The interior desecrator who dreamed this up this should be paintballed with bright colors.  The city of Denver has lost a piece of its vibe.  This would be a 1star except the staff is very nice and Panzanos is still god, although not what it once was.  They need to rename it the hotel monochrome.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Nice place but poor plumbing,"Stayed three nights. Complained about no operating cold water on sink and luke warm, at best shower water. Supposedly an “engineer” visited room, but problem was not fixed.Otherwise a nice room and quiet.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Disappointed on second stay,"I was so excited to bring my friend to this hotel on a recent trip to CO bc I had such a great experience the last time, but this time was a disappointment. Instead of walking into the magnificent lobby I loved, we walked into a small, dark reception area w/a big gray construction wall - they are apparently re-doing the lobby. I wish they would've warned me they were going through some renovations. We walked onto the floor of our room to be greeted by more plastic & working tools - more renovations. My room was smaller & darker than what I had before and the feel of it all was grey & dreary instead of bright & cheery as before. The service was still great, and the location is good, but it lost its magic for me this time. For the price, I wish I had stayed elsewhere.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Will Never Go Back,"Is there a negative rating - hard to give Hotel Monoco in DENVER one star. I love Kimpton hotels and was excited for my first stay at hotel monoco after a long day of travel and work. I was terribly disappointed - this place is on the same scale as Holiday Inn Express! No kidding! The typical cozy Kimpton bed and pillows consisted of a hard box with a mattress tossed on top - no box spring which made it as hard as a rock! The pillows were just as hard - not the typical plush pillows. Needless to say it was a long night of trying to get comfortable. At 3 a.m. my back could no longer stand lying on the rock hard bed. To top off my stay I had a very refreshing ice cold shower! Upon  checkout I told the front desk about my experience and they could care less - no attempt what so ever to remediate despite telling them I had a reservation to again in 2 nights. Overall, horrible facilities....horrible staff that could careless.",1

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Haunting experience - stole my belongings,"I’ve been meaning to write this review for over a year. What happened there still truly haunts me and caused me some emotional turmoil. I stayed there in the middle of a move and left personal belongings with valet/baggage storage due to last minute flight snafu. I checked with front desk saying I wasn’t sure when I’d be back but that I would grab them as soon as I came back which would likely be in a month or so. They said totally fine. Circumstances prevented me from coming back for several months but I called twice and they said it was all good.  When I called to say I was coming back to get my things 2 months after my last call in which they had said just come when you can (and gave me NO deadline) they couldn’t find them then said they got rid of them! NOBODY called me! My phone number was written in Black sharpie in HUGE font on 2 of the bags along with my name. my belongings consisted of BRAND NEW ski helmet, brand new ski goggles, very nice powder skis (in a nice ski bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE), very nice ski boots (in a nice boot bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE and my helmet, goggles in same bag), ski clothing, and a box of hugely sentimental belongings from my move (family pictures, documents, etc). Again, my phone number was written in huge letters on both the ski bag and the boot bag and the box. No effort whatsoever to contact me. As if they had called I would have had had a local friend pick up ASAP. Clearly an employee took the skis/boots or sold them.  When I called to say I was getting them they were super vague about what happened but said they did remember the stuff and said someone took them away. Sure policy on tag says not liable but this is robbery by employees in a locked closet and wrong and they shouldn’t have told me on phone not to worry about not picking it up. More importantly, be a decent human and at least make a phone call, some effort when the phone number is screaming to you, before taking them or getting rid of them. This wasn’t just a suitcase or a bag that was a bother to them. This was nice belongings that clearly someone wanted, otherwise they would have at least CALLED ME before taking them even if it's policy. They know given the fact that there was a phone number someone would have come for them. Not to mention if they had just checked with the front desk. But the fact that my contact info was LARGE on every single item means there is ZERO excuse. I cried when I found out and could not believe their lack of care or apology about the situation. This was at LEAST $3.5K worth of belongings PLUS the box of truly irreplaceable family belongings on top of that. They offered NO accommodation whatsoever. Truly abhorrent inexcusable and incredibly sketchy. No integrity. Still in shock.… phone number was written in Black sharpie in HUGE font on 2 of the bags along with my name. my belongings consisted of BRAND NEW ski helmet, brand new ski goggles, very nice powder skis (in a nice ski bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE), very nice ski boots (in a nice boot bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE and my helmet, goggles in same bag), ski clothing, and a box of hugely sentimental belongings from my move (family pictures, documents, etc).

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,NOT worth what we paid for!!,"Our power went out in the first hour from using a blowdryer and there was hardly any apology. That shouldn’t happen in a large hotel, and although someone came to fix it I expected more (he also had to come into our room after it went out again...). Everything is so cheaply made- paint chipping everywhere, shower door didn’t close, 1 towel hook for 2 people, bathroom decor looking so decrepit, and the hallway felt like a cold pool entry way. So unwelcoming when a hotel room is supposed to feel comforting and cozy. I will never stay at a boutique hotel again- just an excuse to use “trendy” aka cheap furniture and decorations to lure in young people. Pictures were so misleading compared to the “deluxe” room we actually got. I wish I had taken pictures. Will not be staying at a Kimpton again anytime soon! Would rather stay at a Hampton or Hilton, at least they’re always clean, cozy and reliable!… Kimpton again anytime soon!

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Nearly Unbelievable,"My partner arrived early and requested a room with two beds and explained I would be in later. She also asked if the metered parking in front was OK as she arrived on Sunday (free parking) and the meters would not take her money.  As I was not there the staff at the desk tried to decline giving her bottled water for both of us (bizarrely petty for a hotel of their purported caliber). When I arrived about an hour later, the same desk staff angrily answered the doorbell and inquired why I didn't use my key.  After making my way to the room, went to wash up and the sink drain was not working.  We had to crawl underneath to open the drain as the linkage was dis-connected.  At that point, also noticed shower curtain was hanging by a couple of rings as if someone had started to hang it and not finished.  Next, the bath spout's copper plumbing line was hanging loose out of the wall and the wallpaper was peeling in several places. After sleeping for about 3 hours, a herd of folks disembarked from the elevator at about 3:00am and started screaming at eachother in the hall for about half an hour.  Up and off in the morning, was greeted with a parking ticket from just after midnight.  Seems as though the hotel would warn you of this ""gotcha"" on Sunday nights (parking meters won't take money until midnight Sunday and then parking enforcement shows up at midnight to ticket everyone in front of the hotel) No one mentioned the problem when asked the night before.  Called IHG to report all this and was told that they couldn't find our reservation----three different times.  It turns out the desk had mispelled my partner's first name and didn't bother equating ""Abby"" with ""Abbey.""  After 6 phone calls and a few hours on the phone, no reasonable resolution.  What a ridiculous circus.  I would whole heartedly recommend not rewarding the specific hotel nor their parent company with your money.  There are a number of hotels on the same street that will earn your business.",1
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Super disapponting,"From beginning to end the hotel was a disappointment. I’ve been to many Kimpton’s over the years and this is the first one I will not return to. We checked in on Christmas Eve  and there’s no Christmas tree!  We visited the Four Seasons for brunch, the Meridien and Hyatt Regency for drinks and all were beautifully decorated with Christmas trees. Second problem was that their food service didn’t open until 2pm on Christmas Day so no breakfast in the hotel for any guests. Had to go elsewhere. We put out the Room Service tab on Christmas night to have breakfast brought up at 7am. I get a call at 6:55 that they “forgot”, but they weren’t opening until 8am today.    Other issues included a room next to the elevator, and iffy hot water in the shower.  And I’m a Kimpton member!

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Strange lighting,"My stay at this hotel worked out all right, but the lighting seemed strange.  None of it was all that good for reading.  I found it almost impossible to find the switch for a lamp that had a long, tall shade. I have often thought that if the people who design some hotel rooms actually stayed in one like this one that they might design it differently.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Bad Room Service,Ordered breakfast in bed for a special treat to myself.  My toast was missing & I called & they said they’d send it right up.  It never came.  The food I did get was all burned.  Eggs over medium were all burned on the edges.  The bacon was black it was so burned.  The potatoes were black & crunchy brown.  Not happy.,1
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Nice...BUT Not Special,"We LOVE Kimpton proprieties and find they each have their own unique character.  My husband and I did a staycation here on our recent anniversary and were pleasantly surprised and appreciative when they offered us an upgrade to a suite.  The front desk staff was welcoming and lovely. The rooms were spacious and modern.  One concern was that the carpet was wet (saturated) and we were not comfortable walking on it without shoes.  The bathroom while modern had large scratches on the grey pocket door and the grout was filled with ""dirt"".  The decor was VERY dark with poor lighting.  The color scheme was dark grey and this added to the poorly lite space...almost had a gothic feel.Unfortunately our A/C was not working  to capacity and we were so uncomfortable we were unable to sleep!  A call to the front desk came with an offer to bring up a fan.  Given the size of the room and high ceilings a fan would be useless... so we remained uncomfortable for the duration.  We also wanted a room with a view and unfortunately our view was a concrete area loaded with construction supplies!  Such a disappointment.  We did eat in their award winning Italian restaurant and found that disappointing as well.  The staff was hurried and unfocused.  We waited at our table for almost 15 minutes before a greeted and service was slow despite the fact that it was not particularly busy.  Meal was good but not outstanding and it was cold upon arrival.  There are many choices to stay in Denver, including another Kimpton and I think next time we will stay elsewhere.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,"Lovely hotel, friendly but ineffective staff, ...they don't ""walk the talk""","The hotel is lovely, our room comfortable for sleeping and for reading. In the bathroom is a long list of items that the staff will be happy to provide, including small appliances, etc.  It specifies that if you need something not listed and they  don't have it, they will get it for you.  The clock on the room showed the wrong time and there was literally no way to correct it. We immediately called down to request that the clock be repaired or replaced. Someone did come to look at it, but neither repaired or replaced it.  We repeated our request the second day.  Despite being assured it would be taken care of, it wasn't.  When we returned at the end of the day we made our third request.  The woman at Reception said they didn't have another clock available.  I suggested this was an opportunity to make good on the promise to provide what was needed.  She promised to investigate and call us.  No call, no clock.  We miss the days when a Kimpton hotel was actually owned by Kimpton, LLC, not a hotel group.  In the ""old days"", this would never have happened.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Shabby not Chic,"I was very disappointed by the condition of the public spaces in this hotel. The hallways were dirty.  Walls were dirty.  Elevators were not well appointed. To me Kimpton means upscale funk. Not this property. While my room was ample and clean for my purposes, the overall feel of this hotel is over-used and tired. No pool.  The only amenities were a work out room and a restaurant. They made great drinks in the bar, but the breakfast I had came floating in rendered fat. This place is below average. On the positive side, the staff are terrific and they did offer coffee, tea and wine in the lobby at set times. But its hard to make up for a building you want to be outside of for most of your trip.",2

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Old favorite just not the same,"Returned to our local favorite boutique hotel in downtown Denver, Hotel Monaco.  My wife and I love special romantic runaway nights to escape the kids and the suburbs.  On this night we were very disappointed, our old colorful favorite had underwent an “upgrade” that left us longing for the past.  The new color Scheme was Grey on Grey and felt very monochromatic compared to the yellows and blues the graced the walls in the past.  The lovely soaking tubs in the bathrooms were replaced with showers.  While the staff remain friendly and responsive.  This was not the romantic hotel we loved.  Rather, the hotel felt like nothing  special.  It looked and felt like all the others in the area.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Quick getaway,"I have stayed in other Kimpton hotels and have usually found them to be fun with good staff attention, The Hotel Monaco is no exception. My friend and I were staying with plans to go snowshoeing somewhere close by . The staff was helpful with recommendations for this and other helpful suggestions.The room was comfortable but we did not have a great  view so you will have to specify,  if a view is important   The restaurant on site, Panzano's may be the secret gem, though. Both my friend and I were incredibly impressed with the food quality, not generally seen in hotel restaurants.Good choices, we both had salads and they were very good. Great Minnestrone  You can stay cheaper , but I think the totality of the experience is worth the money .",5

There was an early snow storm and cold weather, unseasonable for this time of year.  The staff were accomodating and friendly.  One morning, the battery on the rental car died.  The front desk staff were great.  They contacted the rental company, called other sites to locate a suitable replacement car, arranged a Lyft to transport me to the other rental location, and gave me a monetary credit for ""my trouble and inconvenience.""  I couldn't have been more surprised.  They went above and beyond.That doesn't even begin to address the huge room, great valet, wonderful restaurant on site, and evening wine.

Staff was amazing.. cannot day enough good things about the staff!The lobby of the hotel was pretty stinky. Every day we were there it smelt almost like sewer back up. It was a very comfortable area with the fireplace and couches but boy did it stink. We had a king bed suit and it was very comfortable and roomy. The bathroom was beautiful.

As I was not there the staff at the desk tried to decline giving her bottled water for both of us (bizarrely petty for a hotel of their purported caliber). When I arrived about an hour later, the same desk staff angrily answered the doorbell and inquired why I didn't use my key.  After making my way to the room, went to wash up and the sink drain was not working.  We had to crawl underneath to open the drain as the linkage was dis-connected.  At that point, also noticed shower curtain was hanging by a couple of rings as if someone had started to hang it and not finished.  Next, the bath spout's copper plumbing line was hanging loose out of the wall and the wallpaper was peeling in several places. After sleeping for about 3 hours, a herd of folks disembarked from the elevator at about 3:00am and started screaming at eachother in the hall for about half an hour.  Up and off in the morning, was greeted with a parking ticket from just after midnight.  Seems as though the hotel would warn you of this ""gotcha"" on Sunday nights (parking meters won't take money until midnight Sunday and then parking enforcement shows up at midnight to ticket everyone in front of the hotel) No one mentioned the problem when asked the night before.  Called IHG to report all this and was told that they couldn't find our reservation----three different times.  It turns out the desk had mispelled my partner's first name and didn't bother equating ""Abby"" with ""Abbey.""  After 6 phone calls and a few hours on the phone, no reasonable resolution.

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Super disapponting,"From beginning to end the hotel was a disappointment. I’ve been to many Kimpton’s over the years and this is the first one I will not return to. We checked in on Christmas Eve  and there’s no Christmas tree!  We visited the Four Seasons for brunch, the Meridien and Hyatt Regency for drinks and all were beautifully decorated with Christmas trees. Second problem was that their food service didn’t open until 2pm on Christmas Day so no breakfast in the hotel for any guests. Had to go elsewhere. We put out the Room Service tab on Christmas night to have breakfast brought up at 7am. I get a call at 6:55 that they “forgot”, but they weren’t opening until 8am today.    Other issues included a room next to the elevator, and iffy hot water in the shower.  And I’m a Kimpton member!  A shame but this Kimpton gives them all a bad name.   … shame but this Kimpton gives them all a bad name.   ",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Pretty disappointing experience ,"Nothing like a Kimpton experience you would expect. Booked thru Expedia , and maybe because of that we were given a room at the corner end of the top floor looking directly to the parking building of the hotel next door and a window so small behind the TV that at first we thought there was no window. Certainly not what you expect paying more than $400 a night with parking. But the worse part was lack of hot water. Yes no hot water in a four star hotel. When I called guest services their only suggestion was you have to let the water run five minutes to get it warmed. Did not even care that much. After coming out and waiting more than five minutes, water still cold. I could not wait anymore. Next morning we called valet to bring the car around 10 minutes ahead so it would be ready, and went down the checkout. During checkout front desk person asked ""how was your stay?"", I did not think it would make a difference but I said ""not so good. Room did not even have a regular size window and we had no hot water "". Response was ""Great, thank you for choosing Kimpton Monaco Denver"". I did not say anything to the person that was not listening anyways. I went out to get my car. Good news car was there but bad news had to wait for the valet to come so we can pick our keys for 10 more minutes.",2
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Terribly disappointing,"Hotel was undergoing renovation. Constantly had a man at our window (see photo).  Hot water didn't work for over 24 hours. NOT HANDICAPPED FRIENDLY.   Hotel entrance doors not wheelchair friendly.  Must be opened for you to enter.  Room door needed to be body slammed to be opened which is difficult to do when in a wheelchair. Ridiculously expensive food/room service that was just ok.  Took two days to get room service plates removed from room.  And for the price of our stay,  we deserved better... much better.",2
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Hotel has changed,"If you choose a package make sure the hotel can fulfill all aspects of the package because when we arrived things changed at check-in. The restaurant ,Panzanos, was closed on the 4th. We planned to celebrate my husbands birthday at brunch on that day. They did not communicate when we made the reservation that the restaurant would be closed.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Hotel Monaco,"We rated this a three for a few reasons. Now the staff was amazing! The customer service was outstanding. There are a few things we weren't thrilled with: the fan and Air conditioning in the room weren't working. It was hot at night for us. The front desk sent us up a quiet fan immediately though. We ended up having to move rooms because of the noise in the hallway and from the people in the neighboring room. The hotel is pet friendly which is terrific, but the dog next door kept barking for about 5-10 minutes on and off for a while at night when we were trying to relax. And that family kept going in and out of the room and the door slamming was SOOOO loud. We finally asked the front desk and they were so accommodating they moved us to a quieter floor. The parking options were a bit limited- obviously being in the city we understand the limitations. Valet is the only thing that made sense for us but we weren't thrilled with the alternatives. And the breakfast at panzano's was very disappointing. We didn't eat dinner their which I would imagine is amazing but the breakfast is not all fresh made and for the price it wasn't a good experience.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,bad experience overall,"many service issues from messed up reservations to overpriced parking.  Dated rooms, nobody picking up the phones when you call the front desk.  Systems 'slow' at check in and down at check-out.  Someone else's amenities showed up in our room.",1
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,"Wonderful hotel, Great location ","Once again, the Kimpton did not disappoint.  Top notch customer service, very clean and of course....happy hour!! This location was great.  The hotel was very clean, beds comfortable and I loved the bathroom! I left my toiletries at home since Kimpton has that covered.  I would definitely recommend this hotel while visiting Denver. Thank you Kimpton.  Can’t wait to return.",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Great Boutique Hotel ,"Fantastic rooms, very spacious, very nicely decorated, you can feel that they really cared about generating positive energy into it. I would just recommend they have a sort of light automation inside to make it more energy efficient and easier to turn lights in and off.Service is fantastic and the location is very central and the Italian Resturant down stairs is good. Highly recommended!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Wonderful Hotel,Third time this year I have stayed at a captain in the US. A wonderful hotel chain with unique accommodations and very courteous staff.

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Great visit,"Our visit to this hotel was a nice experience, the front desk staff was very nice and the bellman was super friendly and helpful!  This place is within walking distance to great areas of Denver, the room was spacious and clean and we look forward to staying here in the future!  Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Pleasant hotel in city centre,"We stayed 3 nights en route to Estes Park. Hotel is central, near enough to railway from airport to walk, a block from free bus route. Room spacious and modern. No view from our room which was disappointing given rates I paid. Great A/c given the heat in August was unusual. We recommend this hotel",4
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Center of Denver!,5 stars! Courteous staff at all times! Housekeeping service was removed due to COVID-19 which is completely understandable and prefer that way as well for the time being so you have to request items or replenishment. Super neat detail of the attendants to place everything where it belongs - usually hotels would leave them on top of bed or counter table. They also keep in touch with you by text which comes in handy. I had a last minute change and spoke with Jordan who accommodated me with an additional bed and stunning downtown views. Thank you Elise for the super smooth/informative check in.,5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,A wonderful stay!,"I stayed at the Monaco for a visit with some family. The staff was courteous and extremely helpful. The rooms was one of the cleanest I've ever stayed in, and I travel quite a bit for business. The décor is modern, and the whole place seemed to be recently updated. Panzano has amazing calamari, pizza and a good selection of local beers. I highly recommend staying if you are in the area.  The quick walk to Coors Field is a plus!",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,heating/cooling issues,we checked in on a day with a high of 45.  The heat would not work.  We called for service and house engineer had to break into controls in closet ceiling to adjust source.  Next day  Temps were 65 and the room temp wouldn't cool.  Rather frustrating.,3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Great Downtown location,"Enjoyable stay on way to visit son in college 10-12 March.  Comfortable and spacious rooms, nice lobby and attached bar/restaurant.

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Very Nice Stay,"I stayed for 5 nights and really liked the hotel.  The staff was always friendly and helpful. The room was great, comfortable bed and a really nice shower. It had a lot of outlets and charging ports.  Pretty nice location too.",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Nice,"I did a “Pack up and go” trip, so I did not choose hotel, I was pleasantly surprised.Happy hour was weird ( who serves cake and drinks?) appetizers would have been appreciated...Staff was nice and the place felt safe and comfortable.Great location!",4
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Beautiful hotel. Amazing hospitality,"We arrived on a weekday early, and they were able to accommodate us right away. The valet was quick and pleasant.  The concierge was the friendliest person and gave great advice. Complimentary happy hour with free massage. Again, pleasant people and lively surroundings. The rooms and common areas were tasteful and grand. The food was good. Breakfast pastries and parfaits convenient grab and go.  We grabbed a Lyft to the Botanical Gardens which was a must see. That’s another review!",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Great hotel,"Restaurant attached is outstanding. Friendly and attentive staff. Bathroom immaculate.Long hot shower and never ran out of hot water, was fantastic.Hotel has a great vibe. Felt safe as a solo traveling female.",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Cell Block Decor,"Yes, we were uncomfortable. The bland gray/black decor was dreary. The windows looked out on another building, so we couldn't see the sky. We also couldn't get the windows open to air out the strong off-gassing smell of the carpet and furniture. The entry to the room was tiled such that our feel had shivers from the cold.In the middle of the night we were awakened with sounds of someone pounding mails and using what sounded like a shop vacuum. We chose the Klimpton because fo the beauty of their San Francisco hotel. This one is not even close to that feel of luxury and beauty.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Warmly Accommodating,"We stayed 5 nights at the conveniently located Hotel Monaco as part of a travel package. The hotel is walking distance from some of the best restaurants, a river walking/biking path, and the 6th Street Mall. We were very impressed by the service at the front desk and throughout the hotel. Jared, the manager did his best to accommodate every request we made and even texted to check in with us about what else they could do after we had asked for a room-change. Sheepishly I asked if they could put a sheet we had brought from home into their dryers that had gotten soaked at a Red Rocks concert the night before and they happily complied (twice!). When the sheet was not ready for the third concert, Jared gave me 2 hotel sheets to use in order to mark our GA seats at RR. The room we stayed in the latter 4 nights was beautiful, well-lit and comfortably sized. Every conversation with servers, housekeeping, bellman, and valets was warm and welcoming. We will return.",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Boutique Hotel,"Quaint Boutique Hotel in downtown Denver. Unless you are looking for a regular chain in the Denver area, I would recommend Hotel Monaco as the only good hote to stay in the downtown area. With saying that it is due a renovation. In the early years, it was a much better maintained hotel. It does offer a restaurant and the rooms are spacious and basic. Good for a long weekend trip.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Average Hotel,"Friendly staff and very welcoming. Pricey valet $40, but that is expected downtown I guess. Rooms were outdated and older furniture. Overall would recommend staying somewhere else value wise. View from the room was a cement wall. Not a bad hotel though.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Kind of disappointed ,"Spent just one night - have stayed in Kimpton before and been impressed so looked forward to this stay. As is typical when staying in big city, parking was very limited and costly:  $42 per day. Room was very nice in appearance. Several things disappointed us though.  My husband was looking forward to watching Thursday night football only to find out the hotel doesn't off the NFL channel, so no football for him. Next, there was no coffee maker in the room. Complimentary coffee and tea were offered in the lobby, instead. When we checked out we commented on the lack of coffee maker in room and were told if we would have asked, they would have provided one. Well, there was nothing in the room indicating amenities or available services. Lastly, the shower. Beautiful shower - very large!  But the door doesn't seal so we ended up with a flood on the bathroom floor after each of our showers. So, the place is beautiful but I don't feel it is worth the price.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Great Hotel. Room had issues.,"While not as nice other Kimpton hotels, I did love the decor and location of this hotel. Of my five nights, I had issues with my room 4 of those days. Tv didn't work. Key slider didn't work and had to wait a long time for it to be repaired. No hot water twice. Only one elevator working until the last day. While this was my reality I don't think it was indicative of most experiences and the bottom line, the hotel took care of the issues and took care of me as well. I still recommend the hotel but think it's important to communicate potential issues.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,"Beautiful hotel, great restaurant, no hot water or A/C.","My wife and I booked a Spa Guest Room with one King Bed at the Denver, Kimpton Monaco for our anniversary on our recent vacation to CO. Normally a $459/night room (before taxes and service fees and valet), we paid $283 through Travelocity. Guaranteed check-in: 3pm. Finally were able to check-in closer to 3:45pm. Things happen so this was no big deal. We had dinner at Panzano's which is fantastic and went back to the room. Sometime around 2am, we both woke up because the air conditioner and thermostat were not working. This is common in hotels where they ""manage"" energy usage. Not sure if this is because I booked through Travelocity or because the hotel has budget issues. We woke around 6am to catch a flight home. My wife went to shower and there was no hot water. She called the front desk and was told that a technician would didn't come in till 7am. This was not acceptable as we had a finite amount of time before we needed to be at the airport. Management offered to let us in another room to shower, and being our only choice, that's what we did. For our troubles, we were offered a comped room within 1-year, which is a nice gesture, but we were on vacation and we won't be going back to Denver just because we have a free room. I was told, ""since I booked through a third-party, that's all that could be done."" After I spoke with Travelocity about the matter, and they in turn spoke with Kimpton Monaco management, I was offered a refund of $25. Thanks but no thanks. That's less than 10% of the discounted rate and a little over 5% of the hotel rate. That's a slap in the face and shows me that Kimpton Monaco owners and management do not value their customers and they advertise a product they can not and do not intend to provide.There's two things I expect when I stay at a hotel, hot water and a working air conditioner. I've stayed in hostels in 3rd world countries that had working air conditioning and hot water for $11/night. The Kimpton Monaco failed to provide these things, as well as their ""guaranteed check-in"".So...if you're like me and expect hot water and a working air conditioner, you might consider the Brown Palace or the Hyatt downtown, I know we will. Both are exceptional hotels with great views and easy access to downtown restaurants. Don't waste your time or money at the Kimpton Monaco.",2

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Haunting experience - stole my belongings,"I’ve been meaning to write this review for over a year. What happened there still truly haunts me and caused me some emotional turmoil. I stayed there in the middle of a move and left personal belongings with valet/baggage storage due to last minute flight snafu. I checked with front desk saying I wasn’t sure when I’d be back but that I would grab them as soon as I came back which would likely be in a month or so. They said totally fine. Circumstances prevented me from coming back for several months but I called twice and they said it was all good.  When I called to say I was coming back to get my things 2 months after my last call in which they had said just come when you can (and gave me NO deadline) they couldn’t find them then said they got rid of them! NOBODY called me! My phone number was written in Black sharpie in HUGE font on 2 of the bags along with my name. my belongings consisted of BRAND NEW ski helmet, brand new ski goggles, very nice powder skis (in a nice ski bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE), very nice ski boots (in a nice boot bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE and my helmet, goggles in same bag), ski clothing, and a box of hugely sentimental belongings from my move (family pictures, documents, etc). Again, my phone number was written in huge letters on both the ski bag and the boot bag and the box. No effort whatsoever to contact me. As if they had called I would have had had a local friend pick up ASAP. Clearly an employee took the skis/boots or sold them.  When I called to say I was getting them they were super vague about what happened but said they did remember the stuff and said someone took them away. Sure policy on tag says not liable but this is robbery by employees in a locked closet and wrong and they shouldn’t have told me on phone not to worry about not picking it up. More importantly, be a decent human and at least make a phone call, some effort when the phone number is screaming to you, before taking them or getting rid of them. This wasn’t just a suitcase or a bag that was a bother to them. This was nice belongings that clearly someone wanted, otherwise they would have at least CALLED ME before taking them even if it's policy. They know given the fact that there was a phone number someone would have come for them. Not to mention if they had just checked with the front desk. But the fact that my contact info was LARGE on every single item means there is ZERO excuse. I cried when I found out and could not believe their lack of care or apology about the situation. This was at LEAST $3.5K worth of belongings PLUS the box of truly irreplaceable family belongings on top of that. They offered NO accommodation whatsoever.

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,NOT worth what we paid for!!,"Our power went out in the first hour from using a blowdryer and there was hardly any apology. That shouldn’t happen in a large hotel, and although someone came to fix it I expected more (he also had to come into our room after it went out again...). Everything is so cheaply made- paint chipping everywhere, shower door didn’t close, 1 towel hook for 2 people, bathroom decor looking so decrepit, and the hallway felt like a cold pool entry way. So unwelcoming when a hotel room is supposed to feel comforting and cozy. I will never stay at a boutique hotel again- just an excuse to use “trendy” aka cheap furniture and decorations to lure in young people. Pictures were so misleading compared to the “deluxe” room we actually got. I wish I had taken pictures. Will not be staying at a Kimpton again anytime soon! Would rather stay at a Hampton or Hilton, at least they’re always clean, cozy and reliable!… Kimpton again anytime soon!

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Center of Denver!,5 stars! Courteous staff at all times! Housekeeping service was removed due to COVID-19 which is completely understandable and prefer that way as well for the time being so you have to request items or replenishment. Super neat detail of the attendants to place everything where it belongs - usually hotels would leave them on top of bed or counter table. They also keep in touch with you by text which comes in handy. I had a last minute change and spoke with Jordan who accommodated me with an additional bed and stunning downtown views. Thank you Elise for the super smooth/informative check in.,5

The rooms was one of the cleanest I've ever stayed in, and I travel quite a bit for business. The décor is modern, and the whole place seemed to be recently updated. Panzano has amazing calamari, pizza and a good selection of local beers. I highly recommend staying if you are in the area.  The quick walk to Coors Field is a plus!",5

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Wish this could be 4 stars,"I am a big fan and frequent guest of Kimpton hotels. I have stayed at the Denver Monaco twice before and had great experiences. This visit fell short in a few critical areas. Our room was as requested, high floor and away from the elevator, but the heating/cooling system was not functioning well. Our first night the room didn't cool off at all. I spoke with a very polite gentleman at the front desk and he assured me the engineers would look into it. Gratefully, they did and the cooling kicked in Night #2. My bigger beef is with the housekeepers. I always tip the housekeeping staff---hey, we've all had jobs like that. So imagine my dismay when at 4 PM on our second day they still had not serviced the room! WOW!! We called the front desk and they got on it, because the staff came and cleaned but it was at a very awkward time for my husband and me as we needed to shower before going out to dinner. Final issue: the ""bar"" at Panzano's is a small, crammed-in-the-corner affair with no place to sit. I guess when there is a classy restaurant onsite, I believe the bar should be comparable. I'm thinking of the Vault at the Monaco in Salt Lake City...lovely place to have a drink with the hubby, or a friend. Not impressed with the bar set-up here...if the hotel would like to cultivate the drinks-and-dinner crowd, this area needs some serious work!! I am a diehard Kimpton fan, but I think I'll be staying in Salt Lake from now on.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Bad Experience ,"Normally a big fan of Kimpton properties but on a quick weekend trip to visit family in Denver encountered many annoying issues. First issue discovered was the safe in our room did not function. As we we were waiting for the engineer to show up to fix the issue we were bombarded by the annoying sound of what sounded like a jackhammer in the room next to us. When the engineer got to the room he explained they were remodeling the bathrooms in the hotel and that we could expect to hear the incredibly annoying sound for another 45 minutes to an hour!Last issue encountered was when I went to use the bathroom around 11:00 pm and discovered that there was no running water. A call to the front desk (which was finally picked up after approximately 50 rings) had the front desk personnel telling me that the water would be off for 2 hours due to a ""water emergency "". Not sure what a ""water emergency "" is but after having a personal ""water emergency "" I couldn't flush the toilet....All in all a very poor stay for what is usually a very solid, positive customer experience. Highly disappointing.",2
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Terrible service and attitude,"If it weren't for the restaurant, Panzano, attached to this hotel it would have gotten one star.  Long waits for our car after paying $38 for parking!  Housekeeping came when we didn't want them and didn't show up during a four hour window when we asked for it!  Numerous calls and complaints to the front desk but still no results.Not only we will never stay at this hotel again, but we cancelled a reservation for a 9 day stay at the Kimpton in Salt Lake City.  Kimpton is off our list.",2
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Nice stay but room for some improvements,"This is a very nice hotel in a decent location of LoDo.  The positive:- Great Location - Beautiful Lobby - Nice Atmosphere-  Rooms Look Nice-  Overall Clean - Very good restaurant on site - Were very nice to accommodate super early check in and late check out requests. - King Bed room was perfect size.  Queen Room (my friend stayed in) was tight. - Great shower pressure - Very nice staff but lacks some high hospitality attitude at times (not all just a few interactions)The negative:This hotel has a way to go to come up to the standard of the one other Kimpton property (and many high end hotels I have stayed at)  I have been to. - The bathrooms have either no ventilation or extremely weak ventilation. - The rooms are inconsistently outfitted.  My room did not have the same local magazines as my friends,  I did not have an eat in menu in my room, etc. - My bed cover had a stain on it (looked like a cigarette stain) but it was visible, never got changed? - Not enough drawers for clothes storage if you are there as a couple - Never replaced my shampoo or conditioner at clean up??  Luckily I had a drop left :) - No concierge on duty and the front desk staff, although they did try, was not very good at suggestions and recommendations.In short, I would stay here again if the deal was good.  I paid under $200 but saw the same rooms advertised at $300+ for the same nights.  For that price I think there are better and higher end choices in the area.",3

The location is perfect for all that downtown Denver has to offer and there isn't much more to be said one could describe as ""positive."" The rooms are pedestrian by upscale standards. The staff, while courteous, seemed largely disingenuous. We didn't eat at the restaurant, although everyone I know speaks highly of both the food and the service.On the day of our checkout, we didn't have hot water to the shower or bath sinks.

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Super disapponting,"From beginning to end the hotel was a disappointment. I’ve been to many Kimpton’s over the years and this is the first one I will not return to. We checked in on Christmas Eve  and there’s no Christmas tree!  We visited the Four Seasons for brunch, the Meridien and Hyatt Regency for drinks and all were beautifully decorated with Christmas trees. Second problem was that their food service didn’t open until 2pm on Christmas Day so no breakfast in the hotel for any guests. Had to go elsewhere. We put out the Room Service tab on Christmas night to have breakfast brought up at 7am. I get a call at 6:55 that they “forgot”, but they weren’t opening until 8am today.

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Make sure you check your bill!,"I was recently in Denver for business and stayed at this hotel. I love Kimptons, but this experience was not the best.The hotel itself is beautiful, centrally located, and my room was very comfortable.However, I had a few annoyances that left me leaving a less than excellent rating:1) When I arrived at the hotel, I was early but hoped I could get a room.  I was told that they had no idea when a room would be ready and that I needed to wait.  Totally understand that I was early, but I was pretty disappointed when I overheard several other guests checking in after I tried to.   2) About an hour later they were able to put me in a room, which was much appreciated.  It was however right near the elevator and mechanical room, so it was pretty noisy with the elevator and hallway noise when late night some guests were trying to make their way back to their rooms.3) When I checked out on Saturday morning (around 5am), I was told by the front desk to write down my name, room number and email address and that the bill would be sent to me.  I waited 3 days, and still nothing.  So, I called them and they were able to email it to me.  It was then, that I noticed they charged me $38 for overnight parking---that was particularly interesting since I didn't have a car with me at all during my stay!!  I immediately called them back, and was transferred to accounting.  No one answered there, so I called back and was transferred to someone else, who then just did the same thing and put me back to accounting's voicemail.  I travel very frequently for work, and this is the first time I've encountered erroneous billing like this, as well as such a lackluster response.So, I'd recommend staying here but caution that their billing",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,"Small rooms, inconvenient for those with cars, no hot water in the a.m.","This property DEFINITELY caters to the business traveler who is either on foot or has company money to spend on parking/valet. Upon check in, you will be asked if you want a key to the mini bar. Say yes if you want access to the fridge. This is in a historical building so the rooms are on the small side, yet beautifully appointed. You must pay extra for the wi-fi and for parking. Valet is $30+ per day so we opted to park elsewhere, which initially felt like a great idea. However, Denver street parking has very strange rules. For example, we found lots of places where you could pay for all night but you had to come back between 4am-7am the next morning to pay for a little more time. There was no option to just pay for a 24 hour stretch. When we got in, we were able to pay $5 from 5pm until midnight and the we would've had to get back up and repay for another day (with no in-out priv.). We finally did find a lot where we could pay $5 for the rest of the night up until 8am the next day. That worked.  It's on the corner of 20th and Champa if interested and a very, very short walk to the property.We stayed 2 nights, Sunday-Tuesday and the noise levels were very low. It was a quiet property, bustling with upper-middle to upper class business people.  I would not recommend this place for anything but business travel.  The morning of check out, I attempted to take a shower at 6:00 am. I ran the water for 4 minutes but it remained ice cold. I even tried moving the nozzle back and forth just in case I had some how accidentally set it to cold vs. warm but no go. There simply was no hot/or even luke warm water left. I checked out without a shower.  For $226 night, I expect a hot or at least, warm shower in the morning.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Is the Monaco Denver really a Kimpton hotel???I doubt!!!,"From the very beginining everything was complicated!!!I have booked a 4 night stay in Monaco Denver spa room  starting 1st,April.AS I`d arrive early in the following morning( 2nd,April),I decided to pay an extra night in order to go to the room immediately.I called the hotel in advance  asking them not to cancel my reservation since I`d not be there Wednesday night!!I live in Brazil!!I made na international and expensive phone call to let the hotel knowing my plans!!They kept me on the phone for 20 minutes.I talked at least with 3 persons til I asked for the manager and Juan took care of everything!!April,2nd,I arrived at the hotel at 10 am( our flight was delayed in Miami and DEnver Airport was so far away from Downtown).I checked in and received Keys for a standard room .I realized it when I saw no jacuzzi there.Carrying my luggage back to front desk I had a chance to meet,the same  juan whoI talked on the phone early in the week.I explained him everything and I was told that there was no spa rooms ready for me!!Well,I had paid an extra night and now I was told that I had to wait??I was tired from the long trip!!More than a hour late I got my room.I  was hungry,tired,and lost one precious hour dealing with the  check in!!!At last Juan upgraded us for a mediterranean suíte.I do think that Kimpton should keep na eye at ths hotel!!!Things dont work well there!!!I would be unfair if I dont mention that the Mediterranean Suite is absolutey fantastic!!Decoration was amazing,and I loved to have a pet fish with me in Denver!!!One other good thing:Dave,the bellman who was extremely helpful!!!By the way,Juan offered me a complimentary extra night at the hotel and I declined!!!To tell the truth,I was supposed to check out Sunday,5th,but I checked out at Saturday 4th.So,I paid for 4 nights and I used just 2!!!So sad!!!",2

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Does not compare to other Monaco,"Stayed at few hotels in Denver Downtown.  I had stayed at a Monaco in Portland which was outstanding. The rooms from the Denver hotel does not compare to the one in Portland.  The rates were very high even with government discount.  I do like the free wine tasting from 5-6 pm but the Portland Monaco also had craft beers.  When comparing the hotels I have stayed in the close proximity, i would easily say the rooms were better at the Hyatt Convention centre and the Homewood Suite beside it.  Both of them offer much better value and the rooms are much bigger.",3

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Haunting experience - stole my belongings,"I’ve been meaning to write this review for over a year. What happened there still truly haunts me and caused me some emotional turmoil. I stayed there in the middle of a move and left personal belongings with valet/baggage storage due to last minute flight snafu. I checked with front desk saying I wasn’t sure when I’d be back but that I would grab them as soon as I came back which would likely be in a month or so. They said totally fine. Circumstances prevented me from coming back for several months but I called twice and they said it was all good.  When I called to say I was coming back to get my things 2 months after my last call in which they had said just come when you can (and gave me NO deadline) they couldn’t find them then said they got rid of them! NOBODY called me! My phone number was written in Black sharpie in HUGE font on 2 of the bags along with my name. my belongings consisted of BRAND NEW ski helmet, brand new ski goggles, very nice powder skis (in a nice ski bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE), very nice ski boots (in a nice boot bag WITH MY PHONE NUMBER IN HUGE FONT ON OUTSIDE and my helmet, goggles in same bag), ski clothing, and a box of hugely sentimental belongings from my move (family pictures, documents, etc). Again, my phone number was written in huge letters on both the ski bag and the boot bag and the box. No effort whatsoever to contact me. As if they had called I would have had had a local friend pick up ASAP. Clearly an employee took the skis/boots or sold them.  When I called to say I was getting them they were super vague about what happened but said they did remember the stuff and said someone took them away. Sure policy on tag says not liable but this is robbery by employees in a locked closet and wrong and they shouldn’t have told me on phone not to worry about not picking it up. More importantly, be a decent human and at least make a phone call, some effort when the phone number is screaming to you, before taking them or getting rid of them. This wasn’t just a suitcase or a bag that was a bother to them. This was nice belongings that clearly someone wanted, otherwise they would have at least CALLED ME before taking them even if it's policy. They know given the fact that there was a phone number someone would have come for them. Not to mention if they had just checked with the front desk. But the fact that my contact info was LARGE on every single item means there is ZERO excuse. I cried when I found out and could not believe their lack of care or apology about the situation. This was at LEAST $3.5K worth of belongings PLUS the box of truly irreplaceable family belongings on top of that. They offered NO accommodation whatsoever.

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,I am not seeing why this hotel is rated so high?,"So this hotel had a lot of good things going for it but overall I feel it was very over priced compared to other nearby hotels. Also, it lacked some standard hotel accommodations that should be included at the rate. Pros: Everyone was super nice, free bike rentals, room was comfy and quite. The location was also really nice.Cons: The view from our room was the side of a parking garage. We were even on the top floor. No sun really came into the room since it was right up against the garage so we had to turn the lamps on during the day just to see. No microwave or mini fridge. We also had no cell phone reception while inside our room (AT&T). This was stressful since my mother was watching our son and we couldn't be reached once we were in our room. No coffee machine in room (although they did have a coffee bar from 7-10am). Lastly you can only get free internet by signing up for their loyalty program (easy to do but should just be free like every other hotel)",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Bad experience,"Got a room in the second floor, with a view on a wall just in front of the window. The worst view ever. Don't know, maybe it's a punishment for purchasing the room via the website ""booking"" ?Hoped the breaksfast could change my opinion, but unfortunately I wake up too early for the hotel staff : the breakfast was only possible from 9 am.",1
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Thanks for the room with the parking lot view.,I stayed at this hotel because of the ratings trip advisor gave it - it was priced about the same as a The Westin. We should have stayed at The Westin. First I arrived late and my husband checked us in - the view was of a parking lot. It was too late to change rooms by the time I arrived so we just kept it. The lobby was quaint - the fish for the kids a cool concept - dog stuff very nice. But the staff was not friendly at all. From the valet to the front desk - all very unfriendly and very unwelcoming. The beds were extremely uncomfortable. Again if you have a choice between this hotel and The Westin - which were the same price when we booked - stay at The Westin. Until this hotel can step it up a notch especially with the service.,1
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Beware,"I enjoy the Kimpton brand of hotels and have stayed at many with good experiences so I joined the In-Touch program. Unfortunately my experience at the Denver Monaco was less than optimal. I made my reservation 4 months prior to arrival. The room that I was given (#208) was the worst I have ever been in and seemed unsafe with a cement wall and walkway outside the window. I was astounded a Kimpton would even sell such a room. I was informed the hotel was full with a wedding. After a rough night in the room I packed my suitcase and was prepared to check into another hotel if I could not be given a decent and safe room. The staff at the front desk were nice but seemed unable to manage the necessary service recovery without my persistence. My colleagues did not have the same experience, reserving a king room, not the queen as I did. I guess at this hotel you get better treatment if you spend $9/day more. By the end of the following day I did get another room facing the street on the second floor, which apparently is the dog-friendly floor. I was not informed of this fact so you may want to ask beforehand. The restaurant at the hotel is lovely with good service. I would choose another hotel in Denver next time.",3

Other issues included a room next to the elevator, and iffy hot water in the shower.  And I’m a Kimpton member!  A shame but this Kimpton gives them all a bad name.   … shame but this Kimpton gives them all a bad name.   ",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,"A decent hotel experience, a bit lower than expectations","I stayed at this Kimpton property for work. I love Kimpton properties and all the little perks they offer, and had high expectations; therefore, I give 3 stars because the hotel just didn't meet many of them.I'll start with the good (in addition to the normal great Kimpton things, like friendly service, good gyms and free happy hour): 1) Location is great, I walked almost everywhere. It is very ""downtowny"" so if you're looking for a cooler, more homey neighborhood then probably stay elsewhere. But if you're looking for great access to some good restaurants and the 16th st mall, this is good.2) Room service was excellent and very fast. It comes from Panzano, the restaurant downstairs, and it tasted fresh and delicious.3) I was ""upgraded"" to a room with two queens, even though I was only one person. I find this awkward, but I was grateful for the space because the room was very big.Now the not so good (especially for business travelers):1) The Kimpton boasts being able to supply you with items you've forgotten, including phone chargers. Of course, I forgot ALL my chargers this trip, so I asked if they had any iphone chargers. They had none and they said they don't really give them out because people take them. Well then, don't advertise that you offer them! When I asked if there was an ipod dock in the room, I was told no (ps, there are docks in every room, suitable for models pre-5). I couldn't quite believe that they seriously had NO iphone 4 or 5 chargers, OR blackberry chargers (for my kindle) in the hotel, including lost and found. 2) The internet in the room was TERRIBLE. I understand it was free (for inTouch members) but if you are trying to cater to business customers, you need to have wifi that works. I was expecting to be able to work from my hotel in the evenings, and that turned out to be impossible. When I asked, they mentioned they were having internet issues that day, but it was a regular occurrence. Also, at no fault to the Kimpton but just an FYI, AT&T has TERRIBLE service in the hotel - basically nonexistent.3) In order to print something, you need to use their business center where you will be charged for both internet usage and per page. I totally understand charging per page, but if you are offering free wifi to Kimpton members, why are you charging for use of the internet in the business center to those same members?? The girl at the front desk semi-reluctantly printed my one page for me ""as a one time courtesy"". But they should revisit this policy.All in all, I still like Kimptons, but would probably stay elsewhere if I find myself back in Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Very nice hotel with a few disappointments,"This is a beautiful hotel - rooms are nice, wine at cocktail hour, great downtown location, etc. Front desk staff is friendly but not familiar with area - didn't correctly estimate time or distance of two destinations. Rooms and parking are expensive. Free wifi requires registering online for Kimpton loyalty program - takes too long and requires too many steps. I didn't do it correctly so I had to go to front desk to get a code. (Would have been nice to receive it during check-in.)",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,"We love Monaco hotels, but this one had some problems","We go to Portland, OR frequently and always stay at the Monaco. We love the hotel itself, but the service there is amazing. It's why we stay there. We've stayed in Monacos in a few other cities and are always pleased. Last weekend we stayed in the one in Denver. As usual it was clean, comfortable, roomy, well-located, quiet and all the things we love about the Monaco hotels. The service there was a bit wanting, however. We originally booked two weekends in a row because we were not sure which weekend we would be there. They assured us we could cancel one of the weekends when we knew our plans. We later called and canceled the first weekend (about a month in advance of the date), but made sure they held on to the reservation for the second weekend, saying we were definitely coming. A few days before we left, I looked at our credit card statement on line, and saw that they had charged us $150 for a ""no-show"" on the weekend that we had canceled! I called and complained, and they said they would reverse the charge. They didn't seem very sorry about the inconvenience and offered no compensation. So, we arrived in Denver last weekend, went to the hotel, and found that we did NOT have any reservation at all, even though I had clearly stated that we were definitely keeping the reservation on the second weekend. Fortunately, they did have a room anyway, but were rather blase about the whole thing and not apologetic as if this kind of thing happens all the time. What if they had been booked up?The rest of our stay was fine. We checked out three days later, got the bill and everything looked ok. They asked if we had taken anything from the mini bar and we said no. (We never touch mini bars). Then after we got home, I looked at our credit card statement on line, and saw an additional charge of $7! I would usually shrug it off, but after all the hassle with the reservations, I wanted to find out why they did this. I called and was told we'd taken a bag of almonds from the mini bar. I said we'd done no such thing, and they said they'd reverse the charge. Just one more dumb little annoying thing. When you stay at Monacos, all this stuff is SO unexpected! Too bad for the Denver Monaco.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Amenities are bush league,"Room is pretty nice.  They charge you for EVERYTHING!!!  There is no coffee in the room, $12.50 a day (per computer) for wifi, $33 per day for valet parking!!  Yikes!!  I've had better amenities in Manhattan!  Also, FYI, forget about the restaurant here at the hotel -- Panzano's.   Mediocre.PS.  We have been here for 3 hours and that's what we have figured out so far...",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Medicore Hotel,"I'm not sure why this hotel is rated so highly. It's near the 16th Street mall in Denver, but it is very dated. While it has some of the charm of a Kimpton hotel, it's nothing overly special--and the hotel is definitely starting to show it's age.The hotel staff were friendly and pleasant, and the hotel and my room were clean. The most confusing part of arriving was trying to locate the ""valet"" parking. Eventually, a guy walked out to our car and asked us if we were staying there, if we wanted valet, or if we wanted to park in one of the nearby garages. It was an odd conversation that lasted 30 seconds and left us confused. We pulled up to the valet, wanted valet, but it seemed like he was trying to sell us in parking in a garage instead.But, the overall experience wasn't bad--just average. It's just a dated property that is starting to show it's age around the fringes.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Amazing customer service,"If you are visiting Denver, the Kimpton Hotel Monaco is the place to stay! We recently moved to Denver & have stayed here a couple times during the transition. The hotel has the best customer service, beds & pillows are amazing & the added plus is that they are pet friendly 🐾 We will definitely search for Kimpton Hotels to stay at for all of our future vacations.",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Nice...BUT Not Special,"We LOVE Kimpton proprieties and find they each have their own unique character.  My husband and I did a staycation here on our recent anniversary and were pleasantly surprised and appreciative when they offered us an upgrade to a suite.  The front desk staff was welcoming and lovely. The rooms were spacious and modern.  One concern was that the carpet was wet (saturated) and we were not comfortable walking on it without shoes.  The bathroom while modern had large scratches on the grey pocket door and the grout was filled with ""dirt"".  The decor was VERY dark with poor lighting.  The color scheme was dark grey and this added to the poorly lite space...almost had a gothic feel.Unfortunately our A/C was not working  to capacity and we were so uncomfortable we were unable to sleep!  A call to the front desk came with an offer to bring up a fan.  Given the size of the room and high ceilings a fan would be useless... so we remained uncomfortable for the duration.  We also wanted a room with a view and unfortunately our view was a concrete area loaded with construction supplies!  Such a disappointment.  We did eat in their award winning Italian restaurant and found that disappointing as well.  The staff was hurried and unfocused.  We waited at our table for almost 15 minutes before a greeted and service was slow despite the fact that it was not particularly busy.  Meal was good but not outstanding and it was cold upon arrival.  There are many choices to stay in Denver, including another Kimpton and I think next time we will stay elsewhere.",3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Beautiful Rooms,I have stayed at this hotel several times in the last few years and have always enjoyed my experience. The guest rooms were just renovated and are beautiful! Service has always been great and I am always happy to return.,5

"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,"Great hotel, location and staff","We had a convention in Fenver and visited the Monaco. Great hotel, perfect location and a wonderful staff. Amber Wilcox went above and beyond great service. She was so friendly and outgoing making sure we found the perfect restaurant and told us what to order. Great staff and would be happy to stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Center of Denver!,5 stars! Courteous staff at all times! Housekeeping service was removed due to COVID-19 which is completely understandable and prefer that way as well for the time being so you have to request items or replenishment. Super neat detail of the attendants to place everything where it belongs - usually hotels would leave them on top of bed or counter table. They also keep in touch with you by text which comes in handy. I had a last minute change and spoke with Jordan who accommodated me with an additional bed and stunning downtown views. Thank you Elise for the super smooth/informative check in.,5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,A wonderful stay!,"I stayed at the Monaco for a visit with some family. The staff was courteous and extremely helpful. The rooms was one of the cleanest I've ever stayed in, and I travel quite a bit for business. The décor is modern, and the whole place seemed to be recently updated. Panzano has amazing calamari, pizza and a good selection of local beers. I highly recommend staying if you are in the area.  The quick walk to Coors Field is a plus!",5
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,heating/cooling issues,we checked in on a day with a high of 45.  The heat would not work.  We called for service and house engineer had to break into controls in closet ceiling to adjust source.  Next day  Temps were 65 and the room temp wouldn't cool.  Rather frustrating.,3
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Great Downtown location,"Enjoyable stay on way to visit son in college 10-12 March.  Comfortable and spacious rooms, nice lobby and attached bar/restaurant. Historic District, State Capitol, Mint, Station, Baseball etc all within easy walking distance as were a large selection of bars and restaurants. ",4
"Denver, CO",Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver,Very Nice Stay,"I stayed for 5 nights and really liked the hotel.  The staff was always friendly and helpful. The room was great, comfortable bed and a really nice shower. It had a lot of outlets and charging ports.  Pretty nice location too.",5
