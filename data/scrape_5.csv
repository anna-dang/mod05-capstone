"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!,"This hotel was a disappointment to say the least. The pictures make this hotel seem luxurious and top notch, however this is far from it. From the shooting that happened while we were there (no one staying was informed...we saw the news man outside our window recording so we turned on the tv to see what happened) to stained bed/pillows, this hotel was a mess. I don’t have issue with marijuana, but if you do or have kids, this is not the place for you. Although they do make you agree to not smoke and sign a form during check in, during my stay no one seemed to follow that rule and it reeked of weed in my room most days. Lastly, I don’t know if people didn’t know where to put their room service dishes after they were finished, but there were plates of food in the hallways for over 24 hours before anyone cleaned up. I would definitely check out other hotels in the area because The Warwick Denver is not what it is made to seem and I would probably give them a 1/2 star if it were an option.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Some rooms not as good as others,"We always get executive suite, these rooms are usually GREAT ! Not this time. We got room high floor, 12th. not as nice as some others. We never had hot water.Bed was soft lumpy,time to be relaced Staff was GREAT, Pool is GREAT, Fitness room is GREAT. Just some rooms not as good as others",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Made our birthday trip suck,"My husband and I took the chance to visit Colorado for the first time to celebrate our birthday. Bad idea.  When we checked in the hotel seems cool and clean enough, nice lobby.  Get to the room....and...crumbs everywhere on the seat in front of the bed and on the nightstands.  1st strike.....go back down they gave us another room, this was ok until we stayed the night.  The bathroom fan in the room was a hole in the ceiling and it didn’t work.  The Keurig was dirty even after three rounds of running water through.  The iron leaked water. The ac unit on the wall was dirty had to clean with my wipes.  The bathroom shower had mold.  So the next day they showed us a few more rooms we didn’t like any of the three other.  They said they would fix the vent and clean the room if we left for a hour. We left for a few hours and came back and NOTHING had been done!  Call down again and they said oh we were going to send you to another room because they can’t fix the vent.  Ugh.  We looked at three more rooms....they set us in a suite which was a little better because it had a seating area.  Oh I forgot to say EVERY BED IS HARD AS A ROCK!  This room had only one trash can. Oh yea and they don’t have liners...  They have a small fridge stacked with drinks they want you to buy but no pricing around.  I called the front desk and found they wer $3 and up!  No price list in rooms at all.  Ok the restaurant....over priced pizza!!  We spent $75/on three drinks a pizza and McDonald’s (look alike) truffle fries. Waste of money!  There is no place to parka few out front with meters...2 hour limits.  Everything is closed up around the hotel and boarded up and is scary.  There are homeless people EVERYWHERE! Not their fault but it is so sad. Oh and if you buy marijuana you can’t smoke it anywhere.... but back to the hotel...  As we are in our new room we spent a day in the mountains and called for housekeeping before we left around 10 am...they said they will send someone up.  We got back around 5 that evening.....NOTHING was cleaned at all!  Called downstairs and they said we are so sorry but house has left for the day.  WTW!  Thanks for nothing Warwick. Oh yeah you can hear everything through the walls.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick Hotel,"My boyfriend and I decided to get away and enjoy our selves for a night at The Warwick Hotel. Right away we visited their beautiful rooftop pool and after our swim we went to the restaurant here Gattara, and our waiter Brendan was awesome. His charisma was as amazing as the food. We woke up and decided to stay another night.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Anniversary stay at Warwick Hotel in Denver,"Customer service was great checking in. Checked in and told we have the best room (Premier King Suite). The next up is the highest they have which is the Presidential Suite which were completely booked (there are only two). Was provided a coupon for a free drink at the restaurant onsite. All good until the room. Upon walking into the room, we were unimpressed. The room is very dated and has stains on the walls, holes in the walls, dirty trash cans, pictures hanging sideways on the wall. There's only one remote for both tvs. Smallest tub/shower I've ever seen in a so called upscale hotel. Toilet paper holder falling off the wall. No travel guide book for guest in the room. Promptly went to the front desk as stated the obvious. I was told thats how all the rooms are. REALLY!!! Then the balcony (horrible view of an old brick building)...Why have a balcony you can't enjoy a cigar on. Its outside for a reason yet other guests were smoking Marijuana right outside the entryway of the hotel. This hotel is a joke and definitely not worth $220 a night plus additiinal fees. I would not recommend my worst enemy to stay here and waste their money. Never will I stay here again. Can't believe I became a member of this dumpster of a hotel. Paid for the staycation package, should have just stayed AWAY. Ruined our anniversary stay. The only good that will came out of this, we get to spend quality time together on our anniversary. Just sucks its in an overpriced dirt box.Tosha G.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice Hotel and Rooftop Pool,We enjoyed our trip to the Warwick Denver Hotel.  We checked in late on a Thursday evening and spent Friday and Saturday at the rooftop pool as well as visiting attractions nearby.  We were truly impressed when there was an emergency at the pool and bartenders Ezra and Brendan jumped right in to take care of the unconscious patron.  The concern for this young man and his mother was undeniable and something you don't see every day.   Ezra was also working the next day when another emergency arose and he handled that in a professional manner as well.  The only negative during our visit was the restrooms by the pool weren't open so you had to go to your room to use the restroom (which very few seemed to do!)The clean hotel and excellent service from the staff will make this one of our favorites to visit in the Denver area.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good drinks and atmosphere,Enjoyed our time. Pizza surprised us -didn’t expect much but the food did more than meet our expectations. Sarah was very attentive and gave great recommendations and really enjoyed our time while grabbing some quick food and drinks.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing!!,"Sarah was an ace, definitely one of the best bartender I have ever had. We loved her, she was profesional but yet really friendly. Defiantly coming back. Sarah thanks for taking care of our party. You are the best.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Loved the customer service,I was having a crappy day of travel. My flight was delayed and then the car rental place ran out of vehicles! I was starving by the time I checked into the hotel and Sarah was absolutely amazing and took extra care of me and made sure I was in a better place when I left. Absolutely phenomenal. And the pizza was fantastic. Thank you Sarah!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Location!,"A quiet, upscale boutique hotel in walking distance to the downtown/16th Street tourist district. The restaurant provided a tasty breakfast too.  The best part was the huge balcony perfect for enjoying the Colorado views.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Experience,"Wonderful bar, atmosphere and management. Especially appreciated Brendan, he deserves a raise. We will definitely be returning to this wonderful establishment everytime we come back to Denver. Go see Brendan at the pool and the restaurant for good advice on where to go and great drinks.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Disappointed,"I stayed here for 5 nights. Here are my impressions:Front Desk: Very pleasant when checking in. They never went over the wifi info and when I called no one answered...so I had to go down and ask in person.Room appearance/Cleanliness: The rooms were pretty basic and clean. All the furniture was in good condition. Carpeting was in good condition. Bathroom looked like it could use a remodel.Room functionality/Comfort: There is no microwave in any rooms...very odd to me. The bed was HORRIBLE - the mattress felt 10+ years old. I slept 4 out of 5 nights on the couch. Shower had amazingly good water pressure. I was on 10th floor and it took quite awhile for water to get hot. Noise: I heard sirens multiple times every night. This seems to be a pretty popular hotel for younger people to party and the noise levels can be high up until 2am-3am. Wifi: This was the worst I have seen in any hotel for the past decade at least. I had the member wifi access and it went off AT LEAST 12-15 times per day. Front desk would just say ""hmmm...ok...I'll let our IT/Engineer know."" I have stayed at Economy class hotels with way more reliable internet. Needless to say...I was not happy with my stay.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Cute place, one problem","Didn't get a chance to see the famous pool, but the hotel itself was nice and I appreciated the covid safety precautions. My room was big, bed was comfortable, and balcony pleasant. The folks beside me were smoking on their balcony which was mildly annoying but sometimes these things happen. The room had a minor amount of wear and tear, especially in the carpeting (and what looked to be some dried red nail polish on the bathroom floor...who does that?) However it still felt clean.Room service was speedy and friendly.My only real complaint was when I first tried to check in around 1:40, was told by a quiet fellow the room was ready but it would $50 extra to check in early (check in is at 3). That seems like a pretty big surcharge considering the rooms seem to be going for $100+ a night, so I said I'd wait in the lobby and read my book. However someone walked in right after me and was able to check in (with a woman this time, the guy had stepped aside) without having to pay the surcharge. 4 more people/groups checked in during the rest of that time and no extra $50 surcharge was brought up for early check in. Why was I singled out for this charge I wonder?The rest of the staff was very kind and friendly though.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Hanica, you are great!","I stayed with my girlfriend at the Warwick Denver Hotel from October 1 to October 5. It was our first time in Denver and Hanica gave us such a warm welcome and made our stay effortless. Hanica was one of the kindest individuals I have ever met as she was willing to answer all our questions from options of restaurants to romantic hikes we can take together. Hanica was also accommodating when it came to having our room serviced at inconvenient times, which gave both my girlfriend and I comfort during a pandemic.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Awesome weekend,"Just sayin, if something about Colorado feels A little, well, off to you, this place brings the comfort. Great to be back in the real world for a few days. 10/10 would recommend. The drinks are yummy too.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Gattara restaurant at the Warwick Hotel,Had a lovely evening dinner on the patio with Sarah taking care of us. Food was good and Sarah's service was wonderful! She's a genuine person and a great Bartender!Everyone we dealt with took care with Covid 19 protocols.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Brandon, you are great!","Lovely hotel close to all things downtown. Cute, spacious room to relax in. Thanks to Brandon for giving us such a warm welcome and for making our stay effortless. First impressions go a long way! Would definitely return",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Outstanding Service!!,"Our family was having a rough day with traveling from Avon to Denver as we encountered traveling issues, however Brendan and Brett made our day!! They kept us laughing and ensured we were well taken care of! Thank you Brett and Brendan for your hospitality, kindness, and the ability to cheer us up! We will definitely stay at this hotel with Brett and Brendan’s accommodations and humor. In addition, there was a gentleman by the name of Jesus that quickly fixed our air conditioner and was very pleasant. We are overall pleased with the hospitality.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Top place to stay in Denver,"Brandon the front office supervisor is by far is one of the best hospitality workers I have ever met. I am a manager at a Four Diamond Luxury Boutique hotel , and the way that Brandon took care of me is exactly how I wouldy take care of my own guests . I encountered a few minor issues with my particular room although as soon as Brandon heard he was swift on taking action addressing all of my concerns . The Warwick hotel is by far one of the best places to stay in Denver . The rooms are gorgeous with amazing views , the housekeeping team made me feel very safe during my stay especially the cleanliness throughout the property . The restaurant Gattata has amazing breakfast ,  I'll need to try the dinner menu next time. When staying at the Warwick , it was my last night in Colorado and my first time in downtown Denver . Brandon made my trip to Colorado complete. I can't thank him enough with his professionalism and his attention to my concerns . He deserves to be a GM at a Warwick property !!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Awesome service!,We ate a wonderful meal at the hotels restaurant. Definitely recommend the grilled octopus. We had the most amazing service from Brendan. He was super patient with us and gave us wonderful recommendations. Thanks again Brendan.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Rooftop,"We had a great stay, starting with meeting the pool bartender in the elevator who was extremely welcoming and friendly.  The rooftop pool is beautiful and the reason we booked a stay here with the weather.  It felt very safe with how they limited your time and the number of guests.  We also enjoyed the delicious Front Range breakfast at Gatarra the next morning!  The front desk in the morning was very helpful about parking advice while we did some walking around town.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,amazing,"Honestly didn’t know what to expect when I came here. Rooms were really nice, ambience great. Because of corona they don’t come by daily to clean your room so if that is something you have to ask for, but understandable. Restaurant downstairs was good, good pizzas, cool staff, but my favorite hidden gem was the pool bar tenders Brandon and Brendan. Great drinks but even better time. They really made you feel comfortable at home. Will definitely come back.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Birthday celebration for my daughter!,We had such a fun time here! The rooftop pool was the highlight of our stay! Sarah and Ezra were awesome! They were so attentive the whole time we were at the pool making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,STAFF AT POOL (Ezra & Brendan),We where at this hotel for about 10 days and each day the pool staff Ezra & Brendan where amazing!   Always friendly and professional and went above and beyond to make our stay and time at the pool comfortable.   Due to COVID it limited how many could be at the pool at one time....Ezra & Brendan did a great job at keeping everyone safe and healthy by spreading us out and limiting numbers in the pool area.   Both should get a raise for being remarkable contributions to customers and their company Warwick!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Outstanding Service, Staff & Amenities - Top Notch Food and Rooftop Pool was Excellent!!","My wife and I spent our first anniversary here at the Warwick Hotel Denver.I didn't even get out of my car and had a great experience with my Valet Jesse, who was attentive and knowledgeable.The room was clean and spacious with a great view. The only issue was the TV/Cable was out due to a service provider problem, no fault of the hotel. And, I would suggest 48"" TV's or larger since it's so far away from the bed ;).Originally our plans were to go to 54thirty Rooftop for dinner but they had a two-hour wait so we came back and decided to do dinner up at the pool. We went up to the rooftop pool where Zeke and Sarah exceeded every expectation. They created a relaxed poolside vibe and the presentation and attentiveness during dinner was impeccable. And the FOOD was delicious! I'm going to get a room just to hang out at the pool all day, just because they're that good.The next morning I relaxed by the pool and had an omelette for breakfast and the mushrooms were not your run-of-the-mill buttons.Everyone we interacted with was warm and attentive. We couldn't have been more thrilled with our experience. We're already planning our next stay.9.5/10",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Denver Warwick ONLY for me,"Couldn’t have asked for a better boutique hotel getaway trip for this new retired senior! Heated year round rooftop pool’s Ezra and Sarah are amazingly professional, fun, friendly and client-minded all the way! Never had to wait for drinks or food and accommodations… must have gourmet meals at Gattara like salmon, pizza, pork cheeks, awesome asparagus & omg cocktails to delight! Spacious rooms & private balcony-uh yeah! Definitely returning and happy new member!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Self,This is a excellent hotel and don't let other people change your mind. The staff is friendly and will help you any way possible.  We will return to this hotel again.  The rooms were nice and we like the grounds.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Miscellaneous charges and outdated rooms,Okay hotel except for the fact that everything in my bathroom had mildew and rust in the shower and I was also charged $18 per day to use the weight room and pool When I was unable to use them because of the reservations being booked. Also keep in mind they will not tell you about the $18 per day charge until you see it on your credit card. Save your money and go to another hotel there are nicer hotels with better amenities in less than a mile from this hotel. You also won’t have to worry about miscellaneous charges to ur card after the fact.,1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Appalling!!!,"Disgusting experience. Appalling treatment from staff, felt very uncomfortable throughout stay. Anyone thinking of using this hotel should stay away.Not worth your penny. Stay was horrific to say the least.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Pool and bar,What a treat to have a pool that my kids loved with a rooftop bar for mom. We were here a week and reservations were needed on the weekend to ensure social distancing but midweek we could go anytime. Brendan was great and made sure we had everything we needed!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A+++++,We stayed here for a week and the front desk staff took care of us very well. Our guy Brendan upstairs treated us like absolute gold on a daily basis. He was awesome and we couldn't be happier. Thanks again to Brendan and the Warwick!!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice Visit,"We enjoyed our stay at the Warwick in Denver.  It was very convenient to everything downtown.  Bridget Kasilo, at the front desk, was very kind and helpful.  We enjoyed the coffee station downstairs (free fresh coffee each morning) as well.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,much needed getaway,"spent a few nights in Denver and the Warwick was the perfect location. the restaurant, Gattara, was great, although we only had drinks. Brendan was our server and he made our experience memorable. would definitely come back to both the hotel and the restaurant!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Brendan+Brett (Gattara Restaurant),I wanted to take a minute and mention what phenomenal service we received on multiple days from both Brendan and Brett. They had great energy and passion for hospitality. The food was fantastic but it was the service that shined. The two of them went above and beyond and we can’t wait to return to say hi! Keep up the great work fellas! Thanks again! ,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Dirty, Terrible Service, Overpriced.","Reserved a suite and paid for a pre-paid rate that included early check-in and late check-out. Called at noon to get a 1:30 check-in instead of 3pm normal check-in time. They said they would call when it was ready but they didn't seem to think they could get me in early. I said that was unacceptable as I paid for early check-in. They never called. I arrived at hotel 45 minutes AFTER normal check-in time and room was still not ready. They said they had to go clean it and asked me to wait in the lobby. I had a small dog and 4 bags, no one offered assistance. They never came to tell me the room was ready, I had to go ask someone else.  Then I got to the room and it was very dirty still. In the days of Covid-19, this is unacceptable. I paid for a suite and expected it to be clean at…",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great service,"Stayed here last week and I was so happy, sorta. We had to change rooms twice, so to a few problems. But the staff was great. They were happy to move us, to make sure we were happy. I do have to say, the food at Gattara was PHENOMENAL! It was so good we ate there 3 times in 2 days. And the service? Forget about it. I’m a chef and my partner is a server, some of the best service I’ve ever had. Brendan & Brett were so friendly. They made recommendations for us. They chatted with us and really felt like friends. Planning a trip back and will def stop by for a meal.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Awful hotel service,"I'm writing while I'm currently supposed to be sleeping.  Tummy thermometer says 60°, but the room is nowhere close to that,  it's more like 80°.upon arrival we get room 500 which is the premier king suite, first thing you see in the bathroom is the toilet paper roll hang of the wall, as if it was pulled out.  I go to the receptionist so they know, the woman says that they'll fix it,  never got fixed!We ask about the pool, it's closed due to covid-19.We go to dinner and come back. The air in the room makes a loud noise. I go take a shower and there is no bathrobe or slippers as promised and a tiny container of soap for three people. I call the reception and robert gives us soap, 2 bathrobes and slippers,  changes us to room 401 and says that the resort fee covers the pool, gym, wifi and the cheap coffee.  Well... if I can't use the pool or gym because of covid-19 that means you still charge the resort fee for cheap coffee and wifi, gtf out of here.The whole room was covered in moths. We had to get them out and there were still some left. We'll see what service I get when I check out.  Thank God I is only one night.  I'm writing this at 5:15 a.m.First 2 picks are a hair dried to the ceilingThird pic of where the toilet paper is supposed to beFourth Pic is the bathroom light.  How is the hole so big compared to the light. What makes a hotel luxury,  high class,  or top notch are the finishing touches, the small details.  Here they fail at that.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Weekend Vacation,Honestly the best hotel experience I’ve ever had and I travel for work. The front desk staff Megan and Hanica went above and beyond and Brett and Andrew were the best room service staff I’ve ever had.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"I’m warning you, don’t book.","Upon arrival we had to circle the building twice, to find out we had to pay to park. While getting my family out of the car people were yelling, mind you it’s 1 am. After we check in and get in our room it has moths, stains on the carpet, and the room is smothering hot. We find out there’s no microwave so I can’t warm up my sons food. We get into bed hoping it will cool off. Which it doesn’t. We had a reservation for 2 nights but we will not be staying here another night. NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A LUXURY HOTEL. Very disappointed and a huge waste of money. False advertisement. Not to mention how run down the hotel looks on the outside and inside, compared to how it is advertised.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Disappointing and Dirty,"The Warwick Denver left a lot to be desired. I’ll start with the room: we had a simple room with a balcony. It was just for a night so would be fine. Upon arrival, the balcony had trash and cigarette ash everywhere..to a point we didn’t walk outside. Ironically on the table sits a sign “No smoking...$1,000 fine.” Clearly the housekeeping staff did not clean. That became even more apparent in the bathroom. The shower had a film of residue, even worse 2 minutes into showering you’ll be standing in a foot of water. With COVID-19 concerns, the room was clearly unclean and unsafe. After departure, the hotel charged another $40 of mini bar items, though we didn’t use the mini-bar. Did the staff not check after the previous guest...or are they hurting for money so much they will try to find a way to make a little extra? THEN they charged an additional $20 for fees that were NEVER communicated upon booking to include amenities that were unsafe to use due to COVID-19. When I called the hotel to ask about the charges, the first guy I talked to didn’t have any idea how to help. The second women was rude and abrasive, clearly does not have experience in guest service. She was condensing and accusatory when I told her we didn’t use any mini bar items. Overall, this hotel was untrustworthy, unsanitary and unprofessional. I do not recommend it at all.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A Great Refuge in a Difficult Time,Our water heater went out at home (for more than a week).  Time for a shower. We checked into the Warwick and splurged on the Presidential Suite which was very niecel priced.  Room service was our only choice and it was terrific.  Service staff could not have been more efficent and pleasant.We may consider this again as staycation.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,empathic & helpful during Coronavirus,"FIRST POST on TripAdvisor Because Warwick Denver is sooooo amazing. We came to visit our grandson during the Coronavirus and end up staying for 25 days .. The Staff is beyond wonderful, they have made a scary time easier .. The rooms are clean and nice and service is amazing!!! Everyone is so welcoming.. I am so happy that we found Warwick Denver for our stay .. I highly highly recommend this hotel .. the room service is excellent, the food is excellent.. Thank You",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,dining yesterday,Brandan was amazing as we dined in the new dining area. Hetook care of all of our needs. The food was extremely good and theservice was fast. I would highly recomend staying at this hotel and trying the dining area and bar,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Quiet clean hotel,"I love the staff here.  Very friendly, always accomodating and really make you feel at home.  Brendon in particular was very helpful.  I will continue to keep coming back.  Added bonus the restaurant has great food!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"impeccable service, friendly staff, great room!","I would like to thank Brandon at the front desk for his polite and attentive service. As well as Ezra, Brendan, Brett, Andru and Jonas for their great service and laughs at the bar. The heated rooftop pool was a huge bonus at night. The next time I am in Denver, I will be staying here again. Excellent hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not impressed,Staying for 3 nights and I would have much preferred the Embassy. The location is decent but the bathroom caulk has mold everywhere. Single small tub/shower combo in the king suite with no stopper for a bath for my younger kids however the tub barely drains anyway which is another issue. When we checked in a light fixture had broken and was on the floor but they did replace it the next day. The fire sprinklers are all missing the covers. The closet door doesn’t close correctly and the light is on a motion sensor so it lights up any time we are walking around the room and stays on for awhile. The one day we should have had room service the housekeeper didn’t speak English so asking them to give us a few minutes the reply we kept getting was “no service” so we just gave up and got…,2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not worth the money,"This is an ok hotel,  but for the price it isn’t worth it.  The air conditioning didn’t work properly-  they only refreshed us 2 towels each day with 4 people in the suite room.  People were fairly friendly,  but didn’t really seem to care about any requests.  It was a big room but very small bathroom.  ",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,THE BEST DAMN HOTEL,"I have stayed here 3 times in the last year and I can't wait to come back! The entire staff is so wonderful, but namely Isabelle at the desk and Anna S. in the events coordination dept are truly the reasons I will continue to do business here.  The renovations look beautiful, and I am glad you moved the business center to a more workable location.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Nice rooms, Cold welcome","I had a brief overnight stay here this week.  I chose the Warwick because it was near meetings I had.  The rooms are terrific.  Very large, nicely decorated (I kind of felt like I was in an updated version of MadMen) and very comfortably furnished.  Great desk chair and comfy reading chair and bed as well.  Bathrooms are clean and large with separate tub and stall shower.  It's the experience getting to the room that made me mark this down.  Check-in was the slowest I have experienced at a hotel in a long time.  I'm a member of Warwick's rewards program so they should have had all my details on file but they didn't. I also couldn't get to my room at 6 p.m. for a quick break  to drop things off and change/freshen up for dinner as only 1 of 3 elevators was working.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Bar,Best bar I have ever been to just because brendan and Brett are the best bartenders I have ever dealt with. Their both really funny and made sure my drinks were always filled! Great guys and will be visiting again because of them!!! I never left a review but I felt I needed to because the service was so greAt!!!!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Bartender review,I am staying at your hotel and I came across your bar area with my boyfriend. We came to have a few drinks and had the best time thanks to Brenden and Brett. They were very accommodating and amusing. The best bartenders I’ve had in Denver!!!!! We will be sure to come again!!!!! They made our night!!!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good hotel amazing bar/restaurant,Hotel is good! But the bar/restaurant is amazing especially because Brendan and Mica the bartenders . Amazing service! They were super personal and the food was also amazing! Great overall experience!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Run-down rooms and poor service,"Just checked in, found top sheet dirty, holes in the restroom, mold, dirty floor and broken floor boards. Called for toothpaste and I had to run down and get it! Look I get it, hospitality industry is tough, and I can see why airbnbs thrive more. Wouldn’t book this hotel again.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Hospitality at its finest,While the hotel is great in itself. The hospitality and at ease feeling I received when I sat down at the hotel bar was amazing. I stayed for a better part of this week and hit happy hour a couple of different times and was very well taken care of by Brendan & Mica. They were a terrific team and made everyone who sat down feel welcome like they were at their hometown hangout. I highly recommend paying them a visit if you get the chance. Cheer!!! Matt,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"""Urban Retreat Fee""  JOKE","I had a five-day stay.  Booked a 5 day stay with apparently a teaser rate and then for each additional day I was extended the ""Best Available Rate"".  The bill revealed a steep progression day 1 $89, 2 $115, 3 $143.... don't recall the booking site including the new latest way to add $90.00 with the ""Urban Retreat Fee""  JOKE.  What is that the fee to retreat from the homeless in the downtown streets?  The  Internet did not connect. The place is good for ""No"".  Do you have aspirin?  Can I get a late checkout? 10:05 pm is the kitchen open? No, No, No  Thanks Liz",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Definitely recommend!,I stayed at the Warwick Denver for two nights and it was beautiful! Very well kept grounds and the room was very clean! By far the best part of the stay was the AWESOME bartender called Brendan. He was always very attentive and had some great suggestions on both drinks and food items! Would would back for another stay with family and friends!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Historic Vibe from the 60s,"Historic hotel nicely redecorated. It was originally the site of the first Playboy Club in Denver, and the decor has a unique vibe with halls decorated with Playboy magazine covers from the 60s. We had a junior suite which was spacious, with living room, separate bedroom and bath, balcony, and a small fridge. No microwave. Staff was friendly, but although we requested a change of linens daily, it never happened during the 3 nights we were there. ",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Beautiful hotel and lovely staff!,"Gorgeous hotel setting with an inviting lobby setting, fireplace and all. After hours of driving, we walked up to the front desk of the Warwick and were greeted by Alejandro, who welcomed us nicely and ensured we knew where to spend our 1st evening in Denver. Throughout our stay, Alejandro and Bridget from the front desk helped us ensure we had the best trip possible. This girl from Kansas felt right at home and even celebrated her Chiefs win with the hotel staff. Best hotel experience EVER!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Customer Service and overall experience,"My girlfriend and I were very impressed with the service that we received during our stay at The Warwick Denver. We made some slight adjustments to our stay and Brandon, the gentleman working the front desk, was more than happy to help us and make sure we were taken care of. The restaurant is also an amazing/convenient perk. Brendan Price, our nightly bartender, was always in a great mood, laughing, and just fun to be around and converse with. He, along with Cam, gave us great tips and ideas of what to do during our time in Colorado and were more than willing to go the extra mile. All in all, I would highly recommend staying at The Warwick Denver. It was affordable, conveniently located, and a great atmosphere to be in. ",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wonderful stay in Denver,"Decided to stay at the Warwick  because the room rate was a lot less than at the hotel where the conference I attended was being held.  Glad I did.  In addition to saving money, the Warwick was a great experience. The hotel room was one of the most comfortable and luxurious I've ever had, and the staff was super friendly and helpful.  Although it was several blocks away to the conference hotel, the Warwick is well located, and I had a wonderful stay. I'd love to return for a vacation trip sometime.  Recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Anniversary Trip,"Hritika T. was amazing! I arrived early and she was busy with multiple calls and holding down the front desk solo. Even though it was briefly chaotic, she greeted me with a smile! She made the trip extra special for my bf and I and is the epitome of what great customer service looks like.   Thanks Hritika!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Andrew is the best!,"I recently stayed at the Warwick and enjoyed every aspect of this hotel. The rooms are clean, spacious and well decorated.  The restaurant and bar was wonderful.  But, what made my stay the most fantastic was being greeted and helped by Andrew.  He was so personable and assisted me in finding parking spaces and he went above and beyond the call of duty. When the first person you meet is Andrew, there is no way you can't have anything but a wonderful experience staying here.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice place overall but smells like weed in places,"Nice rooms..had long bed..spacious but could use a chair to sit on beside the office chair on wheels. Breakfast buffet is ample but expensive if not included in room rate..dont like the suggested tipping that starts at 18% and goes to 22%.   Often smelled weed on lobby, elevator area. Not happy about that, I dont care that is legal here.  Good service by employees",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Home away from home,"Warwick Hotel, I am dubbing the Warwick Hotel my new home away from home. What a delight to be met by Andru the valet, making sure that we had all our items out of the car. Always being sure to ask when we may need the car next. A gentleman well-schooled in the pleasantries. Alejandro’s welcome from the front desk completely relaxed me. He was calm and able to explain the details of the Warwick and the surrounding area to two weary travelers. Thank you, friend. Bridget made coming to the desk a delight. For someone who’s only been there a couple of months, I must say she knows her stuff. Overall, I must say that it is a joy to visit a premier property where old school meets new.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great staff but that's all,"The room was old and uncomfortable. The sheets were cheap, scratchy and reeked of bleach. It was impossible to sleep the first night. I asked for hypoallergenic or sensitive skin sheets but they did not offer either. I had to Febreze the whole bed several times a day and cover the pillowcase with my Tshirt to get any sleep. Also the heat system made a LOUD noise every 10 minutes or so, the neighbors' shower was so loud it would wake us up, and when looking for a ring I dropped I found an old toenail on the floor. Gross.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Terrible customer service. Disappointing management.,"They try to sell the hotel saying it is an ""upscale luxury hotel"" after staying here twice there is nothing upscale nor luxurious about this hotel. When you walk in the hotel the lobby gives the impression that it is upscale but if you look closely you will find the dirty dingy couches and sad restaurant and fitness center. But what was most disappointing is the way the front desk staff treats you. Don't expect to be greeted with a smile-- they make you think you are doing them a favor and it is almost an imposition to ask the to tell you about basic amenities about the hotel. The front desk staff, in particular, extremely rude and incompetent. When asked for basic information of where to eat what to see they told me that they dont know. Not I dont know but let me try to find…",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Jonas the best concierge I have come across,"Jonas, a concierge at the Warwick, went Way out of his way to help us with a dilemma Incredibly knowledgeably and connected.  I will return the the Warwick.  Lovely hotel in downtown Denver.  Centrally located in the interesting Denver downtown.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Super awesome hotel ,"The building of the hotel feels cosy. The room I was in  is big and clean, and  the staff at the hotel are helpful and friendly. I slept very well each night. Highly recommended for people who is seeking for comfort. ",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Thanks,My name is Nyesha Wilson and I would like to give thanks to Megan and Brandon at the Warwick Hotel in Denver Colorado for all that you guys had done for my son David. I really do appreciate you both. May God pour out many blessings upon your lives. Thanks again.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great looking hotel, great location, terrible beds","The hotel is nice, in great shape and seems very nice. The biggest problem we and a friend who went with us agreed, was the beds. Holy moly! I've NEVER had such uncomfortable beds and I've stayed in some cheapo hotels before. They crinkle, why does a bed crinkle?? If I had been there any longer than the 4 nights we had booked I would have had to switch hotels. We were absolutely sleep deprived because of the bouncy crinkly mattresses they've chosen. The mattresses have to be THE cheapest mattresses they could find.  But enough about the mattresses, lets talk about the $75 per night additional charged to your account for the snacks they leave in your room. We're not snacking people, neither of us eat candy or drink soda, so what was in the room when we arrived was what was there…",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Conveniently Located on the Edge of Downtown Denver,"We choose this hotel because it was close to our meeting at 1700 Lincoln and nearby restaurants. Our room overlooking downtown was clean but dated. We enjoyed our own happy hour on the balcony at sunset. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We did not need the valet parking as we were able to find an overnight parking place on the street in front of the hotel. There is a nice, heated pool on the roof which we would have used if we had more time. We would stay at this hotel again.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very happy ,Oh my goodness!! This place is amazing And our desk clerk was AMAZING !!!! Her name was MEAGAN M. And she was absolutely adorable and so very helpful cannot day enough We are from Vermont and we’re very very happy,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Over the top service,I was visiting a friend after his deployment and we were at the pool. Mica was our server and we were completely overwhelmed by her professionalism and energy to not only us but everyone around us. She is amazing.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent as always,I always come to this property when in town for business! Room is always clean magnificent roof top. I've had the pleasure to have Megan help me  several times and always makes my stay that much more enjoyable.Thanks Thanks again Megan!!!!!!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Awesome visit,"Very convenient lovely staff sweet home base. We had a fabulous balcony view. My phone accidentally fell off the balcony and staff was super efficient to rescue. Restaurant has superb staff named Brett and Mica. Doormen are considerate and kind, providing us with umbrella coverage from rain as we boarded our Lyft ride to the Rockies baseball game!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,No Room Available and Still Have Not Received Refund,"I reserved a King Suite at this hotel for Fourth of July weekend. Upon my arrival (after waiting in a long line nearly out the door to check-in), the hotel did not have a suite available because they overbooked the property for the weekend. Hours later, we were finally able to get into a regular room and were promised that our daily rate would be adjusted downwards to account for the fact that we did not receive the type of room we paid for. At check out, we were told that the right person was not there to make the adjustment and we were assured that it would be handled. I have called the hotel countless times since July and each time I have been told that they need to call me back/will get back to me. I have still not received the proper refund and am out a significant amount of money.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Nice Mid-Century Hotel, in an up-and-coming part of Denver","Selected the Warwick using TA and found the descriptions to be fair and accurate. Ask for a room facing Grant Street, and if you are lucky you'll get a nice sunset at the end of the day. Found the dining options were limited, as they were in the process of relocating their main dining space. A nice tip from the front desk saved me parking fees! On the weekend the parking is free, safe and very easy to find a spot.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Seeing phish at Dicks sporting good Park,"Great hotel.  Super clean rooms, spacious, soft sheets, good water pressure, nice TV, mini fridge.  Great location next to Be On Keys Psychedelic ripple which is the best bar in Denver if you're a hippie.  Nice restaurant in the bottom of hotel with excellent breakfast.  Acceptable rooftop pool.  Elevators are a bit slow.  Parking is way too expensive.  They were changing the carpet out in the lobby at 2am on Saturday morning on a holiday weekend.  Seemed an odd time to try and get this done.  I will stay at this hotel again when I see phish on labor day weekend.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Mad Modern Warwick Denver,"Elegant hotel we will gladly return to in uptown Denver within easy walking distance of the Capital, restaurants, and sights. Our king room (not a suite, booked on Orbitz) was the size of my son's apartment nearby. Loved the mid-century modern decor - presumably a nod to the hotel's Playboy Club past. Very classy with lots of nice amenities including a spacious balcony. Nice restaurant and bar on ground floor. Rooftop pool we did not use.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing staff!,"We arrived on Friday to spend the long weekend with family. The accommodations were alright. Fairly clean, comfortable beds. The following day I was expecting a delivery of medical supplies, which is always a hassle when traveling. Hotel employees Brandon, Liz, and Jonas spent the better part of the day hunting down this package for me. They found it, made sure it was refrigerated, and had it ready for me to pick up at the front desk! This weekend would not have been nearly as enjoyable without their help. The recent renovations look awesome and it has been a lovely stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"$1,000 dollar fine","It was snowing really bad outside and we wanted to check in early (which we requested) but were denied and left in the cold. We were in town for a Broncos game and were forced to get dressed in the lobby restroom at 1:30 pm. When we finally got in the room there was a $1000 fine for smoking on the balcony, the place is a joke. Pretends to be a quality hotel, it's not, stay somewhere else.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,CEO,"Cameron , was awesome, he made my stay so much nicer , he went out of his way to get to know me n let me know everything hotel had to offer n surrounding areas, I actually tried hotel bar/new restaurant ( which was terrific) couple places close I could walk to , places to go see n since I haven’t been to Denver in a few years it really help pass my off time. I will definitely stay here every time I come to town.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing for multiple reasons,Hospitality is #1. Liz at the front desk did an amazing job of going above and beyond. The rooftop pool is really awesome. Our bartenders Ezra and Mica were incredible. Made for a really fun couple of days. Easy walk to 16th street. I would highly recommend this hotel when visiting Denver. They put their guests first. We'll be back.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick,"We stayed at their grand opening of their restaurant. Brenden the bartender was super friendly and very informative on sights and surrounding events and things to do locally! Being from a resort town we truly appreciated his hospitality and accommodations, he made us feel right at home! Highly recommend the food and general vibe! We will absolutely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Awesome staff and good restaurant food,Talked with Joe at the front desk and he was super helpful answering a few questions. Checked into the room which was perfect (having a balcony was great) Had dinner at the small restaurant and food was great. Overall just an excellent hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Sr bartender,"Mica was the absolute best. She was so accommodating and attentive to us and all guests. I will always come back to this bar just to have service from her. Also, go see Ezra at the pool, he's awesome!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Good Value, residential neighborhood close to downtown",We were in ton for a volleyball tournament and stayed at the Warwick.  It's a clean hotel with spacious rooms and good service.  There are a few restaurants within a couple blocks and we would stay there again.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Disappointing because of General Managers and head of hotel!,"I have given it a 3 rating because even though I would recommend this hotel to anyone as the rooms are lovely, clean and spacious with everything you need, the pool is incredible and the staff are beyond helpful BUT we had a very manic start to our stay! ENORMOUS shout out to these staff members... Jackson, Joe, Sam, Matt, Jonas, Ezra, Rhitika and Nicole- I cannot thank them enough for all their help during our stay!! No credit to general managers or the head of the hotel at all.We arrived at check in time at 3pm and the systems had been down since 6am. We could be checked in through paper copies but we had to be escorted to our room as the machine to activate your key card was down. The names mentioned at the top were none stop running around taking guests up to their rooms or the pool, making sure customers were happy, taking verbal abuse off angry guests on the chin and carried on with a smile and through all this NOT ONE general manager or the head of the hotel could be found- they stayed out of sight because they didn’t want to deal with the pressure of angry guests. In this situation, especially when some of the receptionists hadn’t been working in hotels very long, the general managers and the head of the hotel should be the face to help out but they were no where to be found!! We got assigned to 4 different rooms in the space of 3 hours because each time we got to our room, there was someone already in it! Through this mayhem- no manager came to sort this situation out. We had a concert to get to at 7pm and because we didn’t get to our room until 6pm we were an hour and a half late and missed the start. Once again the names above were incredible but still no manager could be seen or came to apologise. The next day I requested to see a general manager but once again it was us that was trying to find them- it’s their job to ensure the happiness of their customers but no effort from them at all, the only people making effort to help was the names at the top.  The trip though wasn’t ruined completely but that is solely down to the lovely staff- they couldn’t do enough- they gave us complimentary drinks during our wait for our room, a free breakfast and a late check out for all the inconvenience. After 2 days staying in the hotel at the price they charge and all that stress- not once did I see or speak to a general manager!!! They should feel extremely ashamed of their poor working etiquette.Ezra is the friendliest bar tender I have ever met- none stop laughs. The staff are a credit to that hotel!I do hope you stay here because it’s 100% worth it- I just hope the staff higher up are more efficient.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice Modern Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here during our trip to Denver. It is a convenient location and many attractions in the city are within walkable distance to the hotel.  The room was very neat and clean. Beds were comfortable.  The restaurant in the hotel offers extremely good food, and we ate there quite a lot. I would stay again on another trip to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Stayed here for a high school reunion,I love this hotel! We received a group rate because we attended a high school reunion last week. The rooms are huge and well decorated. The bathroom is very nice and there is a walk in closet. There is a large terrace outside with a nice view of Denver. The staff are pleasant and I like this smaller hotel much better than the big hotels.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Denver visit,"We came to Denver for a school reunion.  The hotel was pricey, especially when you have to pay for parking beyond the hotel stay.  However, the services were exceptional. The front desk personnel, Matt and Jackson went beyond expectations in assuring a quality stay in Denver!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,So disappointing!,"The hotel was nice, except for the fact that the AC was broken! Complained as soon as I got into my room - was given a fan or an option to move rooms. Which didn’t make much sense to me considering the entire hotel AC wasn’t working. It was not the staffs fault, but you could tell that they had to play it off like nothing was wrong. Completely unacceptable as a business, truly have no idea how they can remain open. I read reviews before I booked and I sure wish I would have listened, those same AC issues you’ve seen from weeks back reviews, are still there! They are making no effort at all to fix anything until their renovations are done, that is clear! Ruined my entire vacation. I was so excited to stay at this hotel, and was so so so incredibly disappointed. Please if you are thinking of staying here, don’t! I won’t make the same mistake again.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,UGH WHAT A LET DOWN!,"We booked to stay at this “4 star” hotel from the 16th to the 19th in July 2019. We got there the 16th, first approach was nice until we reached the front desk, we were greeted by a lady who obviously hated her job. She was rude a short but no big deal. We didn’t care and moved on. We get to our room and it’s not bad. Obviously old but they did there best to remodel. Was nice enough to stay in. EXCEPT!!!!! THE A/C DID NOT WORK! Our room was a sad attempt at “cool”. They had the A/C set to 65 but it was far from it. It felt like “a room full of thick humidity and shame.” On top of that the entire room is decorated in PlayBoy art! Like WTF!?We decided to at least give it a night since when we called to complain and the front desk said “turn it down more” 🙄 We tried to eat dinner in the lobby the first night but there was no host and the only person working was the poor girl in the tiny bar room by herself. WHICH MIND YOU THE A/C WAS NOT ON IN THE LOBBY!! Doors wide open hoping for the best!!! Which is no big deal, had they admitted to it!! My wife and I decided to check out the next day at 10am! So we only stayed one night and just wanted to leave instead of staying 4 nights. So what does the Warwick do? Charged us TWO OF the most expensive nights on the reservation and told us sorry and have a good day?? WE ONLY STAYED ONE MISERABLE NIGHT! The guy at the desk in a full suit (we felt so bad for your employees) had tell us “sorry the air works better in colder months” That poor guy, he knew the air was broke but was not aloud to say it. Shame on the Warwick. If something breaks I understand it happens. Unfortunately they wouldn’t admit it and wanted my pregnant wife to stay in our 80 degree room that felt like a sauna for 4 nights. Customer service was a let down Room was a gross jokeElevators smelt like a locker room AND I had to pay for a night we didn’t even stay-in. EVEN THOUGH WE LEFT AT 10am. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE. TRUST ME.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Comfortable, super quiet and excellent staff","Just spent 2 weekend nights (Friday and Saturday) at this gem of a hotel and I was totally blown away by the experience. My first trip to Denver (to visit my son and his wife who have just moved to Denver from NYC) was made perfect by how quiet and comfortable this hotel is. Staff went out of their way to make sure all my questions were answered and needs met. Located in easy access to downtown and environs, this is THE place to stay in Denver. Rates are also very reasonable.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Loved Our Stay!,"My husband and I had never been to Denver and came to town in July for the Mecum Car Auction and some well needed R&R.  We stayed at the Warwick for five wonderful nights and loved our king premier suite on the 12th floor.  I had called ahead and spoke with Sophie to ask for an upper floor quite room facing the city.  We got just that! (Thank you Sophie).  Our room was beautiful with plenty of room to spread out and was very quiet.  Added perk was the nice large balcony that we enjoyed coffee in the morning and wine in the evening… lovely.  We also enjoyed chilling at the outdoor rooftop pool and bar, very nice. Thanks also to Megan at the front desk who was very helpful and to Jonas who told us about a wonderful day trip we took to Old Town Arvada!  If you go to Old Town Arvada we recommend lunch at the School House… very unique and the food was delicious, oh and don’t forget to check out the walls in the men’s and women’s restrooms.Back in the city don’t miss Larimer Street at night, it is one of the stops on the 16th Street Mall free shuttle.  Go to the Green Russell for an excellent handcrafted cocktail in a Prohibition-era speakeasy setting.  Look for it at 1422 Larimer Street downstairs.Be sure and read up on the history of this Warwick’s building so you will understand why all the ‘Bunnies” are on the walls… my husband found it very interesting!  We would highly recommend the Warwick Denver and will stay here again next time we visit the Mile High City!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,July trip,"I was disappointed that the restaurant was closed, they had a makeshift in the lobby.We asked for a room with two doubles got a room with one double, although they did make it right, its just that you are tired and don't feel like having to fight with the front desk about what room you should get.Valet parking $38.00 per night and they park your car outside in the back parking lot, there used to be an underground garage.  A big hailstorm was coming fortunatly it missed us.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice stay,"Once again a nice stay. Especially the barkeeper Christina convinced every evening with her warmth, friendliness and patience .Even when the bar was crowded, she cares for a relaxing atmosphere.The rooms are spacious with balconys where you can enjoy your coffee or read a book outside. The pool area on top of the hotel is fittes with cushy chairs.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,That Hotel is extraordinary because of the following people:,"The valet, check in and restaurant are exquisite due to the exemplary service provided by: Jonas, Sam, Hritika, Matthew, Jackson, Cameron, Luke, Megan and Stefanija.Housekeeping is equally of superior quality as represented by Marcey.I have stayed at the Denver Warwick several times and am well aquatinted with all of the people I mentioned above.  These folks all should be rewarded with a raise.  It would be valuable for corporate to consult with each person mentioned for their ideas for improvement as they are on the front lines.  I see no room for improvement; I'm merely a guest...",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,False Advertising,"This hotel markets itself as hip and fresh and it is not even close. It is tired and worn out. The website shows photo after photo of a restaurant and bar that is not open to the public. Its remodel is not done. The existing bar is the size of a closet and the restaurant is dark and musty. The neighborhood is treelined but also has many homeless people in the evenings, making it feel unsafe. The staff seemed tired and uninterested.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Seemed like a great hotel to book,"Warwick is in a great location geographically and rooms have very nice balcony. The room was nice and neat. The cleaning service does not follow “privacy” door hanger. There were a few things that were advertised that either didn’t exist or were services included in daily resort fee that we didn’t have access to. If you search the hotel on google it says there’s a shuttle - there isn’t one. Moreover, there were suppose to bikes that were complementary to the stay however we couldn’t acquire them . One person told us he couldn't give them out , the other told us they didn’t have any... 20 minutes later there was another couple that were able to get bikes. Rooftop and pool is quaint , check in is at 3 but our “special” room wasn’t ready until an hour after we arrived.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great stay - great service - great hotel - great room service - great times!,"We had an excellent stay at the Warwick Hotel.   The service was exceptional.   Matt, Jackson and Ezra were very helpful at reception and the pool top bar.   The location is great.  We got the King Premier Suite.  Great value for the price.  Good times!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not customer-centered...,"This hotel wants to look and feel top-notch when you check in: the reality is different...What I had at the restaurant was excellent but the waitress kept interrupting our conversation to ask how we liked it... a little more discretion would have been appreciated...Service at the bar was worse, the staff talked to me, after it took 10 minutes for them to see me AT the bar, as if I knew absolutely nothing about wine... the second time, I left as I didn’t attract the attention of the bartender who was busy entertaining loud customers . I would appreciate it if this establishment treated all customers the same way, and not judge them by their appearance, my fellow travelers were a diverse group of foreigners.L’assyriologie but not least, the carpeting in my room had quite a few stains...",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice decent hotel but would not be a future pick,"They were quite busy when we arrived but they managed the check in process very nicely. Hotel is in a good location to restaurants and Coors field---you can walk to all of them.The place is, however, worn and dated---carpet has wrinkles and lifting--needs to be stretched, and room AC needs an upgrade, it was not up to par on the hottest day of the year in Denver--95. But, I'm from Oklahoma and we see hotter and more humid days and ACs can get it cool enough in room on a 95 degree day. We made a request for it to be looked at and they responded quickly and said we were not the only ones complaining. So, if you're looking for a nice cold room---not the place. The evenings got cool enough to help the AC--but we had it on 72 and it never made it beyond that in the evening. It ran alllllllll night and allllll day and could never get below 72. Im guessing it got down to about 74-75 in room. The air of AC was blowing directly on bed so that helped to make it manageable. They were 100% booked so there were no options for us to move to another room. It was nice to sit on balcony in the mornings to have coffee. Shower has great water pressure. Bed was comfortable.The bar area and dinning is small and not bad. We had wine and cheesecake in the evening and it was good. Service and staff were friendly.Pool is cool, but small and was quite busy so never got to use it.Don't use valet---$37 a night to park, use the garage next door--$20 a day.Overall, just average.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Dissapointing...,"Apparently, we have been very spoiled by the excellent service and atmosphere at the Warwick-Melrose in Dallas, TX where we often stay...  The Warwick Denver does not compare.  During peak arrival time on a busy friday afternoon, there was only 1 valet person available (this was true the entire weekend).  We had to leave our vehicle parked haphazardly partially in the street (due to the backed-up vehicles waiting for valet service) and carry our baggage in.  ""Mandadtory"" valet (ourdoor/uncovered) parking is $37 per night.  You have to go down to the outside valet stand to request your vehicle each time, (can not call from room in advance) which means you have to get ready to leave, go down request your car then wait (and wait) for it to be brought around.  They have only a small ""bar area"" in the lobby with no wait staff. They have no ice in the bar, when you order a drink the bartender has to go to some other area of the hotel to get ice (each time) for your drink.  A ""well"" scotch & ginger ale was $16.  That's a pretty hefty price for a self-serve bar with no music or entertainment...  We stayed in one of their ""newly renovated"" king suites.  It was a nicely decorated suite - but layed-out very strangely.  The bathroom was not connected to the bedroom, the closet was far from the bedroom (off the living area), the coffee bar area was also off the living area, far from the only source of water (in the bathroom).  Very awkward room!  We were there 2 nights, very dissapointed!",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wannabe High-End ,"We booked our single night's stay to the Governor's Suite, owing mostly to a good deal and the promise of a view (which was weak, at best.) The suite was enormous, but oddly appointed with cheap-looking furniture thst was clearly meant to convey luxury, but I don't recall ever needing a china cabinet with tarnished silver tea service, even at my swankiest business functions. The space would have been better served with a more functional kitchen area (which was mostly just a tight space with a huge counter, bar sink, and mini fridge.) More useless furniture in the bedroom, which was so cavernous that it made the large TV hard to hear, in part because it was set not to go above a fairly low volume, making it difficult to hear across the huge bedroom. Meanwhile, one side of the bed had no nightstand or place to plug in a phone charger. There was no self-parking, only valet, yet our vehicle was simply driven around the back of the hotel to an open-air lot. When we were ready to check out, we waited ages in line while multiple front-end staff seemed to be milling about aimlessly, and then waited another 20 minutes for someone to locate a valet. When he finally arrived, he took another 10 minutes or so to locate our keys and go around to the lot around the corner to get our vehicle. As a result, we were 15 minutes late returning our rental vehicle. I recommend leaving yourself a solid 45 minutes to check out, especially if you have a vehicle that needs retrieving. Staff were friendly and the verandahs on the rooms were large and nice-to-have (though without much in the way of appointments to make them usable), but other than that, there was not muxh to recommend this hotel versus one of many other good options. If you stay, don't miss Steuben's around the corner, which was fabulous.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A great place for Urban visit,This hotel has a very welcoming feel upon arrival. Courteous front desk staff. Our room was well-appointed and had a west-facing balcony. View is not especially exciting but still nice enough to enjoy the later afternoon sun. Hotel also has two bicycles available for guests to use which is highly recommended as there are so many bike trails in Denver (Cherry Creek is recommended). Also nearby (walkable) to several reasonable to very good restaurants and upscale local grocery. State Capitol also about 10 minutes walk from the property. Checkout went fast as well,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Poor customer service,"Very overpriced for the quality, especially the service from the front desk. If you deal with anyone at this hotel, make sure you document exactly what they tell you. I had a billing question at check in and was told the manager was currently unavailable but it would be taken care of and the manager would contact me ASAP to confirm. When that didn't happen, I made the same inquiry then next morning and receive the same response. After no communication, I asked a third time and the same exact person that I spoke with twice told me that she had no idea what I was talking about and that she had no memory of either of our conversations. She did take my information and assured me that as soon as the manager was available she would call me to resolve the issue. Never received a call and was told on checkout that there was nothing they could do about the billing issue as I should have addressed it before checkout. My first and last stay with Warwick hotels.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not what I expected!,"For the price you would think it should be really nice. We found the opposite. Hotel has been under some renovations but  some things aren't excusable. MiniBar in room completely empty every day, no waters in room, glasses in room with nothing to put in them. Carpet needs cleaning badly. Staff was always too busy to answer phone at desk or room service. Now the worst thing was the door lock. When inqiuring about the lack of fuctioning door lock, I was told to use the slide lock. See picture to see what I mean. So it's easy to say I would not recommend this Hotel. The Doorman Jonas was really awesome and helpful.The Heating and Air Conditioning smells like old radiators.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Pride weekend,"My partner and I stayed at the Warwick during 2019 Denver Pride fest and thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The distance to Pride events, plus other area of interest, was perfect - super walkable. The room was clean and welcoming - awesomely comfortable bed. The hotel was quiet and the service was amazing. One of the lobby managers, Sophie, worked our entire stay and was incredibly kind and thoughtful - she helped us with check in, check out, valet, bag check...true Jill of all trades! Would recommend the stay!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Pleasant Stay,"Large rooms, large walk in closet, good water pressure in bathroom. Great roof top pool, but get there early for a chair. A/C was fine but we could tell it wasn’t working 100%. Decent resultant in the hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,No air conditioning for entire stay,"Neat hotel. Good service. Spacious rooms. Unfortunately terrible ac system. For the past few days the Meeting rooms were around 80 degrees. And most of the guest rooms ac were not working.  I would hesitate to stay here during summer or spring. Management seems not to be too concerned about the issue. Offered fans but the traffic noise, sirens and out door noise is going to keep you awake regardless. I would avoid it unless they can solve it. Plenty of other options with working air conditioning.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice visit,Unfortunately the restaurant was being renovated but the hotel was still very nice. The room was very large with a very modern decor. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Diffently would return.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,An enjoyable weekend discovering Denver!,"The Warwick is a clean and polished hotel. Granted some construction was going on in their dining room, but the lobby was nicely converted to a temp. restaurant.Solid breakfast, and we started all three days with Angie in the morning. We enjoyed some complimentary wine thanks to Hritika at the Front desk who checked us in. Matt was very polite, helpful and even jumped to help guests (including us) with getting cars from the valet parking. Being a hospitality professional and restaurant owner, it was a pleasant feeling to enjoy good hospitality with a warm and professional staff.The rooms and linens are great. Nice views from the balcony and the roofdeck pool. Definitely staying there when I'm back in denver next month as the location is perfect as well! Thank you all!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Beautiful room, great amenities and right near all of the action",Great deal on a hotel that is close to everything we wanted to do in Denver. Hotel had great amenities to keep us happy while at the hotel and a room that was perfect for a couple to stay in. Definitely would recommend to anyone traveling to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,No hot water! But amazing service from bellman!!,"My husband and I decided on the Warwick for our babymoon and anniversary trip to Denver. It's an interestingly designed hotel (updated rooms) and is very close to downtown. We were so excited for our trip and to have a sense of luxury after camping in the Rockies for a week. When we arrived we were greeted by Jonas who from the first moment went above and beyond for us. He valeted our car, helped with our items (which were many), gave us restaurant ideas, and even offered to send me off with an umbrella one day when the skies looked cloudy. The down side to our stay was our room. We had booked a standard King room because it came with a guaranteed private balcony (the deluxe King has ""limited balconies""). We were so excited to have a hot shower after so many days of camping. We turned on the shower and it ran cold immediately. We let it run for almost 15 minutes before it hit at best a lukewarm temperature. Then it went ice-cold on me during my shower. We let them know about the issue and they told us to just ""keep running the water"" and to also turn the sink on and flush the toilet at the time time as well. After some more pressing they sent a handyman up the next morning who worked on it for 30 minutes and said he's not sure why it's running cold. He talked to his supervisor who told him to tell us to just run it for 30 minutes or so. We really try to be reasonable customers -- no one wants to be ""those people"" making a scene about small inconveniences. But no hot water at such a fancy hotel was honestly super saddening and disappointing when taking such a special trip. We had to press the front desk on the problem more and they thankfully upgraded us to a Queen suite... AND IT HAD HOT WATER!!! =]My overall assessment is that the staff knew about the water issue. No one seemed surprised by the problem when we brought it to their attention, and they all were pretty prepared with their ""just run it for a while"" response. So if you stay here and have this issue, be sure to ask for a room change right away and skip all the back and forth! Hot water should be a non-negotiable at a hotel. So while we had to push the front desk staff to fix this inconvenience for us, I'd give the hotel 4 stars instead of 3 because of Jonas, the bellman. He seriously went ABOVE AND BEYOND and it was his service that gave us the luxury experience we'd been hoping for during our stay. Thank you Jonas!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Extra mile? Look no further. Amazing care taken by conscientious manager Charlotte, amazing bartenders Mica, Ezra,& Luke","Charlotte was the nicest person we met in Denver, no question. She and Mica made an impossible situation possible. They saved our trip. The staff at Warwick hotel goes above and beyond... think about Ezra and Luke at the rooftop pool when you think of “above and beyond.” Thank you everyone!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great hotel,"Beautiful hotel, awesome decor and you even get a voucher for a free drink upon check  in!  Awesome outdoor pool area on a rooftop..  close to fine dining and bars, nice location.  Would highly recommend.  The balcony off the rooms is an added bonus.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Nice location, clean rooms.  Could do better.","NIce location in a cool neighborhood in Denver.  Rooms are clean and well laid out.  Several missed opportunities though:1. What the heck tiny square pillows.  Pillows should be rectangles.  It is known.2. In-room WiFi is non-existent.  Learn how to use your phone as a hot spot if you need to do work.3. Water temperature is random.  But cold showers are good for you!4. Check-in desk always seems to be on the phone, so can take a while when they are busy.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great hospitality! Look forward to hosting large event here,"I was here with teammates as we prepare to host a large conference in July at the Warwick and we left feeling so excited to bring our executives here. Jonas goes above and beyond his job of valeting and helping transport boxes/luggage! He volunteered so much great places to eat near AND far in Denver, a total joy to interact with. Heidi and her team arranged for my three other out-of-town team members with a warm welcome surprise in their rooms. Matt & Jackson at the front desk were very happy to answer any questions for us. Look forward to returning in July!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Incredible Service and Wonderful Stay,"This hotel was a wonderful retreat in downtown Denver. Ismael Martinez checked us in and could not have been nicer. He was warm, welcoming and professional and made us feel right at home. The room was clean and updated and our in room dining experience was 5 star. Valet parking option was very convenient. We loved our stay and will certainly be back. Thank you Ismael and staff for making our stay so great!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,First Rate Hotel and Staff,"Our flight was cancelled after 5 hours on the tarmac.Arrived at 2am and couldn't have been greeted any better. We quickly got into our room-great size, clean, thoughtful and comfortable.Next day we still couldn't get a flight out and Sophie, front office supervisor, graciously extended our stay until we were able to secure our return. I can't say enough about her attitude, support and kindness. We thought maybe she should work customer service at the airlines-they are sorely in need of someone with her instincts, attitude and ability. But she would be wasted on United, that's for sure.Thank you Sophie for everything.Our daughter just moved to Denver and we visit often.This will be our go to hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing stay!!,"The absolute best stay!! We checked in on Mother’s Day and stayed for 4 days, the staff was amazing, the food in the restaurant was delicious, the cleaning staff made sure our room was clean and stocked daily, if we needed something the staff was right on it! The assistant manager (I forgot her name, beautiful blonde haired girl) went above and beyond to help us and our stay! She was amazing! Restaurant staff was efficient and kind! The motel itself is gorgeous! Our room was huge and well decorated! I’m very impressed and will stay here every time I visit Denver!! There aren’t enough stars for this place",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing Stay!,"Thank you to Matt, Jackson, and Jonas for my amazing stay!  I arrived here for a week stay for business and I was very impressed with how fast I was helped and how they treated me like I was a permanent resident there when they saw me. The room was absolutely beautiful on the 14th floor with a gorgeous view of downtown Denver!  The room was very clean and this is the first hotel I have ever stayed in with two showers in the room.  The maids were great as well and were always there for me if I needed anything.  I will definaltely have my company always book all of our employees at this hotel and would love to come back here for just a trip for pleasure sometime!  Thanks Warwick Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good hotel,"Overall hotel was very clean, rooms were spacious and well appointed. Several nice touches including the bikes offered to guests, coffee in the morning. Staff were friendly, there appeared to be some construction going on, but overall did not impact our stay. We had a balcony off of the room which was nice, however the outdoor carpet was in disrepair and could clearly use a good clean. Overall good hotel for the price in the location. Would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great oversized rooms...,"Nothing special about the common areas but my room was great. Very spacious, immaculate, lovely bathroom, a balcony that I didn't use due to weather but was very pleasantly surprised by the rooms. i didn't use any of the facilities or restaurants but the rooms exceeded my expectations.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fire on the Mountain thanks you.,"All the staff are extremely polite and helpful. Rooms are perfect.   Special thanks to Matt, at the front desk, who helped us quickly solve some parking logistics.  Serious thanks to Bonita for her friendly nature thorough cleaning.  Bonita's professionalism SHINED when I witnessed a patron being incredibly rude to her, and she immediately diffused the situation politely and calmly with zero backlash.  Keep it up, everyone.  We're very happy to be here!  - FOTM",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,We loved it!,"We stayed for a VIP Weekend with a band that rented out the hotel for their fans. The hotel was super nice and within walking distance of pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. Jonas, our Valet/Concierge was absolutely AMAZING! He took care of us and even remembered our names from the time we gave him our keys.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,An Awesome Hotel,"We stayed at the Warwick in Denver over Easter weekend.  We were there to celebrate my husbands birthday.  From the time we checked in the staff were polite, professional, and accommodating.  When we entered our suite, there was a bottle of champagne on ice and a charcuterie plate awaiting us.  The suite was spotless and well appointed.  Even though the hotel was filled to capacity, the staff were there to attend to whatever needs you had.  The bands who played at Red Rock and VIP guests for the concert were staying at the hotel for the weekend, so there were guests everywhere and new friendships being formed everywhere.  This was our third time to stay at the Warwick Denver and we will definitely stay here the next time we visit Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good Hotel with LIMITED AMENITIES!,"We stayed at the Warwick Hotel this past Monday to celebrate my wife's birthday. My kids purchased the room online for their mom. Upon arrival we were not disappointed. We arrived at 7:15 PM. We were the only guests in and promptly were checked into our room.  I inquired as to whether or not our room included the Breakfast In Bed option, which was highly promoted on the Warwick website. It was not. The Front Desk Agent did not attempt to detail or upsell the package. I asked about valet parking and was quickly pointed in the right direction. My wife opted to head right to the room. While waiting for Valet to return I opted to step out side to smoke a cigarette. No smoking area anywhere near the hotel. Nor were there any recepticles to put cigarette butts in. Surprisingly the…",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Stay away and save your money ,"Where should I start? Backed up tub with old fixtures. When I tried calling the front desk, I discovered my phone is not working. Spacious room in need of a sofa. And uncomfortable bedding. Sorry, it’s a 3stars hotel. ",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great hotel - needs some attention - but recommend ,"This hotel has been remodeled beautifully.  I loved the location, decor and space.  The bed was divine!Staff at check in and the valet was wonderful. Exceptionally clean from what I saw. I called down for room service and the phone didn’t work. I used the other phone and had a hard time hearing (evidently they did also).  They delivered to the wrong room.  I did get it - it was cold and I didn’t even get ice to go with my water.  But it wasn’t easy to call to express concern.  The young lady, who was initially frustrated, did apologize, and say she should have verified.  They did comp my meal (but not the service fed or tip, which was odd).I should have parked myself.  Plenty of less expensive parking. The shower curtain was dirty - and toilet needed some attention.  Unfortunately the desk person didn’t apologize about it.  As I mentioned she comped the meal.  An apology goes a long way with me.  All that being said - i would stay there again!! Older hotels, even remodeled, may have some issues.  As long as people apologize and handle them - I’m okay with that.  Minus the apology - they get the review here!",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Mixed Review ,"I stayed 3 nights. The room was large with a balcony which I enjoyed using for a little while one afternoon. I noticed that the water in the sink didn’t get hot. I mentioned this to the front desk the next day who told me I should have let them know as it was occurring, not after the fact. So I called the next night as it was occurring. I was told to turn on the bathtub faucet along with the sink faucet so the water would get hot. It worked but I felt then, and still do, that for the price point of this hotel it seems that you should be able to get hot water without going to those efforts. Something is outdated or needs repaired. Frayed towels also shouldn’t be the norm at a 4 star hotel. Housekeeping was very nice, just not thorough. My mug from yesterday’s coffee still on the counter, sugar packet still on the floor. Shout out to doormen being so friendly!",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great people,"Great people. Kay made housekeepings job easier but that made her own job harder. George is friendly and helpful. Hotel is quiet l but ocation close to everything. Big rooms, comfy beds, and big balconies.  Restaurant yummy and convenient.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Best customer service in years,"From the very beginning of the entire stay (initial check in) all staff was promptly very welcoming & extremely professional. Not only that, but their accommodation for pets compared to their competitors is the Gold standard.One staff member in particular (Ismael Martinez) was working the desk when I arrived late from a night out around 0130. I had stated I wanted to use the valet service, I’d pay it right now and that I didn’t care if I was checking out in the AM due to the fact there was an individual attempting to prowl my vehicle/followed me from the convenience store. I had stated my concern about my vehicle’s safety and he offered me the valet service and due to the circumstance with time (checking out) he accommodated my request & waived the fee. I don’t generally write reviews for customer service but he showed genuine care for my concern/issue. His genuine attention to my concern won me over for amazing customer service.Will definitely use the WarWick Denver location every time I travel here for business & pleasure.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great for the price and location,"The Warwick is very nice place to stay while in Denver.  The room was really clean and spacious, the staff friendly, and it's centrally located downtown.  I really don't have anything negative to say about my stay there.  I will return!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Love the staff!,Micah was an amazing bartender at the lounge downstairs! Friendly charming and fast service..I give her 10 stars! Hope she’s there when we return. Also Patrick and the doorman “George” also known as NaNa were great!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing Staff,"From the moment I was greeted by the valet, George, I was impressed.  I was well taken care of by him as well as the morning valet, Jonas, who went well beyond just getting my vehicle for me.  They made me feel very welcome and that I was an important part of their day.  I will definitely return!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great location,"We had a huge room with a large balcony looking out at downtown. The staff was incredibly friendly and fixed any issues we had quickly. We were able to walk pretty much everywhere and would recommend taking public transit so you don’t need to rent a car. However, we did experience some of the quirks of an older hotel like the lack of soundproofing and unpredictable shower water temperature.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,No Heat for starters,"We were at first impressed when we got to the hotel, however there was no AARP discount given heater in our room was broken. Offered $20 off the outrageous price and more blankets. Shower was in-operable and the bathroom door would not latch. Long cold night-never again",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Super nice hotel!,"When arriving, we were greeted by, probably the best hosts ever, Jennipher and Kay! They were very polite and did everything they could to accommodate us beyond what we could have asked for! They were awesome throughout the entire experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Nice location, nice stay!","Lovely hotel with a Victorian feel (at least at the reception area). The room was pretty big (more like a suite). The living room area of the suit was spacious, so was the bedroom, Sleeping was comfortable with soft pillows and clean bedding. The room comes with balcony access where one can sit and chill. The hotel is located in close proximity to several restaurants and is convenient for taking walks around. The hotel offers a rooftop pool which provides a good view of the city.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Kay is the best front desk agent ever!,We had planned to stay at Warick Denver 2 nights for our 10 anniversary! Due to unforseen circumstances we were only able to stay one night. I called the morning of our arrival and asked to suprise my husband with some champagne and cheese to celebrate our anniversay. Kay answered the phone and when we arrived there was a beautiful handmade card from her with a beautiful design. She took care of us every step of the way. She also was the one who checked us out and was compassionate and understanding! As someone who was a front desk manager for years she is a rare gem that hotels are lucky to hire. Her one of a kind touch is something guest cherish! Thank you Kay for making our experience at Warwick Denver something to cherish!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Highly recommended!,"We had a beautiful suite here for a weekend during the holiday season.  All of the memorabilia from the former Playboy Club made for a fun and interesting atmosphere.  (All very tasteful.)Our suite was spacious and well decorated, and we loved the 2 sets of sliding glass doors which opened to an expansive balcony.  The location was perfect - just a couple of blocks from downtown but out of the rat-race.  We loved it and hope to return soon!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice Stay,"We stayed for here for 4 nights and it was very nice!  I loved the location of the hotel - it was walking distance to several restaurants and shops, which was very nice.  The hotel has a really nice pool on the top that was packed everyday that we were there.  It's a rooftop pool that looked over the city and the views were pretty amazing!  The only complaint that I would have is that for the price that you pay, the rooms could have been a little nicer (maybe a new shower/bathroom area).  They were still nice, but could use some updating.  Each room does have a balcony, which was nice to sit out on.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Impeccable Service and Compassionate Fromt Desk Staff,"We recently booked a hotel stay for my mother at the Warwick Hotel, Denver. My mom came out to Colorado because I recently started chemo therapy. The staff was amazing in looking out for our 78 year old mom! ESPECIALLY MATT & JACKSON- from the front desk! They helped watch out for her and assisted her above and beyond... making her stay comfortable and easy! This in turn helped us get through this trying time by eliminating worrying about mom and her accommodations! Thank you Warwick Staff- & A VERY SPECIAL AND EMPHATIC THANKS TO MATT & Jackson! Really appreciate everything you both did! -Brooke & Jon",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Spacious and Clean,"We arrived early but the front desk had some rooms available. They let us know the view from the available rooms were not of the city which was ok since we were only staying for 1 night and leaving before sunrise. The hotel has a $18 resort fee but they gave us a voucher for complimentary drinks at the bar which pretty much pays for itself. Valet is around $37 or you can pay $18 overnight in the parking garage next door. Our room was up to date and so much space with a balcony. It felt nice not being crammed in a small hotel room. They had all of the amenities aside from complimentary water in the room and the bed was comfy. We will stay again when visiting Denver. The location is very close to everything downtown, a small walk but it’s nice to see the city.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Overall a pleasant experience at a high quality hotel.,"Stayed for just one day but the experience was a memorable one. Room was very well kept, comfortable and clean. Ate breakfast the day after and it was very delicious and filling. Had some additional fees and the front desk staff, especially Kay provided options that helped alleviate the burden. I cannot wait to stay at a Warwick again",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Heated Rooftop Pool!,"Treated ourself to two nights at the Warwick since we were in town to see the awesome local doom metal band, Khemmis. Front desk staff were very helpful and pleasant at check in. Heated year-round rooftop pool was amazing in December! Room was quieter than most. The second night of our stay we could hear a dog barking constantly next door. I let the front desk staff know and when they couldn't reach the owner by phone, they simply moved us to a different room, no questions asked. Thanks Matt and Jackson for helping with this so we could get a decent night's sleep. The balconies were spacious and would be nice in summer.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,HUGE rooms,"I stayed at the Warwick a few years ago and was pleased to return again. The staff was courteous. The rooms are huge and clean. It's just a fun hotel that is conveniently located. I arrived late at night and my only options for parking was (1) valet and (2) on the street. Since I had an early morning meeting the next day, I opted for street parking and easily fount a spot. I'm familiar with the area and it's generally pretty easy to find street parking, FYI. I'd return to this hotel again.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good value -,"We have stayed at the Warwick Denver on three occasions over the past year. The hotel has a casual, fun vibe. The rooms are very spacious and many have nice decks. The staff is friendly and helpful. I would especially like to recognize Asmir, Mellisa, Matt and Greg. We could do without the Playboy Bunny photos in the hallways. Although they channel the historic club once there, I think they miss the mark these days! I am also disappointed that the dishes from room service are always piled in the hallway as you exit the elevators so you have to look at them several times per day as you come and go. Surely there is a closet somewhere to to stash dirty dishes until they can be picked up. Also, the roof pool needs more umbrellas for shade! Overall a good value and a convenient location.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,TOP NOTCH,My husband and I travel frequently and stayca. A lot this is one of my favorite hotels. Very chic and open. Rooms are large staff go above and beyond rooftop pool what else could you ask for..within blocks of 16th Street mall. But quiet balconies which are rare. Will definitely be back,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,THIS IS A MUST STAY HOTEL!!!,So myself and girlfriend wanted a to just get away locally and enjoy the view of the city. I done a lot of research of other hotels and i came across Warick. Carmela the sales rep there won we. I came in she showed me around and the views and the warm heated pool up top. She was excellent in customer service and went above and beyond to keep me as a customer. So that being said i recommend this hotel to anyone in the future. GREAT EXPERIENCE. Carmela you ROCK!!!!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Weekend Before Christmas,"We stayed here for one night.  The customer service was A-1. The concierge, George was waiting curbside upon our arrival and he promptly helped us with our bags.  At the front desk we received a warm greeting from Jackson who also supplied us with extra bottled water.The hotel decor was modern and sleek, yet cozy as were the rooms.  Our 2 Queen room was very spacious compared to most hotels in this price range. The room featured a nice size walk in closet complete with an iron and full sized iron board.  The bathroom was pretty spacious as well with a shower/ tub and all of the basic amenities(tip: let the water run a few minutes to warm up). There were 6 lamps in the room(and a ceiling light), so there was never any shortage on lighting.  We also had a nice balcony with patio seating and a street view. The bed was comfortable although I could've used a firmer pillow. There's also a restaurant adjacent to the hotel (Randolph's  Restaurant) with a really good breakfast(I recommended the Vanilla French Toast).The only issue was the noisy guests next door who continued to make noise through the late night(even after staff addressed the issue).Aside from this, I would stay here again and highly recommend for a room that's a bit off of the main strip.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,My new favourite hotel,"On Arrival we were warmly welcomed and upgraded to the 'Governors suite'. We were warned the decor was dated unlike most of the modernised rooms but the antique, yesteryear look was charming and elegant and the rooms were vast and included a balcony. The Warwick has created a hotel that feels simultaneously homely and luxurious. The roof top pool was perfect and the buffet breakfast the best hotel breakfast we've ever had - it had a home cooked vibe rather than mass produced including delicious fresh seasonal berries and fruit. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. Great location being a 10min walk to 16th mall, Capital and galleries. The price at booking seemed expensive but comparable to others and was more than worth it especially with the upgrade. Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Disappointed.,"Our experience was unfortunate. When we arrived the entry was not marked and no valet to be seen. Rooms were nice except the first day they did not clean our room and only offered $5.00 credit. Noisy neighbors one night kept us awake until 4:00 AM. Manager was right on it but had to make 2 visits.  No parking, valet was very expensive so parked in public lot next door. Had to walk through alley at night to get from parking lot to hotel entry. The ""free"" breakfast package was not clear and made for a difficult check in. The staff was earnest but poorly trained. Rooms nice. Would like to think that another visit might be much more enjoyable.  Too many negatives on this one. Just felt they needed some polishing.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,We loved the Warwick,"The pool on the roof was super fun, with a great view of the city.  We were there when it was cold, but were not the least bit cold because of the pool temp and the barriers on the roof.  The restaurant and room was also great.  I would like to return sometime soon when I stay in Denver again.  Really enjoyable!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Weekend in Denver,This is a lovely hotel. Had a room with a king size bed. One of the best rooms I’ve ever stayed in.  Clean and comfy.  Room fridge. Stand up shower and another shower with tub. Elevators are quick.  Close to everything. But away from center of downtown.  Definitely staying again!!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Ok Stay,"Our stay here was ok- we only stayed for one night due to a late flight into Denver. Our room was huge! Large living area and bedroom. However, the renovations they just did were...lacking. The bathroom was the only area NOT renovated and honestly should hae been the first thing they touched. It was awful- water pressure was not great, toilet ran the whole night, extremely small shower. The staff were very friendly....but we would not stay here again. Also- there were no valets available for parking when we pulled up so we parked at the garage next door- much cheaper.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Lovely warm comfortable hotel,"We love staying at the Warwick. The staff is always helpful and friendly. On this trip we were helped both upon our arrival and in getting ready to leave early, by Matt and Carmella at the front desk. We walk to the Art museum, and it is easy to get our car out to drive over to Cherry Creek, to see our grandchildren, etc. The pool is still open, really warm, what a nice surprise. And, a good happy hour encouraged us to stay in for dinner. What a fun relaxing weekend again at the Warwick.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Outstanding Staff and Property,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Warwick.  I was in town for a class and was pleased the hotel was so close to my training facility.  The Warwick is close to downtown; walking distance to the 16th Street Mall.  From the moment I entered the front door, the staff was attentive, hospitable, and friendly.  Bellman Tony greeted me with a smile and welcomed me to the property; Front Desk Agent Carmella was gracious, efficient, and kind; and Manager Matt was accommodating, friendly, and attentive.  Every staff member I encountered had a pleasant smile on their face, greeted me with a smile and kind gesture.  The hotel itself was lovely; clean rooms, attractive lobby, great bar and restaurant.  Next time I am in town, I'll be sure to book with the Warwick - thank you to your staff for making my stay so wonderful!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Beyond Impressed!,"Booked A Executive King Suite For My Wife's Birthday Weekend,somewhat a ""staycation"" bday celebration..And I Cannot say enough good things about the Warwick. The suite was huge to say the least,and the design was gorgeous! And oh my gosh the balcony private patio ran the length of the suite with a great City view!Even though this is all great..what was even greater was our Hostess Carmela! From the moment we booked she took care of everything! She went out her way to make it a special event for my wife and she is definitely a go to asset when you book here! Don't hesitate to find her the moment you do,I promise you she is the best!

Avoid downtown parking and traffic, yet close enough to city and nearby places of interest. Great size rooms that have been recently remodeled. Bar and restaurant offer great drinks and happy hours. Stayed there numerous occasions and it is great every time (value and service)",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Meh,"Was expecting better. Hotel is clean, lobby decorative and inviting but the rooms and amenities are just..meh. Historically, the hotel has changed hands several times and while basic updates have been completed, details such as chipped bathroom doors and vanities remain. Morning coffee service is lacking compared to the other hotels in the area and the room service offerings are limited. Heated pool (open year round) on the roof is the only really cool feature of this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great weekend,Great time over the weekend at the Warwick. Our room was wonderful the staff was friendly and courteous and the location is perfect for being downtown. We loved the large balcony with our room and the city view was ideal. Since the meters on the street are not in operation over the weekend our parking was free. And the framed artwork and magazine covers are a nice nod to the past playboy club which occupied this establishment. Thanks for a great stay.,5

The hotel was the second Playboy Bunny Mansion in the country and that explains the many pictures of Hugh Hefner and various bunnies.     Rooms  have been updated to  slick modern furniture   We were upgraded to a queen suite and it was beautiful.  A balcony, living room, and a large closet and coffee area.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,From New York,This hotel was great I stood in a premier suite for my birthday and it was very spacious and modern. The balcony was large and had plenty of room for you and any guest. The morning buffet was great as well with you everyday basics like eggs and bacon. The gym was okay but not too bad. Pool was smaller then I thought but was heated so that was nice. Overall this hotel was great and the location was even better I was about 5 minutes away from the 16th street mall and it was very convenient. I’ll be back to revisit Denver in December can not wait to stay here again.,5

Room rate was only 148 very good for downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Customer Service Nightmare,"This hotel was a custimer sevice nightmare. They have an obstinate customer service attitude. In other word they do not know the meaning of customer service nor do they care. The front desk informed me that because I booked my room through a third party site, it is their option what room and where they would place me, in other words, I’m not allowed to make requests. They also proceeded to tell me that I should never use third party sites.  I should call them direct to book a room. Hello Warwick Hotel, third party sites are selling most of your rooms, how dare you be so snobbish. I make frequent business trips to Denver, but this hotel will never get my business again. You fooled me once, that's all you get.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,There are better places to stay ,This was a quick over the night for a early morning meeting stay. Got to hotel late. 3 valet were there trying to get me to park my car with them. So I finally said okay 37$ a night (car was going to parked for a whole 9 hours).  Got checked in took my kids to the pool. Nice roof top pool until my daughter sliced her knee open on the glass tiles that lined the pool. Went down stairs to get a bite to eat at their bar/ restaurant. Nice friendly people but the cole was flat wine tasted like it had been sitting out for days and well the water was Denver gross tasting water. Went back to our room beds were comfortable and pillows were nice. When we woke up at 6 to get ready to go to our meeting there was no hot water. When we told staff about that they did not act like it was on…,2

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,ANNIVERSARY NUMBER 35,At first I was concerned as the room we were given had an occupant.  Then a trip to the front desk and they reposted us to a new room but it was two double beds.  We went to the front desk and they were very apologetic and said we will take care of you.  WOW they put us in the Governors Suite.......provide us with free breakfasts and then later that night sent us a bottle of champaign and chocolate covered strawberries.  Now thats customer service by correcting an oversight and turning it into a positive outcome.  Thats what I call ,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Business and Birthday combo,"Husband had a business conference at the Warwick and I tagged along. We stayed an extra day to celebrate my birthday. The Warwick was very nice, clean, and our room was very large. The room was so large, that we had trouble getting the remote control to turn on TV and change channels. Their engineering dept gave us a new remote. But we still experienced the same problem.   The hotel is located a good distance from the RTD lines. Some restaurants and businesses around the hotel close early in the day during the work week and are closed on the weekend. The 16th street mall has a number of restaurants and bars open, but is a good walk from the Warwick.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Matt is an angel! ,"I recently visited Warwick after a nightmare of a trip... I had spent the last 24 hours on two separate flights (both which had lost my same bag). Then after not being able to find my reservation upon checkin, we realized I had booked for the wrong weekend. I was stressed out. When I mentioned the baggage dilemma to Matt, the front office supervisor, he assured me everything would be ok and upgraded me to suite all a while giving me an overview of the hotel. Sometimes kindness in s stressful situation can go a long way and I will definitely book here again. ",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Lovely hotel for our girl weekend!,"I was a little nervous booking this hotel, as ratings and some reviews were slightly lower than other hotels. However, I am so glad I ended up going with the Warwick. It is an adorable hotel that was perfect for our girl's trip. It's not a 5 star Four Seasons, but it is a lovely, comfortable, reasonably priced hotel I would absolutely return again.Hotel: The hotel itself was clean, cute (loved the photo/phone area on each floor), and easy to get around. Parking was free around the hotel on the weekend, so we were able to stay put and Uber very easily. Only needed to park in the garage one night when it was snowing.Room: I thought the rooms were adorable. The decor was great, the beds were surprisingly comfy (I'm a picky business traveler), the patio was great for looking at the city and watching the snow. I even liked how they stocked the snacks and drinks for you and they were very reasonably priced.Staff: The staff was great, it seemed at times some were a bit green or newer, but any time we needed anything they were helpful. We asked for extra blankets and they came right up. The bar was closing down, but they were willing to make us a quick drink to take to the room.Amenities: Loved the pool! No one was up there, but it was perfect at 85 degrees after a long flight from the east coast. Great area to take a drink, relax, and chat. Happy hour was also good. We just got a few drinks at BOGO prices.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,First stop on a month long road trip!,"The Warwick was the first hotel on a 18-stop road trip in the Eild West of the US!This former Playboy Club is located in the centre of downtown Denver and very convenient for touring the city centre, which is very pedestrian friendly.The room was exceptional, with king size bed, walk-in wardrobe and a separate lounge, making for a very comfortable to acclimatise on our first night in the States!The hotel staff were very friendly and exceptionally helpful and should we find ourselves back in Denver in the future then this will be our preferred accommodation, highly recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Nice hotel, friendly staff",The room was big as was the balcony.  Excellent linens.  Loved the pillows.   Very helpful bellhop/doormen.  Restaurant was mediocre.  My only real complaint was the air freshener in their lovely lobby was overwhelming.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Beautiful hotel but no sound barrier,We recently stayed at the Warwick and we arrived early but unfortunately we were unable to check in early until 20 minutes prior. It's in a great location so it was easy to stay busy until check-in time. The hotel was beautiful and well decorated. The rooms were probably the most beautiful I've ever stayed in. My only complaint was the amount of noise was unbearable. There were kids in the room next to ours and we heard everything. Any door that closed near our room were unbelievably loud. Very difficult to sleep and to sleep in. Such a shame for such a beautiful hotel. Hopefully they can reevaluate their sound issue to make this a 5 star rating.,3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"great building, shockingly poor staff","Should have been five star review, very well finished and furnished building, let down totally by inept and incompetent staff. Room was fine on arrival for seven nights, but from the remaining six, maid service just did not happen (despite a late request via reception) another so late we told them not to bother and a third where they were so late we were back at the room and had to sit out on the balcony while they worked. All from an upmarket hotel. Over 7 nights the bed linen went unchanged, we found a ticket to request this hidden in a drawer on departure day. With maids so reluctant to service our room, it would have been of little value to try using it, of course. The room was advertised as having bottled water, bath robes, slippers, a 'refreshment station'. All absent from our experience. Our room was above a service yard where waste collection lorries arrived at 5/6am each day, with noisy engines and the metallic noise of changing skip sized containers guaranteed to wake occupants several hours earlier than desired. A nice touch was being issued with tokens for a free drink in the bar each day. Less nice was seeing an inexperienced staff member alone and struggling to cope with her duties in there. When this was raised along with other issues at reception it met with a laugh. Odd reaction, but perhaps reflective of the fact that staff/management don't have a grip on things at the Warwick at present. It needs senior management to do their job and it could be excellent. Until that happens, the wise will look for alternative options. The Warwick isn't a cheap option and guests deserve a level of service reflecting the price they pay.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent Hotel,Loved the interior of our room.  All kinds of Playboy bunny artwork on the walls.   We had a beautiful view of te city from our balcony.   The roof top pool was gorgeous and clean.   The restaurant bar downstairs had great food and drinks.   I would definitely stay here again. ,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Interesting site,"This was for a business trip; arrangements made by someone else. Room was lovely as the bedroom was a separate room from the spacious sitting are. There was a walk in closet but it was not near the bedroom. Bed comfortable. Bathroom no cramped. The balcony was a nice touch with space for sitting. The food options were decent. Happy hour was a nice addition. Take out was in cardboard boxes which frankly did not work well - were hard to eat from due to their depth and the food did not stay separated. The motif had Playboy photos from that era and paintings and drawings with Playboy symbols - was odd in this day. Within walking distance of a variety of mostly casual/affordable restaurants, most were local (not chain) and were novel. Staff were consistently pleasant and thoughtful.…",4

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good Hotel for the Weekend,The Warwick for starters is a beautiful hotel. It was clean and the rooms were very comfortable.

KUDOS to the restaurant, staff, and especially Ezra that runs the rooftop pool bar and Adam the bartender at Randolph's that makes a killer old fashioned. Had those during happy hour. Great time. ",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Could be much better,"The Warwick is an OK hotel.  If it wasn't for the balcony, it wouldn't be worth it.  The rooms are large but if you're looking for a chair to sit in all you have is a desk chair.  There is usually a lounge chair in most hotel rooms, but not here.  You won't find a clock/clock radio either.  They have a program where you can put a notice on your room door if you don't want housekeeping for that day and you will be given a $5.00 voucher to use in the restaurant or bar.  You will get no $5.00 voucher nor will you get a credit on your bill as I was told by a few different staff members.  You will only get your room cleaned if you stay out all day.  Also, all the room doors are very heavy.  Good for security, but you will hear it every time someone goes in or out of their room.  Most…",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good Hotel,"The Warwick was in a great area, with restaurants and all of the action of downtown in walking distance. The room was clean, staff lovely, overall we had a great stay. The disappointment comes from the price surge the weekend we were there. By no means was our stay worth what we paid. Luxury pricing in a nice hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Spoilt by admin,"Good location for the centre of Denver  Problem at check in because, apart from a long wait to be attended to, whilst Lufthansa staff were dealt with and we were left standing there, our request for two adjacent rooms was ignored, even though the booking had been made six months previously.  With a young baby, we needed adjacent rooms and in the end these were not available. The otherwise very helpful staff tried to sort it, but in the end were not able to.  The restaurant was good, wth an interesting menu, but again you often had to wait, service not being very prompt.   The pool is not really a swimming pool. Nice location on top of the building, but too shallow, with ledges ad obstructions. Also showing its age, with chipped tiles. One party member cut himself quite badly. …",4

Perfect place to enjoy the city and get in your work too.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great Location, Kind Staff, Very Welcoming","I recently spent 5 nights in the Wawrick on my first trip to Denver. My first impression was the lovely doorman and the free water and cookies at the concierge!Check in was a breeze - they do pre-authorise on your card $60 per night for incidentals which I wasn't aware of (and because I had a debit card, it actually came out of my account but this wasn't the hotel's fault) but the money came back in to my account by the time I'd left. I was given a free drinks tokens for my five nights which I didn't get to use because Denver captivated me so much and I was out all the time but the gesture was very much appreciated.The room was beautiful and clean. I had a balcony that looked over the direction of the city park towards Aurora which gave me many nice nights to sit out and read. Everything worked perfectly, coffee machine was fantastic and the bed was very comfy. I had been told if I left out the door hanger saying that I didn't want room service before 2am that I would get a $5 token which didn't materialise but to be honest I wasn't really bothered about it.I needed a taxi at 4.30am for my flight to Toronto and I was told that reception couldn't book one but that they would put a note in my file for whoever was checking me out to call one. This put me on edge because I had been let down before my taxi drivers very early in the morning but there was no issue in the end. On the last night there was a lot of loud noise from other guests including banging doors and shouting which wasn't great but the staff checking me out was very apologetic and thanked me for telling her. Not really the hotel's fault but I appreciated the acknowledgement. I didn't get to try out the rooftop pool which I regret because it looked incredible. Nor did I get to try out Randolph's but the nights I did pass by it coming home it looked very busy (which is a good sign!).Overall, I was really pleased with the Warrick and it's probably one of the few hotels I tried in the US that I would go back to.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,60th Bday,Greeted at entrance by valet Kyle!  Super friendly welcome.  Attentive and efficient too- Kyle has a super pleasant demeanor!Carmela checked my group of 10 in... She was able to put us all on the 5th floor and was great at explaining Happy Hour and Randolph’s breakfast.  Then Carmela surprised me with a Bday breakfast.  Super sweet girl !  Thank you Warwick Staff.  We will be back to this historical hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice Stay,"I recently stayed two nights at the Warwick and the rooms were large, clean and updated. I say rooms, as there was a living room, walk-in closet, bedroom and bathroom. Stayed on the 8th floor, where rooms are being updated, but no issues with any noise. The balcony outside ran the course of the apartment and offered a nice view.  Overall a very nice hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Rooftop pool and so much more,I never had heard of this property and was pleasantly surprised. The property is in a fabulous downtown location but feels like a boutique hotel on the fringe of the downtown noise. Stay on the east side of the hotel for a more restful sleep. But the rooftop pool is really an amazing attribute and feels like a quiet oasis. The Brussels sprouts are literally the most amazing experience if you want to order food. Overall a positive experience from beginning to end.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Would have been better if not for Ezra,"This hotel would have had our 5 stars, that is how bad our pool experience was when visiting. Is Ezra the pool boy security or customer service? He doesn't seem to know and fluctuates between telling you what you can't do and asking if you want a drink. We decided very quickly to not buy anything at the pool and try to enjoy a swim. That was ruined when Ezra's friends came to the pool and he physically moved my personal belongings without asking (phone, items from my wallet and clothes) to another persons chair in order to accommodate them. When we had enough and were leaving I had to grab my shoes and needed to ask his friends to move, the guy looked to his girl and said, I'm ready to leave, I've got my wallet, my knife...flashed his switch blade!!! There was a baby near by for crying out loud! Warwick hiring team, do better, everyone else on staff was lovely, Ezra's idea of customer service or security is screwed.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Housekeeping skipped my room three times in a week...,"I stayed for 10 days in the Warwick Hotel in Denver, as I was having medical treatment nearby. Everything was ok, except for the fact that they didn't clean my bedroom 3 times in a week, even though I complaint and talked to the General Manager. They just don't care about their current guests, only about having new ones in.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Needs some Help,"At first glance this place really seems nice and like a luxury hotel. However, after spending five minutes in the room it becomes apparent that this is not the case.  The first and really worst part was all the black mold in the shower. It was nasty. Second, was the bathroom door and jam. Both were scratched up and in bad need of painting. Then there was the broken base molding along the wall. Maybe the most puzzling issues was the plastic bag tied around the smoke detector in the room. I realize they were doing construction down the hall and it was probably due to that but still, just poor management.  For a luxury hotel, it has a long way to go.  Finally, and most important were what I can only describe as a cruel trick were these metal rods that stuck-out on the right side of the bed. It appears they were placed  to   Injure people because why else have that sticking out of the side and hidden by the mattress skirt.  I would not recommend this hotel as a luxury hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good things and other stuff,"We checked in and were given a huge room on the 6th floor. It was enormous. But, the air conditioner was making a huge racket. We asked for another room and got one on the 4th floor. It was also a king room, but much smaller. Not that it wasn't nice, but the first room was much nicer. Rooms are nicely furnished with comfy beds.There are generous balconies. Huge walk-in closets with automatic lights when you walk into the room. There is a magnifying shaving/makeup mirror in the bathroom and a shower with great water pressure and unending hot water.I noticed that there was 1 bathrobe in the closet in the first room and none in the 2nd room so I asked for bathrobes, which according the the website should be provided.  They never arrived. I asked twice.Housekeeping service came very late every day. It seemed weird to be interrupted when trying to get ready for dinner so the bed could be made. (Is there a point to even making the bed at 5 PM?) - We had put the dirty towels on the floor to be changed - When we came back from using the pool at 4:30, the dirty towels were still on the floor making it difficult to shower.Dirty room service items stayed near the elevator pretty much all day.The bath could use a good bleaching - there was mold around the tub that should be cleaned. I've posted a picture.In all, it seems they don't have enough housekeeping staff.The pool area is nice. The tiles around the pool are getting a bit outdated and dirty/warn, but since it is open all year I imagine that there is no really good time to close it for repairs. There is a good bar at the pool and the bar tender was wonderful. Lots of people hanging around and enjoying cocktails even on a cloudy/rainy/cool afternoon as the pool is kept very warm. It's very enjoyable. They brought up new furniture while we were there, so it's obvious they are trying to keep it up to date. It's shallow and great for kids.The staff was very friendly and warm towards us. Everyone was delightful. There are some great vintage Playboy photos around the building since it was once the Playboy Club.We didn't use the restaurant. Breakfast room service seemed a bit pricey. They offer Town Car service to the airport for $55. It is pet friendly - there were several dogs staying there. The website mentions a 50 lb maximum, but I think the Husky I saw weighed somewhat more. They have a poop bag dispenser and container on the front lawn for walking your dog.You can walk to several great restaurants and coffee shops. It was a great location for us.Overall, it was a good value and we'd probably stay here again for the pool.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Spotless ,Friendly staff and room was immaculate. Great location; walking distance to theatre. Was able to secure street parking (6pm-9am) at no cost. My second visit to Warwick. I’ll be back. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars was a maintenance/shower issue.,4

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Room Great Location - Service is Horrible,"I feel bad for the staff working at this hotel because they must be critically understaffed.  I rarely write a negative review but after a 4 night stay at this hotel I just have to make sure others are aware of what to expect.  We reserved this hotel for four rooms for four nights for four couples.  All of us experienced the same unbelievably poor and/or just very slow customer service.  Three out of four days, we had to call and request the room to be serviced even though we were gone almost the entire day each day.  Four out of four days, we had to call them back for something missed (coffee, towels, etc.).  There is no actual parking except for on the street so your only option is really to valet.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very underwhelming pool - after seeing the amazing photos!,"My friend and I stayed here as an extension to our work trip to Colorado. We wanted somewhere with a nice pool so that we could just lounge and enjoy some good cocktails before a week of meetings!   Granted this is my first and only experience of Denver, so I have nothing in Denver to compare it to... however I do feel like there was false advertising in the photos of the pool area. The pool is TINY, half of it is about 1ft deep and the other half is 4ft deep. There are steps somehow all over the pool so it really is only to either sit in or stand in. The loungers are nice, however not nearly enough of them (perhaps 10? give or take).   The room was large for a city hotel and obviously renovated (which was great :)) while several things in the hotel were noticeably old such as…",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Community Pool,"Before you stay - be forewarned that the rooftop pool is fair game to anyone off the street willing to pay the daily fee ($20) to use it, or sneak you in (read on). Skip the hotel restaurant, food is bland and draught Coors is $6.00... in Colorado (!?).  Anyway, I arrived early and asked to check in early.  Before I could finish my sentence Brad said, “We aren’t taking any early check ins today.”  Ok!  I then asked to use the pool during the interim.  Got up there to find a ton of barely legal kids all letting more friends in to the pool area, while carrying spiked seltzer, etc.  The bartender/bouncer took the alcohol from them, but between the overwhelming spring break vibe and the blasting Pharrell music, I left soon after.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Downtown Standout,"Downtown Denver is getting to be quite the place with restaurants, shopping, and night life galore. Our recent whim-trip getaway had us in our downtown favorite hotel, the Warwick, newly updated and looking very boutique spiffy. Add a good full service restaurant and lounge and a swimming pool on the roof, the only one downtown we heard, and one asks what's not to like? Just one thing, the Warwick has one of those valet- only parking policies that holds you captive to the valet when you want your car.  A  peeve I have is common to all of Denver: The city's very quick growth provides service jobs to people who aren't from Denver, and, therefore, can't really provide any insider information on places to go or avoid.

It is easy to get to  Union Station, Larimer Square  and GREAT bars and restaurants in the area. We went to the roof top pool because the temp was 102 that day and found it too crowded as it is a small pool and area, but there was a good reason everybody was there.. It was too hot!

The west side has the great views of the city which is lovely at night. The balcony is huge and made lingering over my morning coffee grand. My room was on the large and roomy side with plenty of space to make myself feel at home. Warwick is a pedestrian gateway to everything. 16th street mall, Rockies Field, LoDo, Uptown with all the shops and restaurants are just moments away on foot. Easy to pull up and have your car taken by valet or plenty of on-street parking at night. I was able to get a great deal last moment as well. Service is swell. Easy in and out of City. Loved it here!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Won’t stay there again,"Warwick used to be a nice hotel in Denver.  It doesn’t offer suites anymore and the rooms are small.  At its best, it’s a 2-Star.I had requested an early check in and this is the third time the room hasn’t been ready until after 3pm.  When I was checking in, others were waiting for bellhop and concierge - they were nowhere to be found. Not one person working the front desk apologized for the wait or inconvenience.The only plus side is that they’re close to 16th street mall but not on it.There are several other hotels near the area, I’d suggest you stay elsewhere.  I’ll be suggesting this to my employer, too.  I don’t think they deserve to be a ‘preferred hotel’ any longer.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Terrible service,"While the rooms have been nicely updated and the pool is a plus, the service at this hotel was so bad it cannot overcome the positives. First of all, the air conditioning in our room was broken and it took them more than 24 hours to fix. Secondly, the door to the bedroom was broken and despite 3 requests over a period of 4 days to have it fixed it never was. Additionally, the hotel elevators were VERY slow as one of the 3 elevators was out of service for at least 5 days. Also, we had to call at least two days to have our room cleaned and, on one occasion, we were told they couldn't get to our room because they were focused on cleaning rooms that had been checked out of. Should that be our issue ? Also, when the room was finally cleaned, they forgot to give us fresh towels and water glasses. Finally, the hotel staff is clueless when it comes to providing knowledge of the Denver area. We had to actually go to another hotel to get basic info !The worst thing about it all is that we reported all of this to the hotel manager who simply shrugged and said ""I guess we have things to work on"". If that is the best he could do, he clearly knows nothing about pleasing guests and his attitude is emblematic of the very poor service at this hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Location,"The Warwick offers pleasant, comfortable, well-appointed, clean, and spacious rooms all set in an excellent location at the edge of Uptown, overlooking downtown.

If the plan is the spend time exploring the city, the location is in easy walking distance of the 16th Street Mall, as well as bars, shops, and restaurants in the Uptown and Capital Hill neighborhoods. There is a rooftop pool and a solid gym that includes some free weights in addition to the typical cardio machines. The staff was friendly and welcoming and our stay enjoyable. Recommended.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,surprisingly perfect!,"Booked by mistake (thought it was a different hotel), but thankful I did.  The location is ideal... a few blocks from 16th and a few blocks from locals favorites.  A roof-top pool with an amazing bartender/D.J.  (shout out to Z) sets this hotel above the rest.  We will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Close enough to everything,"Stayed here for a conference in March, and really enjoyed the hotel. The outside is fairly standard to look at, but the inside was filled with atmosphere, comfy chairs and very friendly staff. The conference was held on the 15th floor so there was great views while we met, and ate lunch. We stayed in a mini-suite, with a separate bedroom and large living space. Very comfortable space.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Presidential Suite not so Presidental,We were treating ourselves to the Presidential Suite let me tell you it was defiantly not presidential.  We called ahead the day of check in to see if we could check in early and spoke to Julie.  She said the earliest would be 2PM and that she could call us when it was avalaible.  We arrived early and asked to just park our car and we would come back.  Julie said she would call us and our friends once our rooms were ready.  We went to lunch and by 3PM no call had been received.  We walked back to the hotel to find a very long line once we got to the front they confirmed our rooms we’re indeed ready.  Upon arrival I noticed the lobby and bathrooms were older but still had high hopes based on the lovely online pictures of the rooms and the big balcony we were going to enjoy.  Well…,1

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Stay!,"I love the remodel of this hotel! Had a fabulous stay here with my two kids. Check-in staff was extremely friendly, valet was more than helpful and accommodating when my key dropped down between seats and I couldn't find it! Denver was having extremely hot weather and when we went up around 4pm to the rooftop pool it was was too crowded for my kids' liking with adults (not the hotel's fault, of course), so we decided to venture off to the movies. Within walking distance of Denver Pavilions/16th st. Pedestrian Mall, and plenty of nice restaurants. Recommend the hummus plate and a couple of glasses of house wine at Randolph's happy hour. We did make it up to the pool around sunset, and it was nice, although not really a kids' pool. Overall a very comfortable stay at a lovely,…",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Terrible experience. Do not trust this hotel!,"We were so excited about staying here. We booked the Executive Suite (Colorado Suite) online through Orbitz. It showed hardwood floors, mid-century modern furniture, a balcony with a beautiful view, and the suite had a separate king-sized bed in a private bedroom, as well as a large living room with chairs, a dresser, and a large pull-out couch/bed. There was supposed to be a dressing area and closet, and a large overall room.  The trouble started when we checked in. At first there was NO ONE at the front desk or front of the hotel--it was late, about midnight, but this made us feel a bit uneasy. Although I had prepaid and I brought my confirmation number and print out, when we arrived, the hotel staff were ""sketchy"" and had to go into a private office for a few minutes before…",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not a fan,"This was the strangest hotel I’ve ever spent $300+ to stay in. The hotel itself seems very old and perhaps that’s part of what I didn’t like. The ceilings are low. The room I stayed in (#500) was bizarrely laid out.  The bathroom is immediately inside the front door.  Past that is the bedroom. Totally separate; you have to exit the bedroom and go down the little hallway towards the front door to use the restroom. Then, around the other direction is a living room area, really very (almost disproportionately) large... white ch would be great if I wanted to a lot of entertaining ning or hold an impromptu dance off, but utterly useless on a business trip. The desk provided in the corner of said enormous living room, was bizarrely small and without the basic plugins & useful…",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Stay Here!!!!!!,"We love this place! Have stayed multiple times over the last 15 months for business. We love the ambiance, character and the somewhat storied past. The distance from city center is just enough to be off the beaten path but close enough to everything. Adam in the bar is stellar!! He loves what he does and does it well. The new chef Scott, what can you say? We’ve been to Europe, we’ve lived in Naples, FL, and tasted the finest chefs. His renditions are there with the best of them. When business finishes in the next several months we’ll make it a point to frequently visit our friends. ",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,An outstanding choice for our stay in Denver,"We were in town for a wedding and the Warwick was one of the hotels listed on the wedding couple's website. Not being familiar with Denver, and with only a little information to go on, the Warwick was just ""I'll try this one"".  I should have played the lotto the same night I made the reservation. This was one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in in a while.  Clean, comfortable; near places we needed to be but away from the activity of LoDo (where a lot of the other guests were staying). It was a great choice.  Matt, Brandon, and all of the front desk staff were extremely helpful.  Everyone truly made us feel welcome.  Room service and the restaurant were equally as good.  Would definitely recommend the Warwick.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Room was huge- pool was not,"As a hotel, the room was pleasant, had a great view looking east, big deck, and the staff was friendly.   Downsides- parking was rather expensive given the location, and the pool deck was small and there were a number of people enjoying the afternoon.  Unfortunately, it doesn't take many people to limit the ability to use the pool area. ",3

I had 3 more days to go. One of my classmates sent me to the hotel valet. I wasn't a guest at the hotel. Although it was absolutely gorgeous,  I stayed with one of my Youtube subscribers. That's beside the point. I wanted to make sure that my ""Easy Button"" got the credit he deserves!  I pulled into the valet and exited the rental van I was given.  I stood there in front of Jonas not knowing what to do. I stared at him waiting on instructions and he stared at me, waiting on me to tell him what I wanted. It was funny and awkward. Finally, I said "" I need help. I've never valet parked a car before. Jonas explained everything that was about to happen. I then told him,…",5

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Slightly different ,"We stayed at the Warwick for a quick get-a-way weekend in Denver.  Overall we very much liked the hotel.  The only caveat is that the feel of the hotel is different than the pictures portrayed.  It’s a lovely hotel, the staff was friendly, the rooms are spacious, and the restaurant was good.    Based on the website I would have thought the rooftop pool was huge, it’s tiny.  There also isn’t any atmosphere at the pool.  It was deathly quiet even with 3 other groups of people.  There wasn’t even any music.  We checked back at the pool later in the afternoon on a Saturday, same thing.  There also isn’t a pool bar.  So, if, from the pictures, you’re expecting to while away your warm, sunny day at the pool with a drink while taking in the Denver skyline you’ll be disappointed.  My…",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Mixed Review ,"I have been coming here for years, it’s a great property in an awesome location.... convenient yet in a quiet neighborhood feel, but still close to everything.    Well, one of the amenities that made this property so unique was the Wine & Cheese  Happy Hour that they offered their guests.  I was told by the Front Desk this got too costly and was removed, disappointing, it was such a great touch!  More disappointing, the hotel room walls are paper thin!  Maybe it’s because I was assigned a room that connects/around the next room, but I could hear every word of the phone conversation, the toilet flush, the TV, etc. coming from my neighbor next door.  At 2am last night I finally had to call down and ask them to send someone up to quiet them down so I could get to sleep.   Still a…",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Mixed emotions ,"Several rooms were reserved for our group of about 12 couples visiting the city for business and for a little extended R & R as a reward to our top producers.  Our room was a great two-room suite perfect for the husband who rises early to work in the sitting room while I sleep in.We had a bit of trouble with the A/C in our room, and after having maintenance look at it, finding nothing wrong, chalked it up to having the thermostats installed directly beneath the heat/cooling vents so that the units would kick on for about 30 seconds, cool down the thermostat, then shut off.  Maintenance said our room was the only one in the hotel with that type of thermostat, used for trial during remodeling. However, other members of our group had cooling issues as well.  Could not get completely comfortable at night.Our room was exceptionally quiet, at the end of the hall.  Lights are on control panels and hard to figure out.  Could never turn off the hallway light completely so had to always to keep door to bedroom closed.Comfortable beds, nice linens.  No alarm clock.  Sometimes slow to respond to calls to front desk, but staff is very pleasant and professional.Housekeeping was a bit lax, but nothing we couldn’t complain about.  No place to put soap or shampoo in the shower, had to set it on the floor.  A shower shelf or caddy would have been most helpful.  The biggest issue we had was with the attached restaurant, which was exceptionally slow in service at all meals.  Very nice servers but at times they seemed oblivious to tasks at hand.  Breakfast buffet was expensive and mediocre.  I’d recommend that you walk about 4-6 blocks to other restaurants.Lots of flight crews stay in this hotel.  There is also no convenience store/counter at this hotel.  You need to leave and go a short bit to a Seven Eleven store if you need an aspirin, razor, bandaid or other item you’d find in many hotel lobby stores.",3

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Wonderful, welcoming people","In Denver for both business and pleasure, and we were booked into the Warwick.  We had a small suite and were very pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome we got from everyone at the Hotel.  The room was very nice, the desk staff were a delight to see each time we went through the lobby, and the bar was cozy and a great place to relax at the end of the day.  By the time we left, we were greeted by name.  The location was just right for business.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great rooms with balcony, value for money ",The room was great with a balcony. I stayed two nights on business. The hotel is 10 minutes walk from the shopping street 16. There are plenty of restaurants around within walkable distance. The restaurant at the hotel also was good. Wifi was troublesome at times. Otherwise everything was great. They offered free drinks for two during happy hours.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,View,"We spent three nights here and had a wonderful time. View was beautiful, breakfast was very tasty, and the bed was really, really comfortable. They accommodated our request for a high floor and conjoined rooms and everything was ready for us when we arrived at midnight. It was not too far from most of the things we wanted to do and ubers were there within minutes. (too cold to walk or use their complimentary bikes) Overall, we will definitely come back when in town again and recommend to others as well!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Location/Average Hotel,"I stayed at the Warwick for a couple of days last week to attend a work function.  It was an okay experience.  The location is clearly the property's strong suit.  It's within easy walking distance to heart of downtown Denver.   I'll also say that my room was large, had a nice fresh décor, and the bed was comfortable.  Unfortunately, I was on the 3rd floor, right above the HVAC equipment outside. It made the balcony largely unusable.  My initial conversation with a group of colleagues focused on a series of odd check-in experiences we all had encountered.  One guy, who arrived earlier in the day, was told he couldn't check in yet.  They had clean rooms, but none had been inspected.  He went to lunch and came back hours later, only to be told the same thing.  Another colleague tried to adjust her reservation to add a night to her stay.  It wasn't a problem, except that the front desk staff adjusted the reservation in the wrong direction; they removed a night.  I arrived with a female colleague and let her go first when we got to reception.  She stood three feet from the one guy behind the desk who was free.  He never acknowledged her or said something like ""Give me moment.""  He just ignored her--really odd.  Finally, one of the other staff members called her over.    A minute later, he announced, ""I'm ready"" and looked at me.  I wished he hadn't.  He was overly familiar and edgy, and it made a routine situation confusing.  The front desk staff needs help.Overall, the Warwick was fine, but it has the feeling of an old property with a new veneer hastily applied.  Looks okay at first, but don't look too long.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"I paid cash for my wine, but it ended up on my room charge! HMMMMMMM!","My experience was overall a good one. Great location. Top notch function and bar staff. Dining room staff, not so much. A little smarmy and pretentious, without the food or wine knowledge to back it up. He had to ask the kitchen and bar every time we had a question. A BIG NO-NO. I paid for my wine in cash, but it showed up on my room bill. I am pretty certain he pocketed the cash. A BIGGER NO-NO.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,First Class Hotel and Staff!!,"My daughter and I stayed there thanksgiving eve of 2017. The GM Michael Glover went out of his way to make myself and my 12 year old daughter feel welcomed and appreciated. We dined at the hotel restaurant where the food and staff were as pleasant as their GM was to us. My daughter fell in love with the recently renovated room, heated rooftop pool, and its view. This one night stay made her holidays and is something she'll soon not forget. Overall this was a first class experience and we are going to make this a yearly night away for the family. A big thanks to Michael and his staff!!! You're doing things right at the Warwick.....",5

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent staff,"Large rooms with lots of amenities. What I really need to say after several stays, is that this hotel has absolutely excellent staff. They are very happy to go the extra mile and do anything in their power to help you, make your stay more comfortable and make you feel like a welcome guest. This is something that has become rare in hotels these days. I recall several separate instances where I was recognized by hotel staff and greeted warmly. I witnessed a staff member who remembered a patrons order from weeks ago and asked him if he wanted to order the same thing again. That guest was absolutely puzzled!Seriously, I’m amazed by the staff, their team spirit and their ability to absolutely go above and beyond. I’d like to mention Nick and Andre of the reception and Raul at the Bar, these guys are stellar in their performance, they truly know what hospitality means.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Hotel and Staff,"We recently spent a couple of lovely nights at the Warwick hotel in Denver. We selected the Classic King room for our stay and it couldn't have been better. The room was clean, the bed very comfortable and the room layout separated the bathroom from the bedroom area. We really enjoyed the balcony and had a good city view. We were most impressed by André, one of the Front Desk Staff. He was very welcoming and took complete care of all our needs. He is a positive figure of the Warwick Hotel ethos. Nothing was too much trouble. His beaming face behind the desk made us feel right at home. Such a professional. Nick was anther stellar example of the service one would expect at the Warwick. He took a personal interest to ensure our stay was a perfect weekend. We chose to add breakfast to our room when we booked. Although convenient, I would not choose to do this again.",5

I was very impressed by the friendly greeting I received from the doorman and the front desk clerk.I upgraded my room to a suite and received a free drink nightly, free parking (not sure if this is routine, or part of a special promotion). My beautiful room was truly a suite in that it had a large living room, large bedroom, bathroom, walk-in closet, pantry, and balcony.The rooftop pool was wonderful, especially as it was March and the pool was heated to 85 degrees.Located near a number of wonderful restaurants and area attractions, the Warwick is a wonderful choice while in Denver.As I was leaving the doorman used my name and said “hope to see you soon.” I thought to myself... me too!",5

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Annual Meeting,Our company had our annual meeting at the Warwick Hotel in Denver.  The location of the Warwick was great for exploring downtown Denver.  The rooms were nice and comfortable.  The hotel conference accommodations were good or us.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Things change,"We have stayed here twice during the past two months.  The first stay in January was top notch. Nice, clean, quiet room, good maid service, nice workout facility, and a good breakfast menu along with a buffet option, quick check in and check out. There is a somewhat limited dinner menu and draft beer list but the food and beer were good (try the half chicken) and the complementary bread with dinner very good.  The most recent stay in February was different.  Both check in and out were troublesome due to the changes with breakfast options. We were offered a lower breakfast price at check in but charged a higher price at check out and the desk was unable to change the charges in their system. There was only the $25 buffet option for breakfast in the restaurant - no menu to order from. You will need to order from the room service menu or eat elsewhere if you don't want a buffet breakfast.  Having said this, we look forward to staying there again since the rooms are what are most important. The suites are great and the regular rooms very nice as well. The hotel is quiet and conveniently located to downtown for our business needs.  I hope they return to a breakfast menu for our next stay or we will probably start eating breakfast out of the hotel.  I would have rated it a 5 except for the breakfast changes and checkout charges.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Personalized service!,"I stayed here for two nights for business meetings.  After the first day of meetings I was informed that I would need printed and signed PDF's.  I only had access to my laptop.  A hotel employee named Parker Ramsay helped me at the business station to print.  The format would not quite work on that printer so he had me email him at his personal email, then printed it off behind the desk for me, then scanned it to my business email so that I could have a copy.  Truly a personal experience here and I will be bringing back more business.  Thank you Parker!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good location and breakfast,"Stayed here in August last year for 2 nights. The hotel offers great breakfast! The bed is comfortable and is is always good to have a balcony. The hotel was recently renovated so everything is clean. What I did not like was the lack of self parking on site. You either have to pay for valet parking or to park on the street. The TV in the rooms are small and so far from the bed that it´s really difficult to watch anything. We also tried the restaurant for dinner. We both ordered coctails which were really bad and almost undrinkable. We also both ordered a steak, medium done and we got it well done and overly salted. All in all the hotel is centrally located for some sightseeing so if you get a good rate than stay here. Aviod the restaurant though and be prepared for a hassle in order to find a parking spot.",3

We stayed in a suite which included private bedroom and living room areas, and a wet bar with a wide selection of beverages and snack items. Choice of Valet or street parking.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Dinner at the Warwick,"We took a large party to eat at the Warwick and the service and food was amazing.  Mariah, Nick, and Nolan served us and did a perfect job.  We all had a great time.  George also made sure we were well taken care of.  It will be a memory that we will all cherish.  Thanks to everyone at the Warwick.  GREAT JOB!!!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Christmas ,"We stayed in the Warwick Hotel for four nights during holiday season snd we absolutely enjoyed it.The rooms are refreshed and very spacious. We also liked the heeated rooftop pool, bikes to borrow and the gym with a view.Breakfast Buffet was very good with a wide choice. Our group had a Christmas Eve Dinner in Radolphs Restaurant. It was a real treat.The best thing about our stay was the staff. The two doormen Jonas and Parker made everybody passing trough the lobby or lounging by the fireplace feel very welcome and pampered.All of the staff at the reception are so friendly and helpful to plan our days in and around Denver.The Restaurant manager George did everything to make our Christmas Eve Party to be perfect and just the way we wanted it.Raul made our daily visit at the bar a real treat and almost like coming home.Thank you to everybody.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Find,"Warwick Denver surpassed all expectations. What a great discovery! Perfect location, spacious accommodation, great breakfast, and extra friendly staff. We were pleasantly surprised by everything at the Warwick!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Location and Staff....top notch !,I spent Christmas in Denver and wanted to be in a location close to my son’s place. I had no idea how perfect the Warwick would be !The young staff was very friendly and exceedingly professional.I could easily walk to the 17th Ave restaurants with my son and to the 16th Street Mall.I found my room to be spacious and nicely decorated in a neutral and minimalist style. I can’t wait to return.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Comfortable and Easy,"Each of the rooms, which were originally built to be apartments, are fully updated and comfortable. Each room has a balcony, enjoy some fresh air. Staff is very friendly and it is close to many central Denver activities. I haven't been here in many years but I will definitely come back when in Denver.  Also has a good restaurant!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great location, quiet hotel","This is a solid 4 star hotel... stayed for a long weekend this past weekend and we were very happy with our choice!Great staff, arrived about midnight and were welcomed and checked in quickly, with a couple recommendations for where to grab a late cocktail.We were in a newly renovated room on the fifth floor. My booking was for a Mountain View but when it confirmed the reservation, it confirmed as a city view. I was disappointed, but never mentioned it to the front desk because it was my fault for not catching it. The city view was just fine and tbh, I’m not sure there would have been much of a Mountain View with the downtown buildings blocking the views. The pool is pretty sweet, small but popular. We never got in but did go up top to sit a couple times. Very pretty downtown view, but again, not really a Mountain View.  And I may have misunderstood some of the other reviews, but we expected a rooftop LOUNGE (as in: bar, possibly with some sort of food service)... there are lounge CHAIRS, lolol! But just bring your own drinks and chill.Location is amazing.Be sure you try La Loma, Mexican restaurant only 3 or 4 blocks towards downtown.Bed was comfy but pillows were really small... bathroom was fine, the layout of ours was wonky, but totally workable. As with every hotel, just needs one or two additional towel bars/pegs. Overall, really nice stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great location, lovely hotel, pet friendly","The Warwick has very nice modernized rooms, though there were some visible stains on the carpet. It was average or slightly above average in terms of acoustics (we were near the elevator core). We like that this hotel is right at the edge of downtown, still walkable to many things but street parking (free) is easier to come by, and there are grassy areas for the dog.  I recommend booking a package with the breakfast buffet - it was excellent, but $25/person if paying outright.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Management is on point,I had to stay at this hotel a few times now and let me tell you the manager Nicholas is by far the friendliest and myself a person I've ever dealt with in a hotel I  Make this my hotel when I am in town.  Management and staff are very attentive to your needs And the hotel environment is very family friendly definitely would recommend this hotel to my family and friends if they need a place to stay in the area.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"near citicenter, quiet","since I am staying often in the warwick, I can only recommend this place: it is situated not far from the center, in a quiet area. the rooms had been refurbished and are lovely. the staff is especially caring and friendly. I would have given five stars, but the elevators are tiringly slow",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Exceeded our expectations,We had an amazing stay here. Of course the hotel is beautiful and comfortable with spacious rooms. But I was most impressed by the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. We even had a small issue that was dealt with immediately. It was clear they really cared about our comfort here.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,New Upgraded Rooms,"While the lobby is still a bit outdated, the newly upgraded rooms are pretty good.  They are still in the midst of the  renovation.  Stayed in a premium suite that was pretty nice, although the layout is a bit strange.    Had some food at the bar that was pretty decent and good service.  Breakfast buffet in the AM was fairly good as well.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing fullpackage,"Amazing location, Beautiful rooms, great food and the perfect service from that we get from the whole crew! Thank u George, mike, André and the  rest of the staff, you made us feel like home! Hope to see u soon!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great stay, very nice staff ","I can definitely recommend staying at the Warwick Hotel in Denver. Although I was there due to a business trip, I can certainly say that I will come back to visit Denver and stay at the Warwick. I was very pleasantly surprised and impressed by Denver and the surrounding area, also thanks to the amazing hotel crew. The hotel‘s location is very central and it is just a 10 minute walk to the main shopping street. There are also plenty of restaurants, bars and dining opportunities around the corner. The hotel itself has a good restaurant as well, I can highly recommend their burgers and the truffle fries. The restaurant’s manager, George, is a very kind, funny and pleasant person, as well as the entire staff, they were very friendly, helpful and attentive, I felt very comfortable and welcomed. Great service! I can only repeat myself talking about the main hotel staff, especially Mike, Nick,Andre and Jenaysha from the front desk. Always very kind, helpful, never to busy to help or listen, they had amazing insider tips and really made me enjoy my stay. I constantly felt welcomed, safe and comfortable in the hotel. I will also emphasise that my room was very clean and tidy, the bed was comfortable. Room service, as well as housekeeping were very friendly and professional. All in all I can say that all of the Warwick Hotel and Restaurant staff do an excellent job and they really understand the key to customer service. Continue the great work! Thank you very much, until next time.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Just what we needed and a great value, too","We were celebrating Thanksgiving with our daughter who lives in Denver.  The staff is friendly, the hotel lobby and rooms are very clean.  We enjoyed our stay very much.  Just a very short walk to restaurants, shops, and parks.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fantastic Stay!,This hotel is fantastic.  The staff were all outstanding from the the front desk to the concierge. I would only ever stay here if you are traveling to Denver.  The breakfast buffet is outstanding.  The newly remodeled rooms are well appointed and beds or very comfortable.  Even for one night and no matter the temp take your swimming gear for the heated roof top pool and go at night!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Perfect Hospitality,"Im part of an Airline Crew so i spend half of the year around the globe in all kind and different Hotels. I know what its important for Business guest like me in a Hotel. To be honest Rooms are more less the same as long the bed is cozy the Room (specially the Bathroom) is Clean and the Neighborhood as quite as possible, everything is fine. But if you want this special thing this feeling like coming home you're at the right place at the Denver Warwick. George the Restaurant Manager made me and my crew feel like Home. He was always around and even in the worst times of life he always had a funny story to tell. Im really looking forward to be here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very friendly staff,"It was my first time staying at the Warwick Denver. Everybody was extremely friendly and helpful. They helped us organizing a trip to a national park and after a long day we had a really nice time at the bar. Special thanks to Hannah, David and Connor, who took care of us!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Off the beaten path,"If you are looking for a unique place to stay that is off the beaten path of downtown Denver, you should give this place a go!  Quiet and historic, you can truly relax in the lobby and rooms.  Take the time to enjoy the restaurant and bar.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Cheap renovation, NO WATER, bad customer service","My family and I arrived at the Warwick, had to wait 10 minutes for the valet driver, checked in and went to our room. We needed a baby crib, which was delivered about 20 minutes after and it looked like it was from 1950, from an infirmary. My husband said, ""it looks like jail"" to the guy who delivered it and his response was, ""not like the jail I was in."" Then, I needed to take a shower, but there was NO WATER in the entire hotel. They did not mention this to us when we checked in. The front desk had no idea when the water was going to be turned on. The room was clean-ish, but I wouldn't feel comfortable having my daughter crawl around on the floor. The bathroom door was sticky and we ended up checking out before even spending the night it was so awful.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice hotel--that's about it,"Stayed here for a long weekend--combination visit with family and sight-seeing.  Hotel was adequate and fine for what we wanted.  Couldn't complain about location--good for transportation--close to mall ride.  Also good restaurants a few blocks east. The hotel amentities were OK. We got a free drink in the bar at happy hour every day. A large tour group was also staying there and in the mornings between 8 and 9, they pretty much commendeered the elevators so we had to use the stairs.  Our room was large, but only had one chair.  Plenty of room to put at least one more.  To add insult to injury, the balcony also had only one chair.  If my DH and I both wanted to share an evening on the balcony--and the weather was lovely--we could only do it one at a time unless we dragged the room out.  Bathroom was nice but the shower was so strong, it actually hurt. No way to adjust the spray.  And no matter how we arranged the curtain, we always soaked the floor and it took at least one, sometimes two, towels to sop it up.  The bathmat was wholly inadequate.  Our second night there, housekeeping only left one clean towel and one clean washcloth--I had to ask for more.  We got the feeling our room was meant for a solo business traveler.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing Staff and Great Hotel,"Had to travel to Denver for medical treatment at St. Lukes. This hotel is within walking distance of the hospital. Original flight into DIA was cancelled at the last minute because of mechanical problems and hotel staff was so kind and accommodating. They worked with me to re-book my room. When I arrived, they gave me a card for a free drink at the hotel bar/restaurant to make up for the awful  and stressful travel day. My room was on the 12th floor. The balcony was nice and the view of downtown Denver was amazing. Even though the bar/restaurant was packed on a Friday night, the bartender and wait staff were attentive and on top of things. Food and drink was very good. The room was clean and comfortable. Will certainly stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Lovely neighborhood, comfy bed, great gym","First, the Warwick is in a fantastic location in Denver. There are several great restaurants in a short walk and downtown is easily accessible. Front Desk staff were extremely helpful and check in was quick. We got an non-renovated room (at a deep discount) so the decor was a bit dated and some things clearly were at the end of their lifespan like the shower head and faucets. However, the room was still very comfortable, the bed had scrumptious linens and pillows. The gym has several ellipticals and treadmills as well as a full dumbbell set and weight benches.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Underwhelming Stay,"My husband and I were excited when we booked at the Warwick because we love boutique hotels with historical charm. Unfortunately, with the Warwick, all we got was an overpriced, outdated hotel room. The entrance of the hotel, with the 2 lions, is probably the nicest part of it all. We walked into the lobby to find a generic hotel lobby, with nothing unique about it. Our room had old decor and furnishings. The shower had mildew all on the tile and the grout around the tub was peeling. The hot water didn't last for long and the sink was not conducive for 2 people as it was a pedestal sink with no counter space. The location of the hotel was good, although we awoke to a man screaming on the sidewalk at 1am repeatedly, so that made things a little interesting. Honestly, the hotel is a fine place to stay, but for what we paid, we were thoroughly disappointed.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great new spot (well for us to stay at),We stay in Denver about every other month as we own a business in Boulder that bring us to town.Normally stay at the ART hotel but the price was way high and we decided to try the Warwick. Great stay. I had purchased on Priceline ($180ish) but when we got to the counter  to check in Priceline had room now priced for $119. The host was great without blinking an eye said price match and dropped the price and they upgraded us to a suite room.Hotel itself isn’t the most modern but it’s clean and well decorated.Sheets where great as pillows. Mattress didn’t blow me away at first impression but had a great night of sleep.Used the workout room which was above average for a hotel. Plenty of treadmills (all in working order even if I didn’t use one;) good selection of weights and cable machine.Not the end of the world but we didn’t put out a breakfast card on door-handle that was never picked up. Had hoped to wake up to breakfast(not the norm to do this but we where splurging). Woke up disappointed because we couldn’t get breakfast anymore but ordered the burger and truffle fries which both where great and arrived hot.Overall would stay here again if the price was right and would say if you get a good deal go for it.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Fresh rooms, great roof top pool","Really enjoyed our stay at the Warwick. Very nice newly renovated large rooms with comfortable beds, and great service at the front desk. The roof top pool bar was great. Only things we didn't like was that it was very difficult to get hold of the hotel in advance of our stay (I wrote several e-mails and called multiple times without receiving an answer. I was put on hold two times and waited almost 30 minutes!),another thing was though the service was great at the roof top bar, the music was way too loud, playing terrible rock music. Not relaxing at all. The man working finally turned down the volume, but we thought it was a strange experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent hotel,"Very clean and well appointed hotel, very big room with comfortable bed. Room not ready when we arrived but laid on juice and cookies. Room had a balcony which was nice but no seats to sit out and take the benefit of it.Location of hotel is ok however felt you had to be aware of which direction was safe to take.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Subpar Quality and Service,"I stayed at this hotel as part of my regular travel to Denver. I've stayed at a dozen hotels in Denver including the Art Hotel, Teatro, The Westin, Four Seasons and the Hyatt. The Warwick is one I ended up during a busy week. Overall my experience was very disappointing. The room had not been properly cleaned, there was a half eaten salad in plastic packaging left in the room and the mineral bottled water had been opened by the previous guest.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Awful service, out-dated, slow elevator","Very disappointed in my stay here. An advertised cheaper rate apparently meant that we had to stay in the dated, unfinished, old rooms while we took the old, slow elevator past the new finished floors. The attached restaurant closes at 10pm and you can only order booze from the mini bar if you call them. We watched the broncos- raiders game here at Randolphs (this attached restaurant) while a man threatened to kill liberals because liberals kill babies. I told the front desk about this and they did nothing to remove him. The valet also has been terrible- there are no signs when you pull up and the front desk again cannot communicate what the process is. Very disappointed- hope the remodel does them some good because I actually like this chain.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Ask for George,Very responsive and approachable staff. Spent a great evening with George the Maitre d in the bar. Great guy who made us feel right at home. He has some great stories to tell.A lot of investment being made in the hotel and I stayed in one of the refurbished rooms. Very comfortable. Had an incident where the valet misplaced my car keys which was a big mess up. However the response from the staff and hotel was immediate. They paid for my transportation for the day and sent a fruit bowl and bottle of wine to my room. That’s the response you expect when a disaster happens.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great location and good value for the money,"We stayed at the Warwick for three nights and were charmed by the renovated rooms and elegant lobby atmosphere. A very good AAA rate made this a good value for the money, and the location was close to good restaurants (on 17th St.) and fairly close (a short walk) to tourist attractions. Only down side was that the hotel appeared understaffed, especially when the tour groups were checking in and out. Some staff were friendly and helpful, others were not. Valet parking in particular was disappointing...$37 a night to park our car in an open parking lot in back of the hotel...and one day, we returned our car only to have it sit in front of the hotel on the busy Grant St. for over an hour. I recommend self parking (several garages and lots in the vicinity) or asking that your car be parked in the garage underneath the hotel if you choose valet parking.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fantastic service,"Had a great experience here. The room was newly renovated and very nice. The staff was exceptionally helpful, especially two members of the housekeeping staff, Ishmael and Osbaldo! Will definitely be back when I'm in town again.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent Staff,"The hotel is perfect for staying in Denver. Centrally located, very nice design, very good bar/restaurant. This time I wanted to see a NFL-Game. It was so difficult to get a ticket. NickD and Mitch from reception were so incredibly nice and helpful and finally organized my ticket. Great staff members with an amazing working attitude!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,An Underwhelming Experience,"This is somewhat of a dated traditional hotel in need of renovation and basic upgrading. This is a property that really isn't quite worth the rate that they charge. Housekeeping was inconsistent. Elevator renovations were not managed well. This is a property with reasonably good location and access to downtown Denver, just nothing that makes you feel you are at an up to date hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,My favorite Denver Hotesl,"I am always treated with respect and treated like I am a special guest.  The staff is friendy, efficient and professional.  I always in enjoy the year round outdoor pool.  The new renovations are perfect.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great hotel in the center of Denver,The Warwick is a great hotel in the perfect location. 16th street mall is close enough to walk or take a quick couple minute uber to. The front desk and rest of the hotel staff have some of the best customer service I've ever seen. The rooms and bathrooms were extremely spacious and the walk out balcony was an extra bonus. We loved spending time on the rooftop pool where the bartender was friendly and took great care of us.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,AMAZING HOTEL,"This hotel is amazing.  They were perfectly located.  They had the amenities I wanted (rooftop pool - balcony - restaurant)  Captain Z and Hannah were great hosts at the pool and kept everyone happy.  Mike and Amir (hope I got his name correct) were amazing at the front desk.  Randolph's was so enjoyable, having a great breakfast outside.  Everything was just perfect!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Lovely Hotel and Conveniently Located,"We booked a room for one night in Denver and enjoyed every minute of our stay. The valet manager gave us exceptional service, the beds were super comfortable, and the roof top pool was a nice treat. We liked it so much that we decided to stay another night. The front desk treated us very well.It's only a 15-30 minute walk to City O City (great vegetarian breakfast/lunch/dinner), the Botanical Gardens, and the Art museum!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Huge hotel rooms centrally located in down town Denver,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Warwick - booked online using priceline.  Be careful when you book as there are a couple of extra costs you need to know about.  We stayed in one of their Classic Rooms which had over 350 square feet and come with King beds. Floor-to-ceiling glass doors lead out to private balconies with panoramic views of Denver.1.  They charge a $15  ""Urban Retreat Fee"" on top of your booking2.  If you park here expect to pay up to $37 - we parked in a nearby garage which was cheaper..3.  They have special rates for same day booking; which may include breakfast and parking for a nominal fee.We questioned the Urban Retreat Fee and they gave us 2 drink coupons per room which more than made up for the fee.  Had a lovely stay - room was very nice and super clean.The price was fair for a down town hotel room.  You could hear other hotel room doors closing which was not a problem but something you need to be aware of if you are a light sleeper.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The Perfect Stay,"Stayed at the Warwick for a couple of nights while seeing the Mets play the Rockies. The check-in experience was fantastic with Michael giving us a full rundown of the hotel and surrounding restaurants and shops. You could tell they've done some renovations as the room was updated with a modern, chic vibe. Best feature for us was the rooftop pool that cooled us off after a hot day walking around the city while offering great views all around. Lots of reviews have mentioned the elevators being slow - two of the three elevators were in operation (one is being fixed) but we never experienced much of a wait at all. Walls between rooms seem to be solid but there was some noise from the hallway - nothing that negatively affected our stay. We also tried Randolph's (hotel restaurant) which didn't disappoint.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Impeccable customer service,"We visited Denver for our 35th wedding anniversary on August 25 for 2 nights.  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite.  We had only been in our room for about 10 minutes when there was a knock on the door.  Upon opening the door, one of the hotel staff members was standing at the door with a bottle of champagne on ice and chocolate covered strawberries.  Who else does this?  Our suite was on the newly renovated 9th floor so it was extremely nice.  Our suite also had a balcony overlooking the city.  There are bicycles guests can use at no charge.  In the mornings there is complementary coffee in the lobby.  At the time of our stay the hotel was offering parking for a penny instead of the usual $37 per night.  There is also a nice restaurant/bar onsite with the option of patio dining.  And don't forget the rooftop swimming pool that is heated.  I would just like to say again how incredible the staff at this property is.  On the morning of our departure the valet had called in sick, but the front desk staff had it covered!  What team players!  I would go back to Denver just so I could stay at the Warwick.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fantastic Gem ,We were greeted by Nick who is probably the best front desk person I have ever experienced in my life...and I am 56!The renovated room was gorgeous with everything we could want except there was only one bathrobe for the two if us. The rooftop pool is a huge bonusThe only minus is that one if the three elevators is being renovated and we had to wait a bit most of the time Old world charm...beautiful and promote Nick immediately,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Hotel!,"The Warwick is a great hotel in a great location.  We were given a room that had been recently renovated.  It was beautiful.  It had a large walk in closet that also had the coffee center and a safe.  Below the coffee center was a open cabinet which was great for stacking clothes.  The bathroom was very nice.  It had modern hardware (this took some getting used to especially in the shower) but it functioned fine.  The room itself was very spacious.  Our balcony overlooked downtown Denver and was very pleasant.  The bed and pillows were comfortable.  Staff, at the desk were very helpful.  The rooftop pool is wonderful.  Unfortunately no jacuzzi although it looked like there was room for one.  The hotel is just a couple of blocks away from 16th street which has a free shuttle up and down it.  I truly enjoyed my stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Comfortable room -- surprise upgrade!,"The room was fantastic.  I was upgraded to a suite, which was a completely unexpected surprise.  The suite was probably bigger than my apartment.  The bed was unbelievably comfortable.  I only regret that I did not have time to enjoy it more, I was only there for one night.  Pity I also did not get to enjoy the rooftop pool.  Other contributors noted that the bedroom did not have a light switch near the doorway, which I too found odd, but I quickly found the light on the unit.  One thing I found annoying was that I could not turn off the light on the balcony, so I was forced to sleep with the drapes closed, which I prefer not to do.  Other than these minor annoyances, I really enjoyed my experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Treated like royalty,"Two night stay to visit family. From the time we entered the property we were treated like frequent visitors not first timers. As with life, all is not always smooth. We arrived very late in the evening (O dark Hundred). The key card would not let us enter the assigned room. I returned to the front desk and received another set. From the 11th floor I called to the desk when these would not work. The attendant personally came up, apologized and assisted us to another room.The in-house bar and restaurant were superb . Attentive staff and well presented food.All in all a great place to stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Rooftop Pool is a hidden gem! When renovations are complete, this will be a hands-down mind 5 star!","We stayed at the Warwick for the first night of our college moving-in trip for my younger daughter.  I was a bit skeptical due to some of the reviews, and also the amazing price I got for two rooms.  Wow, we had an amazing experience, and the staff went out of their way to provide top-notch service.  Upon arrival, I was startled to see that the (very nicely appointed!) lobby was packed, and was worried for a long check-in wait.  No worries, it was a large group, but they were very efficiently getting everyone checked-in, and it took no time at all.  We took the elevator up to our rooms, and seemed to somewhat dodge the much reported long wait.  Signs make it clear that the current renovations include the elevators, and will soon be speeding right along!We got a peed of the 4th floor when the doors opened, and the foyer looked beautiful, crips and clean.  When we got to our floor, the 9th, and stepped out, the foyer and hallway was old and clearly in need of renovation.  I worried that our rooms were not renovated.  But again, no worries!  We stepped into beautiful, modern, clean and crisp renovated rooms, with state of the art lighting and full amenities, including Kureig coffee (Yay!).  It was also clear (because we peeked through the ""fake"" door!) that the hallway in the opposite direction of our rooms was in the midst of renovation.  Soon, the rest of the hallways will be beautiful.  We ate dinner at the on-site restaurant, another beautifully appointed place with delicious food (service was a bit slow, however).The next day, we were lucky enough to be at the delightful roof-top pool to soak in some sun and watch the eclipse!  The pool itself is fairly small, but the views are wonderful, the furniture luxurious, and the staff (bar and snacks!!!) amazingly friendly and helpful.  Overall, a beautiful hotel that will be a solid 5 stars when renovations are complete (and they are very close!).  So, so glad we stayed here, and will definitely be back again!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Hotel Staff!  Meeting room temp a problem.,"The staff here was wonderful and I just returned from Disney and they still stood out.   Armondo was cleaning and telling me about the great facilities in the building.  Z at the pool bar was very helpful, accommodating, friendly and made sure we were taken care of.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Denver. The rooms are being remodeled and are really nice.  The elevators are being replaced and were slow but only because they were getting replaced. My only suggestion is if you are having a meeting here make sure you question the temp in the room right away.  The staff here is wonderful.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Front desk staff are really lovely,"The front desk staff were really lovely & welcoming. The bar staff & restaurant staff ,horrible & entitled attitudes .The hotel had a daily resort fee which included two drinks during happy hour. The staff were not on board with this promotion & it showed in the way they behaved . The room was huge & nice except very odd lighting & this auto bath room light switch that turned on when you went in.. I tried to turn the feature off but couldn't? . We wanted to use the bikes but there were no locks. The pool was nice & the guy running it upstairs super nice. Over all liked the neighbourhood & had a nice stay",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Downtown Denver!,"Great hotel within walking distance to downtown Denver's highlights, like the Capital building and 16th Street Mall.  From 16th Street you can hop on the free ""mall ride"" bus and take it to the end, and then walk to other attractions.  All in all a great location.  The hotel is being renovated, so the rooms are beautifully updated.  The rooftop terrace with heated pool is an absolute treat - especially at night.  I would have given this a rating of 5, but the valet was curt and did not seem to like his job - but the rest of the staff were very good, but since he's the first one we came across, I had to rate the hotel 4/5.  But, other than that, great stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Nice hotel, newly renovated rooms but read the fine print","2nd time staying, was upgraded to a newly renovated room.  Very nice room (only 1 mirror in the entire room - kind of odd), comfortable and clean.I thought i had booked a great deal but failed to read the fine print about the ""Urban Retreat Fee"".  Found out about this as I checked out and soured the entire visit.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Like it For What it Is,"The Warwick isn't the most glamorous place, and needs a little updating, but it's still a good place in Denver. For one, the location just off downtown and close to great restaurants in a residential are are perfect. The little patio off the restaurant is a treat. The elevators are a bit dank, but I think they're about to update them.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Fantastic, Ignore the Bad Reviews. Quality and Hospitality is Unreal","First of all, Arriving at the desk we were met by a Chap called Nick, This man needs a promotion, Raise and a Higher Job, every question or advice or even query was answer straight away. He was a good laugh and even though we were british HE GOT SARCASM! THANK GOD! (Americans dont tend to get Banter or Sarcasm) The Stay - We stayed on the 28th and 29th of June and the beds are so comfortable and big that with me and my Fiancee starfishing in the bed still couldnt touch each other, genuinely massive. The room and Bathrooms quality was fantastic quality, Poole on the Roof with the view of Denver and Rocky mountains?! are you kidding me? genuinely this hotel made our first 2 days in Denver Perfect and Wonderful. I would reccomend them to the High Heavens and a Special shout out to Nick for his fantastic work. PS DO NOT RENT THE BIKES IN TOWN - The Warwick have free bikes for you to use!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great place to stay,Very clean hotel.  Is old but has updates.   Bed was extremely comfy.  Rooftop pool was awesome.  All of the staff was friendly and helpful from the bellhops to the housekeeping staff to the bartender.  They all made you feel welcomed.  The only downside was the slow elevators but they were working on one while we were there so I am sure it isn't a problem any longer.  Close to 16th street mall and can walk,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Utterly Awful Experience for a Wedding,"We had my daughter's wedding and a follow-up brunch at the Warwick from July 22-23. There were only two elevators available, and Friday before the wedding, one went down. So people were waiting 20-30 minutes to get on the elevators - the poor staff didn't have their service elevators, so they couldn't do their jobs. Our brunch chef literally walked up and down 14 flights of stairs just to get the eggs for our event. The incompetence of senior management to solve the problem caused major inconvenience and embarassment. Do not recommend this hotel for any kind of event - if something goes wrong, the senior managers run and hide and leave the poor desk personnel to deal with the frustrations.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A wonderful pied-a terre in Denver~!,"A fabulous, low key hotel close to downtown Denver. Great facilities, very comfortable rooms, super swimming pool (and staff) , very welcoming, professional and friendly staff. A diverse group of guests while we were there - families, friends, colleagues - all were having a great time - not boisterous and respectful of other guests. All in all very welcoming and restful!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Only thing missing,"I love the Warwick Hotel.  However, there are no microwaves in the room, which I would have liked.  I don't always want to order a heavy meal and just want to warm something up.  I wish I could have done so.  No microwave forces one to order room service or go to the restaurant, and no one want to be forced to do this.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Ok hotel in Denver,"I stayed for 3 nights in a business trip. It has a good location and great service. I got a recently renovated room, it looked nice, but the carpet was wrinkled, and the bathroom door didn't close - it was bigger than the knocker. The bed was excellent, but the shower wasn't so nice - good water pressure, but hard to regulate temperature. Another down point is the cleaning, it isn't dirty to the point that it will make you disgusted to be there, but it isn't spotless as well. I found 2 beer bottle caps in my room, and the glass of the bathroom painting was dirty as well. The renovation is still ongoing, but I have to say that I spent the most of the days in the hotel and didn't hear anything. The only annoying thing is that the elevators are still being renovated, so they are very very slow.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Almost perfect, some growing pains, great restaurant, upgraded rooms are nice","I stayed here for a week fully well knowing they were in the midst of renovations and had slow elevators. When I was originally looking at the hotel, booking off their own website didn't even work. The 'Premier Suite' I was upgraded to includes a waived resort fee and breakfast daily. Don't be told otherwise. This waived fee and breakfast included caused some issues because a younger woman at the front desk assured me that my rate didn't include breakfast as the original room I booked didn't include it. She demanded an email showing I was entitled breakfast, which I let her know didn't exist, as I upgraded over the phone and was explained the features of the room. Begrudgingly she agreed to finally credit $25/day to my room for breakfast when I let her know I had a screenshot of their own website explaining the room's amenities if she wasn't up to date. Despite this first bump, things were brilliant. I was given 701, an 85% upgraded Premier Suite. I'm deducting 15% from the upgrades, as the bed was very old, only covered with a top-sheet, and really let the room down when they upgraded almost everything else. The bedroom also is pretty dark, you can see where they removed the light-switch and light that used to be in there. So you end up guessing where a tiny flip-switch is on a bedside lamp. Not sure the logic behind removing the bedroom light during the refurbs. I also expected a walk-in glass shower and upgraded bathroom per the website stock images of a Premier Suite, but it was only partially upgraded with a new vanity (picture included) but older tub. Despite the age of the tub, it felt like it was jet-powered, very good pressure - so I can't really complain, just expected a glass shower with some type of rainfall setup from the website pictures. The attached restaurant is a hidden gem in my opinion of this hotel. While breakfast was sub-par and service was slow, lunch and dinner were brilliant. George, the host went out of his way to greet me and everyone nightly, and was constantly running around assisting waiters. Nick was an amazing waiter as well. Overall, expect some wait time for the elevators. They have 3. The middle is currently down. The one on the right is the new high-speed elevator. It seems to almost compete with the older elevator which I think they borrowed from the 'Tower of Terror'. Some API or programming is making a long wait longer, as I actually heard the old elevator stop at my floor a few times with people on it.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Grand Old Dame,"Really nice classic hotel right in the middle of everything downtown DenverGREAT service staff, room was nice and clean. Bathroom was very spacious although it did not have a step in shower for accessibility as requested.Bar is a required stop as it is a real gem with great chatty bartender.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,balcony,"So if you get a room with a balcony- be aware that at least the 3rd floor ""view"" is of the parking lot and not of the city. The rooftop pool was closed the evening that we checked out for a special event. It didn't effect us but if we had stayed the second night- we would have been disappointed to not have access to it.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Thanks for the memories!,"Had a great time at this hotel transitioning from honeymoon to family vacation. We picked my stepkids up at the airport in Denver and chose to stay at the Warwick.The renovated rooms are gorgeous and contemporary. Everything was so clean!!! We really appreciated the service and care everyone took with us, especially Jason and George and the valet crew. Our camping plans made us a little high-maintenance in terms of vehicles and parking, but they accommodated like it was no big deal.I can't say enough about the treatment of the staff. Not only was everyone so helpful and accommodating, but they were so friendly about it too. That really goes a long way these days and we all appreciated it so much.Thanks for helping us create some wonderful and lifelong memories on our honeymoon/vacation adventure! We hope to stay with you again soon!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Better places to stay downtown,"This place is(in my opinion) incredibly over priced as it is severely understaffed and most of the staff they do have are very rude and have no business in the hospitality industry. First off the building looks very run down from the outside, we were surprised we were at the right hotel when we pulled up.They employ one valet/bellman (yes even during check in/out time) so be prepared to wait a long time to get your car as they only provide valet parking. We did book a renovated suite but as we arrived we realized the deck was not renovated and was just covered in tar paper (they did provide a small discount for this when I brought it up to the front desk.) and the door to the bedroom didn't even come close to closing.The pool water looked yellow and murky so we did not attempt to go in although the roof top deck is nice.Elevator was as every other review on here stated SO SLOW and super annoying as we had our baby and stroller so the stairs weren't really an option.The reason Im giving a 1 star and not a 3 star is due to the staff. No one was particularly friendly, the breakfast service was super slow, and upon checkout i was spoken to very rudely by the front desk girl Rhiannon when asking why they were charging me for breakfast when I was told it was included in the rate I agreed to. She was very condescending and had an incredible attitude that I was very surprised by as someone who should have at least some customer service skills. So all in all I would not recommend this place to anyone and I will never stay here again.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice downtown hotel with private balconies and walking distance to 16th street mall.,Stayed here for a girl's week and we chose this hotel because of its central location . We checked in and there was no available personnel to bring up our luggage so the front desk was just piling up everyone's luggage to the right of the desk area. We went to our room to check it out and were pleasantly surprised.  Everything was new and very clean. The balcony was a very nice feature and we enjoyed sitting out there in the evenings. We asked for a Keurig coffee pot to be brought to our room and after a few calls housekeeping found one and brought it to us and completely set it up.  Our maid service was outstanding.  The elevators were so slow but we realized that it was due to the on-going construction to remodel this hotel.  I think the old Warwick is going through some growing pains but is still a really cool place to stay.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice room in the heart of downtown Denver,"Whenever I need to stay in downtown Denver I keep coming back to this room. I get the king size bed and it is huge. A large tv is mounted to the wall, a desk is underneath the tv. 2 nightstands, drawers under a kitchen area and a walk in closet with a robe. The bathroom has everything you need and is the perfect size for a single or double traveler. I've really enjoyed the set up of this room and the comfort it brings. The only real complaint I have is that the fridge is always stocked with sodas and waters so not a lot of room to store my stuff that I bring but I've always managed. For a fee you can add in valet parking which I recommend. Parking is available for free overnight on the street but you have to off the street by 8am or you have to pay. The valet parking is easy and takes care of the street parking limitations. You can get everywhere you need easily from this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Renovated rooms are beautiful ,We had a renovated room which was spotless and comfortable. There was a small balcony which was a nice addition even though the view wasn't great. The pool area was nice with a bar that served good drinks. The slow elevator was the only negative.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great comfortable beds.,This is a old property that is being renovated.  Be patient with the elevators.  Staff is helpful.  Actually pretty decent TV channel selection.  No parking except on street.  Big room.  No closet.  Big bathroom.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Comfort, Service and Location","The Warwick is a special place, deemed with history and catering to those that value service and comfort over low prices.   The rates were reasonable for sure, but that is not why you stay here.  As many travelers know, it's how a place makes you feel that is important.The Warwick makes you feel like your on vacation, and not just staying in a room.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Ask for a Renovated Room,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel.  I made my reservations directly through the hotel and requested a renovated room. The king room was huge with a walk in closet, large desk, immaculate bathroom and a balcony overlooking the city. All my sleeping priorities were met; quiet, cool and dark. The staff were professional and friendly and genuinely seemed to care about our satisfaction. Ask about their breakfast special. We received a $25 credit per person per day.  It was very relaxing having breakfast on the outdoor patio. They also have a happy hour each day.  Lunch at Stuebens, a neighborhood favorite around the corner on 17th St , was excellent. As previous reviewers have mentioned there is an issue with the slowness of the elevators due to their renovation. We realized this and didn't let it bother us.  You can use the stairs and get some exercise!We would not hesitate to stay here again",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Worst Experience,"DO NOT STAY HERE!My friend and I waited close to 4 hours for a room. Mike at the front desk was truly horrible. They gave us drink coupons, but neither one of us drinks. The wifi doesn't work. Our room was never cleaned today. Only one of your elevators is working, but it is still randomly dropping in places. It is scary. For the price, this is absurd and the staff is unprofessional. I asked to see a manager yesterday, but Mike never called one, even though he promised that he would twice. Warwick's incompetence ruined our plans last night and has had a negative impact on our trip. This experience is inexcusable.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great stay at Warwick,"Great stay at Warwick ,wonderful personnel nice location very helpful staff and roof top pool was awesome.  Great food at the restaurant and bar nice view front balcony very affordable for location and amenities.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Rooftop Pool and Staff Is Amazing!,"My experience with this hotel was great! Loved everything about it, even the price :) The location is great, we walked to and from the hotel to the Rockies game for the 4th of July! Definitely will be going back.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Hotel a bit overwhelmed - tips to know before you go,"The Warwick Denver seems to be overwhelmed right now.  I've stayed in three different rooms over four nights in the last week (broken up by travel around Colorado).  Some of their rooms are renovated, airy, bright, lovely.  Some are not.  One of the three elevators has not been working in the past week, and that brings the hotel to a near standstill for most of the day.  The roof deck pool is a lovely space, but they have not filtered or cleaned the pool since I've been here, and it was murky when I arrived.  They were out of towels at the pool level, and one didn't dare go back to one's room to get a towel for fear that it would take 20-30 minutes with the wait for the elevator. The roof deck bar is also a great feature, but perhaps because of the elevator issues, rarely had supplies to make drinks and food ordered took a long time to arrive.  They appear to be renovating, and I trust it will be much nicer in the future, but a few tips if you plan to travel here soon:1. Call ahead and confirm that the room you are booking is on a renovated floor.  Do not bother with the unrenovated rooms, they are a major step down.2. BEWARE THE SUITES -- these appear to all be unrenovated, and that is not clear when you pay extra for a suite.  The bed is in a separate room, but it is a tiny dark room.  The common space has the floor to ceiling windows opening onto a balcony, but the feeling with low ceilings and outdated furniture, it still feels much darker than the renovated rooms.2a. The suites do not have the jetted tubs described on the website, apparently except the presidential suite.3. Ask if the third elevator is working.  Otherwise if it's a busy time when you'll be here, I'd wait to visit until it is.4.  Bring a towel to the pool deck just in case.5.  Ask if they've filtered the pool before you come if you'd like to swim.6. Don't expect satisfying answers to service-related questions.  The staff is kind and gracious, but don't seem very adept at solving problems for their guests.Pros1. The renovated rooms are quite lovely and spacious2. The restaurant, Randolph's, was solid -- nice outdoor patio space, good waitstaff, and the dinner I ordered was delish.3. They gave me a code for free wifi at each checkin.4. The staff is mostly very kind and gracious.  There were a few exceptions, but I'd chalk that up to a staff that is frustrated by not being able to do their jobs effectively with the elevator out.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,OK ,"I wanted to really like this hotel, but it fell down on various fronts.  They had rude breakfast waiters so I did not return for breakfast after the first morning. My first room was so poorly sound insulated that you could hear what the people next door were talking, although they efficiently changed my room.  They were renovating the elevators which meant you were often waiting for 5 mins +Great happy hour",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Charming,"Really liked this hotel. They are in the middle of renovations, and elevators weren't working properly. However, in bad situations, you can get a good read on the quality of the staff. Staff was very, very accommodating. Everyone tried so hard to make the stay comfortable in spite of some very frustrated travelers. Hotel housekeeping was fantastic. A smile for everyone. Every staff I walked by asked how my stay was going. They were so pleasant, and one could feel the strain of these hard working individuals as they tried to get from floor to floor with packed elevators. If it weren't for the renovations, my stay would have been the best experience this year. All rooms were very nice - renovated or not! Rooms facing Grant St, if you look left, one can see the Rockies. Great location. Close to shopping and restaurants. Denver having a bit of a homeless issue, so when going shopping, I'd go and stay with a friend/group. One fault - Restaurant was expensive and not a diverse menu. But 16th street was packed with good restaurants, so no worries.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,My room was beautiful!,"I got in late so was granted an upgrade from a standard room.  I got a suite with a living room that was separate from the bedroom. It had it's own walk in closet (though not near the same room as the bedroom?) and the bathroom was all on its own.  It had a very nice balcony that had been redone that was nice to sit out on at night and watch the buildings and traffic as it went by.  Did have one beautiful night with a sunset and a little lightening light display.  Since they are in a renovation, the elevators were kinda wonky.  At times only one worked and my worst nightmare came true of being stuck on an elevator!  Got on my floor 7th to go down to meet freinds.  Elevator didn't move.  Was on elevator with 2 employees, we tried using the in car phone, that didn't seem to be working.  One of the employees had her cell and the front desk number, and we managed to talk to them.  It was really only about 10 minutes of being stuck, but it's a bit of an uneasy feeling.  Found out I wasn't the only one of my company that was there that as stuck (one being a 6 months pregnant momma).  It was just a walk to downtown or nearby to any eating or drinking establishment you could want.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The renovation is beautiful,"We spent a night at the Warwick and it was enjoyable. While the hotel is not right downtown, it is convenient to most locations. The 16th street mall is within walking distance without all of the noise and commotion. We visited the rooftop pool, but it was too cold to get in the water. There is not a hot tub, which seems to be a missed opportunity. The renovated rooms are beautiful and clean. The elevators are currently being refinished, so 1 was down during our visit.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great hotel,"Stayed for two nights on journey across America. Great hotel, large and spacious rooms, just off 17th street and Grant so a 25 minute walk from downtown but you can walk a couple of blocks and catch free bus to anywhere downtown. Drinks reasonably priced we didn't eat here so can't comment on food. Lots of cafes, takeaways etc nearby. A really comfy great standard hotel with very helpful and friendly staff,",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Pleasant experience,"Friendly staff, Checking in and out was simple,The location is great, close to many spots downtown. The service was great and the hotel was very clean and professional looking.Great for spending a weekend in Denver :)",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Cute Hotel!,I really enjoyed the stay here. Was clean and comfortable and the gym has a nice view of the city. The room had its own balcony and staff was nice. We also had breakfast at their restaurant and it was very good.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Conference,Stayed for a week in June. The accommodations were outstanding. The room was spacious with a walk in shower !! The bed was so very comfortable. They even gave you pillow choices on the bed. Nothing like a down pillow. The food was outstanding as well. The bartender was friendly and attentive. I would highly recommend this well established hotel to any visitor.  They are in a remodel phase but it was not a problem at all. Very convenient location as well.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Terrible Experience,Didn't get the two beds we requested. Manager was not helpful and we ended up with a broken down roll out bed. It had mold and was swaybacked. We left after one night of the three we had booked. The manager did waive the early departure fee. They told me the reason we didn't get the requested room was we booked through a third party (Booking.com). The water in the shower had to be turned all the way to hot to be usable.Only positive thing we experienced was the rooftop pool.This hotel is way to expensive to treat guests this way.,2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Lots of little issues, BUT ...","Room issues, upgrading the building, miscommunication BUT so many staff were so interested in making it right, they really cared!  Wanted to specifically mention the manager Nick, at the front desk. He was so professional, knowledgeable, calm, and handled my questions and solved the problems. What a difference that makes!  I'll be back to Denver and will rebook here again. Thanks so much to Nick!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Slow Service in Every Area,"The roof pool is a nice idea but is is so shallow and short in length that swimming is impossible - merely a dip when too hot.  The restaurant food is over-priced and not exceptional.  The breakfast buffet is actually very nice, but the servers are absent or glacially slow. The check-in and check-out lines were amazingly long and the processing slow at the desk. There are better places to stay in downtown Denver.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Location and Property,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Warwick. The location is within walking distance of 16th street mall, art museum, history museum and many other attractions as well as food options but is still in a very calm and quiet street / block.  I believe they just completed a major renovation and it really shows.  The lobby area is beautiful and inviting.  Our room was really over the top with a nice balcony and updated ""everything"".  I believe we had a Mile High Suite which was so spacious it seemed like we were renting an apartment - a super CLEAN apartment.The rooftop pool was beautiful and refreshing.  The only ""hiccup"" we encountered was with the bartender at the rooftop pool that challenged our use of vouchers even though we didn't even use them there.  We paid cash for the drinks.  He was probably just having a bad day.All other staff members were amazingly attentive and customer service oriented.  We travel to Denver area several times a year and have historically stayed at another property.  However, on a go forward basis, I think the Warwick will be our first choice. Thanks to the hotel staff for all of their efforts.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not impressed,Started off with a bad taste in my mouth from the check in experience with a rude lady. To the elevators going extremely slow and one being out of order. To the bad service at the restaurant attached.,2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice hotel in downtown Denver,Was booked for location to conference I was attending. Hotel is walking distance to food and shops. Lovely room. Very comfortable bed. Nice balcony. Room service was prompt and delicious. Clean and good-sized bathroom.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Service, Above and Beyond","I had the extreme pleasure of staying for a night at this hotel as my daughter and I made our way back cross-country to our home back east.  I had booked the room through Booking.com, but when I went to check-in, it was apparent that they had dropped the ball in communicating that reservation to the hotel.  Nonetheless, an extraordinarily helpful young man  was able to set us up with an upgraded room.  Having just spent 9 hours in a car on this leg of the trip, you can imagine how grateful/relieved I was to encounter someone who transformed a glitch into a benefit.  	He was also able to suggest places to dine within walking distance, and in that regard, his recommendation was spot-on.  Further, I found the facility to be very tastefully decorated and immaculately maintained.  Every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful..I had never stayed at a Warwick before, but hereafter, when the opportunity presents itself, it will be my preferred option.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Memorial Day weekend getaway,"What a delightful experience! We were graciously greeted by all employees and called by our name each day. Attention to detail from arrival, stay, and through departure were true perfection. The elegant bar and restaurant served top notch offerings that not only executed presentation; but, excited the palette.  Raoul makes a delicious Side Car! The room was spacious, clean, and modern with an incredible view. The heated pool on the Penthouse floor was modern with a view of the snow capped mountains!  We watched the sunset rooftop!!! Gentle pictorial reminders of the days gone by when the Warwick housed the Playboy Bunny Club back in 60's and 70's were innocuously displayed and brought the history of the hotel to life. I would certainly recommend this hotel and upon my next visit will be the one of choice.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very impressed ,"We stayed on the 14th floor, the room was large and very comfortable. Huge bed and couch. The bathroom had a bath and shower and plenty of space. The balcony had great city views however, despite there being a no smoking policy, We found a can with cigarette butts on a table outside. We told staff and they apologised and cleaned it immediately. The valet parking is very expensive however there is a car park right next door that costs just $18 for the whole night. The bar there has a happy hour with a good selection of local beers however I wouldn't recommend the cocktails. The hotel is in uptown which has bars and restaurants as well as grocery and liquor stores.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Lovely hotel with spacious rooms, friendly and helpful staff, walkable to many great eating and shopping options.","We spent 7 nights at the Warwick Denver in late May. We had a king room. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of our room and bathroom. There was a large closet, with plenty of room to store both suitcases, coats, etc with space left over. There were 2 drawers for clothes in the room. This was enough room for our clothes. We only had a couple problems with the room. The doors to the rooms slam heavily if you let them, and the walls are thin enough to hear people in the hallways. At night we ran the bathroom fan to cover the noise, that worked pretty well. The other problem (for us) was the bed and pillows were too soft. We both have ""iffy"" backs, and need support. By the 3rd morning we were both stiff and sore. We requested firmer pillows, but all we got were more soft pillows. The hotel is between 18th and 17th streets. The next 3 blocks are full of restaurants and shopping. 17th street is mostly restaurants. (We ate at Steuben's 3 times, by the way. It's a 5 minute walk from the hotel.) Then 16th Street is full of shopping and restaurants. A couple blocks down the street is closed to traffic and it becomes The 16th Street Mall. It's a nice way to spend an afternoon/evening walking and shopping. The next block after 16th is Colfax. That also had many restaurants (we LOVED Sasafrass for breakfast! Check it out!) and stores. There were always Uber and Lyft cars in the area. Whenever we wanted to go somewhere that was too far to walk, we never had to wait long for a car. We would definitely stay here again. It is nice, clean, and convenient to all sorts of Denver attractions.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Renovated Rooms Are Beautiful; Great Value During Renovation!,"The Warwick is undergoing renovations which mean there can be some issues. For example, when we arrived, only one elevator was working and the wait was a bit long. After that one incident, however, there were 2 elevators (of the 3) working and we didn't have any delays. Because of the renovations, the hotel has been offering some great deals. The room rates are lower, and they're offering either free breakfast or parking. Also, we specifically requested a renovated room, and I think we were the first ones to stay in our room (608). It was all updated and everything looked brand new. The bed was great, desk has a nice workspace, large bathroom with a tub, and a very big balcony looking east (not toward the mountains-if you want that you need to look west and be on a higher floor, maybe the 8th or 10th or higher). The location is good to very good. Just a short walk (about 4 blocks) to the 6th street mall where there are shops and restaurant, and also about 4 blocks from the state capital. The staff were all pleasant and helpful. They had a good attitude about the renovation (which is probably harder on them then the guests). The valet was quick both getting the car and taking it.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great hotel,"Perfect place close to downtown Denver..I love the hotel. It is dog friendly, great lobby bar with excellent service.Happy hour from 5-7pmBig rooms, great pillows, huge flat screenQuiet!All perfect, friendly staff",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice business hotel,"It's a typical American city hotel. Looks like a normal building. The lobby and the staff is very nice and helpful.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Ongoing billing issue,"This hotel is nice and I stay in this area frequently but the check-in representative was not nice and didn't mention any amenities or any of the incidental or additional fees. The room was fine, but our mini bar was empty and turned off, yet I was charged over $100 in separate ""mini bar charges"" that still have not been cleared. Management has not been good to work with and they took three days to get back in touch with me. I've spent almost a week now trying to resolve the billing issue and it's been more of a hassle than the night away was worth. Really disappointed in this experience.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A Breath of Fresh Air,"This boutique hotel in the heart of downtown Denver is a breath of freshness in a sea of franchise hotels. The staff is just amazing. The room was spacious and nicely furnished without being overdone. The hotel reminded me of the great boutique hotels of Europe. The room even had a large balcony. What a surprise. Being situated just a few blocks from the Mall, restaurants, and everything downtown makes this my goto hotel in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Too much road noise ordinary rooms,"Looked good from the outside, then went down hill. Our room on the 3rd floor had so much traffic noise and people noise in the corridor, sounded like the walls were made of paper, after 2 nights here couldn't wait to leave.the elevators were extremely poor and slow. Our rooms sliding door to the balcony didn't even have a lock on it,notified staff and they fixed it the same day. Room service didn't clean our room after the first night, very poor service. Bed only just ok. Pool closed a week before summer starts not very good.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Watch out for overcharges,"Bathroom door would not close or lock, leak above the bath/shower with peeling, warped paint, and the the final insult is that I was charged for Valet parking to the tune of $37 per day and I never used valet parking.  When I called them, the said they would credit the account, but I never got an updated receipt and still have not seen a credit on my credit card.  This is a complete pain.  I will probably have to call them again and/or dispute the charge on my credit card.  Go to the Brown Hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Renovation Glitches,"Stayed May 16, 17, 18...in a renovated room on the 7th floor after being relocated from an older room on the 14th or 15th floor that was in need of repair. The renovated room itself was very large and comfortable but the pool was closed; most of the time only 1 of 3 elevators was working causing a lot of wait time when needing to get somewhere, not to mention a very crowded elevator. We were given a $30 refund for inconvenience. I think this will be a nice hotel once renovations are complete but the cost of the stay this time was disappointing based on the inconveniences.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Elegant hotel awsome rooms,When you enter the Warwick hotel you feel a relaxed ambiance come over you. The furniture in the lobby is an older style with class. The suites are huge and over the top. It has a bathroom with a shower/tub combo plus a seperate shower room all by itself. King bed and 2 flat acreen tv's. Great place to stay 5 stars!!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Lovely property, nice staff, quality restaurant, but shortcomings, too","Historic hotel being updated, but not interfering with one's stay.  Attractive rooms.  High end restaurant.  But, despite being told otherwise before stay, pool not functional.  Nice small gym.  No staff could get wifi to work, yet apparently billed for it.  No itemized statement, just odd small additional charge on my credit card after my stay.  Staff very polite and helpful to their abilities (not to expect technology savvy).  Pricy.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,DO NOT STAY HERE,"elevators broken had to climb 13 flights with my kid, wife and bags. old incorrect menus in room. breakfast buffett terrible. Had more comfortable beds in jail. The room is outdated and does not look like the website. Valet was rude. Internet did not work. Warwick hotels should be embarrassed",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Okay- scary neighborhood,"Very classy hotel, beautiful. Balcony overlooked parking lot and street, had to valet park, asked about pool and could not get information. Closed or not??? Scary walk in evening to dinner with many homeless people. Staff was nice. Cold shower and refrigerator that did not work. Food went to waste.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Ok,Stayed in a non- refurbished room. Room was a generous sized suite. Lobby is nice and has a fireplace. Parking is far too expensive. Hotel is in quieter area near fun restaurants on 17th and within easy walking distance to downtown.There was a long balcony but the carpet on the balcony was not in good shape and was a trip hazard.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Typical ""higher end"" hotel gouging","Clean- yes. Roomy- yes. But mandatory valet parking for $37 a day? Come on. And the mini-fridge jammed full of hotel's soda and water they hope you'll be foolish enough to buy to the point where I couldn't put any of my own food/drink in there. Room littered with other overpriced snacks. And, OBTW- pool's closed- no discount for that either. For some reason, every other review talks about complimentary breakfast. We were told explicitly ""that's not included"" for us. One of three elevators working. Horrible, horrible WiFi captive portal. Not a terrible place, but all show and less go in my opinion.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Lovely hotel,"I had one of the refurbished rooms and it was very comfortable.  One issue is they charged 65 bucks a night for incidentals, which I think is an exorbitant amount! However, when I spoke to a manager, he was able to reverse some of the charges, so thank you for that. The gym is awesome, but the pool was closed for repairs.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great place to stay ,I recently stayed at the Warwick when I came to Denver to visit my sons. My room was exceptionally clean and to my amazement was also very quiet. The staff is friendly and professional.  The hotel is centrally located to downtown Denver.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Welcoming, efficient, roomy","Stayed here for work, and it was a good experience from start to finish. Really nice helpful staff, roomy rooms with all you need, and more, provided. Restaurant and bar more than adequate. No complaints whatsoever!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Beautiful, modern room decor.  Good location","This hotel is beautifully decorated with modern decor.  Everything feels and  smells brand new. The room has a balcony as well so you can enjoy some time out there relaxing or just look at the city. This hotel has a great location to the city!  It is only about 4 block walk to free shuttle to downtown action which includes shops, restaurants and more.   The staff at Warwick is very professional though not warm.  They project a professionalism I would associate with a  high end hotel.   Parking is done by valet so when you drop off or get your car their assistance is needed.  When we were leaving the hotel my husband had a problem getting a cart to carry down our belongings.  They seem to be in short supply.  The Warwick might need to get more carts or follow their policy that valet needs to accompany cart at all times rather than leaving carts with people in their rooms. In the end it worked out and he got a cart and we were able to leave without multiple trips up and down.    There is a lovely, high end restaurant attached to hotel.  Beautiful bar and wonderful breakfast buffet on the weekends.  But that is a different review. They also have a nice workout room on the upper floor.  You can look at downtown Denver as you exercise.  Pretty cool.  I don't think you would be disappointed staying at this beautiful hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,They kept taking my towels and throwing my food away,"Stayed here because a conference I attended selected it.Room was spacious. Mini-fridge smelled foul & didn't cool adequately. Power outlet was literally falling out of electrical box. Mirror was cracked. Lights in bathroom impressively crooked. Elevators were quite slow (3 minutes is a pretty long wait for an elevator). Dishes at the restaurant weren't all clean.Housekeeping kept taking away towels I'd hung up & replacing them with fewer (2 adults + 1 kid = 3 towels). Several of the multiple times I called asking for an extra towel for my kid, the housekeeping staff was surly. They also threw my food away.Overall, an unpleasant experience that I wouldn't recommend to others.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very nice stay.....but,"This was a beautiful hotel located within walking distance of everything we wanted to do. We got one of the refurbished rooms. All the rooms have a balcony which was very nice and we enjoyed watching the clouds go by drinking a glass of wine one night. A great feature of the room was a huge closet that we could put all our luggage in so we weren't tripping over it on the floor. We also found robes in there which were really nice. Breakfast was included and it was a very nice buffet. Very good food. The ""but"" comes from 2 issues. We were notified that the pool would not be open during our stay which was a bummer because I picked this hotel particularly because of the roof top pool. When I mentioned this at check in, the gal said ""Well we can cancel your reservation."" I did not think that was very good customer service. She also did not mention our breakfast and when I went down later and asked the same person the hours she told us the wrong times and we ended showing 2 minutes before it was done instead having an additional half hour like she told us. Besides these couple of issues, it is a very nice hotel and we enjoyed our stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,SPACIOUS & COMFORTABLE ROOMS,The recently renovated guest rooms are fabulous!  Much more spacious than many of the luxury hotels I have stayed at in Denver.  Parking is also convenient and very available.  The staff is very friendly and extremely professional.  Excellent fitness center accessible 24 hours a day!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Well placed,"This hotel is centrally placed with high quality rooms, a good bar and restaurant and attentive staff. The bar meals are good value as is the breakfast buffet.  The rooms are large, very clean and some with balconies. There is a handy 7-11 close by and you are within walking distance of 16th and the State Capital building.",4

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wow! What Service!,"I love the Warwick! I asked if I could stay on a high floor, East facing room because I love the sunrise in Denver. To accommodate me, I was upgraded to a Queen corner suite, on the 12th floor, facing East. Wow! I also left my key in my room one night, and was locked out. When returning to the hotel nearly midnight, the front desk guys (Chason and Terren) were so sweet and made it so easy. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Warwick. Great area in Denver that made me feel comfortable to walk around, even though I was by myself. The bartender at Randolph's bar (name Sean or Adam?) in the hotel remembered my favorite drink and when I sat down he immediately had a delicious glass of Prosecco in front of me. I thought this was wonderful, although now that I'm typing it... maybe it's not a good thing that he remembered me and my drink... lol. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Generous Standard Room,"On first impression, we were very satisfied with our large Standard Room! We even decided to extend our stay one additional night. It’s location meant an easy walk to the 16th Street Mall and the free shuttle transit towards Coors Field. My husband and I have premium memberships to CorePower Yoga and OrangeTheory Fitness (from our home city) and thus, staying at this Warwick also made for an easy walk to both local branches of these fitness venues nearby. We had originally booked the “Breakfast on us!” package and for the most part, did not disappoint for its great value! My rating here reflects this. I also want to acknowledge Jacob for being accommodating and correcting errors on my bill. However, there is also room for more hospitality training……… Despite no door tag prohibiting entry, housekeeping did not come to service our room until about 6PM, after we called the front desk. And even then, only the bed was made and the bathroom neaten up. That was it. They took away one of the used glass in the bathroom and left the remaining one—when there were two of us. There was no replenishment of glasses, towels and or the Keurig cups already used that morning. We were left with about a quarter of a roll of toilet paper, with no additional stock. One morning, we had a very kind, very personable waiter at Randolph’s, but the following morning, encountered cold, indifferent service from another. When departing for the airport at just before 4AM, my “Good Morning!” to the man at the front desk was met with him replying without even looking up from what he had been looking down at. This is not acceptable in an industry that depends on customer loyalty and customers valuing excellent customer service. A below average rating is warranted for all that was experienced in this second paragraph.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very nice hotel,"Very nice hotel with friendly and accommodating staff.  Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.  Lots of lighting and outlets with convenient USB ports.  Staff went out of their way to help me print a report for a meeting within a few hours.  Will definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Under construction ,Definitely would have been nice to know that the hotel was under construction prior to booking. Rooms were dated and old. Listed as a boutique hotel without the boutique feel. $37 a night to park your car is a little ridiculous along with the $4 coffee. The bartender at night was not very personable and not attentive at all .  On the positive side the breakfast was really good and plentiful. A little pricey but worth it. Didn't do the buffet as it didn't seem worth it unless you want a variety.  In walking distance to the 16th pedestrian mall which was nice.   they need more heaters outside so you can enjoy being outdoors. A fire pit outside world also be very welcoming. We liked the area and hope that when they do the renovation it becomes the boutique hotel it says it is.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great stay at the Warwick Denver!,"Spent couple of nights at the Warwick whilst visiting Denver.  The hotel was very nice, the rooms tidy and quite big. Staff was nice and helpful. Excellent breakfast. Overall a good stay! Good location.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,great location but a little tired,Been staying here for years.  Great location and walkability.  Decent property but a little tired.  Superior staff makes up for it.  I'll be back and won't stop staying there. Been staying there since 1987!,3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick was Wonderful!,"I was needing to make last minute plans to stay one night somewhere in Denver.  I didn't have a lot of time to make these arrangements, and I've stayed many places in downtown Denver.  I wanted something different, and this place was exactly what I was looking for.  From the initial walk through the door to the front desk, it smelled so lovely and it was beautifully appointed and sleek and clean!  The front desk gentleman was so friendly and accommodating to our every request.  We even got two free drink tickets to use at their beautiful restaurant/bar.The room was very clean, and we had a lovely view of downtown Denver from our very large balcony. The restroom was huge and again, very clean.The whole vibe of this hotel is like old-school elegance.  You feel very special as if you were someone famous in these surroundings.  Although, it did not cost an arm and a leg to stay at this beauty.  It's still cold outside, so we didn't get to use all the amenities, but the outdoor patio looked spectacular and I look forward to staying at the Warwick again this summer.  I couldn't be happier with the experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Mrs. D,I would highly recommend the Warwick hotel. In a safe neighborhood conveniently located to downtown. The staff was extremely helpful and very polite. We stayed in the newly renovated room that was exceptional.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Best Hotel Experience,"We were in Denver for one night and it was a pleasure staying at the Warwick, I wish we could have stayed longer. The staff was welcoming and friendly. Our room was very clean and we had a great view and balcony.  The location was great (close to restaurants, bars, bank and market).  We would absolutely stay here again without hesitation!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great!,"I will be back. I enjoyed every minute of my stay! The rooftop pool was beautiful. They are renovating and our room was not renovated yet, but it was still very clean and comfortable. I love the balcony and the view.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Ok hotel - nothing special,I believe they are about to start refurbishments. It is time as the hotel and the rooms are outdated. Quality price ratio is way off. The hotel is about 15 minutes walking distance of major shopping and fine dining area.,3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wonderful experience in a unique hotel in a fantastic location,I scout and review hotels for a living and know a good place when I see it.  I LOVE this hotel and the staff.  They are in the middle of renovations and it'll be even better.  The staff is helpful and friendly and everyone seems happy and proud to work there.  Be sure to go to Randolphs for dinner and drinks and definitely go to the rooftop pool bar - the only one in downtown Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice hotel,"We were here for one night only when staying in Denver after a trip to Vail and Boulder. The location was not as central as we thought, but the hotel itself was nice enough. Our friend mentioned that his, unrefurbished room, gave him the creeps a bit, but they are in the process ofrefurbishing all rooms. Ours was lovely, and massive! There was even a small room off the main room. I would turn that into a reading nook with a small sofa and a small side table maybe. It now sat empty which gave it a bit of an odd feeling. Bathroom was lovely with marble vanity and bath. The bed was also very comfortable. 16th street market is near, but you walk through parts that at night feel a bit off the beaten path and tends to attract groups hanging round. However, there are also B Bikes…",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fabulous Time!,"We had a great stay at the Warwick. Staff were all so very friendly! Everyone from valet, to front desk, to housekeepers we saw. We booked a Colorado Suite, the ones with the street view were not ready as we arrived before check in, so we opted for the other view which was still amazing! The suite was very spacious. The decorations, decor and furniture were fine and updated. The carpet looked brand new.   They are working on remodeling so all the other complaints are being taken care of. Renovating a hotel of that size is not that easy.I do think the patio carpet needs a little pick me up, since it is coming up and stained.   It was also such a heart warming experience to come back for the evening and find a bottle of champagne and sweet card congratulating us on our…",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great location and room size ,"Very nice hotel, stayed on two occasions both rooms very spacious and clean. Regular rooms are good sized, Colorado suite very spacious with great balcony.small entrance to hotel and tight hallways so don't be fooled. ",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,FACE LIFT TIME,"The lobby is lovely but it was evident our room needed a facelift.  We got a deal through Trivago so we weren't complaining.  Huge bathroom, old furniture, very comfortable bed.  Three floors were being renovated so I was happy to see they were on top of it.  Pool is on top outdoor floor with great views of the city!",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Big Disappointment,I booked the hotel using Groupon three months in advance.  Thankfully I called the morning of check-in to make sure our reservation was still set and was told they didn't have one for us.  After searching they found it was missed and didn't get input into their system.  The hotel was run down and outdated and there was a hole in our room where a picture may have hung but there were exposed wires.  If more care was provided to the state of the rooms and the elevators it wouldn't have been too bad.  Price was just too much for this hotel.,2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,First time to Denver,"In my first time to Denver my company booked me into the Warwick and it was a great hotel. I got in about 5pm, just in time for a wine tasting for happy hour, and check-in was very easy. The atmosphere was filled of those who were in business and very quiet, conversations were held by the fireplace and a nice lobby area. After checking in I proceeded to eat in one of the many restaurants just around the corner on 17th street and was pleased with the assortment of places to eat. My room was large, lots of refreshments for sale, and everything was functional. The bed was the best part after traveling all day and very clean and comfortable. The next morning my co-worker and I had breakfast in the only restaurant of the hotel, it was good, but service was slow. It took awhile to get coffee, but otherwise our food was good and hit. Breakfast for two was $48 and included omelette, French toast, fruit, sausage, OJ, and coffee. I would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fantastic Hotel,"I stay in a lot of hotels, and I thought the Warwick was tops.  From check-in to check-out they made you feel like a guest in their home.  The room was great and even had a view.  The devil is in the details and the Warwick was on top of the little things that you notice when you travel a lot.  Very nice!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,WOW great,"Warwick Denver, It is really super nice. We are enjoying the wine and cheese gathering in the lobby tonight. What a great way to spend a Sunday evening.  I love the Warwick Denver.  Great location. Very clean and welcoming.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Short stay,"No parking, had a suite but it didn't seem like a suite. Just a room n a living room, no kitchen area. Had a mini fridge but not even a microwave. Balcony had carpeting that was coming off. Idk I just expected more. Probably wouldn't stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Overnight staff unprofessional and unresponsive,"The pool was closed - without notice, even when we asked the boy at the desk said that it was just closed for the night - so we were pretty disappointed when we woke up early to a construction site.  The very young and unpolished gentleman running the front desk overnight seemed to have his friends showing up - and ignored us for about 10 minutes while he was chit-chatting, then finally acknowledged us and said that he would bring what we needed to our room (s) - never followed up or showed.  Balcony unusable. Restaurant closed WAY too early, and stopped serving a true brunch - the bartender was attentive and the food smelled good. The Gym was nice.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Plenty of night life near by. Live music ,bars , pizza, subs, grocery. 16th st mall 10 minute walk","Large rooms, all with balconies clean and comfortable, maybe the largest rooms in Denver. Staff is accommodating, kitchen closes a bit too early for me, but many places to dine within walking distance and live music almost every night at near by venues.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Terrible Experience,"Guess what everyone? The POOL IS CLOSED. Don't worry, I will inform everyone since these guys can't update their website. You can't be that lazy...can you? This is why I stayed here, and it's 70 degrees today. Management has ""no idea"" when it will reopen. Doesn't really matter because I'm not coming back. p.s. The room looks brand new...if Reagan was still in office",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Quiet Shelter from the Chaos,"I stayed at this hotel during a conference in Denver and it served its purpose but by no means is it spectacular. I had a friend ask if she could stay with me and she would be arriving before I did. I sent the hotel an authorization form requesting they let her check in with my credit card that they had on file, which they graciously did with no problems. However, I had also asked to switch my reservation to two queens beds, which they said over phone would not be a problem,  and what they gave us was a king bed with a couch in the other room that has a pull out bed which was not set up with linens. I arrived to find my poor jet lagged bestie curled up using just the extra blanket she had scavenged from the closet because she did want to take the king bed. During the course of our stay I asked twice, reception and house keeping, to make up the bed with proper linens and pillows and it was never done. If you are not sharing the room with someone you actually like, the king bed was very comfortable and the room was nice. There is a restaurant downstairs which is great to work in, but I think they keep their wine open a little too long. I had to send my wine back because it tasted a little off, and exchange it for a class of Prosecco which has bubbles so I knew it was not stale.The server was super nice and was happy to make the exchange.  The robes are super comfortable and I lingered in bed and ordered breakfast with room service, and that was yummy,  definitely felt like I had earned a lazy morning. I never did make it up to the pool but I bet it would be good based on the photos I have seen online. Overall,a nice hotel with bare bones customer service, centrally located, with a quiet comfortable ambiance and a cozy king bed and plush bathrobes.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great weekend!,"Stayed at this hotel over the past weekend.  Upon arriving on a Friday evening we walked in just in time for a ""wine happy hour"" a warm fire burning in the fireplace and smiling faces greeted us at the front desk.  Our entire weekend at the Warwick was just lovely!  Restaurant food and staff were wonderful.  Will stay again and recommend to others.  Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Love this hotel,This hotel is absolutely beautiful inside. The rooms are a mix of classic vintage and modern sleek. The room was large with a balcony that provided a lovely view of the city. I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a downtown hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Fine slightly upscale but a bit tired decor, just in the edge of town","We had three nights in Denver and found many good places to eat and shop near. Liked The Standard Diner. Rooms had back decks facing parking lot.  Elevators were weird. Room was clean and lobby pleasant. The rooftop pool was small and we didn't have time to use it, but it is there and there is a nice view.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Exceptional Service,"The staff went above and beyond during our stay. They were a perfect combination of professionalism, friendliness, calm, and helpful. From the ambiance of the entry way, fire place, the folks who run the valet, front desk, etc. Overall the stay exceeded my expectations.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great Location, Comfort and even a few frills","Found this as the best solution to my desire to stay in Denver for a three night run of a favorite band at the nearby Ogden Theater.  Because of its location just far enough from downtown, the AAA rates were about $40/night less expensive when compared to hotels off the 16th St. mall.  Here is what I found.  Courteous and helpful front desk staff.  We arrived midday on a Friday, and there was only one person at the front desk, we had to wait maybe five minutes to be helped.  The recently and deservedly promoted front desk manager Joshua confirmed the reservation, and gave us the low down of the hotel.  Unfortunately, the pool was closed.  Is it just me?  every time I stay in a hotel the pool or hot tub (whichever they have) is always closed.   Although check-in time was 3:00, he had no issues letting us in to our room an hour or so early.  They also honored my request for a high floor (less street noise), and even changed us to a city facing view--but the views from the hotel of the city are not particularly flattering.  An eastern view on a high floor would have provided more early morning light.  I would recommend that more than the not so great ""city-ish"" view.The elevators were in the process of being upgraded (said the note) and consequently were running more slowly than usual.  I saw no evidence of any work being done--and they didn't seem particularly slow.  Maybe it was a psychology experiment to see if such signs reduced the number of complaints about elevator speed.Our room on the eighth floor was fine.. The best things:**Very comfortable bed and plenty of storage (but see the bathroom comment below) **BalconyThe strangest were the following:**Microwave placed on desk--so if you wanted to put a laptop there was no room.  Huh?   Also microwave plugged into the outlets in the desk surface taking up valuable charger space. (I rearranged that right away and put the microwave atop the cabinet which housed the fridge.)  **A nice and very spacious bathroom with huge pedestal sink, real porcelain and travertine tiled (look for the clam fossils) shower tub--but ALMOST ZERO COUNTER SPACE OR CLOTHING/TOWEL HOOKS.  Huh, who designed a bathroom for guests without any places for folks to put their toiletries.  (Also the makeup/shaving mirror--nice touch--did not illuminate.  Not sure if was actually even wired up.Worst things (take note my Warwick friends room 805).  ***The bathroom sink did not drain very quickly even if you pried up the plunger as much as you could.  The drain controller did not work well. This means that dirty soapy or toothpastey or whatever water was hanging in the sink much of the time, making use by the next person either unpleasant or an unneeded waste of time.  Huh, do the cleaning folks not operate the sinks? ***Sliding closet door shrieked like a banshee or like a person scraping their fingernails on the chalkboard when slid  open or closed.  Huh do the cleaning folks never go in the closet?***The safe was not large enough for even a very small laptop.  Well, I guess that is not right, if you chopped the laptop up it would have fit, it was an odd sized safe--maybe from pre-laptop days when people's jewelry was worth more than their computer and its data.  Again, what do people keep in these safes?  a crystal ball?Connecting to WIFI free if you join their club.  It is a bit of a multi step process, and my computer never did figure it out.  Also ethernet cords in the room if you have an ethernet port.   Also a business center where I went to get some work done.  It was nicely set up with a Keurig and printer.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fantastic Hotel,We experienced exactly what you would expect from a Warwick Hotel.  Our stay was fabulous.  We were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been upgraded because we were celebrating my daughter's birthday.  They even brought complementary warm cookies and milk for a special treat.  We enjoyed our stay very much and would highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,This will be my go to place anytime in Denver.,This was the cleanest room I have ever stayed at. The doormen/concierge desk was very helpful in guiding me through the city. Great location just blocks from 16th street mall. Great local eateries and pubs around the corner. I felt safe walking at dark alone in that area. Only $8 taxi ride to/from Union Station to catch $9 train to airport. Price was unbelievably cheap. Below $150.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Extremely friendly staff,"We only needed the hotel for a night so we weren't looking for anything overrated. The Warwick was clean, our suite was spacious and fit our family of 4 nicely and the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. The bellman especially!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice Denver hotel,"I stay here at least once a year on business and the same things stand out. The front of the house staff is great. Highly trained and professional. The rooms are ok, though mine had no chair which is odd for a king. the common areas are very very nice. The evening reception is wonderful with wine and cheese. The hotel restaurant and bar is outstanding. Downsides--Year after year I am dissappointed in housekeeping. They left their dirty towels and cleaning supplies in the room, never refreshed the toiletries, the first night I don't think they did anything but give me fresh towels. Also, the hotel should have vending machines or at least a gift shop that is open a little later than 5. and ice machines on each floor would be nice, but that's being really picky. Also the walls are a little thin but that is because it is older. This is a nice hotel at a reasonable price nicely located.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Beautiful, clean, spacious","I loved staying at the Warwick! I got a great deal when I booked the morning of. The room was spacious, clean, and beautifully appointed. The closet was almost as big as the bathroom, which was a welcome surprise. The lobby was open and very welcoming, with a roaring fire and plenty of books to flip through. Friendly and helpful valet and staff. The only part I wasn't thrilled with was the ugly, outdated patio, but that's the only thing that wasn't wonderful. I really enjoyed my time here and wished it could have been longer.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Staff were great, hotel a little tired","We stayed here for 2 nights in December. Everything was fine, no problems with anything but nothing really stands out either. The staff were all friendly and the wine and cheese hour was a nice touch. Our room was huge but definitely needed an upgrade. The TV was so far away from the bed that we could barely see it! The bathroom was huge also but was strange in that there wasn't anywhere to lay our products - they sat on top of the single sink which wasn't entirely ideal. I'd stay again if we got a deal but there's probably more modern places close-by to go.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent stay,"The Warwick is not the best located hotel in Downtown Denver but the rooms are spacious and very comfortable, the service is excellent. Breakfast in Randolphs is very good. You can park your car and requesta aride down town. We like to stay in different hotels when in Denver but our first stop is always the Warwick.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Solid Hotel near Downtown,"The hotel offers a very solid product, staff is very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay over Christmas here and would definitely come back again.Nevertheless, the hotel rooms would need some update, as you see that they were used for several years. If you travel by car there is a big benefit to park you car on the street behind the hotel for free during the night until 8am in the morning.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Worth a Repeat Visit,"For the most part, we really enjoyed our recent stay at the Warwick. Staff was wonderful. Room was large and clean. Breakfast at the Randolph was tasty and filling. My only concern was that upon arriving at the Grant Street entrance, the pullout suggested it was only for loading/unloading. No mention of Valet Service, therefore we pulled into the next available turn that took us into a garage we assumed was the Warwick's. It turned out to be a city of Denver garage, which we ended up paying for, regardless of our pre-paid Valet parking at the Warwick.",4

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,I was a little disappointed.,"When we first arrived at the WARRICK  it wasn't bad. The place looked a little older, but I'm assuming thats one of their selling points. We stayed in the mile high suite. It was a nice size. The walkout terrace is really the only reason i wanted the room. The bathroom was clean.I didn't care for the carpet on the balcony..but its not a deal breaker. The only thing i can say Negative about the stay was the way SOME of the staff treated us. The Bell Hop guy named *Jeff* if that was even his name...He was unbelievably rude. and i cant help but feel like he treated me the way he did because of my skin color.We came down the elevator to leave with all of our bags. After i checked out i asked him if he could help us take the bags to the car... he said ""yeah gimme a sec"" EVEN tho he wasn't doing anything.. after he said that he said ""or you can get them yourself"" My bf immediately tried to grab a cart and i told him no. We paid $270 a night i dont think i should have to take my own bags. Jeff returned 5 minutes later but the other bell hop had already start assisting us...... well he rolled the cart to the curb .... Jeff just stood there looking at me... so i asked him... "" can you help put the bags in the trunk.."" and he said "" do you want me to ?"" so i said ""yes, isn't that kinda your job. "" he said it certainly is in the description and tossed our bags in the trunk... in the process he dropped my coat.. and didn't even apologize.Its so unfortunate that someone working for such a nice hotel behaves in such a ignorant way. I cant say for sure if he treated me this way because of the color of our skin or if he was just rude in general. Either way its unacceptable behavior.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great hotel close to downtown,"Just stayed at the Warwick for three nights over Christmas.  We have stayed here a number of times and it is a great option if you want to stay close to downtown.  It is dog friendly and people friendly as we are always treated great. Great amenities with gym, restaurant and pool.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Anniversary Celebration,"Enjoying the most romantic anniversary celebration at the Warwick. Came to spend a night together and celebrate 9 years together and mentioned to Ben at check in it was our anniversary. We have been given a lovely comfortable bedroom and Ben was so informative when we checked in and told us all about the amenities at the hotel. The hotel is in a lovely quiet part of town but close to the action if you want it. Great dining option at Randolphs and we will be enjoying a drink at the bar which stays open til 11 pm. What a special treat to receive a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and a note from the staff to congratulate us on our anniversary. Now that is customer service and paying attention to your guests. Thank you so much Warwick hotel for making us feel so special! Special mention to the very personable telephone operator Antoinette who was so personable and helpful earlier today when I called to ask some questions. You are all truly committed to pleasing and paying attention to your guests. We feel so special. Thank you so much.",5

The restaurant is beautiful, the food is terrific and the service is impeccable.",5

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A Gem in the Mile High City! ,"Driving cross county, a last minute stop took us to the beautiful Warwick Hotel on the edge of Downtown Denver.  What a great boutique hotel (so grateful it was not busy season and they had available rooms) with a beautiful lobby, fantastic bar with delicious food and and wine list that will surely make your mouth water. With large and spotless rooms, great views and some with terraces facing DT, this is a great must-stay. Located just on the edge of town, it's easy driving in and out of the city (the hotel has valet parking) and a short walk to Downtown for sightseeing in this fun mile high city. One night was way too short and we look forward to going back when we have more time to spend here.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice place,"The hotel is old so that, in my experience, inevitably comes with some wear and tear (i.e., the occasional stain or dirty tile grout) but we were quite satisfied with the room.  We stayed in the Mile HIgh Suite. It was spacious and had everything we needed. The bed was comfy and we had a decent view of the city. We had a good lunch at the restaurant and overall really enjoyed our time there. We would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very nice.....,".......hotel indeed. Lovely rooftop pool as well which was very quiet. Usual hotel facilities, very nice rooms & a very good location, especially for the tourist. We were stopping here as part of our 'Coast to Coast' trip across the USA. Staff excellent in terms of assistance in what and where to go in Denver - we went to a 'ball' game - very cheap for a great game & entertainment.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,3 night stay for Thanksgiving family visit.,"We selected this hotel mainly because it was close to our son's apartment in the downtown area.  It has a 3 1/2 to 4 rating so I thought we'd give it a try, and the winter rate was acceptable.  We  were gratified that we chose this hotel from others in the same area.  The staff was professional from check in to check out.  The rooms were well appointed and clean with a balcony.  The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in during hotel stays.  The lounge was a nice place to enjoy an adult beverage (or several).  While we didn't use the pool we checked it out.  It is on the top floor and is heated for the winter.  It has a great view, and is surrounded by metal grating and plexiglass.  We'll be staying there again this summer while in town for Colorado Rockies baseball games.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Will never return. A very poorly run hotel,"We stayed at the Warwick Hotel for two days and it was an experience from hell from day one. Upon arrival we waited for almost ten minutes for help from the door people to get our car. The staff refused to allow us to use a cart and insisted that they need to take it as they get tips when taking luggage.  The room booked was for two beds and they did not have any available.  The room was dingy and smelled musty almost moldy. i get that it is an old and cheaper hotel but rooms should be clean. perhaps opening the curtains would be a nice start to provide some light.  The room service phone rang and rang and i was eventually answered only to be put on hold and transfered all over the place,  Eventually we gave up and went to the Rands restaurant and the service was as poor.  staff seem arrogant and greedy for service tips. The bar was swarming with some type of flies which we needed to continuoulsy dodge.  We have been to Denver many times and got this hotel at a very cheap price with everything included so took a chance but will never return. We could never find a supervisor or manager to talk to and everytime we went to the lobby there were lines of people, The hotel is very poorly run, understaffed and in need of a makeover.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great hotel. Superb location!,"Our time at the Warwick was excellent! The staff was friendly, the hotel was updated and appealing. The staff went above and beyond to make our weekend fantastic. We stayed for our anniversary and they delivered champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to our room! The option for dining at Randolph's was not only convenient but delicious. Plus they offer happy hour during the week and wine and cheese hour by the fireplace!! The room was spacious, the view was nice and the balcony was HUGE! Great location too. We walked to the convention center with ease. The greatest part was the price. This hotel offers great rooms with a central locale without the downtown cost.",5

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Too many hidden costs! Stay away!,Hotel as a hotel is not too bad however you will end up paying way more then you planned because they charged hidden exstra cost that you become aware off upon check out. We booked a king room for 2 nights and upon arrival we quickly releaized that this ''4 star'' hotel doesnt offer any parking for its guests. We ended up paying 70$ for 2 nights parking. Room is average but clean which is the only good thing. Secound thing they charged on the same day was WIFI (o yes that thing that even motels offer for free). We had a wondeful view on the back of the hotel parking lot. Hotel is located downtown however no where downtown important so you might as well book somewhere closer to 16th street mall. Upon check out we were greeted with addtional exstra charges like ''using teh hotel…,2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Very nice staff, in the process of re-branding","The hotel is going through re-branding. The lobby looks very nice. The hotel rooms are to be renovated. When I checked in, I was given a nice, spacious room. The only problem was that there was a gap at the patio door. They sent an engineer to the room, and determined that it could not be fixed. They gave me another room, still very nice. I like having a little fridge, even though no microwave. Staff are always friendly when i went in and out of the hotel. It will be a great hotel after some renovation in the rooms. ",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Holiday in Denver,"Stayed at this hotel as wanted something nice downtown. Was given the room right next to the lift.

It's was a quiet time so assume other rooms available. ",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Perfect Date Night Escape,"My partner and I enjoyed a wonderful staycation at the Warwick.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very nice,"We stayed in the Colorado Suite and it was spacious and clean (except for some mold around the bathtub).  We were within a few blocks of the 16th Street Mall with shopping and dining experiences.  One tip - if you are driving, they will offer valet parking at $37 per night, but there is a parking structure just next door for $18 per night.  There is a wine and cheese social hour every evening, and the restaurant connected to the hotel is quite nice.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Beautiful Hotel in great location ,"Beautiful historic hotel, room was good size!  Our room had a great balcony overlooking downtown.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Clean, Friendly Staff - Centrally Located Downtown","My husband and I had tickets to the Bellco theater and wanted a reasonably priced hotel that was in walking distance.  The Warwick fit the bill and more.  It was clean, staff was so wonderful (bottled water at check in) and we lucked out with free parking on the street.  I think they only do that in November.  Anyways, walking distance to the 16 Street Mall and lots more, like the Bellco (Amy Schumer was fantastic!).  They have room service and our king room had a balcony looking out at the city.  Comfy beds.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Charming Hotel,"The Warwick Denver was a really nice alternative to staying in the hustle and bustle of 16th Street Mall. We were upgraded from a King Deluxe to a Queen Suite and had a beautiful 11th floor view of downtown from our HUGE balcony. The room was quite large, but nothing extraordinary. It could have been cleaner, but the view was outstanding. We visited the heated rooftop pool, even though it was early November, and had a nice swim all by ourselves. There were no towels, but I called the front desk and a lovely man brought them up within 5 minutes. This Hotel was a bit too far away from 16th Street Mall for me as I like being within walking (or free shuttle riding) distance to everything I want to see downtown. The balcony was great, as was the rooftop pool. If the price is right, I might stay here again - if not, I will try to stay closer to the 16th Street Mall area.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not equipped to be a luxury hotel : Rudeness is not a hospitable value,"Where do i start.  i live in the midwest and do not travel much so being given the go ahead to attend the ADA meeting was a special gift which unfortunately was spoiled by rude staff almost scary conditions.  On checkin the room was not available for me at 5 pm. i called ahead to say i would be in and to please hold my room for me.  At 6pm i was told the room i wanted was just given to another guest.  When i finally got a room which had two beds i was quite disappointed at the odor of smoke of some sort.  i called the front lobby and was told there were no more rooms available and was literally told just open the window.  i did open the sliding door to find a filthy carpet and horrific view of a dumpster which omitted an odor that was far worse than the smoke.  i called and asked to speak to the manager who i was never able to get hold of. This motel is almost falling apart. i can accept an older building which was clean, but staff who do not care, management not available and cold food with less than hospitable restaurant staff makes this a 2 or very poor.  i will be writing to the Dental Association to tell them of this experience.  I know this hotel is cheap but rude and unavailable is simply unacceptable    i have never written a survey and will not waste my time on the survey i received because it will go on deaf ears.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Stay at Warwick,"Wonderful hotel. I would recommend this place to stay. Great people, great food and great room.I had a doctors appointment at St. Lukes and it was so very convenient and close.  The valet gave us the easiest way to get there and it took all of 6 minutes or less.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Won't stay there ever again even though it's free!!!,"My husband & I stayed this hotel for two nights in July. It was the worst hotel stay ever we experienced. Beginning with rude front desk lady upon check in. We didn't know roof top pool was closed due to construction. She said, "" you are supposed to know that is in website"". We did not check very single fine print. Second, dirty towels hanging in the BR with blood or lip stick stain. The safe was locked. We called the front desk then left to restaurant for dinner. We were back in the room after couple hours, but nothing solved. Called front lady again who said sent someone, but no answer. She didn't tell us to stay so we left. She was with an aggressive attitude and hung up on me. It was fixed finally almost 10 PM. Next morning, I spoke to a manager what was happened last night & no TP was in the BR. There was only small roll of TP no extra roll. He promised replaced TP & clean the room well. Third, the room was still dirty & no TP when we came back @ 7 PM. Called a manager again who was with a gust. We waited him to call back more than 30 min.  No call... We went to the lobby to speak to him who said no one told him to call us back. This is the fourth problem that's no communication between the staff. We switched room  to a suit. Yes, it's suit with a bedroom & living room, but it's very out dated & poor maintained, dirty carpet & couches , trash in the closet, & unfinished veranda. And the last straw, next morning before check out, a house keeper knocked door to check mini bar even though don't disturb sign on the door. We were so disgusted with this hotel. We never stay again.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Very nice hotel, large rooms, great for meetings","First time staying at a Warwick, but this is a great hotel in Denver.  The rooms are very spacious.  The view of the town from the patio is quite nice.  The meeting room for business is very good with Internet, video, and good audio.  Hotel staff is very friendly and does a great job of providing quality food and beverages at all time.  I highly recommend this hotel, which is also in close walking distance to restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good downtown location.,"You are paying more for location than 4 star accommodations. This was my second time here.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A less than sterling situation made better!,"I stayed at the Warwick Hotel in Denver for several days during the National Western Stock Show. The fact that rooms were available at this convenient location during the stock show was a big surprise to us. The staff members at this facility were very helpful and friendly. When it became apparent that there was a problem with the heating in our original room the management quickly and very cheerfully moved us into a suite, at no extra charge. The close-in location also made it possible to get to all of the local attractions quite easily. The restaurant in the hotel was ""okay"" but came to be even more appealing as we returned to the hotel after full days roaming about town. I welcome the opportunity to stay at the Warwick again!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Comfortable & good service,"We stayed three nights and enjoyed the hotel amenities and service. Our room (6th floor) was nicely decorated and larger than most hotel rooms. A openable door to a balcony was nice, we like fresh air. The A/C was good and the fan could be left on so there was no start & stop noise while sleeping. Bathroom also was large, with good sink counter space for Dopp Kits and good shower pressure. Fan is on a separate switch so no need for noise in the middle of the night. Comfortable beds. Benches for luggage and adequate drawer space. Our room was missing a refrigerator but we didn't need it. Excellent WiFi everywhere and it didn't require repeated re-authorizations like some hotels. The breakfast buffet was excellent, with the best fresh fruit selection we've seen and many hot dishes including oatmeal (I would have preferred the oatmeal to be considered part of the continental option to not have to pay for eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc. that I didn't eat). Breakfast prices are high, however, a consideration if you are used to free or moderately-priced buffets. The large fitness facility on the 15th floor is excellent, with excellent views of the city while you work out on three treadmills, three ellipticals, three bikes, extensive free weights, multiple benches, and a couple of machines. The heated (shallow) rooftop pool looks inviting but we didn't have time to use it.  The service throughout was pleasant and efficient, (front desk, doormen, breakfast staff).",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Easy hotel!,"Great staff - Marie at front desk was great, clean room, location, etc.  Close to downtown, great restaurants and nightlife uptown.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nothing Special,"My husband and I just got home from a 4 night stay at the Warwick, and although it wouldn’t be my –first- choice for another long weekend, I wouldn’t complain too much if we stayed there again.We were in town for the American Dental Association meeting, and this was one of the last host hotels that had rooms available for members. That’s how we ended up there.It’s an older property, a little beat up around the edges … but clean. The bed was comfortable, the shower was fine, and we had plenty of space for our luggage and clothes. We had a weird little Kitchen Nook with a coffee maker and a selection of coffee and tea, as well as a sink and a small refrigerator that rattled and hummed with weird noises throughout the night. We solved the refrigerator noise issue by pulling the plug for the rest of the stay. We didn’t really need it.We also had a balcony that faced east, where we saw some spectacular sunrises. I stepped out each morning to take photographs. It was unfortunate that the raggedy fabric on the balcony was a tripping hazard.  They’ve ripped up whatever was there and covered the bare and rough concrete with some sort of fabric that bunched up. Seriously. We’re on the 11th floor and you could trip on that big blanket (?) and fall to your death. It wasn’t tacked down, and there was no warning from the front desk when we checked in. That is my biggest complaint.The attached restaurant, Randolph’s, has a separate review.The staff was wonderful. Everyone was helpful and kind. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. We enjoyed the complimentary wine mixer each afternoon at 5:00. And the guys at the door arranged for a Lincoln town car to take us to the airport for the same price as a taxi. That was a nice touch.The location left a bit to be desired. You’ve got about a five block hike to get to where the action is along 16th street because there aren’t any dining options in the immediate vicinity other than the attached restaurant. But it’s not a –terrible- hike. We felt very safe navigating our way to and from the pedestrian mall on 16th street. Just be aware.So, overall … *shrug*",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very Poor,"Service was quite deplorable. The room I checked in to was filthy. Dust and chocolate wrapper under the desk. The restaurant service is horrific. It took ten minutes to get anyone to even acknowledge my presence.  I ordered a glass of wine which was unavailable. The Manager on duty in the restaurant was not at all knowledgeable. The bill I received included a different wine,  more expensive than what I finally got.  I left a message for the hotel Manager and still have not had a return call.  I could never seem to find anyone answering the phone. The person answering the phone  transferred me to room service.  No answer.  Finally someone answered and I was hung up on.  The pool was not available for some reason,  quite frustrating.  None of the treadmills worked. I called for a bell attendant to help with luggage and was rudely instructed to collect a cart from the lobby myself as they are understaffed.   My Visa card was charged almost double the room tariff and I was told the hotel did not charge me. Not my idea of a resort experience. Terrible hotel and very poorly run.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,biz trip,great staff and nice hotel. second time i have stayed here. i will be back. older building but very nice conditions inside. lobby has a nice fireplace and seating area. i personaly enjoy the uniqueness of the hotel being older.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,customer service recieved,"after staying here in may I was put up on the floor where pets are allowed in the next room the dog barked all night I was not able to sleep. I told the manager that evening and was supposed to be moved but he never found another room. it was a restless night I even went and knocked on the next door but no one answered. well the manager told me that on my following trip I would get a complimentary night. well now that I tried to return I could just get an upgrade and figure I had booked my room a month ago for my trip now in October, have talked to the same reservation lady (wont mention her name) at least 6 times and she has tried to reach a manager and never could I left 3 messages and my calls never got returned. it has been a frustrating experience, I have been staying here for years and thought I was appreciated a little bit. but after this I will probably take my business elsewhere. the customer service I received all around was not what I expected . on another note I was enjoying the pool along with other guests that day and were all asked to leave because a broken tile in the pool so there went that relaxation as well.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Awful hotel for way too much money!,"We had a bday celebration for a few girls, there were six of us so we purchased a suite. Which come to find out offers NOTHING more than a regular room except a 30 year old pull out couch! The furniture and carpet was so old and disgusting, I refused to even sit on it! When we walked in to set up champagne and snacks, I had to dust the entire room cuz it had a film on everything. I took the white towel to the front desk and showed them how nasty our room was and they said sorry but offered us nothing. Upon arrival, we called room service an asked for 2 ice buckets for chilling champagne and some glasses. I called and hour later, nothing. I went to the front desk and got some run around about them having policy of chilling their glasses first and its a process! Now two hours later, We had to call again and demand glasses and ice buckets regardless of their stupid policy! The balcony is so old and nasty, they have commercial grade black carpet just thrown over the concrete. Mind you, this was a ""suite that we paid almost $500 for and there was NOTHING extra other than the couch. Most hotels offer a kitchenette, a fire place , a hot tub....This is the WORST hotel, I have ever stayed at. You honestly might catch something you sit on the furniture which has not been replaced or even steam cleaned in probably 30 years!!!! They charge and urban resort fee for what??? The bar is closed at the pool, or are we paying for the lame cheese and wine hour which is supposed jto be complimentary??! NOT if we're paying the $15! We pay $479 for a suite which is disgusting and we don't even get free parking? Valet for $37!!! THIS PLACE IS A RIP OFF and so outdated and over priced!",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,My new favorite hotel,I found the Warwick online through a booking site.  I was not familiar with it but decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  My room was large and had a great bathroom.  There was also a walk in closet and balcony.  The high rise buildings mixed with the historic ones were visible from the balcony.  I did not get a chance to visit the pool but another guest told me that is was a rooftop pool and was very relaxing.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant.  Both meals were delicious and the service was exceptional.  Even the valet parking was great!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"A hotel, but not a resort","We used the Hotel.com app to find the Warwick for the past weekend.  It is within walking distance of the Pearl Street Mall, and about a mile from Union Station.  The Hotel is being updated (so they say) although we saw no evidence of it.  They had a wine and cheese ""Happy  Hour"" at 5pm on Friday which offered one red and one white wine.  Not sophisticated but reasonable.  The hotel room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  This room has not been updated but was reasonable.  The balcony has carpet that was lose and had white stains on it...not sure what the white ""stuff"" was.

I had the Salmon cakes, and my partner had the pork chop. Both were insanely delicious, we couldn't get over how good everything was. Marcy and Juan both helped make our stay excellent.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Buyer Beware!,"I've stayed at the Warwick in the past and enjoyed my visits, but this last visit was very disappointing. To begin,the hotel's bill did not match Tripadvisor's bill.  It was off by just a few dollars, but I believe the hotel should have honored Tripadvisor's total from when I booked it. Then, my credit card was initially charged for 60 dollars more than it should have been.  A day after I returned home, my credit card company emailed me about ANOTHER charge from the Warwick for a total of 60 dollars less.  I called about this, since it made no sense,  and I was told by Warwick personnel that that was just the way they do things.  They told me that the first transition would be replace by the second.  That is nonsense.  Now, I will have to check with my credit card company to…",2

Our first night we woke up at 2am to the sound of a loud party in the room next door. The hotel was very good about upgrading us to a suite the next day. The suite was large, with a separate living room and bedroom. It also had a large balcony. I was a little disappointed to find most of everything in the room to be out dated. I also felt like the rooms didn't seem very clean. The balcony had this old carpet and smelled like mildew and had mold. For the price it was an ok place to stay. We probably will try another…",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great location with awesome views!,"Very nice place to stay, however I highly suggest staying elsewhere if there is anything going on in town.  We were unfortunate enough to need a room during the weekend of a beer festival which resulted in extremely hiked pricing for our room.  Paying $270+/night for a small room with a single king sized bed is a bit much, even with the stunning balcony views.    The service at the Randolph left much to be desired, the host asked us how many and then rolled her eyes when I told her ""Two, and we'll just be eating off the buffet quickly, so no need for menus."".

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not worth the price,"I bought the fall package where we would receive 3 different vouchers upon arrival. They onlyrics had 1/3 and said to go and buy the other two at the stores and come back to get refunded, which is inconvenient. The rooftop pool was closed again. They didn't leave any towels for us the second day. It's not any nicer than any other hotel I've stayed in minus the lobby, but that isn't what I was paying for.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,First Time in Denver,The hotel is located close to several attractions like 16th St Mall and the   Capitol.  Very friendly and helpful staff were always giving us great tips and directions. The accommodations are comfortable and clean. We had a king that was perfect after a day in the mountains. We didn't eat any meals there because there are so many choices nearby.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Located near downtown Denver. Ok for a short stay.,"Stayed at the Warwick for two nights while on business. Hotel itself is ok. Rooms are spacious with own balcony. A/C doesn't work like you would expect in 2016. But: staff is VERY friendly and helpful!!!Downtown Denver, lots of bars and restaurants in walking distance.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The better of two choices.,"I needed a hotel close to a seminar, and I had stayed at the only other choice, the Hampton before, and was not impressed. This is an older hotel with older furnishings, but still nice, clean and quiet.On the plus side were the bed, the shower, the hi-def tv. On the negative side, the mini-bar fridge was noisy and wouldn't shut off, so I had to disconnect it. The balcony light could not be turned off, meaning I had to shut the drapes rather than take in the downtown lights.They advertise free wifi, but charge an "" urban retreat"" fee, which effectively adds $15.00 to the room price. Breakfast buffet was nice, but not worth $30.00. A previous lunch had a ""lighter fare"" pasta that was anything but. Inch wide noodles stuck together by a sauce that would have been called gravy elsewhere. The area has almost no restaurants, so you are a bit of a prisoner unless you want to walk a half a mile or more. The location probably means I'll have to stay there again, but I'll definitely take my own wine and snacks.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Poor location, disappointing accomodations, horrible management.","My wife and I unfortunately got stuck at this hotel through one of those unadvertised specials. It was supposed to be a 4 star hotel in the downtown Denver area. Upon arriving at the hotel, it's obvious that it is not really close to anything worth visiting. The lobby looked decent but everything else was incredibly worn out and in need of an update, the funny thing is they claim they just renovated (maybe just the lobby). The elevators barely worked and the bathroom had certainly seen better days. Upon confronting Christian and Jacob from the hotel management they took a extremely unfriendly approach and insisted that my expectations were unrealistic. Luckily, we only spent one night at this horrible place.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,denver,excellent all except for the pool being quite dirty the evening i arrived and people were even swimming ....ugh ! i reported it to the pool bartender and the valet and the next day it was closed . as was the entire rooftop area . that was a disappointment for sure,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,This hotel has a nice location. It's not too much in the middle of downtown.,"I liked this hotel much better before I checked out!  Upon check out I was told that I had a change parking charge of $37 for the night! I stay in downtown Denver often enough to know that's over $10 more than customary. I also had a $17 for the wine & cheese reception, use of the Internet, and use of the gym. Unfortunately for me, when I checked in shortly after 4:00 I was not invited to the reception, didn't need to use the gym and didn't use their internet because I was asked to pay when trying to sign on in my room. This was way too much price gouging.  We won't be going back.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,absolutely aweful,"I was not please with this hotel at all, for a 4 star hotel I expected more. The bed was extremely uncomfortable.  I was not explained the charges when I checked in at all.  I booked my hotel on hotwire so when I checked in my room was paid for.  So when I used valet service and room service I new I would have to pay the next morning, no big deal.  I checked out, paid my bill.  When I check my cc the next day I saw 3 additional charges on my card including the final check out charge.  After talking with a very rude manager, it was explained to me that when I check in they automatically charge your card $60 to hold for any amenities you might use.  Then if you use any of those amenities they charge your card those amenities cost, then when you pay your bill the next morning in full, those amenities charges on your credit card with the original charge of $60 will fall off your card with in 3-5 buiness days.  Extremely rude and inconvenient.  Not once was I let known this.  Then the manager proceed to act like I knew that all hotels do this and that I should have know this was a normal thing.  I do not stay at hotels often, and for me to spend a few hundred dollars to stay in a nice hotel is alot.  I will not be going back and do not recommend this hotel to anyone.",1

It was a great place for pets. The hotel staff provided a dog bed and treats to make the stay easier. The rooms are big and elegant. I appreciate the extra space for luggage, bed and bathroom.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent stay for our anniversary.,"I spent a lot of time deciding on a hotel for our first anniversary in Downtown Denver, and ended up choosing the Warwick because it was cheaper than the other 4-star options in the area. We were very  pleased with our stay. Because it was our anniversary, we were upgraded to a corner suite. Awesome! The room was clean, roomy and more than comfortable. The view of downtown from the balcony was breathtaking. The walk to the 16th Street Mall was less than 10 minutes. The staff was a tad quirky (especially the woman who delivered our room-service breakfast) but overall, very friendly. I'm sure other downtown hotels might be nicer and more up-to-date (because of the Warwick's age), but for the price, I don't regret choosing the Warwick.",5

This a great location if needing to business at the nearby capitol district.",4

The bellman reprimanded me for parking in valet then proceeded to tell me that this was an all valet hotel at $34 per day, when I asked about parking options he was very rude. the rest of the stay was good the bartenders very friendly, food was great. Breakfast buffet really pricey.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"So much potential, but unrealized.","We were at the Warwick for 4 nights and initially it all felt pretty good.  Then, we noticed that the sink in the kitchenette area was filthy with coffee spills, the balcony had a horrible dirty carpeting and overall, the place didn't feel clean.  The rooms are super spacious which was probably the big plus.  Later in the week I noticed that same sink had all kinds of crud in the drain and the bathroom sink was also clogged up.  We had signed up for the Fall Package and getting the perks that were offered was somewhat strange.  They wanted us to go to the zoo and get receipts for reimbursement and the same for the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.  Another perk they had was wine in the evening, but you have to stop at one glass.  We are used to a bit more hospitality when you…",2

I brought my husband and children along so we could do some sight seeing between classes because we all love the mountains! Front desk lady was a snob, asked me for my credit card information even though i told her the company card was on file already. She then went on to explain how its company policy, blah blah blah, and then realizes ""OOOPS YOU""RE RIGHT ITS ON FILE!"" Should've checked first. Valet needs some customer service training as well!! VERY RUDE!!! The rooms were very roomy, a HUGE walk-in closet and bathrooms. We had a double room with a city view. It wasn't very noisy at night as I thought it would be. We were only on the fourth floor. Didn't get a chance to check out the restaurant. The kids LOVED the pool and…",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Everything about my visit to the Warwick felt like it was conspiring to make me feel like I didn't belong.,"I'm not a particularly well-off person, and I look very young, but everything about my visit to the Warwick felt like it was conspiring to make me feel like I didn't belong.  The first time I walked in the door, I was asked by a staff member where my parents were. I get that I look very young, and I was completely willing to brush this off. I did, and we both went on with our days.  When I later retrieved my bag from the valet desk, I accidentally tipped the man there $15 instead of $5, something I wasn't aware of until I stepped into the elevator and heard him loudly announce this fact to his friend at the reception desk, at which point they both began loudly laughing at me. I don't resent him keeping the money at all, and if he had asked, I would have told him to keep it just…",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice place to stay,Nice clean place great rooms no hot tub valet  not so helpful you problem have to carry your things  to your room if you don't look  important good location little pricey pool was nice recently renovated ,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not as expected,Room was not a one bedroom as described and in photos online.  There was no door between bedroom and living room. Patio was horrible--torn up carpet and two sad chairs.  Food at restaurant was odd as if chef didn't know what he/she was doing.  Location a bit out of the way.,2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,I loved it!,"My partner and I came to Denver to spend some time together on a mini vacation. We wanted to be close to downtown (walking distance as we were leaving the kiddos at home and we were going to indulge in some adult beverages), and the Warwick fit the bill.  Our room was really large and clean, and had a huuuge balcony! I loved it! The front desk clerk was very polite upon check in, and we ventured down for happy hour at the hotel bar. Great happy hour specials, and a lovely atmosphere.  We really enjoyed our two night stay, and would definitely come back. The balcony alone is worth the price of the room!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nothing bad but nothing really stood out.,"The location was good, the rooms were very spacious I just found the people that worked there to be not overly kind or helpful. Maybe it was because it was 37 degrees (celcius) and they were all super hot and grumpy I know I was. The gym was wonderful and had an amazing view. I would stay again for sure Im just not ranting and raving about how amazing it was.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Poor Hotel ,"This hotel has beautiful pictures in the website but when you arrive it's an old apartment complex painted to hide the age. I booked this hotel for the balcony which turned out to be disgustingly dirty. Glasses in the bathroom were dirty, sheet was not clean and there was a dirty ear bud on the floor in the bathroom.  There was a mouse in the restaurant which I almost stood on. I wanted to report this to a manager but was told that there were no managers in duty.  Very poor Internet. The pool was clearly not maintained with things all over the ground, no clean towels. The staff seem friendly but very understaffed.  Not a good experience.  Management need to walk the hotel to see what is going on.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very nice Hotel.  Good prices.,Go online and book this gem. It had mixed reviews but it was first class to me. WQe received a suite at the price other hotels wanted for a room. Also you can book a room and upgrade to a suite for $40 if available. Our room was remodeled with a huge balcony. Two blocks from the 16th street mall.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,not a luxury hotel,food and drinks were left over in room along with a dirty sink.  a loose covering on floor of balcony left very little to desire.  Get you latte/capucino at starbucks unless you want to  spend $12.hotel smells very musty and you must remind clerks of any packages you booked.,3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very Nice,"The hotel is very nice and so was the staff, from check in and out. The valet parking and luggage safety and security made it feel that everything was in good hands.The hotel was picked by my staff, due to it's closeness to the meeting I was attending.The room was perfect and the view was breath taking in the night with the city view and lights.If you get a chance stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Good value, excellent staff","I chose this hotel in Denver for the rate and proximity to my conference venue.  I was very pleased with the service, which started as soon as I arrived at the door in my car.  The value for the price was excellent; the Warwick easily matches the much more expensive hotels available in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Some definite problems,"Our stay was as one would have expected for a hotel of this sort with one exception. The sizeable balcony had a carpet that was coming up (It had been stuck down with adhesive) It was covered with dust and even an old cigarette end (we took photos). When we complained, we were just told that the carpets were going to be renewed - no date given. We suggested that in the mean time the carpet could be vacuum cleaned, but this was not done. We leant over the balcony to see other peoples and saw this was a general problem - clearly the hotel did not care as replacement was going to happen - but in the meantime it was inexcusable.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Quite nice, with just a few drawbacks this time","Warwick has become my go to for staying close to downtown venues.  It's friendly and comfortable without feeling overly stuffy.  This stay, however, was pretty pricey for nothing included, and Id probably look further next time for the same price.  Cigarette butts on a rooftop surface that we looked down on were quite an eyesore.  If you're going to accommodate the smokers, seems reasonable to expect their nasty trail should be either prevented or cleaned up on a regular basis.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Business Traveler,"Nobody mentioned a ""Resort"" fee at any time and the checkout clerk was apparently intending to pass it off as an incidental fee on my credit card and say nothing about the fee.  A reference to state taxes raised my suspicions and upon questioning I found out about this hidden fee of $15.00 per day per room plus tax.  As a business traveler I need to know about fees up front.  This cute trick is used to allow the Warwick to be competitive on Internet booking sites --when they are not.  Also $25.00 per person for a very limited breakfast buffet menu was a shocker. I was told that the scanner and fax machine were ""broke"".  This hotel is no value and I do not recommend a stay here for business travel.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wonderful Experience!,"A true 4 star hotel with everything a person could want or ask for.  The personnel were kind, courteous and professional.  A wonderful experience.  The rooms are awesome.  Highly recommended.  A wonderful mall within walking distance, with restaurants and shopping near by.  We felt very comfortable and safe in this downtown area.  If you needed something, the staff was there to help at all times.  And the wine tasting hour was fabulous.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,How much did you say parking was?,"The Warwick is a classic old Denver hotel.  We heard from the staff, back in the day, it used to be a Playboy Club.  Interesting!  Now, it's a very refined and elegant hotel.  Every staff member we met...from the desk clerk to the wonderful waiters in the Raphael Restaurant were impeccably groomed and without question knowledgable.  Our room was gorgeous and it had a balcony overlooking the city.  There's certainly nothing in this hotel that isn't inexpensive.  We had a great meal at the restaurant but we paid a good price.  The biggest outlay of money for what you received, was actually parking. For 2 days of parking and tips for the valet going to get your car and re parking it...we were out a $100.  That's a bit much if you are not a Kardashian.  Would I stay here again....yes.",4

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Historic and very cool,Stayed at this place for a night and the hotel was awesome itself.  I'm not a fan of older hotels but this one has been kept up to the best and you would never guess it was older.       They have complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings.  They also have a roof top pool with a great view of Downtown Denver.  Staff was very friendly.  Will return again for sure.,4

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fantastic!,"We have always had a great experience at the Warwick! They are attentive and checkin is fast and easy, the rooms are clean. The hotel is an older hotel, but it is one of the few in downtown Denver that has outdoor balconies - which is beautiful with good weather.  We are very pleased and will be looking at some of their winter packages this year, with the parade of lights.  Parking is rather expensive, but there is a lot of options around the hotel.",5

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Denver business stay,I liked the hotel and the friendliness of staff. The fitness center was nice as well. I do wish that they would provide shuttle service to make getting around easier and the breakfast buffet in the a.m. was not worth the money.,4

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Bronze Pacakage is the Way to ago,Visited Denver for the weekend. Picked the Warwick because of the location and price.  The Bronze Pacakage included breakfast every morning and a night cap at Randolph's.  Our room was very comfortable (especially the bed).  Had a view of the city. The restaurant 's patio was directly below us so we were able to hear the Jazz music in the evening.  The staff was friendly and helpful with directions.  One drawback was the cost of valet parking. We were not allowed to self park in their lot.  Our only alternative was to park on the street.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"The Warwick is clean, neat, and looked after, just like your Grandpa James.","Hotels often can avoid the 'old' moniker by claiming to be 'boutique' hotels. The Warwick is simply old. Having said that, being old doesn't mean not without certain charms. I like the location of this hotel, a nice distance from the 16th Street Mall, about 3-4 blocks. The Warwick sits on Grant Street, a bucolic tree-lined city street, that is relatively quiet. I've been coming here for about 15 years, and the nicely appointed lobby has not been touched, with the same chess set on the same table all these years. Still, it is clean, neat, and looked after, just like your Grandpa James. The rooms are generic: bed, desk, flat screen tv, and smallish coffee maker. I'm guessing Millennials would find these rooms boring. And yet, they are comfortable and predictable. Most rooms have…",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent stay,"Our stay at the Warwick was excellent. We arrived around 10:30 am and they were able to get us to our room immediately upon arrival. The breakfast buffet was delicious and has a wide variety. Service was excellent throughout the Randolph restaurant.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Terrible place to stay,"Other reviewers weren't lying. This place is awful. To boot, they initially made it sound like an early check in was no problem. The day of, they say it's no problem and $50 extra. To say the least, what a scam. Definitely never staying here again and advise YOU not to either.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Average to basic,"I had a large room with two double beds and walk-in closet facing Grant Street.The hotel has definitely seen better days. Carpet all over and furniture worn and slightly outdated. Dog hair allergists beware - this is a ""dog loving hotel""! And I saw German shepherd to ... coming out of the elevator.Got up in the morning to take a ""swim"" in the new rooftoop pool - well, it does look much larger on the website than it is in reality but ok for time to chill-out.Used in-room service which was quick, efficient and plenty but really got annoyed when my in-room minibar charge was more than double of what it said on the menu. Sorry - but this is an absolute no-go! Location: hotel is located about 2 blocks from 16th Street - easy stroll from there to 16th Street Mall. A 7eleven is around the corner to the left with more restaurants if you continue straight.Overall, I define ""Luxury"" slighly different.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Average Stay,"My sister and booked separate rooms within minutes of each other. The hotel chose the rooms we were given.

It was cold when we got back so I put it up to 70°. The heat kicked on and started fogging up everything. I tried to turn off the heat but the thermostat went blank.

Loved that it was a bit away from all the night life yet I could walk to and from using the 16th street mall.  Everyone was pleasant and helpful even recommending local eating places (much better than chain restaurants).  The room was clean, spacious, and much more than I expected.  I would not hesitate to recommend Warwick to anyone visiting Denver.",5

Room was clean and bed linen and towels very fresh (almost too fresh as they did smell of bleach!).  Some leftover rubbish in room on arrival but was removed.  I was happy with my stay and the service and enjoyed dining there a few times. Restaurant staff are great.  Only little complaint was that I suspect housekeeping used my balcony to have their little nicotine fix, as there was always a smell of cigarettes when I returned to the room after a day out at conference, which was Ok once I aired out the room. This is not a good thing considering we have to sign a form to pay a $500 bond if there is smoking in the room!  Otherwise, great stay. About 10 mins from central mall and lots of great restaurants etc.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Horrible Service,"When we arrived at the hotel at 6:00 pm, we were told our room was not ready. Check-in was at 3:00 pm. We were not given the option to change the room. Our car had already been parked by the valet, and we had our bags. The lady at the front desk told us we should go get dinner and come back in an hour or so. No transportation was offered, and no information about the area was given.Once we finally got checked in, we got upstairs to our room. The overall look of the hotel was nice, but the staff gave us no information on hotel amenities or the nearby area. After being in the room for only a few moments, one of the headboards that was screwed in to the wall fell off. When we called down to the front desk, we were asked what we had done. We were on the other side of the room when it happened. Not once did the staff apologize or ask if we were OK. They didn't offer to move us to a new room, rather they sent up two men to our room to fix the headboard. They were in our room for an hour and a half. My friend and I were there for the weekend, and we are both women. It was extremely uncomfortable.Once the maintenance workers left, the front desk called to tell us we were being too noisy. Our neighbors had complained about banging on the wall. When we explained the maintenance workers THEY HAD SENT UP had just left, the response from the guy at the front desk was just, ""Oh yeah."" There was never an apology. The employees didn't know how the breakfast package worked, and we received a bill for $76.00 at check out. The food was unremarkable, and the fresh fruit had bug wrapped in with it.The guy at the desk during checkout all but accused us of lying about the issues we encountered, and he begrudgingly took the $76.00 breakfast charge off our bill. No other discount or apology was given for the poor service. We won't be going back.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,FANTASTIC ,"Absolutely loved our service, suite and the staff!

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,More lows than high altitude,"When I walked into the Warwick, it seemed nice enough, although a little more old worldly than I would normally gravitate to. I checked in to find I was in an accessible room, which was fine, but I would have preferred to be made aware of it at check-in.....The room was spacious with 2 double beds, which were of an average comfort level and the TV was also of average size with he normal range of channels. The bathroom and amenities were also pretty standard.I had room service on one of the nights, which was tasty and reasonable in price. There is also quite a nice bar accessible from the lobby.The real problems with the property are the rooms are quite noisy and it' hard to sleep through the air-con (which can't be turned off) and the water system sounds. The staff are mixed, with a couple being friendly and others, including the bell desk being outright rude. The staff don't seem to be very well trained and tend to respond to requests with ""I think....."", rather than actually finding  the answer.I spend quite a bit of time in Denver and based on this experience, I won't be back.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Ok Stay,"I had more problems than I think you should at a hotel.  They gave us the wrong room (no balcony and said it was an upgrade) the room type we reserved was booked up so they offered to switch us the following afternoon but we didn't want the headache and stayed put.  The maids were lazy.  They made the bed and refreshed the towels but did not give us clean glasses or new soap.  When I got home I saw they charged me $111, I emailed to inquire why and they explained it was for valet parking.  We didn't have a car at all on our trip.  They reversed the charge but I think that is pretty ridiculous.  Bed was comfy.  Not much of a view.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great for Business Travelers,"While this hotel is out of our normal price range for leisure travel, we stayed here while attending a conference and enjoyed our stay.[Note:  we chose the hotel because of its rooftop pool, which was closed for remodeling.  As other TripAdvisor reviewers have noted, the hotel doesn't mention this on its website.  Call ahead to see if the pool is open.]Our room was spacious and clean with a king bed, desk with charging outlets, TV, two chairs, separate small room with wet bar & mini-fridge (stocked with mini-bar items), large bathroom with single-sink vanity & tub/shower, and large balcony.Breakfast was not included, so we skipped the restaurant in the mornings, opting for granola & yogurt we'd stashed in the fridge (we took out some of the mini-bar items to make room for our own food!).Wi-fi was included, but this may have been part of our conference rate.  It was decent, but not outstanding -- streaming video lagged at times.Guests who opt out of housekeeping services are rewarded with a $5/day room credit that can be applied to bar & restaurant purchases or the room bill.On-street parking (~$1/hr and free overnight) and a surface lot across from the hotel are good budget alternatives to the hotel's $37/day valet-only parking.The bar had a reasonably priced happy hour with tasty snacks, drink discounts, and good service.It seemed that only two of the three elevators were in service during our three-night stay, and on our final morning that went from one elevator to, briefly, none (there had been a huge rainstorm the night before and it apparently caused an issue that required them to reset the system).The 16th Street Mall, Convention Center, and Capitol are a short walk away.We'd stay here again for business travel ... if the pool is open!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Experience,This property offers everything for business travelers as well as for leisure travel.  I've been staying here for years and the Warwick has always met my expectations.  The location is great as well as the staff.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Isolated but comfortable ,"I stayed 3 nights during the summer. The property is dated but some of the rooms have been 'refreshed' though still feels dated. Pros: 1) the rooms are large, slightly above average for American standards 2) the beds are comfortable and the wifi is fast and reliable 3) the hotel is in quiet and safe neighborhoodCons: 1) no hotel breakfast 2) it's very isolated. you have to walk 5-7 blocks to reach 'downtown'. It's far from food and shopping The staff is a mixed bag. While the front desk staff were very accommodating and friendly, others seemed to be indifferent.All in all, an average hotel that's isolated",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Overpriced; terrible service,"I had assumed that 30-40 people staying at this hotel on business travel for one of the world's largest banks would be treated well.  I was wrong.  The hotel itself and rooms are clean and spacious, although in need of an update.  Our room rate was $200 per night, even though the corporate rate was much lower.  Why my large bank employer with a large presence in Denver didn't qualify at least for the corporate rate is a bit beyond me.  All that aside, the service was terrible.  After flying all morning, a colleague and I asked to check in early to change and refresh before meetings.  Unfortunately they were ""at capacity"" all week so we couldn't check in but they were kind enough to let us change in the lobby restroom.  I get the no early check in but he was totally indifferent and just straight rude.  Next was the bellman taking our bags until we could check in later, who all but threw our claim tickets at us.  We were also able to get a cab with no assistance from them, obviously.   And we were not belligerent or rude to the hotel employees in the slightest.  Frustrated at the situation yes, but not rude.  I travel a fair amount both for work and personally and have never been treated this badly straight away at check in.  Especially traveling for a corporate partner, the service was shocking.  Not worth the money.  I would not stay here again and we'll also report our experience to corporate travel.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Simply good,"Stayed here for a conference in April 2016. The hotel room was nice and clean. The hotel supposed to be equipped nicely with swimming pool etc, but due to the working schedule it was not possible to experience this myself.The hotel personnel was friendly and helpful. A nice change for me was that the hotel room had a balcony, which was a nice surprise. Location of the hotel is very central in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Trip to Denver,Plesantly surprised at the stay  fairly easy to get to  would definately recommend the hotel valet parking instead of parking on the street or other parking garages  good local restaurants within easy walk,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Building a little old, but still well maintained and great service","Rooms have decent view of city or facing away.  My rate included free wifi, which was very nice.  The restaurant downstairs is not cheap at all, but has good happy hour specials that run late into the night.  Everything was clean and they offer $5 credit for refusing room service.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Average at best ,"The room is fairly large but not super clean. I was disappointed to discover mildew on the shower curtain. I asked at the front desk several times before they finally sent someone (2 days later) from housekeeping to swap it out for a clean one. The front desk staff on Friday night were actually quite rude when I asked for a bottle of water (I had seen someone get a bottle earlier in the day and knew they had bottled water) the girl at the desk just said no we don't have any and didn't offer to help at all just went right on chatting with her colleague. One of my friends who checked in a couple of days after me had trouble with his reservation for 2 rooms. They told him one of the rooms had flooded and they were going to send his underage sons on a bus to another hotel. After some discussion about how that wasn't a viable solution. He wound up getting cots for them in his room and a complimentary breakfast but they were all stuck in one room for their stay.The fitness area was newly renovated and the complimentary cruiser bike was fun. Unfortunately, the pool was closed during our whole stay.On the day we were departing one of the elevators got stuck and the fire department had to come rescue the people who were stuck. We wound up having to carry our heavy bags down 7 flights of stairs. Luckily they had staff helping with this but I was really glad we were leaving so I didn't have to ride the elevator at that hotel again.With so many other choices for hotels in Denver, I don't think I'll be back at the Warwick.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Beautiful overnight stay,My husband and I only needed a one-night stay but wanted something nice that we could watch fireworks from our room/balcony.  The Warwick was exceptional.  Service was great and the room was lovely.  Staff made us feel very welcome.  Looking forward to staying here again!,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,3 bad rooms is 36 hours,"My husband and I took a week long trip to Denver. We decided to ""treat"" ourselves to a nice hotel for the last 2 days of our trip. We chose the Warwick and deeply regret it. We called to make our reservation and were told the cost. We chose the mile high suite because we were told that we would have the best view of downtown and paid extra for this. We arrived at the hotel a little before midnight. We got up to our room on the 8th floor and had a parking lot view. I went back down and they said the view was not guaranteed. If that was the case then don't charge extra for a view if you aren't going to provide it. He said he would move us the next day. I went back to the room to take a shower and go to bed. The bathroom door was coming off of the hinges so you had to lift it to close it. There was a wad of hair behind the bathroom door and once in the shower I realized the drain was clogged. I was so gross out that I didn't even finish my shower. I got out of the shower and decided to just go to bed. My husband went to draw the drapes and realized that they were pulled off the track and broken. I had it at that point and asked to be switched to a clean room. They moved us to one of the small rooms on the 4th floor and were kind enough to credit us for the night. Once again we noticed the bathroom door and front for were coming off of the hinges (this was the case for all 3 rooms and visible on other rooms' front door). The hotel smells musty and damp. I can only assume there is a water damage issue causing the smell and doors to come loose. The front door hanging off makes the room so noisy. You can hear everything going on in the hall. We woke up early and went off on the days adventures. When we arrived back in the afternoon we were switched to a 12th floor room with a view as promised. Although ""clean"" this room was also smelly and made both of us feel dirty. We wouldn't even sit on the couch. Also the patio had a black piece of carpet over it and smelled even worse than the hotel room. We couldn't even enjoy the view. For the price this hotel is not worth it. It's an old and dirty hotel that needs to be leveled to start from scratch. The hotel photographer needs a raise because they made it look so classy and nice. I would never stay here again. Oh and if you don't want to pay $38 for parking you will have to use city parking next door and they lock the gate before 9:00pm and you have to wait around for the security guard to make his rounds to let you in to retrieve your car. Sadly this hotel was a big downer on or otherwise amazing vacation.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not too bad!,"We stayed at the Warwick only one night. The hotel needs updating, looks like they were slowly trying to do this... only one elevator was working, but the room was fine, the bed comfortable, and the hotel was clean. Staff were very friendly and accomodating. I would stay again.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Excellent amenities, good central location","This is a nice and clean hotel in the central Denver area. The lobby is large and welcoming, the restaurant/bar  menu is OK (not cheap, though). The stuff is very friendly. The hotel is pet-friendly, so if you are afraid of or are allergic to dogs, it's not for you",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Would only Stay in this Hotel again if the POOL was open.,"The first impression puling up out front was not too bad.  The bellmen were so friendly and quick to get the luggage unloaded.  My impression certainly changed once I was in the lobby- Wow - could this hotel be much more dated?  Checking in was a breeze.  Started out in a standard king room.  Just okay but did have a balcony - with a view of the parking lot.  Best I can say of the room was that it was clean and the bed comfortable.  Switched to a suite with balcony  facing west the next night. The carpeting on the balcony was frightening. The suite was just okay.  Not pleasant sitting outside in the evening listening to the extremely loud jazz band playing 9 floors below.  Played way too long and each ""song"" seemed to go on and on and on.  Will be returning to Denver in the Fall - if I stay at the Warwick, it is only because the rooftop pool will be newly remodeled.   I think this hotel is over-priced based on location and condition.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,One night stop,"We stayed here one night for a concert at Bluebird.  First, I am not sure I would call this hotel ""luxury"".  It may have been nice once up on a time but it is pretty worn down.  The hall carpets are well walked on.  We stayed in a suite of sorts.  It had a couch set up in front of a TV but what I think was the ""couch bed"" part was sticking out the back of the couch between the end of the bed and enough to hurt someone.  I did appreciate the nice size balcony that overlooked downtown.  The weather was perfect for it.  The lobby cocktail reception was nice also with a red and a white to drink before heading out for dinner.  We were just shy of a half mile walk to the 16th Street Mall for a great place to spend some time.  The shower pressure was blah but the water was nice and hot.  The bed was comfy and plenty of pillows.  The bathroom was plenty spacious but rather odd with 2 showers and the toilet RIGHT in front of the door.  The gym was down a MUSTY, MUSTY hallway due to renovations.  The equipment was better than most but when we went to check it out the night before the water jug was empty and was still empty when I went back the next day when I went to use the gym.  There was also no towels to use.  The wetnaps to wipe off the equipment were dried out.  I guess I ask a lot of a hotel gym.  The hotel was renovating the pool so I can't speak for that.  If I were to go back to Denver, this would not be my first choice.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,What a lovely experience,"From the moment we stepped out of our car to the moment we left for good, our experience at the Warwick was exceptional. The room was amazing as was the view of downtown from our private balcony. We felt like royalty the entire time! I'd recommend the Warwick to anyone wanting luxury at an affordable price. Thank you so much!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Disappointing,"We had stayed at the Warwick a couple of times before, and this is the last time we would ever stay there. First of all, the rates used to be very reasonable, but they doubled on this visit. Secondly, we stayed for three nights and we had no maid service the entire visit. After the first day when our room was not serviced, we contacted the manager who assured us it would be cleaned and given towels the next day. However, when we returned to our room the second night our room had still not been cleaned. No explaination was given. It was a very disappointing experience.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Old TIme Hotel, Off of 16th Street","This is an okay hotel.  It feels pretty dated but the up keep was good.  The room was extremely large, I stayed in a standard king.  The two main things to know about this hotel is that it is pretty far away from 16th street, compared to the many many hotels in the area.  You have to walk a good distance to get to anything, restaurants, stores, or the free 16th mall shuttle.  This would be okay but the price of the hotel is pretty expensive.  I guess my overall conclusion is it is a fine hotel, but certainly not worth the price.  Lastly, I will just say the staff was rude, I had about 3 people be just plan rude.  I try and dismiss stuff like that but one person literally whispered something about me as I walked away.  It was minor, not a big deal but still.  You can tell the…",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great Location, comfotable room for Moms 60 th birthday",The location of this hotel is great.  We booked this hotel for the roof top pool which was closed for remodeling.  we wished we would of been told as lounging by the pool was on the top of our agenda. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The balcony was also nice.   There is no parking and Valet is $37. Breakfast is additional and we opted for the buffet which was awful and expensive. $55 for 2 . we also had some mini bar drinks in the room. at the end of the day the $250 room was $450. ,3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Denver Trip to Concert,"I have stayed at the Warwick Denver several times, and have always enjoyed the location, the size of the rooms and the decor.  This Hotel was good....but it was the small things that keep it from being great.  The in room coffee maker was terrible, the under counter refg. was sitting on top of the counter (instead of underneath as would be expected, as the opening for it was there).  The pool was still under ""renovation"" which it has been every time i have stayed.  The doormen were either not there, or not interested in helping...  So overall it was just ok this trip....kinda disappointing actually.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Smoker's oasis in Denver,"Do not expect much - this hotel is dated and overrated - if you looking for luxury stay on the budget - check in Holiday Inn. Here are reasons we are coming back - #1 location - it is in the walking distance of all downtown attractions - #2 your car is safe in underground garage - #3 my wife is a smoker and I have noticed that many of the other balconies are ""emitting"" smoke..

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Pool closed no notice 2 customers,I do not live too far from this hotel but I was in town to watch a Colorado Rockies game so I figured I would stay the night and swim and according to their website they had a really nice rooftop pool and with it being summertime and hot I figured it would be nice to just stay the night and swim for a while but after checking in they let me know that the rooftop pool was closed for construction if I had been aware of this I would have chose a different hotel or I would have just traveled back home instead of spending $300 on this room overall this hotel seems like it needs to be updated the elevators are very scary one of them actually broke down with people stuck inside and the one functioning elevator was very shaky and did not seem safe also the walking distance to…,2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Classy Hotel with Many Nice Touches,"My brother and I recently spent a weekend night here, and we were really impressed. I found a good rate (through Trip Advisor) for a ""bronze package"" stay, which included 2 caipirihnas from the hotel bar, free wifi and 2 free breakfast buffets.The not-so-great: There really weren't too many things to complain or not be happy about, but there were a couple...The location is not the most happening spot in Denver (though it is quiet for a good night's sleep), I ended up walking from Union Station and LoDo (which is very happening) and it took me about 30 minutes. There's not a lot of night life near-by, but it's also not hard and not expensive to get around to the downtown hot spots with a cab or Uber. The decor and furnishings where also a bit dated, I found it charming and old-school but if you're expecting a W or Aloft experience here, you're expecting Moby and you're getting Sinatra.The close-to-great: We were upgraded to a suite, and it was really nice. The balcony was large and enticing on a cool summer night (I think all the rooms have balconies), and the bedroom was large, the bathroom was well-appointed and the living room was huge. Since our room was upgraded, I assume the hotel was close to full, but we never heard a peep from any of the rooms above, below or next to us.The bartender who served us was an older gentleman (in the truest sense of the word), and he was both engaging and accomodating (to our stupid jokes) on a slow night shortly before closing. The breakfast buffet initially looked modest, but they eventually brought out smoothies, offered eggs cooked to order, and again our server was so accomodating and friendly as we at outside, it was a wonderful experience.I was a bit disappointed when I went up to the roof-top hotel to find out that it was closed for renovations/repairs (we couldn't even get out on the rooftop to enjoy the view), that wasn't disclosed at the time of my reservation but overall my stay was still very pleasant. I should also note that the hotel is very dog-friendly, they have water and food bowls for dogs in the lobby and they welcome guests with dogs.Overall, I really thought the Warwick was a great, old-school hotel with a few things that could be improved. In any case, I would strongly consider staying here again the next time I visit Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Overall good experience,"Cons: Pool under renovations, disappointed. Gym closed the first day due to A/C, when finally working, a bit disappointed on elliptical machine small stride. Had to use the treadmill which is okay. There was no towel, or at least I couldn't find any in the gym. No paper cups for water so don't even know if the water dispenser is working at the gym.Cotton pillows hard to sleep on, prefer down. No full sized mirrors in the room or bathroom. Hotel had door hanger that indicated if place on door to refused housekeeping that a $5 voucher would be provided under your door/day refused (I did this my 4 nights there, no voucher provided any days under my door as indicated or at check-out). Check out: room got charged for dine-in service by accident (wrong room charge was quickly fixed.)Pros: Hotel clean, very good services by bell boys, staff friendly, area felt safe, nice area, free wifi, free wine provided at 5 pm every days I was there (great after long days of conferences), lobby bathroom very clean, Randolph's (Warwick Hotel restaurant) was very good. I had a king bed, own balcony, tub and separate shower. Location was great. Walking distant to Denver pavilion, 16th street mall and, and Larimer Market.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"OK, Not Great","The Warwick is outside the core, so be prepared to walk to downtown destinations.  The hotel is certainly adequate, but not outstanding and you probably need an affirmative reason to choose the location.The rooms and amenities are just what you would expect - fine, but not memorable.  If you're in Denver on business, you can certainly do better, both in terms of facilities and definitely in location.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Denver Hotel,"My stay at the Warwick was uneventful.  I stayed here for business.  The room was clean, but they changed my room from a king to a queen ""at no extra charge"".  That didn't make sense to me. The room itself was comfortable but a little small.  The shower had excellent water pressure (a big plus). The wine and cheese hour was very nice after a long day.  The staff was friendly.  The rooftop pool and workout facilities were not open during my stay.  Overall, I was pleased with the location in regards to where I needed to be for work and was within walking distance of several options for dinner and lunch.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,#1 Choice in Denver,The Warwick is my go to choice when visiting Denver. Great neighborhood far from the maddening 16th Street Mall tourist trap/homeless center. Huge rooms. Get a balcony facing west. Best service ever. Free bicycles. Take a ride to Cheesman Park. Great coffee shop 3 blocks NE. 7 - 11 2 blocks away. Great restaurants on nearby 16th Avenue. One complaint: get them to take the snacks out of the room and lock the mini bar - unless you have a lot of self control. Free computers in business center. Free coffee in lobby.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Denver,"Very expensive without any extra to offer. On top of that the room was not served until 5:00PM and we it finally did, they do not leave coffee or extra towels.Best is to stay in some of the hotels outside downtown and drive and park.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The rooftop pool is not to be missed on a cool rocky mountain summer's evening,I've frequented this property under different franchises for decades.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Comfortable, spacious hotel","We stayed in the Warwick Hotel, Denver, for two nights in May, in the course of a package journey across the States. There were delays in gaining access to our room - we arrived on an overnight train. But the room was spacious and well-equipped, and the staff helpful. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Denver's main attractions, both museums and shopping. And very close to Denver's First Presbyterial church.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,First time to Colorado ,"We arrived in Colorado thinking we were going to stay with friends, but our plane was delayed and they had work the next day so we booked a hotel through hotels tonight. I had stayed at the Warwick in NYC so I was familiar with the brand, and we got a great rate. The hotel wasn't a bad ride from the airport. When you walked in it smelled amazing and the service was super friendly even at 2 am. We needed food and they gave us a list of places we could order from late night.The lobby and entrance was nice.  The hallway leading to our room was sort of crusty. But our room was nice but slightly dated. We had an amazingly large balcony which was nice but they did not have a proper floor out there it was a rubber covering (which made me think they're doing work on it ie not finished). The room was quite large, and cozy. Big closet and lots of space. The highlight of the room for me was the bathroom, which was very nice. They provide Gilchrist & Soames shampoo conditioner and lotion which is one of my favorites. When checking out the staff was super friendly too. They are strict with their noon check out policy but they were quite nice about it. The bellmen were not only helpful but BEYOND friendly helping me with my bags to the car. This makes things a lot more pleasant ! In the elevator there was a sign for happy hour with $3 appetizers and $4-$5 beer and wine. The restaurant looked quite nice as well. I would go back to the hotel to check this happy hour out!  I rated it 4 stars based on what I paid. I got the room for  $156 and thought I 100% got my value for this. For tonight, I looked and I see a room for $356 and I do not think I would pay that rate for this hotel. If it was $200 sure but $356 is too much. I think value of the room has to do with what you pay for it in relation to what you get!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent Hotel on the up,"I have stayed with my family here several times now and am pleased to see amenities and service improving.  We enjoy the large rooms and the new paint is definately an improvement.  Pitty about the balcony condition and absence of a pool, although the manager on duty promissed before the end of the summer.  We were looking forward to this amenity, usually the main reason for staying at the Warwick, like most of our friends who escape for the weekend to Denver.  Clean rooms, nice staff and a more relaxing environment than the other downtown hotels.  we will be back once the pool is in service.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Solid four star hotel,"All rooms have their own balcony and ours was more like a suite with a huge bedroom, sofa, desk and enormous bathroom with a bath and a shower.  The room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom was immaculately clean too.  When a bottle in our mini bar shattered (because the temperature had been set too low) both housekeeping and maintenance attended very quickly and cleared up and fixed it; improving our stay.  I got some wet paint on me (from our balcony) but Mike on reception was very helpful and found some white spirit so I could clean up.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent staff,Stayed at the Warwick in beautiful Denver.

Service was excellent   we appreciated the hotel getting us into a room on arrival in the morning.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not worth the money,"Generally, a nice hotel. A little pricey for what you get. Big balcony. When we checked in, they stated that the balcony was drying from the paint but would be available within an hour. Unfortunately that was not the case. It was almost 5 hours later that we were allowed to access the balcony; and when we did, the painters has left behind quite the mess. Due to the inconvenience, the front desk guy gave us 2 free drink vouchers. We went to the hotel restaurant for happy hour and when we presented the tickets, the waiter told us the vouchers had expired in June of 2015. We had to wait for them to eventually honor as we explained we just received it that day. ",3

We immediately asked to see a better room and the next one was not any better.  The second room, like the firs had black moldy carpet on the patio, it was disgusting enough to keep us off the patio.  Called the front desk and asked for a refund, they said it was past 3:00 pm check in, so we had to pay half, this was at 2:45 pm, We then called our booking agency and asked to leave.  They were able to refund the complete amount.  Found another room at a Classy, deserving 4 star hotel.  What a nightmare.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice hotel & location,"The room was very nice, although a bit dated. The hotel had European tourists and seemed high end. The proximity to downtown was great too.

Please give this hotel a try, I don't think you'd be disappointed.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Loved it,"My husband and I drove up from Colorado Springs and found this hotel when we got there.

We were within walking distance of the few places we wanted to go to. We only ended up staying one night because we were flying home the next day. But I would absolutely come back and stay here again! (There was some construction going on in the hotel and the pool wasn't available which were bummed about, but oh well. Bad timing!)",5

The staff was extremely helpful from advising us where to get a reasonable good meal to where to walk around. The room was top rate with all amenities you want/need. Clean & Comfortable!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,nothing but DISAPPOINTED,"I booked a double bed room and paid online  (a double room is $100 expensiver than a king bed room) , however when I checked in at hotel they told me there is no double room for the first night. So I have to slept on a roller bed with a dirty blanket. Although the room is non-smoking, there are cigarette ash on balcony. The most terrible part is the bathroom, there are urine stains on toilet!!! DISGUSTING! And the most confusing thing is when I first got my room key and tried to open the door of my room, there is a stranger in my room...She said she was visiting her friend and saw the door was not closed, so she thought my room was her friend's room by mistake.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Stay,"Just had a pleasant 4 day stay at the Warwick in downtown Denver. Frankly, I would say this hotel is as good or better than all the hotels in the downtown area, including the Ritz and the Four Seasons. Why spend the extra money when you can stay at the Warwick. That's not to say it's the cheapest, but the prices are reasonable for what you get. The room I stayed in was their basic room, but quite elegant and roomy from my perspective. The bathroom was also quite superior. I believe all the rooms have a balcony and that just adds to the pleasure of the hotel.By the way, if you stay there, ask for Joseph if you need help in finding a great restaurant. He has quite a bit of knowledge in that area. I was looking for some crab cakes, but he recommended the salmon cakes at the Warwick's restaurant, Randolph's. Normally I'm not a hotel restaurant kind of guy, but this was an excellent choice. I would highly recommend the salmon cakes if you stay there. You won't go wrong staying at the Warwick in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Everything was amazing!,"From the right price to the amazing rooms that have their own balconies, everything was fantastic. Any request we made was fulfilled almost immediately. They accommodated our early check-in and late check-out! The food for breakfast and dinner was superb. Definitely will be staying here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Phenomenal customer service,"Hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. The front desk, guest services, valet, all great! I would recommend this hotel to everyone! The location is great with view overlooking downtown Denver. Thank you Warwick for the great experience!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing despite snow storm,Traveling across country with a group of friends from the UK and bus tour stopped here for the weekend.  Employees could not have been more courteous especially the reception staff.  Lovely breakfast this morning.  Would be nice if the wine and cheese could be available on Saturdays.  Wonderful arrival reception was appreciated.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A scam of a lifetime!,"WARNING! This place will scam you many times over without a care in the world. I got a holiday package through another website. They just had the one package and based on the reviews I believed I would be getting free breakfast and parking. I did not receive this and they basically acted like tough luck you should of been physic and knew about our other packages. Since they claimed it will sell out quick and I should act fast of course I didn't bother to check their website. I trusted them and that was my mistake. Then when I left the reviews finally someone contacted me. They then promised that they would cancel my reservation when I was told before that it wasn't possible, because of the special. Great.. Now almost 6 months later they STILL haven't refunded my money and will…",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Cost is good, staff is excellent, but conditions are disappointing","The pluses of this hotel are location, cost, food quality of the restaurant, and staff helpfulness and friendliness. The downsides are the worn and somewhat shabby decor, lack of attention to detail in terms of housekeeping and room equipment, and expensive food. ",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Denver,"I chose this place due to location and ease of access. All aspects were good other than the shower. Don't know if they are all handicapped accessible with a shower head at 4' high,  that's all they had available, or just uniformed of what rooms have what options. ",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good choice for business,"I stayed at this hotel for business for a few nights.  The room is specious enough with a good size balcony overlooking the city. The bed was very comfortable and clean. The shower was spacious, clean and tidy.  I didn’t like the noisy cooling and heating system in the room. The staff was friendly and helpful. It is relatively close to downtown and touristy areas. The hotel has a gym and a swimming pool but the pool was under construction during my stay. Overall I would recommend this hotel for the business crowd.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Pleasantly Surprised,"We usually head right to Boulder to spend time with our daughter.  This time we stayed 1 night in Denver.  The room was large and the bed was so comfortable and they added so many nice touches.  There was wine and cheese happy hour in the lobby, bikes available for use, a fitness center that overlooked the city and it was in a great location!  We enjoyed our time there, just wish we had more time to utilize the amenities!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Special Guest,"Trevor and the other concierges that work at this hotel are TOP NOTCH.  They gave me the ropes, guided me as to where to eat and shop and also went above and beyond to get me a car to take me to the airport.  I loved, loved my bed~it was a wonderful, comfy and clean place to catch up on sleep and treat my jet lag!  They took such good care of me that they called ME to ask me if they could pick me up at the mall where I was killing a couple hours!  So, THEY called me, arranged for the driver to come and get me and THEY packed up the car at the hotel for me!  Truly top notch employees.  My only disappointments were that they wanted to charge me for a late check out when I was using their car and paying for him to take me to the airport.  I didn't need to be in the room, but it was just a bit disappointing. The other bummer was that I could hear ALL of the talking in the room next to me :(  That is no fun.  I wish I was not in an adjoining room~so ask to be in a non-adjoining room if you don't want to hear the TV and conversations of your neighbors.  Finally--there was some incessant dripping in the bathroom!  It was in the ceiling-dripping onto the vent it sounded like.  However, I am going right back to the Warwick with my husband if I go back to Denver!!!!! I highly recommend it!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Just say ""No"" to this hotel","Downtown Denver offers a plethora of hotels. Many closer to 16th street Mall. The Warwick Denver tries to be four stars however when you combine the decay of the building, it's furnishings with the lack of customer service at the front desk culminate into a combination that says ""no"" to any reservation. Stay elsewhere!",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick Hotel - Denver,"Very nice hotel, dog-friendly. I have stayed there twice, and had an excellent experience both times. The location is great, with the Capitol and many small restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Be aware that there are many people who appear to be living on the streets in Denver. We never felt intimidated, in fact, some were quite friendly and pleasant. I will definitely stay at this hotel  again.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Exceptional Stay,"I loved the stay. The staff was amazingly helpful and friendly.I stayed for six nights, and everything went extremely smooth. Not a single complaint I could see.I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Mostly the Good News,"Good news first. Ambience was exceptional. Old fashioned charm everywhere and lobby feels like someone's living room with ample comfortable seating and huge fireplace. Very inviting. I arrived just in time to enjoy an offering of a free glass of wine and cheese samples. Tasty. In fact, all the food was top rate and delectable! No other hotel in the area offers a balcony with your room, that I could find. That is a huge feature for me and not only do they have a balcony but a table and chairs as well! The hotel has some old fashioned charm but nothing was run-down. A complimentary basket of top-rate snacks in the room along with a stocked fridge of beverages (additional charge for those, I believe) made me feel right at home. Everything worked, which is always appreciated. I never turned on the TV, though. The internet service was complimentary, fast and easy to access. As for the less than great news: the pedestal sink in the bathroom, although large and very charming, did not offer much space to set personal toiletries down. There was a small shelf on the wall to the right of the sink. I've never seen a tub/shower set up like the one seen here. At the end of the tub, instead of a wall, there was this huge box-shaped stone surface at the foot of the tub that was also enclosed by the shower curtain. I used this huge space for setting my things down but it was open to the shower itself. Handle bars for the shower and beside the toilet would have been helpful. Perhaps if I had specifically requested such assistance, they would have accommodated. The bed was okay but since I have a Sleep Number bed at home, it was difficult for me to adjust to. On the other hand, the pillows were quite luxurious. Extra pillows and blanket were provided in the closet as well as bathrobes and a safe for valuables. I made use of the desk, appreciated all of the electrical sockets available for charging items and room service for my first morning there. Again, the food and the service was perfect. Next time I need to go to Denver, this is where I will stay ~ again!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Last night in Denver,"I couldn't say enough about the Warwick Denver. Upon check-in they upgraded us to a suite. Ten minutes after arrival a tray of fresh fruit arrived as well as some water and a nice note thanking us for choosing the Warwick. Everything was clean, comfortable and close. What really set them apart in my mind was their understanding nature. A storm was hitting Denver and the mountain region last Saturday. Every airline was canceling flights and rather than checking out and having no where to stay, we asked the front desk for another night. They accommodated us without hesitation. As the afternoon came, our airline had still not canceled the flight. We took a cab to the airport and were able to fly back to NYC at 4:00 pm. Upon our arrival in NYC, we called the Warwick to let them know we would not be in the room and that we understood we would have to pay for both nights. Understanding of our situation and the weather, they agreed to only charge us for the night we stayed. The next time I am in Denver, the Warwick is the first place I will look to stay. I commend their amazing customer service and will recommend them to everyone I know going to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Good hotel, close to the City Center","Visited it in April 2016, super location, amazing staff, loved the gym. They also have free wine n cheese between 5-6 during the week, plus free coffee through out the day. The coffee machine in the room is also a super winner. Highly recommend trying the burger. Efficient room service crew.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Beautiful Hotel,I stayed 4 nights at the Warwick for business. My company prefers to use this hotel. The hotel was beautiful and very clean. Every employee I came in contact with was extremely nice and helpful. The balcony was the largest I have ever had! (I think this is true for every room). Make sure to go up to the 14th floor where the fitness center is because there is an outside area (balcony) with beautiful views! Randolph's is attached and the food was good. I really liked that you had the option to skip maid service and if you put the card on your door before 2am you received a $5 hotel credit for each day you skipped. I only had them clean my room once. The credit can be used toward your bill when you check out. I enjoyed the wine and cheese provided from 5-6pm free of charge. Several evenings there was a guitar player during this time as well.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,One night in Denver ,"My wife and I stayed here while visiting Denver overnight. The hotel was in a great location downtown. Instead of paying for the $34 valet only parking at the hotel, we parked across the street at the metered parking that is free from 6pm-9am. The hotel room was pretty nice. I liked that the room had a huge balcony. We easily walked to Coors Field to watch the Giants vs Rockies.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Missed connection and last minute stay in Denver!,"We missed our connection on a flight from SFO to Baltimore via Denver due to weather. By the time we landed in Denver it was about 10 pm. I booked this hotel last minute via my app Hotel Tonight. It was a great price for the hotel, and it looked nice in the pics from the app. The staff was great and nice even though we arrived around 11:30 pm. I was so tired that any bed at the time would have been great to sleep on. The bed was comfortable, and I slept well. The room was clean and huge. The hotel also had a great view. For a last minute stay in Denver, it was a great hotel!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Solid hotel at a great location,"This is an old old hotel that has been renovated with real charm. It has a great location that is just of the really busy zone. Its not a huge fancy hotel but a great value. VERY clean, nice bar and good restaurant.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great location and service,Warwick is a nice property with balcony on all rooms which makes it really nice. Staff is super well trained and they take their time to give us a good experience. The room was always kept clean and tidy. Will sure go back as it has great value for money for a spacious room.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fell in love with Denver!,"The start of a great trip is an awesome hotel! Thanks to the Warwick, my husband, sister and myself had an amazing time. Very nice, and in the complete walking distance of downtown. Very friendly and clean! Junior Suite was niiice,  I wish the bed had been a little more comfortable but I'm probably picky about my sleeping arrangements. And we really needed the fold out couch to work for my sister but it felt like it was going to break when we tried. All the staff was super friendly except the door guy on Sunday. (He really seemed to enjoy his job lol) Can't wait to come back and start our job and house hunting!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,We booked this hotel the day of our travel,"The value was ok for the hotel. The Warwick was exceptional in cleaniest! The only reason I rate this hotel at a 4 is because the mattress had a zippered bag on it. I know some people are ok with this, but there was only a sheet on top no mattress pad. During the night when you move the plastic would make noise and it was very hot sleeping. Great service for checking in! Another good point is the hotel was very quite for sleeping.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Good value, better than expected, convenient location","I was delighted with the comfort of the room, marble bathrooms, bath robe, complimentary breakfast and drinks.  The balcony was nice to get fresh air (view was so so), and nice to have an in room coffee maker.  The only few negative things were that the refrigerator was loud, it was hard to get stable hot water in the shower, and the plug on the desk for the computer was not working (I used the wall instead). The line to check out in the morning was long and breakfast was understaffed, but food was superb.  The location is within walking distance to the state capital and 16th street mall, so super handy.  Staff was friendly and professional.  A few little touches that would be nice would be a magnified make up mirror in the bathroom and a reading light by the bed, but all in all, I was pleasantly surprised and will be back.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"good value, don't believe pictures","+} good for walking to museum and local restaurants. Cheap balcony views. Restaurant pasta surprisingly good. - }    room large lighting/  bad. groaning HVACI would stay again, But felt like this was stuck in 1980 bc decor / device charging.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Best hotel in Denver,"Very happy with our stay at the Warwick Beautiful room with lovely amenities.  Staff are very well trained and nothing seems too much. Our room cleaner supervisor Mark was very polite and attentive. Josh at the front desk, Nicole in Randolps, Andrew and to be honest everyone was amazing. The hotel is older and could do with some modernization but its still a luxury hotel helped by staff who make  it a pleasure to stay there.     Please fix the pool! I know its being built but to me its a deal breaker.",5

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Charming, large rooms & helpful staff!","I recently visited Denver with a long-time friend. We were looking for a comfortable hotel with close proximity to restaurants and museums, and the Warwick completely surpassed our expectations! It offered such incredible value for the price point. We had a large, clean, and nicely decorated room. The hotel staff was very welcoming, and had many great recommendations for recreation and dining. The onsite restaurant had a phenomenal breakfast buffet that was included when I booked the room (with excellent coffee!). One of the best parts of our stay was the Warwick's complimentary wine and cheese happy hour. Live music, wine, cheese, and dried fruit enjoyed by the fireplace in the lobby!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great price for last minute booking + the 1 cent valet parking promo.,"Nice location, great views and yet quiet.  We spent 3 nights in ""Downtown"" Denver and wish we had booked all three with Warwick.  Next trip we shall.  The accommodations were outstanding for the price and downtown conveniences.  All attractions are a walk or short ride away.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The Warwick is not bad.,"I like the Warwick in Denver.   It's an older property, so the rooms are big and have actual balconies (i love windows that open).   The service is good and it's dog friendly...very important to me.  It's a weird  location...a couple blocks East of the downtown core...but walkable to 16 st mall, The Convention Center Larrimer Sq and Pepsi Center.  Rates are generally competitive.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent stay,"First off thank you for the amenity. It was unexpected. Quite a nice touch and issued by the hotel manager himself. Spotless room, friendly housekeeper, restaurant food delicious although service was slower than we would have liked on Easter Sunday.  Kids would have liked the pool as it was a wonderful sunny day. We live only a few hours away and travel to Denver a lot in the summer. We will be back. Very professional and sincere staff.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Friendly service, great room","Stayed there with my wife on our wedding night. The valet (Jonas) and the concierge (Kevin) were helpful, informative, and very nice. The best experience checking into a hotel I've ever had. There was no wait to check in or check out, and the valet service was fast. The suite was spacious and comfortable. We had no complaints about the hotel. The attached and associated Randolph restaurant was prohibitively expensive, however, and we decided to go elsewhere for breakfast.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A budget motel,"This hotel is a disaster! The customer service and concierge at this hotel are worse than a budget motel. In fact, I think we had nicer and more accommodating staff at budget hotels than this one.  Also, heads up to brides. Our family booked events at this hotel for a wedding weekend, and they offered us $190/night as a DISCOUNTED rate for our guests on basic rooms. Then when we booked on Orbitz it was $108/night, $80 cheaper a night. They missed out on our ENTIRE wedding block due to this misleading behavior who just went onto the third party sites to book because it was so disgusting the price gauging. Seriously, why would they mislead like this?  Then when we checked in, the staff was noticeably annoyed, short tempered, dismissive and rude when we made any requests. The front…",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great stay.,"Great stay!  I was pleasantly surprised by the personnel, service, facility as well as the comfort and quality of my room. The staff made my visit so easy and comfortable.  Breakfast was even a surprise. I ordered what I thought would be a simple bowl of oatmeal.  What I received was the best oatmeal, I've eaten... accommpanied by fresh berries, nuts, dried fruit and great coffee.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent Hotel,"I found a great last minute deal and thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  My first room request wasn'5 available, so they upgraded me to a suite for free.  Beautiful accommodations and friendly staff.  Free parking behind the hotel.  Loved Randolph's, the hotel restaurant as well.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very Professional Staff and Spotless,"A nice surprise given the look of the hotel on some of the sites.  The staff could not have been more accommodating.  Our housekeeper was very friendly and asked us several times how he could help.  Bell guys are super friendly and a wealth of information.  Pity about the pool, although we were aware before we booked of its closure it would have been nice.  We will certainly be back and will let our company Emerald oil know that we should all be staying in this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Couples night away,"The only negative we can say about this place is that the bed was harder than we like; otherwise, everything else was great! The room we had was very spacious and clean. We purchased the room and breakfast option, which was a great deal. It provided us with breakfast for two at Randolph's, which is the restaurant attached to the hotel. We would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing,Stayed here for a night while on a cross country road trip. The hotel is in a great area and we had a great city view. Unfortunately there is only valet parking for $35/night so it took a while to find metered parking and the pool was closed for maintenance but otherwise it was an amazing stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Outstanding Customer Service!!!!,"Absolutely everyone I came in contact with (i.e. reservations, check in, interactions with employees, etc.) during my stay at the Warwick was positive.   I truly felt welcomed. Dog friendly. My only suggestion for improvement would be that the mini-fridge was loud enough to be a distraction.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Old world glamour, phenomenal service. dog friendly!","I had no idea what to expect from the Warwick, in all of my overnight stays in Denver, we had never stayed there.  The staff was exceptional, friendly and helpful.  The room was charming and really clean.  I loved the marble in the bathrooms, the fun art and the furniture, it was refreshing to be a hotel that is not a big box chain.  The staff & hotel were incredibly accommodating for our dog as well, there is a little park across the street as well as a larger one about two blocks away.  They had treats and water waiting for my dog in the lobby as well.  All in all, I can't wait to go back to the Warwick!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Denver Stay,We visited this hotel for the NCAA tournament weekend and it was a very nice hotel with a great location to attractions/shopping nearby.  The rooms were extremely spacious and could have held an entire family!  Was disappointed that the beds were double and not queen.  Just a little small.  ;.(   We visited the restaurant and the bar and both were very nice and friendly.  The service in the restaurant was rather slow but if you are not in a hurry you would probably be okay.  Had to ask for refills on drinks. (water).   The bar was much better but probably because we were sitting right at the bar.   Food was very good and filling.  ,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Comfortable with Amazing Service!!!,We loved everything about the Warwick!! From the very moment we pulled up and were greeted by valet to the second we left we were treated royally. The entire staff was very friendly and always helpful!! The hotel is also very cozy and is in a great location. ,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Memorable Night at the Warwick,"Such a lovely hotel, but what makes this place really special is the staff. They are amazing, especially Joshua! The beds were extremely comfortable, the balcony was a really nice feature, and the location was great. I will definitely be staying here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Disappointed by condition of room,"Was really looking forward to staying at this hotel, but unfortunately, it left a lot to be desired for the almost $200 per night we paid.  The room was not cleaned properly, and there was a clearly visible empty wine bottle from the minibar on the floor next to the night stand that was left from the last occupant.  After two days, it was still there when I checked out.  The faucet in the bathroom leaked all over the counter.  The toiletries were not refreshed each day.  A 12"" section of the wallpaper was peeled back on the bathroom wall.  The wooden front of the vanity was thick with dust and grime.  On the positive side, the bed was very comfortable and the staff at the front desk were very friendly.  Unfortunately, I was overcharged by almost $30 a night, but the front desk was able to quickly adjust the bill.  Ate breakfast in the restaurant, and they had only one server working, and the restaurant was very full.  We waited almost 45 minutes for our food and the manager had to help bring out dishes.  What a shame.  With better staffing and some renovation, this could be a really nice hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great experience in a nice hotel on short notice.,"Neat, clean, great staff.  We did call the property to make a reservation and they quoted a rate that was 63.00 higher than online.  They wouldn't budge when I told them, so I hung up and made a reservation on line.  Geesh!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Short stay in Denver,"I stayed at the Warwick for a quick 3 night business trip and had an excellent experience. The location is easy to get to and has great amenities, including a gym that looks out over downtown Denver. Service was excellent, specifically the staff were very courteous and helpful. The room was very large and had everything I could have needed and more. I would highly recommend if you are visiting Denver especially given the central location and proximity to nearby attractions and great local restaurants.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,less than expected.,"facility, food and staff all less than expected. it was nice to be downtown and within walking distance of many things to do; however, I am unlikely to recommend this to anyone and unlikely to return.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Spring Vacation,Loved our stay. Loved the entire atmosphere of hotel. Loved the wine and cheese happy hour every night. Great location in downtown Denver. Near all attractions. Nice walks or quick Uber trips. We will definitely be back if ever in the area.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"A bit disappointed for a ""luxury"" hotel",Be sure to call and confirm that the roof top pool is open. Self-parking is not available and there's an additional fee for valet parking.Very comfortable beds and the balcony experience is wonderful. The room is spacious and elegantly decorated.,3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A find in Denvr,"This hotel turned out to be far beyond my expectations. it is well located, and a great price. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well appointed.  The quality of the linens was impressive---super soft large towels.  More importantly the hotel hat the three most critical qualities in a hotel.  Clean, comfortable, and friendly staff.as for the staff, I cannot say enough about how friendly and helpful they were. they were also well groomed---from the desk clerks to the valet.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Made me feel special,"During my entire stay, I was treated with respect and made to feel special,  The room was clean and spacious.

I love to take advantage of the year round heated roof top pool.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Thank you Warwick,"One word sums up our entire experience - awesome! Check in was a breeze, breakfast at the Randolph is great & the super friendly staff made sure that everything we asked for was delivered with a smile.Next time, hopefully will again get the 14th floor and its panoramic views of Denver's skyline!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Excellent location, very satisfying stay.",The staff are the friendliest of any hotel at which I've stayed. The room was very comfortable. The ambiance of the hotel was classy and elegant while still maintaining the casual feel of Colorado. The location is central to everything so walking everywhere was very easy. I will definitely stay at this hotel again when we are in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Quick but rejuvenating stay!,"We enjoyed an unplanned stay at the Warwick after we missed our flight from Denver to LA due to snow-related traffic. Our ""4-hour"" drive from Aspen to Denver turned out taking 10.5 hours; we were exhausted & stressed to say the least. Although it was 8pm, Jo quickly checked us in & was super accommodating. The rooms were large & the beds were amazingly comfortable. Jo was sincerely empathetic through-out the check-in process & gave us breakfast vouchers for the next day. Our night at the hotel definitely took the edge off a very long day!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Outstanding Service at an Affordable Cost,I could not have asked for a better hotel.  Everything was first class -- from the moment we entered and were greeted by the front desk personnel.  Our room was the best.  We had a separate bedroom and living room area.  I really enjoyed the balcony with a downtown view.  We used a lot of room service and the personnel was always prompt and helpful.  The room was very clean and spacious.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.  You will not be disappointed.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very good older hotel,So not ritzy on shiny but excellent service within short walk to Capitol and convention center . Free bottled water at the front desk makes the dehydration Denver issue non existent . Great Bar . Comfortable beds . Free wifi if you sign up for their newsletter . Will definitely stay again,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good but not great,"Hotel staff was great. The only drawback to that was the maid service. Every day, all they did was throw the sheet back on and cover it. Really unprofessional for a hotel of this stature. Really enjoyed the Manager's reception from 5-6pm. Wine and snacks. Very impressed. The valet personnel was also very friendly.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent hotel!,"Very nice, clean hotel. The staff was super friendly too! The only complaint I could have is the cost of valet. However, it's to be expected in larger cities. The hotel itself was beautiful! I would definitely recommend a stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Old country elegance,"I stayed at the Denver Warwick for a long weekend. It impressed me as a quietly elegant, graceful hotel. The room was large, spacious and pleasantly decorated. The bathroom was also spacious and well appointed. The front desk staff were all pleasant and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Staff made me feel like a celebrity,"i have never been given such warm and hospitable service in all my years of travel.  From the unexpected welcome from the general manager, (hand written),with beautiful fruit tray and fresh water to the warm and charming smiles from everyone i came into contact with.  simply put - a true gem.. who would have known given the look of the building and aged furnishings.  I highly recommend this hotel. Personalized service warm somewhat ""younger"" service pushing to make you happy.  It was good to see  staff so relaxed yet highly responsive.   My only negative comment is that the wine and cheese although free could be better presented.  The guy serving was so friendly and charming, but i think the management should arrange a more luxurious selection of cheese etc.   A wonderful hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,OLD HOTEL CHARM but DATED,"For the price, this hotel was not bad at ALL! It had the all important balcony for a successful Denver experience, nice spacious one bedroom suite, and ample parking close by for a cost and also meter parking. The room service was affordable and very good and the staff members were nice and friendly. The restaurant was nice and clean and nice food options and a great price. The only things I would change are things that may not be able to be changed due to the age of the hotel. This hotel was about $140/night with the room upgrade. It was well worth it as it is in downtown. The elevators are old and dated however I believe they kept that old hotel charm and rolled with it well. The rooms were comfy, but the ceiling height was very low. Overall I would stay again and think it was a great value!",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Will come back,"The hotel is not very distinct from outside, but when you get in, the lobby is well designed, comfortable and spacious.  The check-in was quick and informative.  I stayed in a junior suite on the 14th floor and it was a great room. Quite plenty of space in the living area and the bedroom.  Modern spacious bathroom. Like the walkin shower that I used. There was also a bathtub I did not use.  My only complaint is lack of plugs around the bed. Wifi was free and at very good speed. I will be back to stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Herman Jo Roque (aka Jo) was the best!!!!,"The front desk clerk, Jo, went out of his way to accommodate my requests to extend my stay.  With a tall task before him and a continuous smile on his face, he was able to extend my stay for 2 more nights when all my other efforts failed!!!  He made my business visit to Denver something to look forward again.  Warwick should be proud to have a representative that is as dedicated and hard working as Jo!!!!  I will definitely be staying at Warwick Denver again and recommending it!!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,excellent hotel,"the hotel is an excellent place to stay for business as well as vacation. it is close to every spot in the downtown area. besides, its restaurant and facilities are great. but one specific thing is their employees. they have excellent customer service. I give them A+",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Loved this hotel!,"Kevin at the front desk is awesome when we got there a night early, he even upgraded us to a suite for our honeymoon.. the staff was very nice and knowledgeable. I would recommend the Warwick to anyone looking for a classy establishment with a classy staff. Very happy with our stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Travels to enver,The Warwick Denver is an excellent hotel.  Their customer service starts at the front door when you start your stay -- and ends as your walk out the front door for your departure.  All staff is customer service trained and they make your stay delightful.  They are pleasant and seem to genuinely care about me the customer.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Luxury, Location, Price","Warwick is located in the heart of downtown Denver, walking distance to many bars and restaurants. It's also a short ride (little over a mile) away from the Coors Field. Front Desk is super helpful with directions and anything else you might need.The hotel also offers free wine and beer happy hour every night until 6pm with live music in the lobby.Parking is probably the worst thing about this hotel. They're valet only for $38 a night. We were there on a weekend so we just found street parking. But any other time, I imagine it might be a little difficult to arrange affordable parking nearby.We only spent a night here but the service was great. The room was gorgeously classic and spacious with a very comfy bed. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great experience ,Stephanie fielded my call due to me booking through a 3rd party website and she made it right for us. I'm very grateful to have someone who worked with me. We need more people like Stephanie who are creative and make it work. We very much look forward to our visit next week in the mile high suite.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great option in the city,The rooms at Warwick Denver Hotel are pretty big compared to other properties. My room had a separate area for coffee and tea amenities. The closet and bathroom are located right at the entrance and a half-wall separates the bed which gives the feeling of a suite. The bedroom itself is quite big and verandah is a nice feature. The bed is comfortable but the pillows are small and soft (others may prefer this). The hotel needs some upgrading as signs wear and tear are already showing. The hotel's staff takes great steps to ensure that guests feel welcome.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great employee's,"Stephanie, the reservation clerk, is fantastic.  She did a great job reserving our room and providing us with information on rooms and the benefits of the Warwick. We look forward to staying at the Warwick of Denver, again.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great time in Denver!!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Warwick Denver Hotel and were very impressed!!  From the great room we had, to the welcoming staff. Loved the location!  It was our first visit to  Denver and I know we will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A rare blend of high quality and warmth in a downtown prestigious hotel.,"My stay at the Denver Warwick hotel was outstanding and will count as one of the best of any of the fine hotels I have stayed in. It was also surprisingly the best rate for the location and quality received. My standard room with king was huge and bright. The general atmosphere was more intimate than that of the better known hotel chains and provided exceptional quality, comfort and friendly service for a very affordable price in a premium downtown location.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Stopping through Denver,"We were given a warm welcome by the front desk manager, Jo, who went above and beyond to make sure our stay was enjoyable. He upgraded us to a deluxe suite for free, gave us free wifi, and sent us a birthday gift. Before we went out for the night, he gave us dinner recommendations in the area. Would definitely come back and recommend others!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great stay,"My wife and I stayed here for Valentine's Day 2016. The hotel is very clean, staff is very friendly and is a short walk to downtown 16th st mall area. We would definitely stay here again. The only downside was the pool was being redone so it was closed and also there was some construction at the hotel but we didn't even notice it until we went outside. ",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Clean moderately priced hotel with some pluses.,"We booked this room as an Expedia mystery rate. Always take a chance doing this, but we were actually pleasantly surprised. Other reviewers complain about the required valet fee of $34, but your staying in Downtown Denver, what do you expect.  The valet's are friendly and helpful, and will go grab something out of your car if you want. Your within a short walk and the downtown Mallride which gets you to pretty much any restaurant, bar or attraction in the central downtown area for free.  We saved the $34 on Uber's. The rooms are spacious, the bathroom is clean and roomy with a nice large mirror. The hotel decorations are vintage and interesting. They allow you to bring Fido for free and offer treats, water bowls and beds for free. (There is a nice park across the street and a…",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very nice location,We had a king room on the 8th floor that was both roomy and comfortable with a nice sized balcony.  The staff was very helpful and polite.  The hotel was within walking distance of the wedding we attended.  This was convenient because street parking (free on weekends) was hard to find and it was nice to not have to always jump in the car.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Inhospitable...,"Before going to a reception at the Warwick, I noticed that there was only valet parking.  I called the hotel, told them that I was driving an expensive sports car, didn't feel comfortable handing my keys to some kid and asked if there was any other parking alternative available.  The answer was a very curt ""Meters on the street!"" and the phone went dead.  I walked to the hotel after finding alternative parking with which I felt comfortable and went to the reception.  The organization that invited me said that there would be food and drinks and when I went to get something to eat, lo and behold, there were only crumbs to be had.  I asked a hotel service person if they were going to re-stock the buffet, I was again answered with a really curt ""NO.""  I really don't know why the…",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A beautiful hotel and a great value,"The Warwick Hotel is a wonderfully kept property in a nice ""historic"" neighborhood of Denver. Easy to walk anywhere downtown or to the Capitol and museums from there. Randolphs' restaurant is excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great!,"The Warwick is always amazing.  The fact that all of the rooms have balconies is very nice, great views of downtown if you are able to get a room on the west side of the building.  Service is fantastic as well!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Location - Large Rooms,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Warwick last weekend.  We were shocked at the size of the rooms and balcony - both were very large.  The rooms were very clean and the staff very helpful.  We chose the hotel based on location and we very pleased.  As we had no car, this was a perfect location.  The hotel was a 8-10 minute walk to the 16th Street Mall and about 15-20 to Larimer Square.  I would definitely stay at the Warwick again without hesitation.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Best urban living in the city!  Crazy friendly staff.,"We stayed at the Warwick last weekend having no idea when we booked the vacation we'd be celebrating a Broncos Super Bowl win with thousands of our closest friends!  The rooms were more than adequate, the valet car service was consistently convenient, the bar and lobby areas were comfortable day and night.  That said, what impressed us the most was the over-the-top customer service displayed by the entire staff--from front desk, to valets, to bartenders.  Not only was the staff helpful and friendly to us during our stay, it became evident these people actually like each other and take pride in working at the Warwick.  Kudos to the entire staff!  We will return!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Old School luxury at a reasonable price,"Large room. Large balcony. Nice view. Friendly staff. Nice old fashioned touches like huge walk in closet, Bathrobes & free wine & cheese in lobby with fireplace. Also the happy hour at hotel bar was fun & a bargain",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Everything was perfect,"We stayed here for only one night and wish we could have stayed longer.  The hotel is lovely, our accommodations were beautiful and comfortable and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.  The food and service in the bar and the restaurant were outstanding.  The Calamari we ordered was delicious and I've never seen portions so generous.  The breakfast was delicious and there were some very interesting and different selections on the menu.  Both  my husband and I were sorry that we had to checkout!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fine...,"I stayed at the Warwick on a business trip last year.  My first time in Denver, but it was recommended by a colleague as a good value.  And, true, it kept us within budget and was very serviceable, but the hotel really needed a makeover.  The rooms are a nice size, clean and well-kept, but very dated. (Think 1970s browns and maroons.)  The balcony space also could have been very nice, but was kind of grubby and not at all inviting.   Plus, the wifi was pretty buggy and inconsistent, making work a little difficult.  I was only there for two nights - and it was fine - but I will definitely look for other options the next time I'm in Denver. ",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Stay,"At check-in they surprised us by upgrading us to a suite with a bottle of wine & fruit platter waiting for us in the room - it was lovely! The pool is under construction, so that's a bummer, but other than that it was great.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful as well.  ",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Probably the best hotel we've ever stayed at,"Flawless. My husband surprised me with a trip to one of my favorite cities. We just had a very rough trip to get to Denver (missed a flight, lost wallet). We were so happy to finally arrive at the hotel. Jo at the reception desk was just amazing. We told him our story as I'm sure we looked a little rough! He went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. It was a nice relief to finally feel comfortable!  Each day during the week they have a wine and cheese reception from 5-6. This was so nice to arrive to. We sat by the fire in the lobby and enjoyed this. The lobby is such a nice calm, relaxing atmosphere and the decor is beautiful. This is also a pet friendly hotel so they had a dog dish with treats and water in the lobby as well. They also have a small gift…",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wonderful!,What a lovely place! I loved learning about the history of this hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The room was clean and fresh. The price was terrific. (Park for a Penny was a great benefit!) The location was central to many attractions. I would definitely choose to stay here again in the future!!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A Gem... But a bit dusty,"The Warwick Denver is clearly a great hotel. My very spacious, very clean room included a balcony and a small pantry. The bed was comfortable and I slept like a log. Breakfast (excellent) was included with my room.   The odd parts- 1) I was asked to,sign a lengthy no-smoking statement at check-in (I don't smoke, but it was longer than normal and still have no idea what it said). 2)The safety lock fell apart in my hands as I tried to latch it, and 3) The floor covering on the balcony was all bunched up and seemed dirty. They had a nice set of tables and chairs out there, but it all seemed dirty.   The great parts of the hotel clearly were remarkable, but the odd parts made me wonder if The Warwick was on the way up or on the way down.   I will stay at the Denver Warwick again as…",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice clean and friendly hotel,"Friendly staff. Large room but a bit ill configured with the TV not really usable from the bed. The bathroom was a bit outdated with tub/shower combo and the shower head chest high. Large comfortable bed but noisy starchy sheets. Included a delicious breakfast at the adjacent restaurant, Randolphs.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent service and very clean,"I stayed at the Warwick for business the week of Jan11-Jan15.  The staff was helpful and my room was very roomy and clean.  Location was great.  The complementary breakfast was much better than the usual buffet at other hotels.  Being able to sit down at the restaurant was great.  Our server, Erica, was so sweet every morning.  Thanks to Mike at the front desk for his help with my airline check in as I am not very travel savvy.  I would definitely recommend the Warwick.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Absolutely love this hotel! ,"We had a wonderful stay! It's our 4th time spending our vacation at this hotel. Every time we return the service exceeds our expectations. Britton was wonderfully accommodating and even remembered us from our last visit. The hotel was fully booked when we arrived, which was a few hours before check in. No rooms of the type we reserved were ready at that time. Britton informed is that we could upgrade to a suite for a fraction of the price. It was a wonderful recommendation and worth every extra penny! The room was beautiful and wonderfully appointed. Our only gripe was the room service. It's our 3rd time ordering room service and previously we were completely satisfied. The service was wonderful and very quick. Our room service attendant (didn't catch her name) was extremely attentive and explained our dishes to us perfectly. My order was the farfalle carbonara. It was not actually made with farfalle and the dish itself was not good, very plain and did not meet expectations. It unfortunately even left me with an upset stomach for the remainder of the night. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and look forward to visiting again!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing Staff Makes for 5 Stars,"The Warwick in Denver feels a bit run-down from the outside, but once inside you'll forget all about first looks--because the service is incredible. EVERY staff member went above and beyond to help my wife and me during our stay, which was appreciated especially because it was our first night as Denver residents. They made us feel right at home. Thanks!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very elegant,My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at the Warwick Hotel. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite and felt like VIP guests. The room was large and clean and the view of downtown Denver was amazing. Looking forward to our next visit!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent January Stay,We really enjoyed this hotel. Service was through the roof! Only a very short walk from the main restaurants and the hotel is in a quieter part of downtown. nice dog friendly staff and the chowder in the restaurant is award winning.    Excellent staff and clean quarters. a must for a relaxing winter visit.   Wine in the lobby fire side. romantic.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"I found the corner suite to be lovely, quiet and comfortable","I had the pleasure of staying at the lovely Warwick Hotel in 2015. My room was a corner suite with a beautiful view of downtown and the mountains from the balcony. I found my stay to be very comfortable – the bed was fluffy and soft and I slept like a baby, the bathroom was roomy and the common area was classy, and I think my favorite part of the suite was the balcony. The area around the hotel offers just about everything you could want for a night on the town. I would definitely stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Simply Outstanding Service,"A business trip cut short by a problem back home and we needed a lot of assistance and arrangements. It is unusual for a hotel to be so attentive and on the ball.  Excellent service from the serverice people from Mary in Room Service to Danny the luggage attendant. It was nice to have a large clean room in which i could work.  On the not so good, the lighting is terrible and the balcony is in need of attention.  The business center while free and well equipped is too small. I suggest moving it to a station in the lobby where it is easily available and not hidden away.  It is a busines hotel after all ?     A very good hotel with some small things that will make it a top pick.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great place to stay in Downtown Denver,"Very much enjoyed my stay at the Warwick in downtown Denver.  Staff was great.  Polite, helpful and even opened the doors for me.  I've stayed here before and will likely stay more in the future.  No complaints whatsoever.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Charming hotel in a cool neighborhood with great staff,"The Warwick is in the Uptown area of Denver, a short walk to the 16th St. Mall as well as other nearby eateries and bars. Front desk staff was amazing, especially Britton. He recommended an awesome spot where we watched the AFC Championship  (Go Broncos!) We loved the cozy room, bed was very comfortable and the robe was a nice touch too. We also enjoyed the rooftop fitness center with fresh citrus water. The little and big things they do to make their guests feel welcome here don't go unnoticed. Thanks again Britton and all of the Warwick staff!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very Friendly and Convenient,"It's an older hotel, but the staff works hard to keep it pleasant and clean. It's also safe and secure--which is important to me--and conveniently located within walking distance to downtown.  As I was checking out, a couple commented, ""We always stay here when we come to Denver. Everyone is so nice."" I agree.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing staff made our weekend,"We, ( 5 girls on a Co Ski Trip), can not say enough about the staff at the hotel.  The valet guys were always willing to provide directions and cool places to visit. Beautiful large room with soft sheets and lux soaps and shampoo.  if you are leaving early as we did today, no fear, free coffee in the lobby with bottles of water.  Dinner was good in the restaurant but there are also nice places close by.  Ask the door guys.   The hotel is a short walk from the 16th street strip and very easy to get to.  Wine and cheese in the evening sitting in front of the fire place was quite special.  My girl friends and I are on a ski trip and are heading home today and will miss the friendly faces. Warwick is the best hotel we have stayed in so far on this Colorado trip. We highly recommend.  Ask for a corner suite when booking.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent downtown location,"This property has been everything from condos, to an array of hotel chains, to the Playboy Club (on the top floor) back in the day.  Currently it is an upscale but moderately priced hotel with good service, very friendly staff and a nice restaurant with private meeting rooms.  The rooms and bathrooms have been updated to a high standard. Our 6th floor room had a nice view of the city rather than the mountains, but mountain view can be requested when making a reservation.  Because of the many transformations and renovations of this property, our room had an odd space devoted to the coffee maker and mini-fridge.  Everything was in good order (except the always prone to problems) sliding doors on the closet.  There is limited in both hours and supply street parking, and the daily valet parking rate is $34, but in a downtown location that is not uncommon.  If your stay doesn't demand a car, then the location is perfect for walking just about anywhere downtown.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great hotel in downtown Denver,Very nice room at a reasonable price for the location. Comfortable beds and sitting area. Very nice lobby area. Seem to be pet friendly. The upper floors with the balcony are great and have nice views of downtown.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Average At Best,"Fairly clean but worn & mediocre food in restaurant/bar - we expected a bit better for the price, and the fact that it was a bit off the beaten path.  2 plus points - the bartender in the restaurant (made a good drink and very service oriented - seems he worked our entire stay), and the bed was comfortable.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Stay at the Warwick Denver,Highly recommend if you are looking for a cozy hotel in downtown Denver. Within walking distance of drug store and 16th Street mall which is full of great restaurants and shopping. Can't wait to come back!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,awsome stay,"decided to take my wife for a romantic birthday get-away, decided on the warwick hotel since it is close to the 16th street mall. what an experience!! everyone was so great. everything was 1st class, from check-in to the spacious rooms. definitely will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,always quality,we don't make it to denver all that often.  but when we can stay at the warwick we are always completely satisfied.  from the front desk check in to the concierge guys to the really comfortable room..never disappointing!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Perfect location, classy hotel","The Warwick is a great location for visiting the Colorado State Capitol or downtown events.  It's a block or two out of the congestion of downtown traffic, but within easy walking distance.  The rooms are large, and sliding doors onto private balconies make it easy to get fresh air.  The staff is very helpful and accommodating.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Super nice hotel off the beaten path,"Great hotel...Was there for 33 wedding anniversary.  Nice staff, nice room.  Had no car, used the 16th street FREE bus service to see downtown.  Lots to do.  Walked a lot, would love to come back when its warmer.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick Hotel,We celebrated my husband's 60th birthday there and the Warwick couldn't of been more accommodating thank you so much great place to stay good location . They also had entertainment in the lobby and a complimentary wine and cheese spread! We loved that!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great stay in the heart of Denver,We arrived 2 hours before the actual check in time and rhe room was ready. It was on the 9th floor with an amazing view of downtown. It was a king room and it was spacious and very bright. The bed was heavenly comfortable. We had a great time.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent Accommodations in Downtown Denver,"Had to go to Denver for three nights for business earlier this week.  Arrived in town around 10:30-11am.  The official check in time was 3pm.  I figured I could drop my bags and then bop around town a bit before getting into my room.  I was pleasantly surprised when they said they had a room ready for me right away.  I was able to settle into the room, freshen up from my flight, and then explore the nearby Capitol area.  My room was spacious, clean and well appointed.  The bed was very comfortable.  The only downside was trying to get the temperature just right, but it wasn't too bad.  I did have breakfast at the hotel restaurant (Randolph's) and the breakfast burrito was delicious.  I also found the complimentary morning coffee in the lobby to be very good as well.  It was a good overall value and I would consider staying there again, should I find myself in Denver in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great location for exporing Denver at a reasonable price,"We stayed at the Warwick for a couple of nights after arriving in the USA and before travelling on.Downtown Denver is an easy walk from the Hotel which is located in a quieter part of town. Although we only booked a standard room it was extremely spacious and very comfortable. Unfortunately, the rooftop pool was out of action for repairs when we stayed which was a bit disappointing but beyond the control of the hotel who did their best to make up for the inconvenience. Overall would recommend The Warwick.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great,Great hotel. Great staff great service great food great location great neighborhoodWe stay every time we come to DENVER.. Never been disappointed Walk to LODO walk to several great LOCAL eateries and the best Coffee in Colorado,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,great bithday trip,Went to Denver with my wife on a business trip and was booked into the Warwick.  The staff was extremely helpful. We received some great recommendations for places to eat and places to see.  On my birthday the hotel gave me a bottle of Champaign and a plate of fruit and candy.  Room was nice and staff was wonderful . We will stay here again when we return to Denver,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Second Visit!,"The first time we stayed at the Warwick was our first vacation together as a couple. We arrived later than planned and the front desk was kind enough to upgrade our room for us. I booked it for our 5 wedding anniversary thinking it was be a great trip. Everything seemed to be the same as our first trip, not many updates had been made. The TV seemed to be the biggest upgrade. It was very clean and the staff is amazing. The room could use some help. As it was March in Colorado we did not get to use the pool but did walk up and was clean. For the price I don't know that I would recommend it without some upgrades or perks.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A great stay,"I've stayed at the Warwick twice. Both times greeted with knowledgable, excellent staff. The rooms very comfortable, and the bar and restaurant excellent. This is a hotel that is non-fussy, but excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Best hotel in Denver!,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this place! The staff is very attentive and does everything to make your stay a delight and memorable.  Jo at the front desk, Daniel the manager and all of the valet guys greet you by name and make you feel at home.  The rooms are very spacious and the beds are very comfortable, the balconies are very large and have nice views. The pool deck on the top floor provides the best views of the city!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,One day stay,Excellent service and food. They were able to get me a super early check-in and additionally upgraded me to a suite which was very spacious. Also kept bringing me treats like fruit plates which was really nice. Good location. Definitely exceeded expectations.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Wonderful hotel, staff, and accommodations!","My boyfriend and I stayed at the Warwick and had an excellent stay. We chose the hotel for its location relative to the Fillmore Auditorium, but we were delighted with every aspect of our one night stay. Clean and big room, pet friendly with no extra fees, reasonably priced for college students, complimentary candy and snacks in room, and the friendliest staff we've had compared to any other hotel we've been to. Extremely happy we chose to stay at the Warwick and would recommend to anyone!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Loved the hotel, staff, and amenities!","This hotel is in the heart of Downtown Denver (well...as far as I know) with an incredible staff! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the balcony looked very ratty with a wet, crumpled up ""carpet"" on the ground. The balcony itself was nice, in terms of space and view, it's just that carpet was nasty. One of the elevators was a bit sketchy as well, but not too bad. Other than that, this hotel was fantastic! The staff was extremely nice and helpful. From check-in to check-out, they were there for whatever we needed. They even delivered us complimentary fruit upon our arrival. There was a complimentary wine tasting in the lobby from 5-6, which was nice. I don't have a bad thing to say about the staff or the hotel itself, other than that balcony carpet. I would definitely recommend this hotel when looking to stay in Denver! We were able to walk around wherever we wanted to go! If you're not a fan of walking, there's a free bus that takes you around Denver! This hotel is great! Book it!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing staff and location,"We stayed here from Dec 30th for 3 nights and had a really good time.  The room had a new carpet which was obvious given the smell of carpet in the room.  Overall very clean room with snug bed and sheets. New Years eve was a good dinner with an excellent wine selection. They did a good job of keeping our glasses full.   Very upset to find that the pool was closed.  We were told it would be open by the internet site we booked through so this was unfair to us.  When we got to the hotel we were told if would be opening in the spring as it is under renovations.  Lobby was beautiful and very good to see how friendly the staff are to dogs. This is a definite plus as we often travel with our pets.  staff are really quite remarkable. Danny in parking department, Wan and Ben at the concierge were all exceptional  The housekeeper was nice and as we had the privacy request on the door always came to us and offered soap and shampoo which was a nice touch.  The balcony was a let down.  If the weather was good we would have liked to sit out there but it is not inviting.  Overall a really good hotel with some small things that can be improved with a little bit of capach.  We will be back in the summer and look forward to bringing the hound, the hotel was inexpensive and if this is the case in June we will certainly enjoy the good value again.  BJS",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great value and location,"You cannot beat this hotel for the value price, coupled with a great, walkable location and 2- 2 1/2 block walk to some great and varied restaurants. This multi story older building sits atop a ( small) hill, close to the Capitol and within 5 -10 minutes walking to the 16th St mall promenade shopping and dining mecca. It is also a much shorter jaunt to the eclectic independent restaurants of 17th street. The hotel, built in the 1960's, has a more 1940's feel in the rooms ( lobby is updated and traditional, with a fireplace, many lounging areas and evening wine and cheese). Rooms are relatively large and many have patio balconies that were sunny ( on the Grant St side) with chairs and a small table, accessible by charming french doors. The draperies and carpets could use a cleaning and repair, bathroom needed a deep cleaning in the corners, shoring up of wallpaper etc, and all would take minimal effort to make this truly a top notch location. One downside was paper thin walls and reverberating loud naturally-slamming doors. This is a pet friendly hotel, and tho we were told that we did not have a pet approved room, it was evident that a short haired white dog had frquented the outdoor patio...a few hairs inside, but otherwise the room was very clean. The workout room has amazing views and was a pleasure to use. The staff was friendly and generally helpful except for on one front-- the bellmen controlling access to the ""shuttle"" , which is essentially a car that is sporadically available per the largesse of the bellmen. We stayed at the Warwick for a wedding nearby and were told that there was a hotel shuttle, and that reservations were recommended. Upon check in, we asked the front desk about the rcommended reservations. And so the runaround began: Front desk: ""Ask the bellmen. They are the ones who drive the courtesy car"" . Bellman (Jonas): We dont know if we will be available. The front desk might have a big event tomorrow with things for us to do. Ask again tomorrow at the front desk. Following day, front desk: We dont do the scheduling, that is left to the bellmen. Back to the bellmen. Bellman: (same one): Oh yes, we have a list, let's see if we have the time you want. And you know it's not a shuttle, right? It 's a car operated on gratuities. "" Well, we got our ride to the wedding ( by a different bellman, and he was happy to oblige). He stated to call when we needed to get picked up, which we did, only to be informed that one of the bellmen had already gone home, so no one could come pick us up. Sigh. Should have gone Uber from the get-go and saved time and exasperation from employees who clearly avoided ""courtesy car"" duty. On the subject of cars, the $28 valet only parking ( which we heard was going up in 2016) can be circumvented by free, and largely available, street parking on weekends and holidays. On weekdays, use your car to go around town, then return to the meters after 6 ( free but until the next am), or can periodically feed the Grant St meters in two hour increments. Dont know why the parking is so expensive, ( other than they can) as the Warwick has a plentiful two levels of subterranean parking . So cars in general bring the rating down a bit, but in general, the majority of the staff, convenience, location, lovely lobby wine hours and price make the Warwick hard to beat as an overall package.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice downtown/midtown hotel,"Nice clean room. I had a balcony view of downtown. The gym, which is very nice has a fabulous view! It is on the 15th floor. There is valet parking only which is a bit pricey but it is covered so your car stays clean The restaurant-Randolph's has good food. The hotel offers wine early evening and music. Lots of restaurants walking distance as well.Only about 2 miles from city park for runners, which is also nice.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Incredible home away from home!,"I had booked the Warwick for my ""mini-cation"" based upon a prior visit.  It is ideal for a little ""pampering"" time.  The service was absolutely top- notch. I was arriving in Denver  early in the morning- way too early for check in time. I called the hotel to see if it would be possible to drop my bags off at the hotel, so that I could go do some sight seeing without lugging my bag. The receptionist ( whose name I forgot...I apologize) couldn't have been any more welcoming. I explained my situation and she said that it would be no problem. In fact, she assigned a room for me ( awesome view) and told me that I could check in when I arrived! When I got to the hotel, I met Kevin- who had me checked in to the hotel, and seeing that I had been there before, offered some suggestions for things to do. Everyone was incredibly incredible!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Rated 5 Stars,"The Warwick Hotel was perfect for accomodations and locatlion for my stay in Denver.  I chose it due its location to my daughter's apartment complex - about 2 blocks.  The rates were exceptional for most nights of my stay.  New Year's Eve was a very expensive night, but to be expected.  My best compliment goes to the maid staff.  They are exceptional doing little things that really made a difference.  The entire hotel is extremely clean - the halls and room smelled fresh all the time.  The in-house restaurant was competitively priced with excellent food.  We had the New Year's and Sunday Buffet and it was exceptional, fresh, quality food.  The staff were attentive without being bothersome.  I will most definitely stay there again for all of these reasons.  I have NOT returned to a hotel due to cleanliness or rudeness before.....with the Wariwick it is the maid service and cleanliness that will bring me back first, the location of the hotel, the food and the friendliness of the entire hotel staff.  I rate this hotel my own 5 star rating - BEST.     I only rated one category 4 stars vice 5 and that is the sleep quality.  The mattress was not UNcomfortable once I found an area where people have normally laid upon.  The other parts of the mattress were very hard and not to my liking, so it took 2 nights of adjusting where I laid on the mattress and then I slept pretty well.  Mattress needs to be replaced.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The Warwick hotel was fantastic,Let  tell we arrive and the man at the front desk was so great he gave us a free upgrade because we were staying for 7 days. I could believe it but is was fantastic. The service was wonderful and everyone was so friendly,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Bland breakfast food,"The floor was dirty in my room like they never heard of a vacuum!  I went to order room service and they were only serving an overpriced New Years Dinner, that was not advertised on their website.  They were only serving meat options and nothing for vegetarians!  I could not order their pasta dishes from their main menu.  I booked under their breakfast package and the food was horrible!   Their pancakes were fluffy but tasted like cardboard and were bland.  The omelette was horrible!  You have to pay for valet parking, there are no other choices. It was $30 for one night. Next time I will stay else where when I need a mini vacation!  Thin walls heard dogs next door barking all night and every time a toilet flushes and could hear people talking through the walls all night.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice big rooms,"We booked this hotel for a night's ""get-away"" after a busy Christmas with family.  We needed some ""just the two of us"" time and The Warwick Hotel got good reviews on Trip Advisor and wasn't as pricey as some of the other hotels in downtown Denver.  The rooms are very spacious, as well as the bathrooms.  Everything was clean, but nothing fancy or special.  There seemed to be a lot of traffic in and out of this hotel with people from every walk of life and nationality coming to check in.  Very interesting.  They offered wine at 5 pm, which we enjoyed, though there didn't seem to be many napkins or much selection as far as the cheese and crackers was concerned.  To have the car ""valet'ed"" cost us an additional $30 (plus tip), and the breakfast they were serving in the adjacent restaurant (The Randolph) the next morning was expensive and not very appetizing, so we left to go eat at the Denver Biscuit Company on Broadway.  Overall not a bad experience, and it was nice to get away for a night, but nothing to write home about.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Jo Roque made our stay wonderful! ,Vacation trip with my husband. At check in Jo made us feel at home! He was very friendly and gave us free coupons as well as free parking and a free room upgrade. He really went above and beyond. Amazing employee! Thanks Jo! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who travels to Denver. Very clean rooms and lobby smells great :),5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fantastic Christmas,Totally enjoyed staying at this hotel over Christmas. Beautiful lobby with Christmas tree .  Very good Dinner on Christmas Eve. Friendly and professional staff make this an amazing place.  A white Christmas to remember,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Classy, downtown hotel",We loved our stay at the Warwick Hotel.   The staff was extremely courteous and attentive.  We enjoyed the hot cocoa and cookies in the lobby (they also had coffee and spa water).  Our room was spacious and clean with attention to details.  The linens and bed were great.  The lobby was inviting and welcoming.   They had a free wine and cheese hour.  We will definitely go back to this hotel on future visits to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Last minute visit,"All the staff were very helpful, rooms very nice, very good restaurant and bar. Gave good advice on local activities, restaurants etc., very convenient location. They were running special so price to value was good. Not sure would have chosen if regular higher price.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The Warwick Hotel,"This hotel is absolutely amazing from the architecture to exceptional customer service to the perfect location as it is in a great spot of downtown Denver, nice view, valet parking, great food, The Warwick Hotel is a 10!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Charrimng old Place,"My wife and I aer staying at this hotel and really enjoying the place.  Here for a few days before moving on to meet friends at  Courtyard.  So far we are enjoying everything.  Nice large quarters with butiful bathroom, pool is closed are carpet is bads  but a very nice place.  We are never left a review for a hotel but after reading  few of the reviews of this place we thought we shold do also. Nice touches including wine in the evening, with live music hot shokolad and cookies.  We leave tomorrow to other part of town and  give good for this place.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Pretty Standard with a great location,"We visited in December. The hotel has all the necessary comforts, the room had a nice view, looking to the Capitol building. The location is great since you are walking distance from all Denver attractions. The staff is polite and the room was adequately spacious and comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick Hotel,I stayed here for business and was upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was awesome. It had a separate shower room and a balcony overlooking the city! More important was that it was clean. The staff was very friendly. You can walk to downtown and your near a number of bars and restaurants.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Convenient for short stay,Stayed here two nights after arriving from England.  Unfortunately suffered from altitude change so did not test the bar or dining.We had booked the hotel as it had a swimming pool but when we arrived it was closed for maintenance.Room large and comfortable but there were a poor selection of toiletries - no shampoo.Convenient walking distance from central Denver but I would suggest you make use of the hotel car - cheaper and more comfortable than a taxi.,3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Enjoyable 2 Day Stay,"An older luxury hotel close to downtown, short walking distance from the 16th Street Mall, lots of great restaurants in the neighborhood.  Beds were wonderful, hard to get out of in the morning.  Staff was great with directions on how to get around.  Only one drawback with our room,  it's about time to replace the carpet. That being said, we'll probably be back.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great stay in Uptown--your best choice in Denver,"I had never stayed in a Warwick before which is an international chain. The reviews here were so-so and the property is not new. However, the hotel is a gem. Service is top notch. Rooms are spotless. Service is great. Nearby gym (Uptown) and coffee shop (Fluid) a plus. The 7-11 is a block away. Trendy restaurants on 17th beckon. A short walk to downtown which is a plus since the 16th Mall area is not really that interesting. Great business center with free coffee. Free bicycles (plus helmets and locks) to use so you can ride over to Cheesman Park or the Botanical Garden. I had them remove the snacks placed on the dresser in my room as well as the stuff in the mini-bar (and they promptly did) which would be my only ""complaint"". I've stayed everywhere in downtown (and uptown…",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Best Hotel Downtown Denver!,"Love the Warwick Hotel! Elegant, comfortable, clean, and awesome staff throughout! Great location for anything downtown Denver. This was a business trip but is great for anyone who is doing a fun trip to Denver to shop or attend any event. Highly recommend!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Classic Luxury,"My first visit here after being prompted by a friend. I like staying somewhat off the ""brand grid""., Greeted at valet with enthusiasm and care. It's old school luxe, which I don't mind. Was upgraded to a one bedroom suite- very nice, keeping in mind that's it's old school. Really nice size room but the layout is a little strange- they should pay closer attn to the details in the room, could use more power outlets and clean up the calking around the tub and bathroom floor ., I am still onsite and enjoying the property- I will be back for sure!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Like going home!,"We were pleasantly surprised with our recent stay at the Warwick.  Can't understand some of the negative reviews!  We had a comfortable room and wonderful service.  Mike at the front desk took very good care of his, upgrading our room and helping with the parking.  Our king room was very comfortable and spacious.  We'll make every effort to stay here the next time we spend time in Denver!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Elegant and luxurious,"For the price of an average hotel in a city's downtown, my husband and I spent a week in the Colorado suite, which had separate bedroom and living rooms, both huge, comfortable and stylish. The bed was comfy, the living areas had big comfortable chairs and sofa. Spacious, clean bathroom had tub/shower combo, plenty of fresh towels and lovely bath products. In addition, we took advantage of their complimentary afternoon wine and cheese by the fire in the lobby on one of the coldest days. The entire staff who worked from 11/25 through 12/3/15 went above and beyond their job specifications to make our stay absolutely great. I can't say enough nice things about this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,awesome hotel,"This hotel is a must stay. Clean, spacious,quiet and worth the money.Near 16th street mall.  I will definitely stay at this hotel whenever in Denver and will refer to family and friends. i would have given a 5 star, but the tv volume in room was very low  and it was to late for the problem to be fix,was only there for one night. Great hotel for sure",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Passing thru,"Pros n consPros: downtown, good price, good restraunt w good prices for downtown, beautiful lobby and decor,huge rooms.  Great tv. Con: housekeeping less than optimum,not completely cleaned. Front desk staff attitude is poor(this is Denver not Paris): also door men in Denver act like they are doing u a big favor by telling u about parking options.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Stay!,"Nice and clean hotel. Very friendly concierge. Dog friendly (I didn't have a dog). I came for an interview and this hotel worked exactly for my needs. They have a car/shuttle to drive you within 2 miles distance, but I was never able to use it as it wasn't available when I needed it so I just used uber.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,First class all the way,"Elegant, yet comfortable hotel very conveniently located in downtown Denver. Wonderful staff with just the right touch. Just the right amount of attention, not too much nor too little. They are always there to help with a need or a question. Rooms large and comfy. Bathrooms new enough, adequately warm, quality bathroom amenities. Very nice breakfast with good service. Last year at Christmas there was a problem with a downtown (outside) transformer (NOT a problem caused by the hotel) and power was out for 6 or 8 hours. The hotel brought all the guests down to the lobby and provided wine, cheese and snacks. It was a very nice presentation and definitely the way to keep guests happy. Folks from all over the world met who would not have otherwise. It ended up being a delightful party and turned lemons into lemonade for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick Denver is an excellent property with affordable rates and the friendlies staff ever,"My Denver-based daughter recommended the Warwick Denver to us as we searched for accommodations for the Thanksgiving Holidays.  Conveniently located to downtown Denver, this hotel proved delightfully well furnished and well staffed.  Rates were great compared to many lesser properties in the area, and the facilities were fresh and welcoming.  Staff - from doorman/valet to front desk, to housekeeper - are knowledgeable, friendly, and professional.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent hospitality and comforable stay at the Warwick,"My king room was large for a downtown hotel.  Every one of the staff exhibited excellent hospitality.  The hotel is an older facility, however the hotel is well maintained.  Breakfast in the restaurant was very good with excellent service.  I would not hesitate to return.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Hotel with Personality in Downton Denver,"I enjoyed spending two nights at the Warwick Denver hotel while I was in town for a convention.  I had a very large king room (handicapped accessible, so I believe that's why it was so big) that had a city view. The hotel staff was friendly and inviting, the hotel restaurant was good, and I enjoyed the ""personality"" that comes with being an ""older"" hotel.  The hardwood floors in the lobby were amazing! The Warwick was a good walk from the convention center, they offered a complimentary shuttle, but I Ubered it most of the time!  A good, solid hotel that won't disappoint.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A GREAT Value,"Downtown hotels can be pricey.  Although I have stayed in my share of upscale, pricey downtown hotels, the focus on this trip was to find a hotel in a great location for modest price.  This place was a winner!  Although the building appeared to be old, attention has been given to maintain this historic venue.  The friendliness of the staff stood out from the moment we walked into the hotel.  The location was prime for walks to the Denver Art Museum, 16th Avenue Mall and other attractions.  The 24 hour accessibility to the top floor fitness center was icing on the cake.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent Service,"I stayed here before going to Eagle and found a good deal on Expedia.  All the staff were excellent.  The staff seem friendly and warm which is always a welcome relief.  Lovely fireplace in the lobby and radlops restaurant.  lovely towels, so fluffy and soft, the best i have ever had in any hotel as were the sheets and the bed for that matter.  Hotel does need somewhat of a makeover however,  rooms have very old carpet and furtniture looked like something out of my great grandmothers house.  With some upgrades this place will really rock.  excellent place to stay with charming staff.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Lovely hotel convenient to downtown Denver,Loved everything about The Warwick Denver. The personnel are fun and freindly. The location is near the center of town yet far enough from the noise and busyness. The rooms were comfortable and elegant. Happy hour wine and cheese was a pleasant surprise. We also enjoyed our dinner at the Randolph. I will definitely plan to stay again at this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A very pleasant stay,I had a very nice experience at the Warwick Denver Hotel. Rooms are large and comfortable. The hotel has a nice atmosphere and the staff is very welcoming. Walking-distance to city centre not too far.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Glad we stayed there despite some glitches,"I had been wanting to try the Warwick and this trip decided to do just that.  Easy 3 block walk to 16th St Mall and all it has to offer.  Checkin was fine, we were very early so only one of our two rooms was ready.  Checked into one, put all the bags in that room and went for lunch.  Came back and our second room was still not ready but they went ahead and gave us our room key as we were headed out to the Bronco game and it would be late when we got back.  A very nice effort that ended up backfiring. Got back late, got into room, moved our bags from room one, really tired.  Started the opening suitcase routine, etc and my wife noticed that the small kitchenette area had pieces of ceiling on the floor, a wet spot in the ceiling and that basically the room had not been serviced.  Called down, and turns out there was a leak, which is what had delayed us getting into the room.  They ended up taking it out of service, but after they had given us keys.  The desk fellow had tried to ""intercept"" us when we got back to the hotel but was in the back when we came in.  So they upgraded us to s suite and offered to help move all of our bags. Both our original roöm and the suite were HUGE.  Nicely appointed, very comfy beds, good linens, good water pressure and plenty of hot water.  This is a very nice hotel and offers a great value in my view.  Will stay again and recommend.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Neighborhood stay,"On Friday night 11/20 the road to our home closed due to adverse weather.  We were given the ""neighborhood discount"" and the woman that night with Reservations was super friendly and helpful.  Our stay was enjoyable and flawless.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,WOW...upgraded and that's not all!,"Great comfy pillows and beds are just the beginning of what we enjoyed most at the Warwick.  Sure we got upgraded to a suite bigger than many apartments...and sure we got a plate of fruit and water complimentary in the room...and sure, we got a late check out. And the breakfast in the restaurant was unbeatable.  All nice and wonderful, right?  Yes.  But what both my husband and commented on during our stay was neither of us had any sneezing or headaches which often occur while staying in hotel rooms.  Why?  I think it's because the cleaning fluids they use.  So, I give the Warwick a big ""high five"" for the quality of cleaning fluids they use and consider staying here, especially if you are sensitive to hotel cleaning fluids.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not sure what is going on here,"Having lived in Denver before, I thought staying at the Warwick would be a nice alternative to the convention center hotels. While everyone here was very nice, and the hotel staff really did try to solve problems, my experience was blighted by both poor conditions at the hotel (which is being renovated-- though I was in an old room that was dirty when I arrived, with outdated menus and hotel information) and the hotel's inability to control its many unruly guests. Every day that I was here the hallway outside my room was full of cigarette smoke and/or thick, stinky marijuana smoke. I was woken at night by large groups of young people partying well into the early hours of the morning. The hotel management could not seem to get the smokers to stop, despite the fact that this was a nonsmoking hotel, and it took several tries to quiet my screaming, drunken neighbors (they eventually settled down around 3am). To their credit, the hotel manager tried their best to make it up to me with a discount and free breakfasts, but I wonder if the Warwick has become perhaps more downmarket than I remembered. I probably would have happily paid for a breakfast or two rather than been up all night coughing.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Conference Hotel alternative,"I was on a business trip, and stayed at the Warwick as an alternative to conference hotel on the 16th Ave Mall. My Warwick stay was so much more pleasant than my colleague's experience at the event hotel! I really enjoyed the spacious room, the walk-in closet, the wet bar - the room amenities are over the top! The Warwick is a little out to the way, but it is a short walk to everything in downtown.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Traveling for a conference,"Overal, the Warwick is a nice hotel, albeit a little dated. The room was nice, the work out center was nice, and the staff were helpful. However, the towels in the bathroom were absolutely wonderful!!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Weekend visit with out-of-town guest,"Check-in was easy and fast.  Very courteous staff with helpful information on where to eat etc.  Other reviewers mentioned that it wasn't right in the downtown area, but that wasn't a problem for us.  Parking is expensive, but we got lucky with metered parking which became free after 2 hours on a Friday night.  We used Uber to get to where we needed and enjoyed the walk back from Larimer Square.  All the amenities you would need avail in the bathroom (hairdryer), bed very comfortable, only complaint was the bathtub plug was hard to stay closed.  We had a very early morning start so was not able to try the hotel restaurant.  Would stay here again in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very nice!,Stayed at this hotel for six nights in November and I was really satisfied... Ok location in walking distance to downtown/city center (at least for a Norwegian) and nice prices. I was attending a conference at the Marriot City Center and food out that I could get a better and less expensive stay at the Warwick Hotel. Nice staff as well! Free wifi is always positive!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick stay,I just stayed at the warwick this weekend for a wedding  I just want to say I have stayed in so many hotel all over the world and this stay was the best I ever had. First of all I checked in to my room Friday and the heat was not working right so I went downstairs and the desk service upgraded my room to a suite for less than 30 dollars a night so nice I think k his name was britton.and the room service waiter Sean was the best was a mistake in the breakfast he took it off the bill right away and couldn't do enough to sevice us .came back to the hotel from the wedding and their was a plate of fruit and chocolate in the room .5 star service at this hotel .I never right reviews but had to now never recieved such first class sevice at a hotel. Most hotels are very impersonal.                  Britt saiag                   Brooklyn ny,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"A bit out of downtown, decent older hotel","This hotel is quite nice, but not a stunner and over-priced for what I paid because there were large conventions going on in Denver.  The rooms are large-ish (I saw a double and stayed in a large king room), and the bathrooms quite nice. I had room service that was basic but decent. Overall, I'd say the hotel needs a makeover and some decent sound proofing as we could hear each and every night the people on both sides, which was quite annoying at 1AM and then again at 5:30 when they respectively went to bed and got up. More than annoying it meant quite a bit less sleep, and given the intense work and pressure I was under, that made things more difficult than they should have been.A quick comment on check out: staff person proceeded to charge me a room that I didn't book, which took about 10 minutes to sort out. When leaving the hotel I asked the door person for a cab, and not only did he not succeed in getting the person the 10 feet to the door of the hotel but made me walk to the cab and get it myself. For a hotel that has a door person, it was clear he was not doing his job, nor did he know how to do it. I explicitly said I wanted a cab to the airport.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Parking,Parking is expensive but valet service is very good.  Close to the downtown without the downtown traffic challenges.  Trendy hotel with responsive guest services.  Breakfast at restaurant fairly good but short staffed.,3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great staff,"The hotel is dated (land phones in the bathroom ;-) and worn at the edges but the staff is super and the rooms are large. Looks like every room has a balcony though they were run down (outdoor carpet coming up) but it's nice to have outdoor space even when cold. All amenities were upgraded and nice. Little noisy but I think that's the age of the construction, too.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great value!,"Nicely appointed, large room. Did not hear hallway noise. Friendly, helpful staff. Nice lobby with fireplace that gives it small hotel field. Not a chain hotel. We have stayed in a lot of hotels in downtown Denver and for the money, this was great value and extremely pleasant.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Filthy room,"Stayed at this hotel during a business trip. The lobby is beautiful. Staff was very friendly. Hotel was completely booked and we had to wait about a 1/2 hour before the room was ready even though we checked in late in the day. The room was disgusting. Stains all over the carpet and furniture. Balcony needs to be washed and repainted. Room needs a complete overhaul. Since I was staying in a suite, I expected much more - especially from a 4 star hotel.  We had friends staying in a regular room. Their room had been recently renovated and was much cleaner than our room. I will not return to this hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Dirty room,Lobby is beautiful. Staff is friendly. Valet is great. There is a parking garage for a lot less money literally right next door if anyone feels the valet parking is too expensive. Room included Wi-Fi for no extra charge.  The room was disgusting. Stains all over the rug and furniture. I refused to walk barefoot in the room and wouldn't sit on the couch. The balcony needs to be scrubbed and repainted. Some rooms in the hotel have been renovated. It's a shame that the suite I stayed in had not been renovated and is still in use. It shouldn't be used until the carpets and furniture have been replaced.,2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent Customer Service,"Stephanie in Reservations was an amazing help. She was friendly, smart, informative and a pleasure to work with. The rooms are beautiful and it's a great location. Great balconies on the west side suites.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Exceptional Staff,"Pleasantly surprised by the professional and friendly people at the Warwick.  Mr. Erasmus, the general manager, went out of his way to see that our hotel experience was memorable, with upgraded amenities.  The front desk staff succeeded in making us feel quite special during our anniversary stay.  We enjoyed a large suite that was perfectly clean and well appointed.  Our balcony faced east.  Although many TripAdvisor reviewers prefer the west side, the morning sun during November made the balcony a perfect place to enjoy a cup of coffee.  The hotel location was good for wandering downtown, as the free 16th Street shuttle was just three blocks away.  The wine, cheese and live music by the lobby fireplace made for a nice place to relax.Breakfast was far better than at most hotels.  My wife said her oatmeal, and the presentation, were the best ever.  A few minutes later, I overheard another guest make the same remark to his coworkers.  Thanks to Wan for remembering our names and being so helpful and professional.  Thanks to Tom for pointing out interesting places to visit.  I hope to return soon.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Quirky charm,"I've been a regular at the Warwick for the past couple of years. The hotel is well maintained, the staff very accommodating. The rooms for the most part are very large, all are clean and comfortable. Definitely not all the same layout, but the same big bed, a desk, maybe a couch, maybe a wet bar, sometimes a walk in closet. Almost all have large balconies.  The restaurant is quite nice, especially when snowed in. I always have them arrange a ride to the airport for me, the drivers have been great and the price better than a taxi.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Way to go Jo!,Jo the front desk manager could not have been more helpful. I bet his parents are very proud of him and probably upstanding citizens as well. He allowed us to rent bikes from the hotel even though he shouldn't have trusted us. My only complaint is that Jo was not there when he got back from dinner so I could not say good bye to him.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Memorable and Charming,"As indicated in the hotel survey this is a very charming hotel,  a little on the older side but clean with very comfortable bed, lovely bar and restaurant and everyone we dealt with gave us the feeling that they wanted to impress us.  We received an unexpected amenity in our room with card from management as well as a beautiful room overlooking the city and beautiful trees adjacent to the hotel which are full of festive lights.  A good visit and we do recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,My favorite place to stay in Denver,"The Warwick can't be beat for location, price, atmosphere, service, and amenities. The staff -- front desk, housekeeping, and valets are always very friendly, efficient, and helpful. The rooms are beautifully appointed, spacious, and include a balcony. We visited the hotel bar/restaurant this time, and the food and drinks were superb and not too costly. We also love the hotel lobby's ""living room"" where you can relax on couches by a fireplace.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Good location, nice restsaurant and very nice room",We had good friendly room service and also liked Randolph's restaurant on the lobby level.  The room was well appointed with a nice coffee machine and a refrigerator with a mini-bar. I would stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff,"Beautiful hotel.  We were invited to a wine and cheese reception in the beautiful lobby where we listened to relaxing, live music.  We had fun in the Randolf Bar for Happy Hour.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Excellent Hotel, Great Location","Clean, sun-filled, large, comfortable room; excellent staff!  Every member of staff with whom I spoke was very friendly and helpful.  Lobby a pleasant place to relax with complimentary coffee in the morning.  Room showed some minor blemishes from normal wear and tear, but this is a very, very minor item and shouldn't stop you from choosing the Warwick.  Great location, walk to 16th St Mall, tons of restaurants, bars, and shopping; short cab ride to everything else in Central Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent !!,"I chose to stay at the Warwick for my first trip ever to Denver and I couldn't have been more satisfied!! I lost my debit card on the way to Denver so it made check in difficult for the staff but they were super nice and helpful and got me checked in without any worries. I believe his name was Kevin he was very nice. Everyone that worked there was nice from the front desk staff to the bellman they all greeted you with a friendly smile and we're just very welcoming. The location of the hotel is great you're within walking distance to a lot of attractions. The rooms were huge and very clean the beds were super comfy ,The balcony was a nice plus, the view was amazing. This trip was for my birthday and I couldn't have spent it any better place. If I do return to Denver I will most definitely be staying at the Warwick.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great Price, Great View, Great Experience!","This was my first time staying at a Warwick hotel, and I can tell you I will certainly be back. The rooms were spacious and clean. My balcony was not the most ideal view, but it was still spacious and lovely. The best part of this hotel is the staff. At check in the staff noticed my dog on my debit card and heavily encouraged me to bring him next time. You have to love a hotel that not only allows pets, but encourages them! I am already planning a trip back in the near future!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The Warwick Hotel is Grand!,Great 3 night stay... the room was very clean the hotel overall was fantastic. Great view from the balcony too. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Restaurant downstairs is Randolph's...they were quite good. Valet parking also a plus.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A night out,"So we love downtown and love to spend time in the city. We were there on 10/24/2015 &stayed one night. We wanted to stay at this hotel and check out the year round heated rooftop pool. But when we got there the pool was closed due to construction and we received no discount for the pool being closed. When we arrived there is no free parking for this hotel which would of been fine had we know this and I'm sorry but 30 for valet is too much when I am paying 200 for one night. Now rooms were nice and clean the view was good but we requested the highest room we could get and they put us on 4th floor. And on stay we were woke up at 2 am to the fire alarm going off and fire department knocking on doors due to a glitch in the system, now it's not the hotel's fault but a discount would have been nice after paying 200 and no pool and fire alarm. It was a nice place but I think better customer service is needed.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,City Hotel,A Lovely Hotel very close to the Shopping Mile. The rooms where very clean and spacious. The Restaurant and bar staff where very friendly and accommadating. IWe could vey easily return to this hotel and enjoy this section of Denver again.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great experience at the Warwick Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at the Warwick Hotel. Beautiful, spacious room with a great view. Valet parking and bell hop service was very good.  We received special attention from the General Manager Neville Erasmus which was greatly appreciated!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great job Elizabeth!!,Great great bar tender Elizabeth. Took good care of the group. Great food. Bartender Elizabeth is the best. One of the best hotel restaurants I've been to. They really make you feel at home as soon as you walk in the door. Rooms are great! Thanks Warwick hotel for a great stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The Old Grey Mare,"Staff and employees are great! Superbly helpful and nice. The public areas of the hotel are nice and updated and comfortable for a 4*. The rooms was a disappointment. Not because of size or amenity, but because what was there was in a poor state of repair. Barely any hot water out of the bathroom tap. The grout and caulking around the tub (and around the nice stone tiles enclosing the tub) were GROSS. Stained, midlewy with gaps where it had rotted away. Just poor. In the room, there were switches that didn't control anything, and lamps that weren't plugged in?! Some bulbs were warm white CFL, and others were cold (I HATE cold-white CFL light - it's dollar-store, not 4*) and some of the wattages were clearly wrong, with spotlight power on floor lamps and dimness from over-head lights. The whole room just needed some attention. Not worth the $230 we paid for the night, but it was close to the race that we were visiting Denver to do, so it won.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fantastic experience,It was our first anniversary and we picked up a room at the Warwick through one of those last minute hotel sites. There was some delay upon check in due to a data transfer issue from the site but it was very well made up for by the staff who all jumped in to resolve our check in issue. The front desk staff were all friendly and wanted to make sure our stay was to our liking. The room was large and clean. The bed was comfortable and we had a huge balcony. We enjoyed our stay and will certainly come back.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice Hotel and Great Customer Service,"I stayed here on my last trip to Denver, and was very satisfied with the customer service, and accommodations.  It is located right in the middle of town, with easy access to all of the nice bars, and museums.  Will definitely stay here next time we are in town!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,European feel,Very nice Hotel elegant and comfortable. I would have given five stars exept the rooftop pool was not working and the balcony was not to nice. Also being an old hotel you can hear every word in the room next door,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warm and professional staff,We stayed at the Warwick with our dog for 2 days and really enjoyed the staff who acted like nothing was too much for them.  Everyone we interacted with were able to deal with our questions and requests. Even though there were some initial issues with the reservation the staff at the desk resolved our issues.   The dog friendliness is something we really appreciated.  Try the gnocci and risotto in the restaurant it is the best we have had,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Baseball and Culture,We were very pleased with our accommodations in a one-bedroom suite.  The size was perfect and the rooms were very clean and very well maintained.  Location of the hotel was ideal for our mini vacation.  Restaurant was great for breakfast and dinner too.  The staff was extremely helpful and very friendly.  We asked for many directions to various tourist spots and they were eager to help.  Could not have asked for more during our stay.   AC was perfect and having a coffee maker was a plus as well as two televisions.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Comfortable and at home.,Complimentary wine 5-6pm every evening. Everyone is friendly and happy to help. Rooms are clean. You can walk to downtown or uptown easily. Restaurant is a solid option and pretty patio. I've stayed here several times and it is my first choice.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good value,"A bit run down, but overall good value for the money.  Not in the best area,  Staff is very friendly.  Eat at Randolphs, the in house restaurant.  Don't waste time going elsewhere,  the food here is as good as you'll find in Denver.  The chef knows what he's doing.  The caesar dressing is made on site, and they use anchovies, although I prefer to emulsify mine.  Very authentic.  Ask for Raul, a fun competent waiter.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Classy Hotel with Friendliest Staff,"Great hotel and unmatched in terms of staff: friendly, helpful, and always going out of their way to make your stay a nice one.  Randolf's, the restaurant located off the main lobby, is absolutely fantastic - delicious food and great menu.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Looking Forward to my 2nd Stay...,"Just spent 4 nights at this Beyond Friendly place... Atmosphere takes you back to another place in time where customer service is GENUINE & # 1! Elizabeth at the bar served me a  Delightful ""Virgin Bloody Mary"" ... Fresh  Fragrant Flowers greet visitors at the lobby... the Divine Artistic Food at Randolphs under Joseph's leadership is a Delicious Memory ... Thanks for treating Maddie & friends from Nurse Family Partnership like royalty! Looking forward to my next trip to Denver...",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,They threw away my shoes,I liked the hotel until I had to call them when I got home and realized I'd left a pair of black heels in the room... they couldn't find them and told me they'd probably thrown them away! That anything that got left behind that was deemed of no value got tossed by housekeeping.  That seemed a little inappropriate to me. I will not stay there again based on that 1 comment.,2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Comfortable rooms, great staff, and balconies!","We stayed at the Warwick Denver for our son's wedding.  We provided this at the designated hotel for our guests as well.  They could not have been more accommodating to our wedding party.  The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable, and the balconies are an added amenity not usually found in downtown hotels.  The location is great, situated between the downtown and trendy uptown areas.  The rooftop deck and pool area are closed for renovations, which we are told will be completed by next summer.  That will make the hotel an even better venue for enjoying Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A Truly Wonderful Experience,"I spent the night at the Warwick Denver and had a truly wonderful experience.  When I called to make my reservation, the agent asked if I'd be traveling with my dog - it's nice to know that that is in the hotel's reservation notes - and was professional and efficient.  Upon arriving at the hotel, the valet was fast and friendly, Michael, at the reception desk was great and the room service server was very nice.  I've stayed at many of Denver's downtown hotels and the Warwick, overall, is the best.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Vacation,"Great service, accommodations, room and employees! This is one of the best hotels in the world!  There is a great bar where we ate and partied .  The room was very large with two Queen beds, large living area and bathroom with a separate shower and tub.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Weekend Stay,We were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful view from our hotel room! We experience great customer service at the front desk from Wan Lim. He was of great help and made our experience that much more enjoyable! I would highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great historic feeling hotel!,A group of friends and I went here for a weekend trip to Denver.  The staff was very friendly and always helpful from the front desk to the valet.  There are several bars within walking distance and a 7-11.  It is in classic style.  It would be a great place for couples or families.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A Conveniently Located Classic,"The room was obviously updated and had the right amenities.  The balcony was a nice surprise.  It's walking distance to the Capitol and hipster joints.  There is a great restaurant adjacent to the lobby.  Parking was an added expense-- I saw cheaper, self park options in lots that were only a block away.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Service beyond the norm,"An open letter to the staff and management of the Warwick Denver Hotel:A hearty thank you  and the entire staff for a successful weekend. Every employee at every customer touch point was sincerely helpful, apparently happy and obviously ready to provide a level of service above and beyond the norm. Thank you specifically for the surprise reception wine, chocolates and fruit.  We all appreciated the effort.You have a new convert, who will be back to the Warwick, whenever he returns to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"A ""hidden"" gem",We love the Warwick! They have the best service and rooms for the price. They are pet-friendly which really sells us. Parking is a pain but if you do valet there's no problem. It's close to some key areas in Denver. The restaurant and room service are great too -- especially the patio for the restaurant.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fantastic hotel,"Top notch service. From the front desk check in and out there were no issues. The bar staff were quite terrific , in general incredible Staff going out of their way to please. There was a roof top pool, it would have been nice if it was available for use unfortunately it was under renovation. PLEASE FIX THE POOL.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very enjoyable stay,"Simply put.. Remarkable.  I attended a meeting this past week at the Warwick Hotel and had a very good event.  Not only were the staff willing to go way and beyond, I appreciated the ability of the staff to fix the small issue we had with a buffet and it was immediately rectified with out any delay.  Food was excellent to.  Staff throughout the hotel just seemed to enjoy us being there and I have to commend the door guys as well as the management in the lobby.  I will likely not be back in Denver but will stay at a Warwick hotel if I have an opportunity again.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Perfect!,"I stayed at this hotel earlier this month as I had friends to catch up with in the city.  From the moment I arrived (from the UK), tired and grumpy, I was made to feel special.  My room was clean and very comfortable, the staff were absolute stars, all of them!  Nothing was too much trouble. And the food was superb, I ate far too much! When I left the hotel after 4 days I felt I was saying goodbye to friends! I will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent Hotel,We stayed at the Warwick this past weekend and had a lot of fun. The room was very clean and we enjoyed our coffee with room service on the balcony. The hotel is older but very friendly.  The only thing we did not enjoy was the fact that there is no laundry facility to wash socks etc.  We have been on the road for a few weeks and it would have been nice to have this.  The hotel laundry is not cheap.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Def Not My Style,"I know a lot of people really like this style of hotel. But, I found it dated, and creepy and called it the Mad Men hotel. The staff were nice enough. Parking is a little odd. I really would not think about this hotel if I were travelling to Denver again.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Helpful Reservation Agent,"I had a complicated reservation to make (mostly my own fault because I'd waited too long and the block booking wasn't available for all nights). Stephanie was not only pleasant to deal with, but she went the extra mile to get me the best rate possible for the night that was outside the block booking. Stephanie is a rock star.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Charming and Clean,"I have stayed at the Warwick hotel for 3 days with some girlfriends in a room with 2 beds,  yes 4 girls, and it was such a good stay.  When we checked in to the room we received a call from the staff to welcome us and ask if we needed anything which we did.  Towels because there were 4 of us.  The towels and lots of smiles arrived a few minutes later with an apology for not having enough towels,  we did not need the apology as we just needed more.  This was a really good start.  Unfortunately the lap pool was closed while we were there which was a let down but we had read about this so it was ok.  The hotel was always willing to drive us to 16th street and the mall  and even picked us up again.  James in the bar is a blast and the guy playing the live music on the outside patio in restaurant is really nice.  The only bad in this stay is that the hotel is very old and run down especially the balcony and the room furniture and carpet.  At least it was clean and the service was excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good with lots of potential,Could be so much more. Seemed like veteran employees had it down but newer employees didn't have the professionalism. Housekeeping didn't replace wash cloths for 3 nights. New girl at desk didn't remove $30 per night valet fee after telling her we were parking on street.    Valets were perfect and made good impressions throughout stay. Room was large and balcony was nice. Great restaurants around the corner to walk to.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice Hotel in the Heart of Denver,"On our recent trip to Denver we were looking for a hotel that was close to the 16th Street shopping area.  We found the Warwick was very reasonably priced and had a great location just a few blocks from the heart of downtown.  When we arrived we didn't like the view from our room but when we mentioned it to the staff we were upgraded to a suite with a balcony with perks thrown in.  The room was nice, clean and spacious and the view was great.  Restaurant was a bit pricey but had a delicious breakfast.  We would go back.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great location and very clean,The hotel is very clean and the staff were great.  The hotel has a rooftop pool which is a great feature.  The rooms are very nice and clean.  The facilities are well-maintained as well.  The lobby is immaculate.  This hotel is a nice little (not really little ) gem in the heart of Denver and worth the stay.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great downtown location.  Close to everything.,"I liked this hotel because it felt luxurious and was perfectly located in downtown close to everything.  They also offer balcony rooms which is very nice and they have furniture out on the balcony which is also a big plus.  I thought the bathroom was large and the shower even better.  Bed was comfortable and room was definitely larger than most.  I would stay here again, except for the parking situation.  You either have to valet or park on the street.  You could park a few blocks away in the residential neighborhood but it is a walk.  There is also a parking garage that is less than what the hotel charges.   I suggest they sell rates that include the parking - nobody would even realize the rate increase.   They would get a ton of business!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very Good Hotel in Downtown Denver,"Took my wife on a quick trip to Denver for her birthday.  She found the Warwick on Orbitz.  It was the best priced hotel with a decent rating.  The hotel is in the heart of downtown Denver.  We were there on a weekend and downtown Denver seemed quiet on the weekends.  There were plenty of places open and things to do, but if  you were looking for a more popular area you may consider other parts of Denver.  However, this was our first time here so it may have just been that weekend.  The parking was a slight issue.  We parked in the public lot next to the hotel cause we thought it was the only option.  Once we checked in we discovered you could have them valet your car.  It was $17 a day in the public lot and a $30 flat rate for the hotel and you could take your car in and out as much as you wanted.  This is a few other public lots in the area we noticed when were driving around so a little research should save you some cash.  The hotel was very nice and clean.  The hotel staff was extremely helpful with questions regarding what to do and where to eat.  We asked if we could switch from 2 queen beds to a single king and they did it with no problem.  The room was very nice and big.  Nice size balcony over looking the city.  Two issues we had.  First, they have an amazing looking rooftop pool that was under  construction, which I guess isn't totally their fault.  Second, my wife and I are big coffee drinkers and when the maid made up the room she did not replenish the coffee (which is very good for hotel coffee).  Minor in detail I know, but when you want a cup in the morning you don't want to have to wait a half hour for housekeeping to show up with it.  All in all I recommend the Warwick for the price and cleanliness.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Nice, clean hotel","The staff was very attentive and the room was clean and big. Our room came with a sitting area and a balcony which was nice. The balcony had carpet which was interesting. Unfortunately, the root top pool was closed when we went. I hear it's one of the best, but we were not able to use it. The beds were quite comfortable and the shower had good pressure. It's a short cab ride to the Denver Botanical Gardens. It was in the middle of the downtown. We were only there for 1 night, so we did not get to explore too much.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Disappointing stay,"Our stay at the Warwick can only be described as disappointing. For starters, the rooftop pool was closed. The actual rooms and lobby did not appear as they do in the pictures. The ""recently renovated"" hotel seemed dated - low ceilings, out-dated decor and the shower water pressure was lacking. However, the hotel was clean and all of the staff were accommodating and very friendly.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,very comfy bed,"I had read several negative reviews, but things being what they are, I opted for this hotel, and found it a comfortable stay.  The bellmen were very helpful and informative, and the room, a jr. suite was fine.  The decor is dated, and I have experienced that in another Warwick hotel I stayed in also,.  It's clean and comfortable, and there was a balcony on our room which was a nice touch.  With all the hotels in Denver in this price range, I am not sure I would opt for this again.  I have nothing bad to say, just nothing terrific either.  It was a bit pricey for what it is.  Definitely skip the restaurant , Randolf's, if it is the same place that prepares the room service food.  It really was very bad.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Treated like Royalty,We are travelling across country and spent a long time in cramped conditions from Chicago to Denver. Imagine our joy on arrival at the Worik when we were met with tea and coffee biscuits and cold refreshments while we waited a few minutes for our room   The suite was large and very indulging especially the balcony and spectacular sun set.  Food in Room Service was way too expensive but good.  The staff were helpful in showing us the town.  A perfect stop in Denver,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent,I checked out of this hotel this morning and need to express my gratitude to the staff. I had a business meeting to attend and was under tremendous pressure to get things done.  The service in this respect was excellent.  They printed all my documents and made sure that my bags were collected from the room and taxi waiting outside when i left.  i appreciate the professionalism Warwick.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good Comfortable Stay!,"My husband and I saw a really great deal on this hotel the night of check-in so we gave it a try. The location is good and the evening staff are really friendly and helpful if you need help finding things to do/eat in the area. The rooms were nice and the bed was really comfortable, although the pillows were extremely soft for my taste. There is also a safe in the room, for those who may be wondering. There are also nice patio views of downtown Denver from the rooms (or at least the room we stayed in). ***House KeepingI really enjoyed my stay at the hotel and I was really comfortable in the room, but I felt like housekeeping could have done a better job preparing the room. There was a french fry on the desk chair, several strings of tangled hair on the rim of the tub and for some reason our room didn't have wash towels, but some were delivered to our room once we called it in. I believe a lot of hotels turn the rooms over very quickly, but a little more attention to the cleanliness would be nice.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warm Hotel with great Staff!,"The Warwick had a great ""park for a penny"" promotion going on! My car stayed safe all night and I caught a Lyft ride everywhere. The room was very clean and super big. I had two double beds and there was still plenty of room. The décor was old but in a cute way. I loved the balcony. It was very long and I had a great view. The housekeeping staff was awesome. I asked for extra towels like 4 times and there was not issue at all. The front desk staff was great too. They were very welcoming and always said hi when they saw me.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Hotel - Quieter Part of Downtown,"This hotel is not far from downtown, but it a little bit quieter location.  It was walking to a couple of really good restaurants.  The room was very nice and had a huge closet which we were able to use as a separate room for the baby's crib.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Nice hotel, average, not a bad impression, but rather no impression.","Hotel was decent for the money, I think it was like $160/night.  Room was large, had a nice balcony, clean, but a little dated.  Staff was extremely polite and helpful.  Extremely.  The bar and restaurant were just ""ok"" at best.  Reminded me of a Hampton Inn feel.  The hotel didn't make a good or bad impression, it just made NO impression.  Wifi was decent.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent Stay,"We spent 2 days at this hotel before leaving for home again. The saff were quite amazing and were always greeting us as we left the lobby. The room was clean and we appreciated the little touches, swan coffee in lobby  bicycles and excellent site seeing advice from Jeff.  Kong our housekeeper was kind enough to bring us additional shampoo when we droped ours in the toilet. He was very friendly.  The pool was closed which was unfortunate. This was our first experience in this hotel and we will return on our trip next summer.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good hotel not too far from downtown denver attractions,I booked the Warwick for a trade show at the convention center.  It is a fifteen minute walk to the convention center and ten minutes from the sixteenth street pedestrian mall.  The rooms are very nice upscale and clean.  The price was reasonable when I booked on line.  Would stay here again.  The pool is not open but they gave me free WiFi instead.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Strange experience,"To start, while we were checking in, the front desk staff seemed to be on each other's nerves... Then we went up to our room where the door was propped open and mini fridge was as well. Not a big deal, we wondered if we were in someone else's room... That and we booked 2 beds and it was just 1 king. The woman who checked us in was very helpful in remedying the switch for us and we quickly got ready for our event. When we got back for the evening we noticed one of the bags of nuts that are for sale in the room was open and eaten... Maybe we didn't notice earlier but it was still really weird.  We put the privacy please tag on the door knob and latched it. At 8 am we heard the door opening and banging against the latch... No knock, no 'housekeeping' mention.... I got up and went to the door and the housekeeper was at the next room and just said 'sorry about that'.  I double checked the privacy tag and it was still there... So, all in all.  The room was just fine, everything else was just off!",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Dated and average at best,"While the staff was wonderful, especially Paige at the front desk, the rooms are in dire need of an upgrade. While I was asked to sign off at check in that I would not smoke in my room, I got to my room to find it had previously been a smoking room. The carpets stank. The bathroom was nice and large which was a perk. But there was no closet in the room for me to hang my clothes up. The location is good and that is why they get the business they do. Food at the bar was also, incredibly average. Getting wifi was a herculean task in the rooms.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Staff,"Although I had an issue with housekeeping not cleaning my room there was a silver lining in my stay. By the third night of having to request housekeeping I was a little upset. James Black, Bartender, came to the rescue! He went above and beyond to make things right. He is a great representative for the hotel.Veronica",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wonderful experience,I had a great stay at the Warwick Denver Hotel.  Upon arrival I was upgraded to a large room which had a huge bathroom with a separate tub and a walk in shower. The bed was super comfortable and the room was very clean.  Yes the hotel is older but I felt that added to its charm.  The hotel was also in a perfect location for walking downtown. Would stay here again and definitely recommend.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Hotel and Great Location!!,"Me and my friend decided to stay at this hotel for 4 nights and although price was a bit high considering the location, we kind of loved our stay here. The staff were very helpful and super nice that it made you feel at home. Would definitely stay here again! Denver was a blast!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Location,Great Downtown Location. Walking Distance to 16th Street Mall. Hotel itself was very nice and room was very spacious. Would definitely stay again when visiting Denver. Very nice valet staff. I would say the only downside to the hotel was the restaurant. I was disappointed in the service and drinks were overpriced. We tried to order food and were told the kitchen was closed only to see the bartender take food orders from 2 gentlemen at the bar about 10 minutes after we asked. The hotel itself was awesome but go somewhere else for food and drinks.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Expectations not met,"Our stay was a big disappointment. We had to wait 2.5 hours (until 3pm!) for our rooms to get ready. Unfortunately, the pool was also closed due to renovation, so entertaining the kids in the pool while waiting for the rooms to be made up was also not an option. Rooms are ok, but nothing fancy. Overall, not a good experience for a family on vacation in the beautiful state of Colorado.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wonderful visit.,"Stayed for two nights and was thrilled with the fabulous accommodations. The room was spacious, clean and bed was very comfortable.  Over all the hotel has a lot of character.  The staff was excellent and went above and beyond. The location was very convenient to many Denver sites, many of which were within walking distance. The food in the Randolph Restaurant  was good but not excellent so that is why I gave four rather than five stars.  Would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wonderful experience!,"We have been absolutely thrilled with everything about the Warwick.  The service has been stellar.  Tyneta at the front desk was an absolute gem- extremely helpful and friendly when we checked in.  She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything to make the stay pleasant. The other staff have all been wonderful as well, more than willing to answer questions and give recommendations for restaurants, getting around the city, etc.  The beds are extremely comfortable, room is large and very clean and the lobby is lovely.  This place has that Old World charm that newer hotels lack- so much nicer than staying in a cookie-cutter hotel where the rooms and lobby look exactly the same in every city.  Hotel amenities are plentiful and the location is in the midst of it all.  Staying at a hotel like the Warwick becomes part of the experience instead of just-a-place-to-sleep during the experience.  Yet it still provides the modern amenities that travelers expect.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good place for an affordable week stay,"I was looking for an affordable place to stay in Denver for a week which is why I chose this hotel. It is run down but the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bed was really comfortable and clean but the balcony was not well taken care of and the bathroom was small. When we checked in, we were told the rooftop pool was closed which was disappointing. I did like the location. The restaurants near the hotel were great, Steuben's and Tavern Uptown. There were a few more but we did not have time to try them. I am not sure I would stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Awesome Beauty,"Great location. The front desk staff is super sweet, helpful and professional. The hotel is walking distance to a ton of sites in Denver. I've only been here 2 of my 4 night stay and I am completely wowed.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Comfortable hotel,"A very comfortable bed awaits you in the hotel.Hotel is clean, staff pleasant but be aware that the rooftop pool is closed for repairs.Breakfast is very good and the bar has a good atmosphere in the evenings.The room was a little tired and in need of some TLC, but overall good.Hotel organised a town car to the airport for a very reasonable 56 dollars.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A True Denver Gem!,"Just returned this weekend from a family trip to Denver and we have to say we couldn't have been more pleased with The Warwick Denver. The Front Office Manager (Daniel)was most courteous, helpful and kind.  Tynita helped us with car rental info. and even did a map quest for us for our drive out to Pike's Peak. The hotel's serves an amazing breakfast and is located in a really convenient spot ~ close to lots of restaurants, bars and shopping as well. We had a great time visiting the amusement park and Coors Field as well as Pike's Peak. Loved our comfie bed and the big screen tv as well. Great hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Awesome Hotel,"We loved our stay at this hotel, and very thing about this place was awesome. We booked online through Hotwire and when we arrived I asked if we would get a regular room or a ""Hotwire"" room, the receptionist informed me that there isn't a difference and they treat all reservations the same. Once inside the room we loved the layout, the bed was super comfortable, the bathroom was clean and roomy, and it had a patio door with a deck. There is a nice flat screen television with enough channels to find something to watch along with the other typical amenities. All the staff members we had contact with were nothing but exceptionally helpful and courteous. We have stayed at a few 4 star hotels in downtown Denver and this place is by far one of the best.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,First time stay at Warwick Hotel,"Wow, what a great place to stay whether for business or personal.  The staff are professional and friendly.  The location is great to experience many area attractions and restaurants (all within walking distance).  The room I had was perfect.  The balcony was a welcomed addition to sit and read for a bit.  Frankly, I was surprised how well I slept in a hotel bed.  But, they make sure the accommodations are right.  The bed was comfortable, the closet was spacious, the bathroom was very clean and they filter in wonderful scents to make you feel like you are at home.  They have a wonderful bar located inside the hotel that provides the perfect atmosphere for either a work or personal gathering. Great place to stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Our stay at the Warwick Denver,"We had a fantastic time at the Warwick.  Everyone was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. Yes, the pool closure was a disappoinment BUT we received a notification email in plenty of time to allow us the choice to pick another hotel (we didn't). When we received the email we sent back a response asking for free parking for our ""inconvenience"".  Not only did we receive free valet parking we also received a great fruit basket/wine bottle. In addition, hotel management put out complimentary water/soda/cupcakes.  Truthfully, we really didn't even think about the pool.  Randolph's Restaurant had great food even though it was a bit on the pricey side.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Older but good,"This hotel goes back a long time, but is very nice.  The first impression is service of by-gone day.  A doorman, formal lobby with beautiful wood and floors.  The rooms are huge with balconies and chairs. If you have children the room size would be great for them, where they can play and spread out. It was a pleasure to sit outside with a view of the city.  The furnishings were up to date and comfortable. Unfortunately the pool was closed.  I can only imagine that addition would have been great.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice hotel - dingy room,Was here for a weekend trip and Warwick rated highly in Frommers. It was overall a good experience. The linens were top quality. The room was sizable. The lobby beautiful. Staff very friendly and helpful. The carpet on the 14th floor was filthy. The carpet in the room was filthy and the overall decor was outdated and dingy. I still gave it a 4 rating and would recommend it. It needs updated and carpet cleaning. Very good value and location - ask the staff for restaurant recommendations.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Caring staff make this place,"After receiving an email from the manager a week before arrival about the closure of the pool we were very annoyed and were not so nice. What we expected was a hotel void of amenities judging by the comments on here but we were proven wrong. We were put into a beautiful suite with a lovely balcony. There was an amenity with a card hand written by Mr. Eramus who also arranged tickets to a local park which my daughter loved. The front staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the local area. The Hotel is not far from the main street but is a few minutes’ walk.  We missed the pool and are still disappointed.  The amenity and cupcakes as well as the friendly personal service made up for it. The maid on our floor was very charming and constantly asked us if we needed anything. We did eventually take advantage of the conserve card which gave us a $5 discount. We think you will love this hotel if you are about service, but don’t mind an older hotel with a few creases here and there.  We highly recommend this motel.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,We liked our stay,"My husband booked the deluxe king suite and it did not dissapoint. It was like an apartment with a separate bedroom, bathroom, and bar area. Upon arrival they gifted us a big plate of fruit and a bottle of wine. Nice touch. Comfy beds and pillows we slept great. A lot of people complain about the carpet on the balcony but who cares with that city view. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was delicious. It's an older hotel but definitely doesn't lack on charm and comfort. Thanks Warwick.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not clean,"Our room had several areas of filth on the wall, curtain and floors. However  the room was cleaned and was a good size. The beds were not very good. For the price I would recommend  other options. People at check out were also complaining regarding cleanliness. The pool is broken. The people working were friendly.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Clean but amenities lacking.,"Older hotel, but clean and spacious.  Two reasons for choosing this particular hotel:  pool on the roof (was closed) and balcony (faced a parking lot).  Front desk staff was not very friendly or accommodating.  Parking is $30 a day (valet).  Pay lot next door but does not allow in and out access.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,So so hotel,"Upon arrival, our initial balcony room was given away to someone else. We were ""upgraded"" to a bigger room - our room was designed for a handicapped person in a wheel chair. As our room was probably bigger than our intial one, our toilet seat was quite low. There was assistive hand railing in the bathroom. We requested a late checkout, later to find out our request was not granted although front desk claimed ok. The elevator has a mind of its own, it goes to random floors even though you don't press buttons. The pool has been closed due to an emergency. The rooms are quite dated. The black and white pics are a little creepy and are the movie ""Shining-esqe"". I wouldn't stay there again. If however you do decide to stay here and you have AAA, use it for a discount. Oh by the way there were no plugs for chargers, we had to unplug lamps. No fridge. Head over to Walgreens 16th and by water, drinks, and snacks.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Nice hotel , shame about the service ..","Arrived at the hotel at 9:30 am , tired from an overnight train from Chicago. I didn't expect to check in at that early time. Neither did I expect to check in at 3:15pm !! Which is what happened. It was a little annoying to see other guests checking in while I waited and waited in the lobby. This is a shame .. The room was great and so is the city. Good free gym... Shame the top deck pool was out of action",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Over-the-top service!,"The Warwick Denver is in an ideal location between downtown and the Denver Zoo/Museum of Nature & Science! The neighborhood is welcoming and the whole experience was phenomenal. To be completely honest, I was a little disappointed due to the rooftop pool being out of service during my stay, but it wasn't a deal breaker.  The general manager and the rest of his staff were all incredibly friendly and incredibly accommodating.  They're all very knowledgable of the neighboring area and went out of their way to help me further enjoy my time in Denver.  I would definitely recommend!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Hotel and restaurant staff are fantastic!,"We had a rocky start when we first arrived only.  The valet was a tad snippy when, in our truck we could not move to the desired location fast enough, but it was all up hill from there. The room was as I had booked it and very comfortable!  The best part was the staff and management of the restaurant, especially Sarah and Raul at Randolph!  We had a fabulous meal and I was introduced to the Denver Mule!  It comes in a Copper Cup which you will love!  Thanks Sarah! All the staff at both the hotel and restaurant are fantastic!  We will remember this trip to Denver and Red Rocks concert for the rest of our lives!  Way to go Warwick Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Denver Warwick,"We had a wonderful experience at this hotel.  The staff was super nice and friendly.  We used the valet service and it was phenomenal and the valet staff was amazing.  Our room was a corner King Suite on 10th floor.  Very spacious, very clean for an older hotel.  Towels were nice and fluffy.  Water was hot and had good pressure.  Bed was comfortable.  Linens were soft and plush. Had room service lunch one day and it was delicious.  I would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Beautiful and clean hotel, a little expensive, quite a walk to downtown","The Warwick Denver was a beautiful hotel and I really enjoyed staying there. The staff was absolutely wonderful and very accommodating and friendly. It was a little more expensive than I had been hoping, but it was definitely worth the price. The hotel was clearly very pet-friendly.   In terms of location, the hotel was not as close to downtown as I would have liked it to have been. You can take a bus down the street or walk a ways to get to the light rail station, but it ends up being faster to walk just to get to the 16th Street Mall area. However, walking back to the hotel (if you take any of the numbered streets, like 17th Streets), it is not an easy walk because it is all uphill. If you are planning on driving, the hotel is not far at all, but walkers and users of public…",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Good location, ok hotel","The hotel is in a great location and the staff was very helpful. The rooms were not bad but not great though probably in line with the price which was reasonable. I'm not sure if it was because it is a pet-friendly hotel but there was a weird smell in the lobby- it was to the point where we couldn't sit in the lobby and enjoy what looked like a lovely fire-place area because it was somewhat overwhelming. The bathrooms were clean enough and it is always nice to have a balcony- I feel claustrophobic in hotels where the windows don't open. Considering the price and location, I would say it could be worth it- I would probably look to stay elsewhere next time but we had a very fun time visiting Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Wonderful hotel, with surprises","Really like this hotel, its location, its vibe. The staff is exceptional. However, I would recommend that future guests double check their reservations to make sure you are accommodated as expected (I was placed in a lower tier room, having reserved an upper tier room - though the staff quickly make the change at check in) and was surprised to learn that the hotel pool was closed for repairs (after having chosen the Warwick over other hotels because of the advertised amenities). The staff did not offer an explanation until check-in. If I return, I will remember to ask when making the reservation if all the hotel amenities will be available during my stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Decent for the price and location,"Positives: - Large room and walk-in closet - Pet friendly - Balcony - Service  Negatives: - Ice machines are only on certain floors - Hallways didn't smell very good - Harsh, fluorescent lights in bathroom - Swimming pool area not that nice compared to photos. It could use some jazzing up. - Mini bar area in the room needs re-do. Warped, old wood and fridge wasn't cold.  Overall, about as expected for the price.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice reasonably priced downtown hotel,"Booked here because of the roof top pool.  Sadly it was not working when we arrived. HUGE disappointment for us.  They did send out an e-mail ahead of time warning of this but this was my main reason for booking this hotel.  It is a charming hotel with nice amenities.  If you arrive by car you can park for $17 a night in the covered lot next door.  Nice large room and loved having a balcony.  Just a couple block walk to the free mall shuttle.  You can ride the shuttle close to a lot of places you probably want to see, Convention Center, Larimar Street etc.  If I came back to Denver and the pool was working would definitely stay here. Good price and good location.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A little disappointing,"A solid three star...not four.Distance to the 16th Street Mall is a bit further than lead to believe.  More like four long blocks.  Bring your walking shoes.  17th street is also great, though, with lots of restaurants and bars.I did like that it was dog friendly.  And, the rooms were quite spacious and beds comfortable.  The front door staff was terrific and helpful with directions.  Registration staff so-so.  Check your bill carefully -- lots of errors on ours.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Usually a great experience, not this time.","I've stayed at the Warwick the last few times I've been in Denver and it's usually a very positive experience.  This time around, I was in town with my 4 piece band to play a few shows.  We reserved a 2 queen bed room so that the 4 of us could sleep comfortably and looked forward to relaxing after our gigs in the pool.  Upon check in we were told that there were no 2 bed rooms available so we were ""upgraded"" to a ""suite."" We were also informed that the pool was closed, but the Warwick would reimburse us if we wanted to use the public pool down the street.  Seriously.  So we get to the suite and it's got a king bed and a pull out couch.  We drew straws for the couch and I ended up on it both nights.  Even as far as pull out couches are concerned, this was terribly uncomfortable.  Overall I absolutely do not feel I got my $522 worth, not by a long shot.  Additionally, house keeping came by around 9AM.  We asked her to come back in a couple of hours, and no one ever did--the room wasn't cleaned once in the 2 nights we stayed.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Good location, well priced with Denver history",The staff was very friendly at check-in they gave us a hotel credit as the pool wasn't working so that was nice. Location is great to 17th street bars and restaurants which is close walk to most places. Hotel is more on old side and could use a little updating. But overall met our needs.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A Great Part of our Denver Experience - The Warwick Hotel!,"We just returned from spending six days in the Warwick Hotel in Denver and it was a delightful experience. From the moment you enter the lobby, you are greeted with warmth and enthusiasm by the staff welcoming you to their hotel. We unfortunately learned upon arrival that the rooftop pool was not available which was a disappointment as we were looking forward to it. Despite that little set-back upon arrival, we could not have asked for more courteous, friendly and overall professional staff that were there to respond to every one of our needs. Randolph's the bar and restaurant featured some great drinks and their culinery selections were wonderful. Recommendation for breakfast, try their yogurt parfait with berries a great way to start the day and with afternoon drinks, I recommend their crab cakes which were beyond delicious. Dinner, the short braised ribs fell off the bone, the pasta was equally good. All in all, the food was excellent and beautifully displayed.Overall, the Warwick lived up to the excellent reputation from the one I stayed in at New York and would book again in another city. Rooms are a good size with all the amenities required.They are pet friendly if that is important to you, we enjoyed seeing the different dogs coming and going, gave it a home down feeling.It is very well situated for getting into the downtown area but far enough away to get you away from the hustle bustle of everyday traffic. The property itself is very well maintained.They have an outdoor patio where they serve food and drinks with umbrella's -simply delightful.Recommend this hotel for a great experience in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Terrific staff,Wes stayed at the Warwick for a few days while we were in Denver and found it to be a very nice hotel with a great location. The hotel has classic feel and very comfortable. We had an 8th floor room facing the street and the accommodations worked well for us. We were not able to use the pool due to some repair bit it definitely would be a great place to relax on a warm afternoon.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Over priced, but not terrible","The hotel itself wasn't to bad, the rooms were nice and large, although a little dirty. The valets were amazing always super friendly and ready to give you recommendations on places to visit. The front desk was not extremely friendly or welcoming.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Way too overpriced and not the best location.,"Stayed here at the end of great location. This was the third hotel during our trip and really did not meet expectations.  Our other two hotels during our trip were outstanding so this was really a bummer.   The bathroom was dirty - yuck!   Also, the pool was closed during our stay.  I understand things happen but they should have sent a message to us prior to our arrival letting us know.  One of the main reasons we stayed here was we wanted to relax after a week of travel /driving.   We paid extra to stay at this particular hotel because of the pool.  I asked the staff if there was another hotel we could go to and there were no options only a ""sorry"".   Very disappointed in our stay at the Warick .  Would not stay again as they did not exceed expectations.  Definitely need to work on customer service.    Also, when we booked using expedia it said we would have a balcony and mountain view - well this was not the case.   We overlooked the parking lot and no mountains plus outdoor patio area was dirty.    I will say the rooms were nice and large.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Hotel with Balconies,"The rooms were great each with its own balcony. The management took care of us and it was in a great location. Not to far from great restaurants or 16th mall.  I highly recommend this hotel, every view is good.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Decent hotel, a bit removed from the action","Stayed 2 nights at the Warwick for a conference, also hosted at the hotel.  Overall my stay was pleasant and the room was large and comfortable, but things were just a little off for me to have rated the hotel perfect.  I had great water pressure in the shower, but hardly any in my hot water at the sink in the bathroom.  The mini bar was well stocked, but the mini fridge that housed the drinks was barely cold.  And the door stop for my front door was missing from the floor, so there was a hole in the carpet.  I used the fitness center one morning, and a few of the machines were not working properly and none offered tv.  The water cooler was not working, and I took the last towel available (at 5am).  Views are great from the 15th floor fitness center, watching the sun rise over the city.Also, the rooftop pool was ""closed for emergency maintenance."" While I understand that happens, it's a major focus of their advertising and was closed all three days I was there.  Disappointing,  However, the bed was comfortable, the room large with a private balcony, and the wifi was efficient and easy.  We ate at the hotel's restaurant for lunch one day and service was good, and portions were generous.  It should be noted that while the hotel sits on the edge of downtown, it's a bit removed from the pedestrian mall and major restaurants and nightlife.  There are some places to eat and drink nearby, but you're not ""in the heart of it"" here.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Pool Closed,Nice hotel and the valet staff are amazing. We broke the hotel for a 2 day stay to unwind and relax but the pool. When we check in we find that the pool has a crack in it and has been closed for over a week. They hotel did not bother letting their future guest know the pool was closed so they could make other arrangements if they choose to. Upon check in the Front desk was not very friendly and acted like the pool being closed was no big deal.,2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick - great for business meeting!,the sales and catering staff were AMAZING in ensuring our meeting was perfect in every detail. (I saw a lot of guests in town for leisure as well - Rockies in town that night :) - and they all seemed to be pleased with the facility as well.),5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very Nice Hotel,"Very nice hotel and rooms. No parking options is not a great thing and I think $30 per night for valet when there is public parking for $17 next door is a bit out there. The free WiFi was a nice surprise, other reviewers said you had to pay for it, which I will not do. Love the rooftop pool and the room service was excellent, Mary was very helpful and friendly.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Loved this Place,Just stayed here as we were in Denver for a wedding. What a wonderful hotel. Location was close to Lowdo and everything we needed for the wedding!  The rooms were very nice and the lobby bar was great!  Staff were great and checkin easy! Will definitely stay here again when visiting Denver!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for a business training trip. I stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was very nice. The room was clean and decorated nicely. It had a stocked mini fridge, but no microwave (which would be my only complaint). There was a restaurant with a bar that served happy hour menu items that were yummy. Megan was our server and she was top notch. Also, Alex was very great and knowledgeable about the area and gave us great tips on places to go. The hotel was situated so that the I was able to walk to all of the places I needed to. Overall this hotel was very nice and accommodating.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Service,"The staff at this hotel was key to our enjoyable stay - friendly and organized.  The room was a good size and we really liked that it had it's own little balcony to sit out on.  Had a nice view of downtown.  The hotel could use a few updates, but overall it still has an old-fashioned coolness.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good home base,"The location was only three blocks from the downtown shopping and sights. The hotel had some early 20th century charm. Staff was overly friendly. Pool was gorgeous in the morning or at night. There is no mountain view, just city and east into the plains.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Five-Star Gem in Downtown Denver,"Centrally located in downtown with excellent, friendly staff, efficient check-in and check-out, and a really great restaurant on the premises. The hotel offers old-world charm while still providing modern amenities. This is now my ""go-to"" hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent service,"We stayed at the Warwick last week and were given amazing service. We booked on Expedia and paid $200, on arrival we were given a welcome with wine and cheese, up to the room and there was a gift from the General Manager him self...wow.   The room service was excellent.  Food was nice but too expensive . Front desk staff were excellent7 too. I especially  appreciated the call from Teneta  after we arrived. She was very helpful.   The pillows were to hard and felt very synthetic.  Very old and worn out but beautiful balcony with  perfect view of  downtown.  The fridge in the room  did not work.  We called the operator and received a free Beverage and ice and within 20 minutes a fridge arrived, also did  not cool our  milk well but was ok.  Pool on the roof is a must.  Early in the morning it's an experience we loved.  The two of us on top of denver .Excellent restaurant with a very good Manager albert.  Megan in the bar and Hays were all helpful and friendly.We did enjoy the location which  was not too far from 16th Street and close to local restaurants.   We had the best dinner in a long time at Beastly bottle, a little bit of a walk but was worth it.A very good hotel with friendly and efficient staff but in need of some Updates especially the carpet in the room.We think this is a good buy at its price.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great Place, Great Location","I had a suite which was quite lovely.  Balcony private bedroom.   Upon arrival to my room, there was a fruit basket and a bottle of wine for me to enjoy.  I guess for $300 a night, you should get something...lol",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Average is the perfect word,"Stayed here for a week and found the hotel to be just fine.  Room was clean, a little outdated, but functional.  Hotel elevators were slow.  The gem to me is the restaurant patio and I had a delicious dinner there.   Nestled into a great neighborhood with good restaurants nearby, loved the location.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,You better check your credit card ...,"Surprise, surprise; for some reason I got a 10 $ bill on my credit card. There was no bill, so I had to ask for that and well, it looks like I used the 'honor bar' ... whatever that is. I guess the mini-bar. Well, I never use anything there (far too expensive). So I suppose that there was some mix-up with room number, some person not able to count the number of bottles in the fridge (or the right number was not put in before), or a person paying with my room number, who cares. I sent three mails, polite, less polite and a complaint and no reply at all.So, here is my feedback, worth 10 dollars.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Average is a good way to describe the Warwick,"This was my first trip to Denver, and after reading many reviews, I booked at the Warwick. I was in town for a wedding and stayed for 3 nights over a July weekend.If you visit their website, the building looks like it's cast in gold. Very elegant. In reality, this has to be a contender for one of the ugliest buildings in Denver. It is a block of concrete and reminded me of Soviet architecture from old East Berlin. Is that really a negative? No. I would never take a star off for that. But it deserves mentioning.I got a room on the third floor overlooking the parking lot. Welcome to Denver! Not a great view at all. The rooms are average. There's an outdoor balcony which I didn't really use. I took a star off because they don't use fitted sheets on the bed. A hotel must use fitted sheets to get 5 stars from me.Bathroom is average. Everything worked. Nice oatmeal soap.The location was great for me. I walked to Coors Field and down to the 16th St mall. I didn't rent a car and used Uber when I needed to get to the wedding. This is a quieter part of town but still close enough to get to places. Didn't use room service because the prices were too high for me. Plus they add 22% tip and $3 delivery fee to every order. If you don't want to leave the room to sample one of the nearby restaurants, you pay the price.Everyone who works here is very nice. Great staff. But I deducted a second star because my room did not get cleaned during the day on Sunday. I was gone all day and returned at 5 pm. The room was not cleaned. The maid knocked at 5:53. I told her I would have liked to have the room cleaned, but I had been gone all day and I didn't want to go back out. She apologized and explained they were very busy. This is not an excuse, only evidence that the Warwick has a workforce management problem. If you cannot get all your rooms cleaned by 5 pm, you need to hire more people.All and all an average experience. When I come to Denver next year, I will definitely try another hotel. I think for $20 more a night I could have gotten at least a 4 star experience.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great weekend getaway!,"LOVE this hotel!  Great rooftop pool, exceptional staff, 4 blocks to 16th Street mall in downtown Denver, wonderful restaurant, and very nice rooms!  Make sure to get a room above the 6th floor so you get the views of downtown.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Always a pleasant stay,"Always my favorite. Great location, right on the outskirts of the action. Clean. Good room service. Car service downtown. Quiet. (For a city) and you can walk to Ace or Steuben's (two of my favorite restaurants)- The Warwick is highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A Hidden Jewel,"If you are looking for a reasonable 4 star property, look no further.  Friendly staff and very nice rooms.  They even have balconies!  15 stories, so not overly busy!  Kind of tucked away, but that's what made it a find.  Didn't mind the $30 parking fee because room was reasonable...unlike the major chains! Quiet, comfortable, and friendly.  Perfect stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Value,"Convenient location with large clean room and good sized balcony. Restaurant was better than average, the food was very well prepared but not all items were available. Compared to the upscale Brown Palace this was a great place to stay for the price and would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Anniversary trip,The location of this hotel was convenient to all siteseeing downtown and the friendliness of the staff will definitely bring me back. They had everything set up in our suite for my anniversary surprise for my husband.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,All class,"I was lucky to get a room at the Warwick when I was in town for business. I wish I could have stayed longer. I had a great room with a balcony with an even better view of the city. Centrally located, the Warwick is close to everything. I appreciated how quiet my room was and just how comfortable the bed was.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Promising hotel needs some improvements,"We spent two nights (July 4th weekend) in this 16-story hotel, located five blocks from the Civic Center Station of the free 16th St. Mall bus.  (The westbound #20 bus stops across the intersection the hotel is located at.)  The hotel, once Denver’s Playboy Club, is in a tree-lined neighborhood a couple blocks east of the downtown Denver skyscrapers.  So the Warwick is fairly convenient to Civic Center and the 16th St. Mall, but hardly in the midst of all the restaurants, museums, and entertainment venues there.The Warwick has the only roof-top swimming pool in Denver, modest in size with heated water and glass panels providing views from the deck in most directions.  Randolph’s restaurant is adjacent to the attractive, low-ceilinged lobby and has a pleasant, tree-and-rock-lined outdoor patio near the somewhat noisy intersection; we had breakfast, dinner, and brunch there with good food and service.  Only two of the three elevators are functional, one marginally so (it sometimes goes down when it is supposed to go up, and it displays incorrect floor numbers).  East-facing rooms apparently lack balconies while downtown-facing rooms all have balconies.Our room, termed a ""junior suite"", was large and nicely furnished.  The main area has a three-person couch (convertible bed), a comfortable king bed, dresser, a large HD TV (which greets you by name), two luggage racks and a bench, two sizable bedside tables, and a closet with a safe.  The smaller partition -- separated from the main bedroom only by furniture, the TV, and a large mahogany post -- has a desk and chair, a separate comfortable chair with a reading light, and a small bar unit/mini-fridge.  The very spacious bathroom has a tub and a large, separate shower unit with height-adjustable hand spray nozzle.  Air temperature is well-maintained and quiet.  Wifi often costs extra unless you sign up for a Warwick hotels account. The Warwick could rate 5 stars if it were better maintained, the service were top-notch, and communications were less confusing.  Signs by the pool were mutually inconsistent, one saying that no food or drink was allowed in the pool or on the deck, while another sign offered poolside snacks and drinks.  Information in the room says check-out is 11 a.m., but the website says that it is at noon…which it was.  We were assured at check-in that no pets were allowed on our floor of this “pet-friendly” hotel, but a large dog barked and lunged at us on our floor.  We liked our table at dinner one evening and asked that it be reserved for us for Sunday brunch; we were told that the request would be in our reservation but that it couldn’t be absolutely guaranteed.  Upon arriving for brunch, our table had just been given to another party a few minutes earlier, despite all the other empty tables, apparently because our request was overlooked.We were told that an hour of free wine-and-cheese begins in the lobby at 5 pm, and we looked forward to spending the half-hour there before our early 5:30 dinner reservations.  But the wine-and-cheese didn’t appear until 5:20 p.m.  The next day we came to the lobby at 5:45 p.m. but there was no sign of wine-and-cheese. Upon entering our room the second evening, we discovered that our extra roll of toilet paper hadn't been replaced, leaving us with half-a-roll.  We phoned the front desk and were told that a replacement would be put outside our door.  Two-and-a-half hours later, it still hadn’t happened, so we called the front desk again.  By this time, we’d noticed that none of the drinks (including a small champagne) we had consumed the previous evening from our mini-fridge had been replaced, so ""Dan"" said he would have a small bottle of champagne sent up.  We watched holiday fireworks from our window for 45 minutes, but no champagne appeared. We called down to the front desk, and nobody there nor the person in charge of room-service was aware of such an order...it had disappeared into a black hole.  Eventually, after the fireworks had dwindled away, champagne appeared.  At check-out, staff explained that mini-fridge items aren’t replaced until rooms are vacated, but they didn’t charge for our drinks.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Classic & classy,The roof top pool and the balcony...awesome view! I was lucky enough to get a room facing the front. I mentioned their beautiful city and I got to face it and enjoy it. Real swanky no smoking ...but complimentary wine and cheese .Take advantage of that if its up your alley. It was great room. Best 4th of July ever. Denver ....do i really have to say any more.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Hotel Was Misrepresented,"We booked four nights at the Warwick for our 10-year wedding anniversary and were very excited about our stay.  We chose the Warwick specifically because of the rooftop pool which looked amazing for Denver from the photos on their site.  Upon arriving for our check-in on Monday, we were informed that the rooftop pool was closed for maintenance until Wednesday.  We were not even allowed on the roof to sun tan.  I had contacted the Warwick on the previous Saturday to confirm our reservation and they did not mention anything about maintenance to the pool.  We decided to stay at the Warwick so that we could enjoy the rooftop pool on Wednesday and Thursday when it was open again.Our room was a suite and couldn't have been further from 'sweet'.  The balcony was large, but hadn't been cared for in a while with loose and upturned carpet to match the living space of the room.  The furniture was all old and the room had a damp smell about it.  It is important to know that there is no refrigerator in this room that can be used!  We did not notice that when we booked the room so that is our bad, but there is a mini frig under the wet bar, but it is completely full of beverages with a sign that indicated that anything removed from the frig would automatically be charged to our room bill!  So, yeah, you can't use the frig :)  I had checked previously if they had HDMI connections on the TV in the room which I was informed they did, but when I went to connect I found there was no way to select HDMI for the input.  I had to call the front desk and someone changed a setting on the TV governor that finally let me use the HDMI on the TV.  They really want you to buy their digital content and not bring your own.On Wednesday, we checked with the front desk on when the pool would be open only to find that now it would not be open until Friday!  I believe that the staff misinformed us that the pool would ever be open simply to get us to stay for the first two nights.  I was very upset and spoke to the manager who agreed to reimburse us our last two nights if we wanted to leave which we did.  We did not get reimbursement for the two nights we stayed waiting for the pool to open though.It was an overall regretful booking!  We booked the next two nights further out from the downtown and had a terrific experience to make up for the Warwick hotel.  My hope is that others will heed the warning of the Warwick.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Beautiful hotel in the center of Denver,"I stayed here a couple weeks ago. The room was large with a small balcony. It was very clean, formal decor. Staff was friendly. The rooftop swimming pool although small, was niceafter a hot summer day with nice views of the city. Prices are high, but if you are flexible and plan, you can find a day here and there where prices are affordable.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Pictures look great on the web,"Old, run down, shaky elevator, dead bugs in bathroom.  The only good thing about this hotel is the restaurant and they do allow dogs though I did not bring mine.  Mattress has cover like a baby bed and squeaks every time you move, pillows are hard as a rock.  I can't believe it made Denver's top 10 hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very Average ,"The hotel is old and is in need of a make over, however the staff are very friendly and helpfull and the rooms and beds are huge. I also like the fact that the hotel is pet freandly. One disgusting thing I witnessed, some one left a food tray in front of the lifts and this was about 2pm and I don't now how long it had been there? But when I came back at midnight it was still there, not on?",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick-Worn Out,"It's a stretch to give this property a 3.  I don't know which room was used for the photo on the website, but it sure wasn't the room we were given.  After booking two adjoining rooms over a month in advance and a hassle at the front desk upon checking in, we arrived to find our rooms to be on the same floor but in no way adjoining.  If the carpeting was part of an update then the choice of pattern makes it look like you shouldn't take your socks off.  The ""balcony"" is a painted metal box with a couple of metal chairs and black carpet (?) that was so soggy and stained you couldn't go out without shoes, and then you didn't want to walk back in the room for fear of what you were bringing with you.  If I didn't know better I would have thought it was a sub-par remodel of an old folks home.  The restaurant wasn't bad, but was completely devoid of customers and run by a pleasant, skeleton crew who also had to service the pool which has no bar of its' own but a definite crowd.  I love Denver and travel there often.  I was very disappointed in my stay and will not be returning.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Ok place,"Stayed here for two nights last weekend. This hotel is 50 years old. Obviously it has been renovated a few times since the original build, however, it is ready for another one. The location is good. Parking is a complete rip off at 30 dollars a day via the hotel valet. On weekends you can park on the street for free. My room appeared clean, but upon further investigation, lots of dust on everything, most noticeably on the phone in the bathroom. Come on guys, it's 2015, get rid of the gross, un-clean, bathroom phone. No one uses them. Also some leftover small nuts in the corner on the right side of the bed upon check in. Still present after the room was cleaned after the first night. Elevators are slow and stuffy. Fitness center has three treadmills and other workout equipment as well. No TV in fitness center. One treadmill broken. I had a monster drink, one cocktail, one water, and one beer out of the ""honor bar"" and it was 31 dollars. I expected it to be pricy, but didn't know I was going to be taken advantage of. I even left behind 4-5 beers. I stayed in room 803. Also, balconies are unusable as they have some weird moldy indoor-outdoor carpet that isn't even still sticking to the floor anymore.  Probably better places to stay but the location is decent.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice Hotel For A Weekend Visit,"I spent two nights here with my fiancee whilst on a road trip and the hotel was ideal for our needs while we were in Denver. By this point in the trip we were ready to have some time to relax and the rooftop pool was perfect for it. The pool area itself was small but nice, as was the bar and the food served up there was delicious. The location of the hotel was great, a short walk from the main sights and nightlife, and as it was a weekend we were able to park on the street for free just opposite the hotel. The room itself was good and we enjoyed our stay here.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very comfortable hotel with an excellent restaurant,"We stayed for four nights, and almost everything was perfect. An excellent room, many first-class meals in the restaurant, and a fast and friendly valet service for the car. A quality hotel. Good WiFi, free with our room category.  Only two criticisms - some noise from the lift at night, as our room backed onto the lift, and the pool was being serviced for part of our visit.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Almost perfect,"Friendly staff, comfy bed, spacious room. Love this place. Pool is awesome, who doesn't like a rooftop pool. Randolphs is really good, pricey, but really good. There is less expensive parking next door, but the valet parking is handy and not that bad really.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Needs updating,"I was very disappointed by the hotel after reading the reviews. The bed was lumpy, the sheets poor quality, and the carpet on the outdoor patio was moldy. The bathroom had a shower curtain which allowed water to get on the floor. Also, the bathroom sink leaked. I must say the staff was wonderful, and after listening to my complaints the manager gave us one free night. If I were to go back I would ask if they have renovated any of the rooms.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent Experience. Minus age,"My partner and I stayed at the hotel over pride weekend and enjoyed the weekend. Lovely pool on the roof friendly and professional staff. We especially enjoyed the lobby staff Daniel and Wan, The lady who served us the wine in the lobby, even my housekeeping guy was helpful in getting me ice when he saw me exiting my room with my ice bucket.The balcony was in bad condition, the bed was comfortable but the furniture was old and obviously cheap. All in , a very good hotel with caring staff, but hotel needs some updates. We will be back to enjoy the pool and warm hospitality.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great location, friendly staff","We stayed here in May, 2015. Location is great and is in walking distance of most downtown locations. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean. Would definitely stay here again if in the area. There is a heated out door pool on the roof that gives great views of downtwon.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great location,"We decided to stay at this hotel because of its location. We weren't disappointed. We were close to the 16th street mall, convention center (for a graduation ceremony we were attending), the Capitol, Molly Brown historic home and other attractions. The staff was very friendly. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom didn't have enough towel racks for two but we improvised. I was disappointed after paying $225+ per night that we had to pay for wi-fi and parking. The restaurant adjacent to the lobby is NOT worth visiting. Athough the food is ok, the staff is slow. Our first night, it took quite some time to get our beverages. I had the pork shank and it was delicious. The next morning, our breakfast was cold, indicating that it sat for quite some time, even though the restaurant wasn't crowded. We didn't frequent that restaurant again.I haven't decided if I'd stay at this hotel again.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,LoDo Feel without the LoDo Noise,"We stayed at the Warwick for a wedding.  It was a great hotel.  While we didn't explore much, the staff was very helpful and keen to give us the lowdown on the amenities at the hotel.The beds were comfy, the room was quiet.  And I'm going to go back just to see the skyline at night from the rooftop pool.Only downside (other than lack of time) was slow service at Randolph's on Sunday morning, but it gave us time to sit outside on the gorgeous patio and talk.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The WarCrap,"Poor staff hopitality, dirty, run-down, no attention to detail, and very expensive. Could have stayed at the Broadmoor or Westin for what we paid, and we got CRAP! House keeping and Valet were great..",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Ok style hotel but nice,"Stayed here for a night in denver . walking distance to  coors stadium about 20 min walk . also about a 15 min walk to quite a few resturants.  The hotel itself was clean , friendly staff. we had a corner room that was big , giant bathroom and bed . bed was older , the decor of the room was older. overall a nice hotel , good location",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A Bit Run Down...,"The hotel is located in nice area just off the busy 16th street mall, and the hotel staff was terrific however the hotel is a bit run down and not up to 4 star standards.  The rooms are not finished as shown in the online ad that's on the hotel's website. To me this is inexcusable since the hotel selling itself via the web and as we all know must be a good representation of what we should expect.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Weekend Experience,"My husband and I selected this hotel for a weekend getaway in Denver to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. We were very impressed with all of the staff who assisted us, from the valet attendant to the front desk associate to the waiter at Randolph's. All were professional, friendly, and very helpful. We were upgraded to a really spacious suite which was unexpected and made our experience so much more memorable. The rooms have a definite historical ambiance so they seem a little worn, though you can tell there has been an effort to keep up with modern conveniences. Our room was very clean. We were able to spend a morning at the rooftop pool which was excellent. Lots of direct sunlight and seating/ lounge chairs.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,In need of serious update,"This hotel needs a good scrub from top to bottom.  The furniture in our room was stained and the carpet needed replacement.  What is with the carpet on the balcony that was dirty and crumpled?  I am not sure with all the hotels in Denver why this hotel has not had a remodel.  It is not reflected in the price, as that was high for this hotel.  With so many other choices I would not stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good choice for Denver,"While a little further to walk into the center of Denver than other hotels, it's just a few blocks and offers a unique atmosphere with large, elegant rooms and some special amenities including the heated rooftop pool. Staff friendly and accommodating, both the continental and hot breakfasts good with excellent fresh fruit and pastries well presented. A couple of minor maintenance needs noticed in rooms, but generally well kept up. While maintaining its traditional ambiance, the hotel appears to be appealing to a broader clientele including younger people, with a new and more contemporary image reflected in its room guides. Prices are rising and there may be fewer specials if the hotel is doing well, but worth looking for or asking about special rates lower than the standard advertised price, since this may no longer be competitive with other area luxury hotels.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Repeatable excellence,"Always an excellent stay with clean rooms an great town car service. Randolph's service was not as stellar as it typically is. Food was decent. Definitely better choices in Denver. Try Linger, it rocks!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The rooftop pool is awesome,"Nice stay. The staff is fantastic, great service. You can tell it is a priority in the staff training.  The rooftop pool is amazing.  I wish we had had more time to enjoy. Great city views.  Very relaxing.  That is why I picked it and it was worth it.The rooms need a little TLC.  I loved the balcony but the railing was in need of painting and the floor was a weird carpet like thing.  It rained that day so it was soaking wet.  It was nice to leave the balcony doors opened at night.  The rooms were very spacious.  I guess the newer hotels are not as roomy. The bed was very comfortable as well as the linens.Good location, a bit of a walk to the Denver Performing Arts Center but doable.  It was easier to use the valet parking.  The wifi was additional which was a disappointment.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Lovely hotel near amenities,"I just recently stayed at the Warwick Denver Hotel. It was a beautiful hotel and the hotel staff was very welcoming. My room was a very large 1-bedroom suite complete with separate living area and bedroom. The location of the hotel is great, near some great restaurants and bars. I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Nice hotel, but....","Stayed at the Warwick in June.Nice old property in an excellent location for me.Had bicycles for guests. Even though newspapers were not delivered to rooms, I always managed to grab one in the lobby.My room, on the 14th floor had a city view and I could get a glimpse of the mountains.The staff was pleasant, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the room was quite large.Free WIFI was great and the room had a large flat screen TV.On the down side:The balcony had a rotten wood floorThe amenity dish in the bathroom was chipped, and ""hidden"" by washcloth placementOverall, pluses out weighed minuses",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick was great,"Stayed here for 4 days for business. This place was perfect. Rooms were nice, very clean, and HUGE - with a balcony too. Staff was nice and friendly and overall wonderful location! I will definitely be staying here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice hotel and decent location,"Rooms were very nice. Wifi was $10/day and very slow! Parking was $30/day, but st parking wasn't too hard to find.  Ac was awful! Too cold or else the heat kicked on?!?! Fire and no one could hear alarm in rooms. Nice bazar w decent drinks. Pet friendly!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great hotel, close to the main attractions of The Mile High city","The hotel was extremely comfortable, with spacious and very well presented rooms. Its location is within easy reach of all the main attractions and shopping areas that Denver has to offer. Service in the hotel was first class, as was the restaurant which provided extremely palatable food and wine. I'd have no hesitation in recommending the Warwick to anyone visiting Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Location,"The Warwick Hotel is in a great location in Denver.  It is walking distance to the 16th Street Mall, Civic Park and Capitol. We have stayed here several times and have enjoyed our stay.  We would recommend requesting a room at higher floor. We couldn't use our patio on 4th floor because the gas fumes from equipment on ground level were strong.  ",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great location,"The Warwick Denver is very well located, being just a short stroll to the Denver Senate buildings. We were given a warm welcome on arrival, and throughout our stay we found the staff to be both friendly and helpful. Our room was clean, large and very comfortable. Breakfast offered a good choice and was reasonably priced. A nice surprise was the free mid-afternoon offering of wine and cheese in the lobby-lounge, which, surprisingly the hotel did not seem to advertise to its guests. We chanced upon as we returned from sightseeing a little earlier than anticipated. The only negative about this hotel is that, like so many other big city hotels, it charges for wifi. How different this is to the small-town hotels and motels we used on this trip, which universally offered free wifi.…",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Amazing Trip!,"A friend and I stayed at the Warwick Denver and absolutely loved it. The staff was friendly, rooms clean, and we had a great view of the city and mountains. We chose this hotel partly because of its downtown location, as we did not have a car. We were able to easily get around and the hotel provided a free car service to Union Station. I will definitely be staying at Warwick in the future!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Greatly placed location making up for any shortcomings,"The draw to the Warwick, in addition to being an appealing update of an older hotel, is the fact that it's well positioned to allow guests walking access to most of the neighborhoods within Denver you'd hope to visit.  Our room had a balcony and they have a heated pool on the roof and a nice sized gym.  The beds weren't terribly comfortable and we were put in a handicap room for whatever reason so we had an odd layout.  But overall, wouldn't mind staying here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Lovely hotel spoiled by incompetent email communications,"I really enjoyed this hotel - the room was great, the service smiling; the location - 4 blocks from the 16th st mall shuttle, good. But they put a $50 holding charge on my foreign exchange debit card, and although I emailed them asking for it to be lifted, 6 days later they have done nothing. I had also emailed them before my arrival to see if I could co-ordinate their town shuttle with the bus from the airport - the answer to that email arrived late and did not answer the question I asked. So overall a good hotel but it really needs to lift its game in communicating with guests. And it is simply not good enough not to lift a holding charge after a guest has departed.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,combining business and pleasure in denver,The Warwick was an enjoyable hotel for my five night stay It is close enough to both downtown and the free bus on the mall that takes you all the way to Union Station and the ballpark while allowing easy 20 minute walk access to City park and the Musuem of Science and Nature. Very affordably priced especiallly if you get the breakfast included rate. Nice touch that they have bikes free for guests use.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Location,"Chose the Warwick as the training I was attending was using the conference rooms. Door men were friendly, room was a good size and nicely decorated, loved the large balcony.  Staff was consistently friendly, Internet faster than some other hotels I have stayed at. The hotel is in close proximity to the 16th st. area & nice restaurants etc.. Loved the leafy street.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Large Rooms,"The hotel is about 5 blocks to the end of the 16th street mall and 3 blocks from the state capitol. It is on the edge of downtown but walking distance to restaurants and other shops. The room was large with a good sized bathroom and sitting area. They are very pet friendly (without being smelly) and our room on the 4th floor had a good sized balcony though no view. There are only 3 elevators so check out time can get crowded. The front desk staff and bell boys were helpful and the wine and cheese happy hour on Friday afternoon was a nice touch. The lobby is really nice, has chess and with the fireplace on it made it a place we wanted to hangout.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Pleasant One Night Stay at the Warwick,"Stayed here for one night in May.  Requested a higher floor and got it.  Nice city view.  They also provided me a cell phone charger after mine broke, which was cool.  The pool on the roof was nice and warm too.  Liked the balcony as well.  The old school feel of the hotel was very enjoyable.  The room was big and the bed was comfy.  If we return it'd be nice to bring a dog, as they appeared well set up for it.  Not much within immediate walking distance is the only drawback, but that's what cabs and uber are for I guess.  Would definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The staff make this elegant hotel exceptional,"The Front Desk staff (Mr. Wony?) were patient, professional and very helpful with directions. The room was spacious, quiet, very clean, and quiet. Breakfast was very good. RThe pool was exceptional, as was the view. There were plenty of towels and the area was very clean.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent stay,"We stayed at the hotel as part of a group tour. Even though the group arrived in the morning, the staff went out of their way to look after us. They gave us cookies and fresh lemonade to welcome us and gave us our rooms as soon as they became available. The room was large and quiet with a large balcony. The hotel is well located with only a short walk to get into the main part of town. If we were planning to visit the Rockies we would definitely choose this hotel again as a base.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A romantic stay,We stayed @ the Warwick to celebrate 25 yrs of marriage.                                                  Our room was lovely & clean.A nice comfortable bed.                                                                                       It had lots of little touches too..an Ipod docking station.. so we could have some music in our room.A good size bath. plenty of hot water (not you usual midget size)a coffee machine : I like a couple of cups of coffee in the morning and the cleaning staff were happy to bring me extra brewing packages of coffee.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Coast to coast,Ideal place to drop in during our long journey. The rooms are spacious and fully equipped with all mod con. Comfortable quiet room to recharge the batteries. Took a long time to book in this was due to the large party arriving at once. Breakfast great plenty of choices.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Very nice hotel, well priced, great staff - Downtown Denver","My brother and I stayed at the Warwick Denver Hotel on May 24 for a night out on the town and to watch the Colorado Rockies.  The front desk staff found out it was my birthday, and left a very nice card (signed by all of the staff) along with some beverages and treats.  This was a very nice surprise!  The hotel was well priced, and is located a few blocks from some great bars and restaurants associated with the 16th Street Mall area.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The room was very well appointed, and included a balcony with a great view of downtown.  Although we didn't have time to enjoy the rooftop pool, we checked the pool out before leaving the next day.  The pool was clean, neat, and a supply of towels is provided as you enter the area.  Will definitely have to enjoy…",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Old World Charm,"Our only regret about the Denver Warwick Hotel was that we could only stay one day.  The staff are very well trained, courteous, and helpful.  Loved our room with its spaciousness and little touches, and appreciated the coffee in the lobby in the am.  Will definitely stay here on any future trips to Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Downtown: Small and very, very nice","Right off the main streets of downtown, but small enough to be cozy. Great restaurant, rooftop pool, and wonderful,quiet rooms. For what you get, a good value. If you like balconies, ask for a room on the mountain side of the building. There are very popular outside bars on the other side, can be noisy when on your balcony. Love the Warwick!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Great hotel, bring back the room service","I love this hotel. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, and I like that many have balconies. I was disappointed recently upon arriving after 10pm only to find out that they had discontinued 24hr room service. Disappointing. Other than that, I recommend this place.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wonderful Warwick,"We booked our stay based on the reviews on TripAdvisor and were a little tentative as the price was considerably lower than other City hotels. We really weren't expecting too much at all. However, we were so pleasantly surprised as we walked into this lovely hotel after a long and somewhat boring train trip from San Francisco ( buts that's another story) which had arrived over 2 hours late.The reception staff were delightful, the lobby area was warm and welcoming with a gas fireplace at one end with comfortable lounges all around.Our room was large with every amenity we needed and the  bed very comfortable. We tried out the fitness centre next morning and again were surprised at the amenities and selection of equipment which appeared to be fairly new.Wifi was not included in the tariff but when my husband asked if there was free wi fi in the lobby area the receptionist gave him a password so we could use it in our room. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for the staff here, from late checkout, storing our luggage for our train departure later in the day, every request was met with a smile.Location wise, while the hotel is not right in the middle of the downtown area, it is within walking distance of almost everything and Denver is a great city to walk in. There are not too many eating places in the immediate vicinity but Randolph's restaurant in the hotel is very good.We would definitely recommend staying at the Warwick.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Fantastic stay,"Clean, friendly front desk, fantastic breakfast. I'll definitely return again I felt remarkably comfortable in my room, the air conditioning was easy to control, and the tv was easy to control. I was really impressed with the warmth, convenience, and friendliness.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Met All My Expectations,"This was my first trip to Denver, and I'm glad I chose the Warwick for my stay! The place was lovely, clean, and within walking distance of a variety of shops and restaurants. The staff was friendly and helpful, and I really enjoyed having a balcony that provided views of the city and the Rockies in the distance. There's the convenience of a restaurant/bar on property, and the rooms were very nice. My only complaint was that the bathroom had a rather strange layout. Of course, the views from the rooftop pool were the best...reason alone to chose this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,looking forward to my next stay at the Warwick!,"I recently enjoyed my second visit to the Warwick.  I think the most noteworthy memory of my 2 stays is the friendly service; they really do aim to please.  I was pleased with my rooms (one standard and one suite), with housekeeping, with room service, and with the excellent location.  My husband loved the fitness center (I didn't visit that).  The decor is dated (but very clean) and could use a contemporary refresh, but everything is cozy comfy.  The restaurant food is better than I expected and much better than the bland menu descriptions.  The bar is friendly and welcoming too.  We are definitely returning to the Warwick one day soon.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Stayed in better motels,"Having travelled the U.S. for the last two weeks, staying in two to five star hotels/motels, this was the biggest disappointment. The reasons are thus:I paid $10 a day for wifi - seriously does this even happen anymore? It is 2015!!! This is a basic amentity that has been present in the backwoods of Utah for free. We were out from 9-4 one day, and housekeeping did not tidy our room. As we didn't want to be disturbed, we ended not having the room cleaned in our two day stay. We expect housekeeping to come between these hours, so was a bit disappointed with this. My girlfriend was woken up twice by what sounded like the fan in the bathroom turning on in the middle of the night. The minibar in our room had a serious design flaw - it couldn't be opened as the fitted unit it was installed overlapped the bottom of the fridge door. There is an air of pretension here that is completely unwarranted. The room is nice, but the experience as a whole does not reflect what is expected of a four star hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Meeting,What I can say I didn't enjoy much my stay over there ;( front desk people are nice and friendly breakfast people not all. I was stoked when I left the doorman he didn't even open the door I'm not saying he should help me with my luggage but at least to offer some help anyway for sure is not going to be my choice again ;( Maybe I was unlucky,3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,wonderful experience,"The Warwick hotel in downtown Denver provided us with a wonderful weekend experience.  From the time you arrive the hotel staff so friendly and helpful.  I found this hotel to clean and comfortable, our room very spacious, with a large balcony.   Loved the area off of the lobby with the sofas and fireplace.Mariela halverson was so helpful with making sure our room was perfect for us!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Friendly but old and tired,Our team stayed at the Warwick last week and found the meeting facilities to be good. Food was excellent and the serving staff were very good. Amanda was nice to work with. Front lobby staff were pleasing and organized.  Nice pool area and excellent gym.  I do recommend this hotel but because it is tired and  in need of some attention from the manager at the hotel I would not bring my executives back. It needs to be upgraded and especially the carpets in the bedroom. The furniture is horribly worn. The bed was very nice.  For a good value weekend or business trip it is a good option but with an important client stay elsewhere.,4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Dog friendly,We had a chance to book a last minute at the Warwick and loved the place. After finding out they were dog friendly we brought our puppy and after every walk out front the lobby boy would give her an organic treat! Pool on the roof was heated and had nice views. We will definitely make another trip to this hotel!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,OK place for a meeting,"I attending a small (~40 people) conference at this hotel.... traveling with my wife. Pro: - good hotel rate for a meeting group - large room (a wheelchair accessible room, so I can't comment on other types of rooms)  - Adequate power outlets at the desk and bedside - Bed was OK, although my wife ""hated"" the pillows - Lunch in the restaurant was good.  - Two miles to shopping area (thanks to Uber) for my wife (could be a con for some)Con: - Despite our request, specifically called in, for breakfast for two... on a table (as there is NO place to put a tray of food, especially for two people, NO table was provided.  The server offered to bring the table back after delivering 2 or 3 other meals,. but I declined as the food would have been cold by then.   We ate off of the edge of the bed in awkward positions.- No bellman seen on arrival until after I checked in and my wife had unloaded our 4 bags.  Despite him walking by her, he did not even offer to assist with bags. NOT A FULL SERVICE HOTEL",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Downtown Denver,"This hotel is 1st CLASS, with most reasonable rates!  You cannot beat the location in downtown Denver... walking distance to most restaurants, shops, convention center, and anything you'd want. The service is ultra friendly, and they smile, genuinely! I especially liked the comfort feel of the boutique room, and roof top views of uptown.  The room was spotless and cozy. I wished we were staying more than one night!",5

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,I have always liked the Warwick hotels and continue to like them,"Warwick Denver, is well located, can walk to area cafes etc. Traditional Hotel, traditional décor . Clean, courteous and affordable. It is a decent price for very decent accommodations. It isn't a luxury hotel resort, but feels very comfortable and is rather upscale in feel. I have stayed in Warwick hotels in Dallas and Paris and they all have a nice standard of service, amenities and décor. Would go to a Warwick any day",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Tired hotel, poor housekeeping","Being a seasoned traveler, I know the Warwick chain is considered a luxury hotel chain. The Denver location needs a major refresh and housekeeping services need to be improved before I would consider this a luxury hotel.  I traveled with a colleague, so we had two rooms. The carpet in both rooms was very worn and stained.  Both rooms smelled musty. The thermostats did not properly regulate the temperature in the rooms. In both rooms, the mini bar and snack baskets were not replenished after the last guest was in the rooms. I don't buy from these, but because they were not replenished, I had to take the extra steps to ensure I was not charged for them.   In my room, the pillowcases were obviously not changed, as they smelled like perfume. The 3 days we were there, housekeeping…",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great place to stay after a concert,"We stayed at the Warwick because it was so close to the Filmore Auditorium.

We also were pleasantly shocked to have chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne awaiting us in the room and a really nice note from Daniel, wishing us a happy anniversary! One day the coffee was not replenished during cleaning, but one call and the front desk sent up what we needed within minutes. Everything was great, and we definitely would choose the Warwick again when visiting Colorado!",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Simply Amazing,I am staying at the Warwick located in uptown Denver.  The group I am with are travelling across the country and I so SO amazed at the little things the staff at this hotel offer.  When we arrived lemonade an cookies. We went out to the city yesterday and returned late afternoon to find free wine and cheese in the lobby. :)   love it.  Hotel is clean and very nice beds.  The only thing I dont appreciate is the old and somewhat bleak appearance of the room and the balcony is nice but oh so yukky. All in all I am happy with this hotel and the staff especially friendly chambermaid and reception manager Daniel are a good thing,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good Value For Location,"We stayed at the Warwick in early May 2015 and overall it was a pleasant stay. When we first checked in we got a call saying that they would need to switch our room. Without us saying a word they upgraded us to a King Suite and gave us a credit for dinner in the restaurant (Randolph's) due to the inconvenience, which was very nice. The room was comfortable and clean but could use a refresh. The location was great as it was within walking distance of several restaurants and the 16th Street Mall. You get good value for the location.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Very nice stay,"We stayed here for a week in April 2015. Everything said about it being dated may be true but our room was clean and everything worked and we did not find it uncomfortable at all. For the price we paid, it really would have been nice to have a small refrigerator and a small microwave in the room. Having a room with a balcony in a city such as this was a welcomed luxury and we took full advantage by having breakfast out there on the nice mornings. Unfortunately the pool was being serviced most of our stay and when if was finally opened the weather had turned unfavorable, that is really the only thing i would say that would come close to a complaint.We enjoyed the complimentary wine and cheese a few times in the lobby and the seating was comfortable and the staff serving it  were generous and pleasant.Yes occasionally there was a scent of cannabis but that can be said of every place we went in denver and i can`t say it was overpowering or unpleasant, now the guest who passed gas in the elevator that we were stuck in for 9 floors, that was unpleasant!!  Overall we had a great stay and i would like to mention that bryan the bellman was outstanding in everyway . We met him when we arrived and he helped us with our bags to a room that was not what we booked ,he quickly changed our room and got us settled in. Thoughout the week he greeted us by name and offered excellent advice on local places within walking distance to eat.  His personal attention ( as in looking you in the eyes when speaking ) and excellent customer service alone would be a reason for us to stay there the next time we are in Denver. We would definitely stay there again.",4

Sure, there may be a few less-expensive option in / around downtown Denver, but the Warwick was very well priced compared to other area hotels of its caliber, and offered one of the most pleasant stays I've experienced in a long time.  The staff were very helpful and incredibly accommodating. The room was excellent, and having a balcony with a nice view of downtown was really, really nice (something few hotels have, an under-appreciated feature in my opinion).

There are plenty of restaurants within 2 blocks of the hotel.  The room was very clean and spacious. Has a safe in the room and a minibar. There is an outside balcony available and each is privatized from the next.  Free WiFi in each room. Very spacious and elegant lobby and has a restaurant in the hotel. Although a downside is that the cost of a meal is expensive. But a great wonderful hotel with very friendly staff. The customer service desk was very helpful in local knowledge and any problems were prompted in sorting out.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,A solid option in downtown Denver,"Warwick is a nice hotel tucked right into downtown Denver.  The location is just far enough away from the hustle and bustle to allow for relaxation, but close enough that you can get to the heart of the action for a couple of bucks in an Uber.  The hotel is nicely appointed, but frankly a bit run down in places.  The beds in my room were adequate.  Comfortable enough for a good night's sleep, but not exquisite.  The room itself was quite spacious, with a cavernous bathroom.  This being said, it had the odd detail of a separate bath and shower.  The shower had a very low, handheld shower ""wand"" which was cumbersome to say the least.  I would have preferred a traditional bath/shower combo.

From the beginning of my stay through check out I was very satisfied with my stay.  Valet parking is $30.00 a day; a little expensive but I needed a secured location for my vehicle and the staff made up for the expense with outstanding service.  As a matter of fact, the Bellboy's were the friendliest staff members in the entire place.  Check in was effortless; I did spend some time trying to get ""Jo"" to smile.  We also enjoyed two meals at the restaurant and the food and service was wonderful.  I look forward to a return visit to The Warwick Denver Hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick experience,"My stay at the Warwick was great for the most part. The front desk staff were excellent. My real complaint was the price Warwick hotel in Denver charges and they promote services on there website that they don't offer.  For $291.00 a night in a mile high suite I was told there were hard wood floors as you enter, there was carpet not that it's a big deal I was just told one thing and got another. Second, because I knew there were many refrigerators in the room I did not bother with thinking about needing refreshments or food, and when I got to the room both of the mini refrigerators that were in my room were luke hot,  Third, ordering room service there was horrible they never answered the phone I had to call to the front desk to order and  both times I ordered room service they…",2

My wife and I were in town for a concert at the Pepsi Center and this turned out to be an excellent choice.  The cab ride to and from the concert was cheaper than parking alone at the Pepsi Center.  It snowed during our stay and I discovered that they have a garage for your car which meant that the next morning not only was there no snow on it but it was also warm.  I ate in the restaurant each morning and breakfast was good.  There is a lot to do close to the hotel and you are walking distance from the capitol building.  I think I have found a new place to stay whenever we are in Denver.,5

I was able to use their computer room equipped with windows office and printers. Walking distance to 16th Street mall, Lodo, and all the trendy restaurants and bars along Larimer Ave. Only mishap is the toilet overflowed about an hour before we checked out. They had somebody on it right away, but given the staff's lack of urgency, it seems like it happens all the time. No complaints here though, everything was great.

Hotel is in need of a renovation something fierce, carpets are worn and balconies quite awful. They are balconies though and give a nice partial view of mountains and city.

Service, especially the valet's, were great.   Not to far from the airport either!",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,The Strangest Service,"The best thing about the Warwick Hotel are the bellmen/valet service gents outside.  They were fabulous.  However, the front desk was extremely strange and I felt as if I was speaking a different language as they had no clue as to what I was saying anytime I asked them for something. Or they just ignored me the other times.  Very odd indeed.  They had earpieces in the ears that seemed to preoccupy them rather than attending to the actual person in front of them.    The room was fine and clean and old-school - refurb time perhaps.  The restaurant served room service that was also a very strange setup.    I wouldn't stay here again.",2

The style of furnishing  is repro antique which is good quality.   Randolph's, the hotel's popular restaurant and bar, serves breakfast in typical American fashion - good sized portions that justify the cost. If you want to eat less, as I did, just ask.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,terrible hotel,after searching online for hotels in downtown Denver we were excited to stay at the Warwick. The online information and pics were not totally honest.  The poolside does not have loungechairs and one of the regular chairs was broken and thrown in a corner.  There is a mattress pad under the sheets that didn't fit the bed and bunched up under the sheets. The shuttle service was inoperable for the two days and nights we were there. One of the three elevators had blankets hanging over the three walls and displayed the wrong room numbers.  The main overhead light in our room only stayed on for 3 minutes then went automatically off. .We had a suite and our daughter had a regular room and her room had a balcony..We came downstairs to enjoy the complimentary hors dourves and drinks 30 minutes before they closed this complimentary service and they were already out of food and wine. I checked out the work-out room at 10pm the night before I wanted to use it and when I went up at 8 the following morning the same sliced oranges and lemons were in the bottom of the empty water dispenser..yuck!  We will never stay at the Warwick again..,1

OVERCHARGED MY CREDIT CARD FOR $59 DOLLARS AND HAD NO EXPLAINATION AS TO WHY. The elevators are slow. The valet parking is $30 a day otherwise you have to park on street at meters. Incompetent rude staff. Security did nothing to stop the parties and door slamming. This place is horrible. Oh and there is nowhere to plug in electronics by your bed. Two lamps did not work and there were finger smudges on the mirrors.,1

It is not in the heart of DT, but on the outskirt. In my opinion the savings was well worth it.

Our room was huge, the bed was really comfortable, the bathroom was a decent size, and it was exactly what we wanted without any frills (that always cost more). We didn't even go in the front bar area of our room because it was all so spacious. We really enjoyed opening up the patio doors at night to let in the cool mountain air.

The gesture saved me from hefty shipping charges and meant I didn't have to make extra trips back to the city. Thank you Bryce! I'll definitely return to the Warwick when I'm in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,This Place is Classy and IT SMELLS GOOD,"Let's get this out of the way right off the bat: the Warwick isn't cheap. It is, however, clean, comfortable, classy and it smells good. Think about the last time you stayed in a hotel that had a funky smell to it...You get the opposite of that at the Warwick, it simply SMELLS GOOD all the time. It's great. Additionally, the rooms are clean, spacious, well appointed and comfortable and they all have balconies. Balconies are cool. If you're looking to impress someone, stay at the Warwick.  I should also mention that the staff is helpful and responsive...There was an issue with billing on this particular stay but the staff got it handled rapidly. Thumbs up all the way around.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Lovely hotel with warm and oh so charming staff,"We checked out of the hotel this morning with our daughter from the Crossroads and as you know kids are a handful especially a whole bunch of them  The management here at the desk, in the restaurant, housekeeping who had to clean up after us were warm and professional.  Huge balcony spacious suite with space for ample kids.  We loved the brunch and found the hotel to be spotless.  for the money this is an excellent hotel.  it is an old lady who needs quite a lot of face cream to get her back to her original glory. i.e hotel needs to be renovated. It is well furnished, tasteful and excellent service though and we highly recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,This was a very nice place to stay for the weekend.,"I think this was a great place to stay. The check in was kind of a hassle since there was a volleyball tournament in town, every teen and their sister were checking in when we got here. Secondly the walls were supper thin and the first night we got a pervert who kept playing his porn super loud, thankfully he left the next day. The second day was just perfect! Just as long as I don't get a pervery next time I'll stay here. The first time we came we got a suite, which has a much better layout then the normal rooms here. The normal rooms have a way too big bathroom that should have been added onto the bedroom. Great place, but need to get a suite next time.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,I won't be back,"Pros: Location. Clean bed. Clean bathroom. Outdoor balcony.   Cons: Ancient carpeting in room 720. Musty. Very unappealing floor covering on the outdoor balcony. if you don't take the hotel's $0.01 parking deal, you pay to park.   In summary: Really, the only reason I can figure I would stay here again would be to avail myself of the outside balcony, but even then hotel policy stipulates no smoking even on the balcony, violation of which can trigger a $500 ""cleaning fee"",    The room itself really wasn't all that great, but it was acceptable. if I were to give it a grade, it would be a ""C"". Passing, but could be much better, and normally I would expect much better.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Very nice, Free on street parking on weekends!","I stayed here with friends for a concert and everything here is great except you have to pay daily for wifi?!?  I would stay here again but not use the ""extra"" things that cost money like wifi that should be free. Other than the nickel and diming on the things that should be free the cost of the rooms was no more than $189.00 per night and we stayed in two rooms for two nights. We checked in on a Friday afternoon and the Valet notified us that if we could find on street parking that the $28 per day valet charge would not appear on our bill, we must have gotten lucky because there was a space just across the street and we left it there all weekend with no extra fees. Rooms were beautifully appointed with a great view from the deck (that was a nice surprise, having a huge deck off…",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"I'm a local, and I'm sure there are better places to stay.","Location is OK. The hotel is over priced, we paid 75 cents for a local call, 20 bucks for parking and 10 bucks for internet. Please?  The refridgerator was not plugged in, the alarm clock was not illuminated and the balcony was dirty.  The ""Warwick"" hotel, I thought, was going to be a ""distinguished"" stay, it was Not!  Lobby was boring and the resturant was empty.  However, the linens in the room were fabulous and the room clean. The roof top pool was open and very inviting. The people at the desk were friendly, but didn't tell us about happy hour. There are some awesome photos on the 15th floor. On the way home, there was 6 - 7 inches of snow, the bell men were standing talking, barely  opened the door for us ... more less shovel the walk way. The  Brown Place Hotel was just…",3

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Uh, so so.","Outdated and overpriced. Hosted a business conference, the food spreads were disappointing and overpriced. Jason's deli serves better quality spreads than this hotel. The cantaloupe slices were thinner than deli meat. Terrible aesthetic appeal for a spread. We were advised only one poly com exists for the several conference rooms to share. As for the rooms, roomy but can be loud (old pipes, vents, etc). Bathroom sink could use more space. I found better rest at the older, smaller room oxford hotel and even courtyard. The only reason I stay at this location is convenience to office.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Excellent hotel!,Everything about our stay here was perfect! My wife and I stayed for 4 days and we were very satisfied. The staff are helpful and courteous and went out of their way to make sure we had a great stay. Highly recommend!,5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Warwick Denver,"My husband and I stay at the Warwick in Denver when we gotta get away for a few days at a time. We've been doing this for the past 2-3 years. We tried staying somewhere else once, but ended up canceling that stay and coming back to the Warwick. We wont stray again. We love the location, how clean the hotel is and how great the staff is, especially Danny the bell hop, as he seems to always go over and beyond to make everyone happy and things go smoothly.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Versatile location, great beds, excellent staff","I like the Warwick's location;  the Pedestrian Mall is just to the west, but the smaller, hip places on 17th are an easy walk to the east.  You can walk to either, depending on your mood.  The rooms are large and comfortable, with big balconies so you can actually get out there for fresh air and views.  The beds were very comfortable, with a range of pillows so you can find one you like.  Bathroom was fine; shower was great.  I has some odd requests for the staff (printer trouble, ice for an injury, coffee at 4:30 am) and they handled all quickly and graciously.  We didn't use the roof-top pool, but would have if our stay had been longer.  I'll bet it has awesome views!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not bad,"We got this room through Hotwire, we were very pleased with the Warwick. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The balcony was also nice. We both enjoyed the view of the Denver sunrise from the room. We would stay here again. We wished we would've take a swim in the heated pool, I thought about staying a little longer to take a dip but we didn't, maybe next time!",4

I had a question about parking and Erica who I think is a sales manager helped offer alternatives but I chose the valet, very nice guys. In the evening Victoria another sales manager? She was serving wine, she politely offered, I declined and she said okay ill get you some coffee, that was so nice and then checking out my wife's suitcase zipper got stuck and the engineer Michael last name starts with.

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wonderful experience,"We recently stayed at the Warwick for four nights.  Every aspect of this hotel is perfect.  Yes, it's old décor but very well maintained.  The employees go out of their way to make sure your stay is a pleasant one ( Wan & Jonas ) from the time you check in to check out.  We are planning to be back in Denver in May and will definitely stay there.  After staying at this property in Denver, I'm excited to try some of their international properties.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great spot - the pool is the ticket!,"Excellent service and good location. Price was great, too. I was in Denver for business and wanted something slightly off the beaten path. I was familiar with the Warwick name from traveling in Europe and gave it a try. Not disappointed at all! Staff was super-friendly and the service was stellar. Loved the room, space and style. Can't wait to get back!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Customer service was incredible ,"My husband and I stayed at the Warwick in Denver for a night before heading to the snow. My only regret would be not having stayed longer. There had been issue after issue with the airport, car hire and by the time we got there I was at the end of my tether. My husband chose the hotel (risky move) and assured me he researched it. He nailed it. We were greeted by the door staff who were polite, welcoming and efficient. We made our way to the front desk and were greeted by Britton. We honesty had not experienced such wonderful customer service in the time we have been in the states. He was so accommodating and made sure we were satisfied with everything. The room was exquisite and clean as a whistle. Thank you to Britton for making that part of our honeymoon so special and to all…",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Old charm Colorado Style,"We checked out of this hotel today.  After attending the snowboard convention in Denver and travelling from HKG we found the Warwick Hotel to be a very good example of what my son calls Colorado Old School.  Yes old and a little tired but very well run, clean and the staff are amazing. Matthew, Daniel and the oh so friendly housekeeper who really did an wonderful job cleaning our room.  the 6th floor is non smoking and we were very pleased as we read comments about smoke.  We paid for internet which was shocking,   everything else was five star.  We recommend this hotel for families and singles looking for service and staff with warm hospitality.  thank you all.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,very impressed,"I dont know who trains the front desk staff, but they do an EXCELLENT job of it.   Other hotels could learn a lot from these guys.  Made us feel right at home from the beginning and throughout our stay.  Definitely will stay here again when in Denver.  Also location is unbeatable, walked to everything downtown.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Terrific Hotel,"First time at any Warwick property - every staff member I encountered was extremely friendly and helpful. Huge room, great balcony overlooking the city and close to cool, newly rejuvenated neighborhood with great restaurants.  Only downside is the white florescent bulbs throughout the room - gave the space a very sterile, hospital-like feel.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Was just an okay experience,"The hotel was nice and the room was spacious. When we walked in to check in I walked up to the counter and said hello and asked the clerk how he was doing and his response was ""last name"". He was rude and it wasn't a very warm welcome, at all. The hotel didn't seem busy, during our stay, I saw maybe 5 other guests. The room we were put in had a view of an ugly parking lot, I assume that is because we booked through Priceline and not directly through the hotel. The rooms do have a large balcony so that was a plus. Our shower backed up several inches and there were very obvious stains on the carpet. Otherwise, the location is okay, a few blocks to 16th St. Mall. The lady the next day at the front desk made up for the rude jerk at check in. I would probably stay again.",3
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Over-sized rooms, good location","The rooms here are huge! The hotel is very nice, also clean. It is a few blocks walk to the Capitol. Restaurants are within walking distance if you don't have a car or feel like driving.The area was fine. We had no concerns walking the streets in the area. The hotel would've gotten 5 stars except no breakfast was included with the room rate. The breakfast at the hotel appeared to be very nice but also very expensive so we decided to eat elsewhere in the area.",4
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Great Hospitality!  Great Service!  Fabulous Gym & Rooftop Pool,"I love the Warwick.  This was my second stay at the Denver location and the Bell Boy remembered me. That made me feel increadibly welcome.The Roof Top Pool is beautiful.  The gym was fabulous with lots of equipment avaialble, oranges and citrus water.I love having the large balcony, desk with free wifi and refreshment centre in the room.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Refunded my money without being asked,"My family and I usually spend a night in Denver before going to higher elevations to ski so that our bodies have a better chance of adjusting to the altitude. We spent one night at the Warwick when we arrived and we found the outside of the hotel to be very unattractive. We were pleasantly surprised when we went inside as it was quite nice. Our room was clean and comfortable and the gym and pool area were also nice. The only knock on the hotel is that is a little farther away from the 16th Street Mall than usually stay. We returned to the hotel the evening before we were to fly home. We thought we had a 1:20 pm departure, but after we had checked in we realized that our flight was at 1:20 am. We checked out after spending about 6 hours at the hotel. We had prepaid for our room and we simply wrote off the expense of the room to lack of focus on our part. As we were checking out at 11:00 pm, the gentleman at the front desk asked us if there was something wrong with the room. We simply stated that we had been confused about our flight home and needed to go to the airport. When my credit card statement came, I noticed that our room fee had been refunded. We didn't ask for a refund so I was very pleased and impressed that they did it on their own.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Wonderful Hotel!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Warwick Hotel!  It is a beautiful hotel with large rooms and great bathrooms.  We didn't eat at the adjoining restaurant, Randolph's, but did have drinks in the cozy bar.  The food we did see come out looked delicious! I found the hotel easy to get in and out of and was within walking distance to the Capitol hill neighborhood and shops.  Staff was very helpful and accessible.  I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Nice!,"The Warwick is very understated elegance.  Nice rooms and pretty comfortable beds.  I like the ambience.  Randolph's serves really good food, a little pricey, but usually well worth the cost.  I think that this hotel is very well suited to business travelers.",5

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Hosted visiting family here and was disappointed & embarrassed,"I stayed here with my siblings after a night out in Denver. They were visiting from out-of-town and I wanted to treat them to a ""nice"" hotel. When we arrived to check in, they did not have the room we reserved available and the front desk attendant was rude (a ""this is your fault"" attitude, when, um, it wasn't). The bar was disappointing; the bartender was MIA for awhile while we just sat there. There are hotels in Denver for a similar price that are much higher quality. I won't stay here  again.",2
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Good except for parking.,"The hotel was nice, a idle old looking. Coffee downstairs in the morning was good. Staff was friendly . Dog bowl and treats for dogs at the entrance. Rooftop pool was open in winter. Nice views not really any view of the mountains. Parking was expensive . location was good.",4

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,"Clean, cozy and comfortable in Denver.","We liked the Hotel. The guys that parked the cars were the best. They were always asking if we needed directions, etc.  And, sometimes we did because our GPS didn't always pick up between the tall buildings. The view on our balcony was great and the beds very comfortable. A little too cold for us to use pool but if your brave it was really neat up on the roof top and we were told the water was 85 degrees. All good, hope to return.",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,What a gift!,"Our family stayed at the Warwick for about five weeks-yes five weeks.  We had a family member at the St. Luke's hospital and the hotel was close by.  We had an amazing experience.  We highly appreciate the Warwick team for making us feel at home and taking care of us each day.  The entire staff was so approachable and  helpful.   Each day we took the shuttle to the hospital and the drivers were excellent, polite and actually a lot of fun.  If the shuttle was busy they helped us get a taxi.  We ate many times in the restaurant and bar  and the staff there was outstanding and again friendly and helpful.  At the end of a long day at the hospital it was good to go ""home"" to our home away from home.  What a gift the hotel and staff were to our family.  We will back to stay  and  highly recommend the hotel to friends and family.  We are happy to be home.  Our niece is getting better.  We miss all of our Warwick family.  THANK YOU!!

"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Welcoming,"Great location, safe and close to downtown. Clean facilities, fantastic fitness center. Restaurant in house (although never used). However the best part was the welcoming staff with an old-fashioned customer service ethic that went above and beyond making me feel welcomed and appreciated. Would stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",Warwick Denver Hotel,Not worth the trouble,"booked this hotel on a name your own deal website and found that it was more trouble than it was worth. Rooms were outdated and filthy. Exterior of building was same way. Needs a remodel something fierce! Stayed for 3 nights and wished I hadn't payed ahead of time. I was stuck! They allow dogs, so upon opening the room door for the first time at midnight because of a delayed flight, the dog across the hall barked excessively. Then when we kicked on the heat, the room smelled of wet dog and urine. The carpet was crusty and filthy under the desks and around the bathroom vanity. Upon checking my credit card statement when I got home I got an extra $10 charge for mini bar drinks! Never touched the mini bar, and let accounting know but if I hadn't checked they would have an extra $10 of mine they didn't earn! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Kindness that far exceeded expectations,"I am an artist and writer who was hoping for a few days away from my daily routine. What I wanted most was to get on an airplane and go away, but since circumstances didn't allow this, my husband bought me a couple nights next to the airport as the next best thing. When Courtney H. checked me in, she had no way of knowing this. But when I asked her if my room had a Mountain View, she immediately offered to move me to a higher floor, to a window with a view more exquisite for my intentions than any I have ever had. For the past two days, I have spent hours sitting in front of it. Watching cars, trucks and buses circulating. In and out. Like arteries of a heart beating with our innate desire to transport ourselves. Through space and time. Trains arrive at the station. The flashing red light signaling their approach from downtown Denver and beyond. And planes fly in. And I sit. Watching. In awe. Of this view that I have. As a result of a small act of kindness, Writ large by my desire. Humility. And gratitude. Thank you, Courney H. for making this time away all that I needed it to be. And so much more. Your kindness has radiated onto me.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience and Views,"We stayed here during a layover in Denver. Loved and the view from our room. So cool to see the peaks of the airport. Most restaurants are shut down but theirs was open for indoor dining which was really nice. We got to have some family meet us for dinner there. Great food, staff are all incredibly friendly! The following day proved to be the biggest benefit. There were flight issues so our 5:30am didn’t leave till 1pm. Instead of sitting around the airport all day, the hotel let us come back to the room and relax there till it was time to go. Lifesaver!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient,Convenient though you have to go outside to access the hotel. Room was modern and comfortable. Certainly a better option than waiting for buses etc. I’d have no problem staying agin if within a reasonable price point.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Worst nights sleep for a long time,"My partner booked standard room and because of her status we were upgraded to 10th floor. Nice room. 4.00am flight next day so early to bed. Room next to elevator and non existent  noise insulation from passageway. Constant noise from corridor. Non existent noise insulation from room above.  Bottom sheet didn't fit the bed and kept coming untucked so ended up sleeping on bare mattress.But worst thing was air conditioning. Tried every setting, but it/fan would come on for 20 seconds then off for three minutes then on for 2 minutes then off for 20 seconds. Nightmare. Just falling asleep- fan comes on. Then off then on - then off. Too hot to keep it turned off all the time. Such a pain. Toilet sounds like a rocket launch when flushed especially at 2.00am. Bathroom water tap pipes make that high pitched noise- really pleasant with the rocket launch toilet noise.Only one bottle of water, no tea......just goes on and on.......and at 4.00 am only way to get out of the hotel, elevator from 10th to 6th floor (lobby) - that's as far as it goes. Walk to next elevator, to get to 5th floor- but this is not the elevator that you arrived in which goes to the 1st floor. Oh no- This is a different elevator that goes only as far as the 5th, the plaza. Real pain at 4.00am in the morning. Never again.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Luxury night at the hotel,"My husband and I booked the Westin after realizing our flight wasn’t due to arrive in Denver until after midnight. At first we were spectacle because of the price, however after walking in we realized why it’s important to treat yourself like a king every once in awhile. The staff was friendly, virtuous, and maintained all social distancing protocols. We had a beautiful and CLEAN room on the 12th floor with a spectacular mountain range view. In addition they had grab and go style food for purchase in a refrigerator for guests arriving late in the day. The next morning we had speedy access to ground transportation at the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Knocked it out of the park - again,"The team here wrote the book on customer experience for Bonvoy members.  Easy friendly check in.Treated to a giant junior suite on the corner very quiet very comfortable big bathroom was able to get a lot of work done in the morning.Was glad the pool was open got in a nice little swim.  In the morning I really like the easy, no rush walk to check in for your flight.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent Stay and Amazing Dinner! ,"The Westin Denver International Airport is an amazing property! The room is beautiful with full runway views in both rooms. I love the windows and views of the mountain. The staff is great and assisted me in celebrating my 100th night this year with Marriott and hitting the Ambassador Milestone. Thank you all for the delicious bottle of wine and the best Thanksgiving burger ever — cooked perfectly! The food is very good with a wide range of options to please most people and diets. Thank you for the exceptional service and amazing staff. And, making my milestone special. Looking forward to staying at this property again soon.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Incredible Stay!,"My family was having a great challenge with flights due to COVID19. We were forced to stay at the Westin Airport hotel, and we were met with the most exceptional service I might have ever received at a hotel in my life. Maddie, who was helping us to book our rooms, went over and beyond to get us a room quickly. Shannon, printed new fligt documents for me and even created a nice cover page on our folder to add the extra touch. Ronald assisted us with our suitcases, which there were MANY, and even helped us get them all the airline check in counter the next morning. This team was incredible! The hotel is beautiful, modern, clean, and very well maintained. I can't say enough about all that this staff did for us on a very hard day.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect for night before early am flight,"Even though we live in downtown Denver, we like to stay at the Westin Hotel at the Denver International Airport before an early morning flight. The Denver airport is about 25 miles east of downtown Denver via Interstate 70. Heading to the airport the night before, makes a 6 am departure significantly less stressful. The Westin hotel is connected to the airport, and it takes 3 minutes or less to walk to the security screening.  The Westin is the only hotel at the airport (with no long shuttle ride). This lack of competition means room rates can be expensive. The rooms are basic but have triple pane windows for airport sound proofing. They also have good showers, a refrigerator and an in-room coffee maker. We also like the Grill and Vine for a quick dinner or a glass of wine. If you are using Marriott Bon Voyage Rewards, this hotel is a Category 6.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great hotel, very nice room, Great Staff.","This is a great hotel and one of the best hotels we have ever visited. It is located at the Airport so getting to a flight is remarkably easy. The lobby is futuristic and beautiful. The staff was friendly. The room was seems like a standard room but the glass must be soundproofed because I did not hear any airport noise at all the entire time that I stayed there. Security is good because your key works the elevator and only people with keys can get to the appropriate floor. The views are spectacular from the upper floors. The bed was extremely comfortable. Overall, a great hotel for the location, price, look and staff. I highly recommend this location for anyone wanting a nice place to stay near the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very disappointed,"We stayed at the Westin Marriott at the Denver airport on October 5. I opened the fridge to put something in and I was appalled to find a salad that had expired on September 25, a bottle of vodka(1/3 full), a bottle of lemonade and a bottle of something else.  I would have expected that they would have comped our room- they offered us $50 off breakfast, which we refused. They took $ off my room. I was extreme disappointed with their lack of concern about the uncleanliness of the room.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,COVID requirements not enforced; threatened by another guest.,"While the room was great, had a quick check in with titanium recognition, and the property is very convenient for early flights, we had a very poor experience at the restaurant. We were eating at a high top by the bar when a man not wearing a mask came in demanding  to sit at a table despite being told by the staff that it was not available (pedaumably for social distancing reasons). He then came over and stood about two feet from our table. When we asked him to put a mask on and move at least six feet away (i.e. follow the rules), he became agitated and walked up to our table, putting his hands on one of the chairs. He then counted six feet out loud and starting carrying on how he shouldn’t have to wear a mask because he has the antibodies. When he did temporarily put on the mask to walk to his table, he mocked us and make a couple of political statements. His actions were threatening and we were very uncomfortable, putting aside the increased COVID risk. Why should we as guests be threatened by another guest for politely asking  for him to follow the rules. The bartender apologized for this person’s actions (the manager did not), but at no point in time was this man instructed to put on a mask by the manager of asked to leave. I get that we all have COVID fatigue, but this could have been easily prevented. I’ve logged over 600 nights with Marriott/Starwood and I have never experienced this. This single experience would cause me to not return to the property (despite the other good aspects) and makes me question how seriously other COVID aspects are taken both here and at other Marriott properties.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Overrated,"First and foremost, the absolute worst bar experience ever.  When you order a hard liquor drink at their sports bar, they will not give you the price. There are prices for wine and beer but if you want a scotch or bourbon, forget it. They pour the drink first then tell you the price. In may case $22.00 for a bourbon. But I did refuse. I ordered  a lower end whiskey for 12 bucks. . I asked the bartender that since you work here why can't you tell me the price of liquor drinks.. No answer. he kind of shrugged like he was clueless.If you like being ripped off then this is the place for you. The Olive and Grill restaurant where we had dinner was expensive and just average. Nothing to write home about. Stay at another hotel near the Denver airport.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A great overnight for early flight.,"We had to overnight unexpectedly due to a plane issue. We were very impressed with the convenience, the quick check in, the clean room, and the restaurants available. The service was very good, and the rate wasn't bad considering it was a last minute reservation. We didn't have time to utilize the amenities, but they look great so we would try to if we have the chance to stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A Favorite Westin Of Mine,"This hotel is truly one of my favorite Westin properties.  Besides the amazingly convenient location, it offers everything I look for in a property.  Great service, comfortable rooms, great food and effortless delivery of elite benefits.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great Bed, But Expensive","Stayed here for the convenience at the end of a trip with a morning flight.  Property is beautiful.  Loved the shower and the bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in.  It is really expensive though.  Wanted to just do room service, but it was shut down due to COVID.  Seems it would be safer than in person dining if you ask me.  So we ate at Grill & Vine for dinner.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Just OK,"Stayed at Westin for first time (and last). Not impressed. We just needed a place to stay before morning departure. Normally we just use a place that has a morning shuttle. The Westin was substantially more expensive than other options, but we figured with COVID, this was best option for max social distancing (no need for shuttle in morning).  We also thought we could have a nice breakfast, but restaurant does not open til 7am (airport hotels typically open earlier, we had an 8:30 am flight, so breakfast at 7 am would be very rushed). And also, no room service for COVID prevention (would think room service safer than restaurant). We just did Micky D’s in terminal 2 (my first fast food since Feb). That worked, but could have booked somewhere nice for less than half the price.  Next time we will.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Just steps away from checkin or baggage carousel,"When we have a late arrival or early departure, this hotel is the best choice. It is literally steps away from checkin or baggage pickup. The rooms are new, clean and spacious. The staff is helpful and friendly. The chinzy part of the hotel is that they charge a huge amount for wifi. What’s the reason ro charge for a service that today is a commodity?  Any tech savvy guest can easily turn their phone into a hotspot so there is no need to pay. But the location is unbeatable. The",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Worth Every Penny,"I loved my visit and we will never stay anywhere else when visiting Denver.  Super clean, super convenient, and very cool views.  I see a lot of people complain and the price, but when you have a 6AM flight I’d pay and enjoy a no hassle morning.  But be careful...you may over sleep in that comfortable bed.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience and that is about all!,"We chose this hotel purely for the convenience of being at the airport. It is quite expensive at $260 a night, but we knew we were paying for the convenience. It is a very average hotel, with average rooms and nothing to get excited about. For both business and pleasure we stay in serviced accommodation around 240 night on average each year, so we know you often take what you can get! What surprised me the most however, was having to pay $14.95 per person for internet! We haven't paid for internet in years, and do even know there were places that still did not include it in the room rate! We were actually charge for everything! I wouldn't have minded if we had paid about half of what we did, but at the price we were charged, everything should have been included!",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Luxury night on way home from fire assignment,"My second stay at the Westin DEN - you can’t beat the location for ease of traveling. This was my first stay in a corner room - very spacious, I wish I had a longer visit! Because I was traveling home from a fire assignment - I had a lot of luggage. I took advantage of their luggage assist service and it was well worth what I tipped. The gentleman took my bags and me right to the Delta counter. This was my first visit here during the virus. My only dining options seemed to be Wine & Vine and Tom’s Urban Kitchen. Would have been fun to have more choices. Navigating around can be a bit confusing - make sure you have plenty of time. I will stay here always when flying in and out of DEN as long as I can get the government rate. Friendly front desk and the valet that held my luggage while I dropped off my rental. Thanks!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Amazing hotel, however very exspensive","Check in was awesome.  Myriam was so friendly and nice.  That woman deserves a raise, she was incredible.This is a gorgeous hotel, room, bed, bath all amazing.  Onsite restaurant was excellent.  I would stay here again for sure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Comfortable Acclimating To Altitude Overnight Stay,"When we travel to other spots in Colorado from past experiences, we need at least a night in Denver to get acclimated to the higher altitude.  Well, lucky we are to have found this Westin to stay at from now on.Architecturally striking.  Convenient it is to pick up our luggage from baggage claim and stroll on over.  Welcoming, spacious,  and, bright is their registration area.Ready was our requested defeathered room at time of check-in. A view of the white peaks in this clean standard room. Comfortable bed and powerful shower.No room service presently.  Nice that there’s a coffee shop and two restaurants to choose from.  Making it a very pleasant stay for us to get adjusted and well rested.Happy Travels Y’all!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,It was nice but not $300/night nice,The room appeared to be clean. No bad smells. No mold or moldy smells in bathroom.  Tv worked fine. We had a king-sized bed and it was comfortable. The view was as good as you get with the nothingness you had to work with outside the window. The room was ample size. The staff was friendly. Ease of checking in and out was good. All that being said I’ve paid a LOT less money for rooms that had a kitchenette included. There was no microwave and no fridge.  You are paying for the convenience of not having to sleep in the airport. There wasn’t very clear instructions how to get to the hotel once we landed. Had to call the desk clerk to have her talk us through. The only reason the review is not 5 stars is because it simply cost too much.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenient, nice","We stayed here one night . Very nice, comfortable and convenient. It’s right outside baggage claim . No shuttle required. Nice hotel lobby area. We didn’t take time to eat here. We got up and caught the shuttle to the rental car area. Very easy . It’s more expensive than staying nearby but it’s worth it if your flight arrives late or you have very early flight the next morning. Staff was nice and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Will Come Back!,"I loved my one-night stay at the Westin at Denver airport and plan to return as soon as I need accommodations at DEN (and if I want to visit the city too). Location is top-notch, and the only property physically attached to the airport itself—always a plus. For anyone desiring a trip closer to Denver and surrounding suburbs, train service is available on a regular basis. Staff are extremely kind, passionate, and attentive. Social distancing and masks were in place at all times, as expected. Check-in and check-out were a breeze, and I felt that someone would always be around to assist if I needed. Thanks for the great service!The rooms were quiet, comfy, modern, and clean. No cleanliness issues observed, an aspect of hotels that is super crucial amid COVID-19. As I’m sensitive to sound, I was pleased to not hear any outside or neighborly noise during the night; everywhere was adequately soundproofed. Overall, the standards I perceive of the Westin brand were very visible and executed well. With WiFi for Bonvoy members (and likely everyone as well), on-site restaurants (only one open during the pandemic), a pool, and warm staff and rooms, I can’t wait to return to this property for another relaxing stay. One shall not be disappointed!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"No frills, problems with room","Although the location of this hotel for travelers seems ideal for early airport departures, for the cost and services, I would recommend another venue. Gone are the valet and bellman to help with your car and luggage. Mask wearing, although requested, is not enforced at all as I saw families walking through the lobby without masks. This is the third time in a year I have stayed at a Westin and each time something is amiss. This time, we were booked for a 13th Floor room and I requested a move to the 10th Fl. The phone did not work in our room, the television was not set correctly and showed a date of January 31 and did not have any programmed channel content, the plug for the bathtub was lying on the side of the tub and the plug for the sink would not stop the water from flowing out. None of these things are a big deal, it is just annoying to have so many minor inconveniences. If this hotel is going to charge the rates they do for such minimal services, things should be in working order in the rooms.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient but restaurants closed due to COVID,"We stayed one night after an evening arrival at Denver Airport so we could get an early start driving to western Colorado the next morning.   Location is so convenient!  Check in was quick, staff wore masks and social distancing was in place.  Room was comfortable and very quiet.  Only disappointment was lack of hotel food service due to Covid-19.  I had made the reservation only a few days before and would have expected the hotel website to say this,  but the website still touted its restaurants and 24/7 room service.  Our only dinner options were a Subway inside the airport and a restaurant next to the hotel which was packed and had very very slow service, probably because it was the only place open.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful Stay!,"We live in the Denver metro area and decided to stay at this hotel since we had a morning flight. It was my husband, our 2 kids and myself. After a wonderful stay there, we all agreed that it was the best idea and we’d like to stay there as often as possible. It was an amazing experience. The hotel is beautiful and smells great, we loved the architecture and style, everything  is impeccable, the rooms are really comfortable, the service from the Front Desk is amazing, we loved the pool and the fitness room. One of the restaurants was still closed but another restaurant/brewery and the Starbucks were open, which was extremely convenient. The hotel is kid friendly and pet friendly as well. The RTD light train station is right there. It was so nice waking up and being right at the airport to save us the early drive. I recommend it to anyone who is traveling from or to Denver International Airport. It’s one of our favorite hotels in the Denver area. Felt like a mini vacation in our own town. Can’t wait to be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Super convenient and nice room,"Right in the airport property! No need to say more. When it’s super cold, I’m sure that’s a treat. Of course being a new hotel, room is nice and clean. Bed is super comfy!! Fridge in the room was nice!! Microwave is available in the lobby. Limited place available for food (because of the current restrictions) so I went to the terminal early to grab some food. Many electric outlets by TV and by the bed. Staff were very professional and courteous. Highly recommend this place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Flight crew dormitory,"After a long day of flight delays and diversions, I was excited to book this hotel and pamper myself.  I had been on airplanes servinv only water and crackers for the previous 10 hours.  When I arrived at the hotel at 11pm, I was informed there was *no restaurants open, *no room service, *no mini bar.  The only food/beverage that was available was in a mini fridge in the corner of the lobby, and consisted of cans of soda and some prepackaged vegan meals.  I booked a deluxe king room.  There was no bathtub, no bathrob, no microwave to heat the cold food I purchased downstairs.  I was so excited to book this hotel. I'm from Denver and heard this place was really nice.  The only other guests I saw were flight crews.  I think this place may have once been fabulous, but they've clearly parred down ALL the amenities, likely due to lack of guests?  Either way, if you're going to charge me $350/400 for a hotel room, you should ensure there's access to hot food and beverages.  I can't imagine it impacts the bottom line THAT much to keep a cook and a waitress/bartender in the restaurant.  The best part about this hotel is the gym, which has a spectacular view of the architecture of the airport, those 'snow capped peaks'.  Very cool.  Unfortunately, after my workout, I ordered breakfast from Toms urban diner just across the way, and after 45 minutes, it still wasn't ready, and I had to forego breakfast or risk missing my flight.  It's a nice hotel, don;t get me wrong.  Clean, nice bedding.  Cool views.  But they should just label themselves as a more basic level Marriott and charge $150/night.  You're better off taking a shuttle to a nearby hotel that charges 20% of the price and offers the same product.   The front desk staff was really nice, I should add.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Airline Crew Layover June 15/16th,First time laying over here on Denver layovers. Excellent stay nice modern room. The staff was friendly and professional. The bed was very comfortable. I look forward to staying here again in the future.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Super clean ,Great super clean hotel conveniently located in Denver airport. A few minutes walk from the terminal. Very roomy great size room with clean sheets and pillows and soft king size bed. Big flat tv screen and completely Starbucks coffees is provided in the room. Standup rain shower with contemporary clean restroom. Clean carpet! Gym is located on 11th floor.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Up to date modern Hotel,"I stay here when I have a early morning flight. It is a quick walk over to the terminal and security.I like that I always get the same room, very important to me. The front desk staff is always friendly and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,We’ll be customers for life!,My daughter wound up in the hospital after returning from a recent trip to the mountains. We hadn’t slept all night and missed our flight home. We showed up at the Westin with all our luggage and ski bags hours before check-in with no reservation. They couldn’t have been more understanding. They gave us a room right away. Took away a huge stress as we wanted to be at the airport the next morning to try and get home and needed a place for our daughter to rest. The room was great. Comfy beds and you can’t get more convenient if you are traveling in and out of Denver. We got food from their restaurant and it was actually very good. There are still good companies out there! Thank you for caring!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Love that Heavenly bed,Very nice hotel. Was nicely upgraded due to status. So convenient as the higher cost was offset by being able to turn the rental car in early. Staff were super friendly and I will definitely stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great place to stay,"We stayed here on 2 separate rate occasions in February 2020. Our destination was Vail. We elected to stay the first night instead of attempting to transverse Vail Pass at night. We stayed the second night because coming down from Vail there was another storm and we missed our flight. The first room was on the right side of the hotel, king room. It was a little quieter than the second night when we were on the left side of the hotel. Although neither room was bad from airplane noise. Kind of fun to watch the planes. The restaurant was good although service is a little slow. The decor helps you forget you are in an airport. Remember the airport is a long distance from downtown. Although the rates are higher than neighboring hotels the convenience is worth it. We had to take a taxi to pick up a prescription from the closest grocery store. It was over $70. Just stay at the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Early flight? This is the place to stay,This is a good hotel whether your coming or going. They have a very nice bar on the main level and though my flight was early (7 am) I wasn't able to check out the breakfast. I was told the restaurant is very good. Not having to drive over or wait for a shuttle for my 7 am flight was so so nice. There was an indoor pool and hot tub as well as an exercise area. I will use this hotel again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fantastic Airport Location ,This is one of the BEST on site airport hotels I’ve ever been to. Rooms are super quiet. I never heard an airplane land or take off. Lobby is super modern and looks like a space ship! Rooms are spacious and I love the lighted mirror in the bathroom! The workout room had great views of the airport and even had cold towels to wipe down after your workout. Just steps away from the TSA checkpoint. This hotel does not disappoint! Highly recommend for the weary business traveler!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great if you have an early flight or travel snafu,"This hotel is great if you have an early flight in the morning  or you encounter a travel snafu that leaves you stranded at DIA. The hotel id in the airport with super easy access to security. The hotel is ultra modern & comfortable. Dark out curtains, sound proof rooms & comfy beds make for a nice night rest. It’s very expensive though.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent Location but expensive for the standard,"Having arrived from London Heathrow where we had stayed overnight at The Sofitel, this hotel pales by comparison. It is more expensive with less good restaurants and little or no service. The rooms are of a good standard but everything else is too close to 'motel' standard. If you are only overnighting in Denver, as we were, it is the best place to stay as it is so handy for the airport as security is just a two minute walk from the hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Outside of the turnover service, a great hotel","Very high quality hotel. My only issue is with the turnover service. My toothbrush was moved by hand, my collar stays (which were laid out on the desk) were thrown out with the trash and my suitcase and shoes were moved from near the comfort chair to the closet. I never asked for the latter (keep it where it was!) and why would you think it ok to touch someone's toothbrush with your hand? As I mentioned, that was my only issue. The restaurant is top notch, overall services are great and of course, it's a very convenient location.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wow,"I love staying here . Its beautiful , clean and so worth the cost for convenience and more. I get room service and enjoy waking up and walking to airport security for my plane! Love it! From the parking to the restaurant its great!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Room with urine on floor and splashed on toilet seat,I could not be more disgusted - we had a long day of Travel and missed connections with two young kids. We finally get to our room at 830 pm after waiting in line to check in for about 20/30 min and the bathroom is worse than a public toilet. I called down to the front desk with two screaming kids and I was offered not much in return (50 dollars or points )  or to move my two screaming and crying kids to another room with all of our bags. I didn’t take that offer due to the circumstances ..... I don’t understand why there is no level of cleanliness expected in a Westin? It was as if we were camping in the Westin .... stand on the toilet it hasn’t been cleaned in days! Don’t stay here - I’m embarrassed for the Westin.,1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Peaceful, convenient, clean, comfortable","Peaceful, convenient, clean, comfortable, and beside airport security, maybe 100 yard walk.  I liked the convenience for a super early morning flight.  Negative:  pricey for one night but other hotels are severs miles away.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,DON'T DO IT!,"When you pay $720/night for convenience to catch a good night's sleep before an early flight, but there's such a strong smell in your room that it wakes you up a few hours later with a sore throat, you feel ""had."" This stay was a disaster for me. I'm sitting in the airport an hour later and STILL can't get that smell out of my throat. It donned on me in the middle of the night what it is -- pool chlorine, covered up by some sort of floral air freshener. CLEARLY THE HOTEL IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE BC THEY TRIED TO COVER IT UP WITH FLORAL AIR FRESHENER. I'm normally not sensitive to chemicals, so that tells you the magnitude of the problem. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T ACCEPT A ROOM NEAR THE POOL! I stayed in room 1136. What a waste of money & probably a few brain cells  :(",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Can't beat the convenience,"First, getting there.  If you are in Denver, the train runs right to the hotel.  You can park at any of the train Park and Rides, and be delivered right to the hotel.  Second, I was amazed at how quiet the hotel was,  It is right in the middle of the airport, and I didn't hear a single plane, surprising.  The staff was terrific, professional, I even got a wake up  call from an actual human, top notch.  I was in an ordinary room, no upgrades.  It was a square room like hundreds that we have all stayed in, but it was a very nice ""ordinary"" room.  The bath room was a bit larger than normal, with a great, large shower, and sumptuous towels.  I was surprised that there was no comfortable,sitting chair in the room.  There was room and it would have been a really nice amenity.  The bed was large and very comfortable.  It was really nice checking out and wheeling your self directly into the terminal, and on with your travel.  Well worth the price I paid",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Two phenomenal stays in two weeks,Treated to upgrade rooms with gorgeous views.  The front desk team here is best in class.  Anything comes up and they are on it.  Enjoy the pool and work out area.  Beds are so restful.  Bonvoy done right!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Short Stay,"This property is fantastic.  Too bad my stay was so short as I had a very early morning flight the next day.  I appreciated their recognition of my Ambassador status with a great upgrade.  And the person at the front desk offered me upgrade options, unlike other properties that just say no without even looking!  With the airport terminal under construction food can be very limited as there are no quick food options available.  I loved my view right into the airport terminal, great way to people watch!  If I have another early flight I would definitely consider staying at the Westin in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Incredible Staff - Impeccable Customer Service,"I can't brag enough about the staff at this hotel, especially Natalie and Kristin. We had planned and scheduled our 4th qtr Board Meeting here and both ladies were understanding, patient, helpful, and had wonderful attitudes when dealing with some demanding requests that trickled down from my CEO. I have not had service like this in a very long time and I cannot say enough about how wonderful our overall experience was.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Loud hotel! No sleep,"I stayed here because I had an early flight to Tokyo. At first I was impressed by the property but was woken three times by noise before midnight. Housekeeping cleaning rooms between 9 and 12. Slamming doors, yelling down the hallway at one another. Sounds that would normally occur but still be unacceptable at 8 am.  Got about three hours sleep for $350. A total ripoff. Do not even provide free WiFi and it barely works in the lobby or restaurant. Couldn't even send an email from the restaurant where I was almost overcharged by $50 due to a 'computer error'. Good thing I caught that! The people dining next to me had a similar error and had to send the bill back. Overall, a disgrace. Avoid at all costs and save money staying in nearby Aurora at the hotels there",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The best,"Beautiful, quiet, peaceful hotel with the best location- right at the terminal.  I felt safe walking around at night and thought the staff was wonderful.  And the bed and linens were so nice.  I can’t believe I didn’t heAr any noise from aircraft!   Beautiful views too",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,JP at the Westin Denver International Airport Hotel Bar,"JP was a wonderful bartender - kind, personable, professional.  In addition to making a killer martini, he made our stay much more enjoyable with bar-served food, conversation, and good wishes.  We exchanged property stories, and JP celebrated our sale by sending a lovely card and two glasses of wine to our room.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Another Great Stay!,"I think this hotel is a great option when flying in and out of Denver. We stayed here twice on our trip to Colorado. Once after our late arrival and another before our early departure. Both stays were great!I would like to mention that when we arrived to our first stay there was a little hiccup with the room cleanliness and being 1 AM we were a little out of it. The front desk manager was efficient and very helpful in resolving the issue. She had us in a comfortable and clean room in no time.  The way they handled the situation with ease and professionalism is why I will stay here during my future travels in and out of Colorado. If you are looking for a clean, comfortable and convenient place to stay before or after a flight, this is a fantastic option!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Location!!!,I was here running a meeting. An easy walk from the airport. The Front desk was so helpful and after a busy day running around I went back to a clean and comfortable room. The food at our meals were delicious. Would come back.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"So convenient, nice rooms","I love coming to the Westin.  It’s an easy walk to or from the airport.  There’s a bar in the lobby, Starbucks and a restaurant for convenience before or after a long day of travel. Since it’s the holiday season it’s fun to watch people at the ice skating rink which is set up by United Airlines.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very nice hotel,I stayed at the Westin on Business for three nights. The check in is very conveniently located near the baggage claim area at DIA. TSA is also located immediately adjacent to the hotel. Very nice clean and well appointed rooms. I would highly recommend taking the time to enjoy their saltwater hot tub. I was amazed at the soundproofing of the guest rooms with all the air traffic and being so close to the main terminal. The staff are very accommodating and the restaurants had excellent food. The nonprofit board I serve on met there and I can tell you that their board room and meeting services staff were outstanding.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Super convenient,"We just stayed here as we had a really early flight :(  It is so nice & convenient, great to have it available since we fly international a lot have flights leaving & arriving at odd times.  I wish they didn’t allow smoking between there & the airport, we had to walk through a cloud of smoke to get to our flight.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Gorgeous Hotel, Convenient Airport Location!  ","We stayed here when we had a very early morning flight. It is connected to the airport which made it so much easier. Didn’t need to wait around to take a shuttle, just walked out the door and the airport was right there! It is a beautiful hotel with excellent service. The room was spacious and one of the most comfortable beds ever!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great for a late night or early bird flight!,This hotel is attached to the Denver International Airport so super convenient for the late night or red eye flights.The check in and checkout process was easy and friendly as was the wake up call that I had scheduled due to my early flight.Food options are also good with both in house and airport dining available.With easy access to the light rail to Denver and friendly staff I would recommend staying here if you are not wishing to partake in Downtown Denver but would rather use it as a base for non Denver activities. With a 40 minute ride to Union Station this would seem a better option for those that would like to take excursions but not necessarily within Denver itself.I would definitely stay here again given the convenience of both airport and light rail options.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,What  a great way to start a trip!,"As Denver residents, we had been wanting to stay here since it opened! We finally had the opportunity when our flight left at 5:30am.The hotel itself is stunning and the rooms are comfortable.Remember though, the windows are NOT blacked out, people can see you from outside.We ate at Vine & Grill and had a wonderful meal.What is most striking is that you would have no idea you are 100 feet from an international airport. There was absolutely NO noise from the airplanes or traffic at all. Probably the absolute best part was that they offer 24 hour concierge service and, as such, we were able to get assistance with our bags at 3:30am!! She even walked over to the terminal with us and dropped our bags at the United check-in counter. What service!! It was so appreciated with a very early morning start to a very long day of travel.We cannot wait until we have another chance to stay at the Westin DIA!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent and Convenient Hotel,"This is an amazing hotel that sits at DIA, just outside the door to the main security gates. In the morning waking up it was easy just to look out the window and see how backed up security was into the airport. The hotel itself is beautiful inside, there's a bar right in the lobby with lots of seating, nice place to sit, relax and gaze out the windows. I wish there were more food options around, but it is at the airport. Service was great, quick and easy check in. Would definitely stay again due to the convenience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing hotel and fabulous staff,"The Westin is amazing...Delaney, one of the managers went above and beyond to accommodate our family.  We had been traveling all day with 2 small children with many delays and she made our family feel so welcome!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great hotel to relax when you are traveling,We stayed at this hotel the night before flying to Europe and the night we returned before our final trip home.  The staff is wonderful and helpful and the rooms so comfortable and clean.  We took advantage of the large hot tub and pool to relax before and after our long trips.  We didn't eat at Grill and Vine which is the official restaurant but there is a nice little snack bar on the lower level where you can pick up a reasonable breakfast in the morning as well as coffee.  The real bonus is not having to wait for a shuttle to an airport hotel 15-20 minutes away when you are jet lagged or worrying about bad weather.  This place is quiet and relaxing and just a short walk away but connected to the terminal.  If you are a senior be sure to let them know for a discount and also sign up for the Marriott rewards.  It saves money.  I will stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Top Notch in Every Way,"I loved my stay here during the Denver Thanksgiving snow storm. The hotel is beautiful, everything is nice and clean, and the staff is excellent. The rooms are quiet, I never once heard anyone in the hall or room next to me. Breakfast was excellent and the service was good. I also found out that they had lodging for their staff to keep them off of the roads during the storm. I appreciated that they made sure their team was cared for and safe.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fine,Really nice easy hotel right next to Denver airport. groom service is a shocking ripoff. I've been to the Ritz-Carlton and it's actually less than this. They charge $25 for two eggs and hash browns. They also add on a 24% room service fee and an additional $3 delivery charge and on top of that they ask for gratuity. Total for two eggs in orange juice and a small coffee was $41.50. Ritz-Carlton in Manhattan is actually cheaper. They should definitely take the gratuity line off of there. Other than that it was a great stay but I really feel ripped off by the room service and by how little you get for room service. When San Francisco prices and Manhattan prices are cheaper than your room service you're not doing something right.,2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience,"I've been an occasional guest at this property, typically when I have an early flight leaving from DEN.  It's convenient, clean, and the staff it friendly.  The property has no concierge lounge and amenities are limited (small bar with limited casual menu, no gift shop for incidentals).  I don't like that the windows looking down at the airport security area aren't mirrored.  Often, the prices for this hotel are north of $300 and higher per night, so I stay over on Tower Rd, instead.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Superb and helpful personnel,"I can't say enough about the front desk and the receiving department at the Westin Denver International Airport.  I was scheduled to fly to Puerto Vallart and realilzed I had left my passport in my home city.  I had it overnighted to the DIA Westin for  an 8 am delivery.  The staff was all over making sure that I would get it in time.  Due to weather delay I did not get it in time.  However the staff made phone calls to the local FedEx facillity and did their best to make sure I would receive it the next morning.  The young woman in receiving was on the watch for this parcell and personally delivered it to me in the lobby.  I was thoroughly impressed with their care, concern and professionalism.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Not Up To Expectations,"We stayed at the Westin DIA the night of 11/8. As a Titanium Elite member I put in a request when making the reservation to use one of my Suite Night Awards. I was notified several days in advance that the award had been approved and my room had been upgraded to a 1 bedroom executive suite. I was pleased and looking forward to the stay. Upon check in we requested a room key vs. using the app and found out once we were in the elevator the key didn't work. Fortunately there was an employee in the elevator that used her key so we could get to our floor and then walked us to our room (we appreciated her). Once there she made sure I was able to open our door using the app. Once in I quickly realized we weren't in a 1 bedroom exec suite but instead had been downgraded to a junior suite. The room was nice but not what we were expecting. Unbeknownst to us we were also put in an ADA room.  We would have preferred a standard, non-ADA room but were never asked, the hotel was far from full. Standard requests in my profile were also not met, no extra towels or pillows were in the room. There were no wash cloths in the bathroom either. We had breakfast in their restaurant the next morning before our flight. It took 40 minutes to receive our food but only after asking someone. When our food finally arrived it was luke warm at best. There were only six tables of 1-2 people in the restaurant at the time and 1/2 of them already had their food upon our arrival. Overall a disappointing stay. .",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Westin at DIA in Denver,"Stayed here for an overnight due to an early morning flight.  Just walked out of the hotel into their terminal at 4:00 a.m. to check  luggage and go through TSA.  The  room Had many airport views.  Comfortable beds, nice furnishings, safe, refrigerator, great toiletries and shower!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful stop for business travelers!,"This is my favorite Westin west of the Mississippi! From the moment Tony greeted me at the front desk, to the lovely well appointed room, to the ease of dining, the gym, the place is fantastic. I love the large rooms overlooking the terminal, so I can watch planes land as I work in my room, the great bed, robes, and quiet. It is very quiet. You cannot hear the planes or elevators nor most other guests. I love this place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Clean beautiful hotel,"I really like this place. Housekeeping does a wonderful job keeping it clean. The lobby is spacious with a nice bar and small check in area. Process was fast and we were on our way.For $400+ a night, there are a few things I would like to see changed. The water is hard and impossible to wash soap off. The check in desk did not want me to talk to security to get a gate pass, saying it was too late. Luckily. I have talked to Westin security beforehand, so I didn't argue and just took care it of separately. When I got to my room, there were dirty dishes piled in front of the room door probably from previous guests. It was beginning to smell and weren't picked up by room service.The gate pass can take up to 2 hours to get and let's past security to check out the restaurants and shops. TSA has never seen this before and had to call the head officer. People watching was great.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent!,"Everything was top of the line. Clean, up to date, comfortable. The service was excellent! We were treated like royalty. It is also very convenient that it is connected to the airport. We ordered room service, it was very good and timely.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Nice Room, Excellent Location, and Mobile Key is the Greatest Thing Ever","Mobile check-in with mobile key is the best use of a mobile app ever.  You can check-in online 48 hours in advance and you'll get notified of your room number as soon as your room is available. You'll also get a mobile key that gives you access to the elevators, fitness center, pool, and most importantly, your room. With this feature, was able to get off the A train at DIA, go directly from the lower lever to the 12th floor to entering the room.  No visit to the reception area, no stops in the lobby, no receptionist, no lines, no waiting, no papers to sign, no rules to review...  Perfect!  Will use this feature any and every time. On top of that the room was nice as expected.  Everything was clean and well-stocked. The wifi was great (free!) and provided fast enough service to stream without interruption. The view from the room was very nice and the location can't be beat for an early morning flight.  No shuttle is needed, just walk out the front door and into the security area at the airport.  Pool area was great and includes a large hot tub. Fitness center had plenty of equipment and provided cool towels and headphones. Everything about this stay was terrific!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great location and views,"Super convenient hotel to DEN. Walk out, across an outdoor area, and into the hotel. If you have your boarding pass and no checked bags, you can immediately enter security. Love the views from the higher rooms, especially overlooking the terminal's famous roof. Rooms are nice and beds comfortable. Nice gym and pool, too, with great views. Did Grill & Vine restaurant this time and it was good. Previously tried Tom's Urban Diner (twice) and it was poor both times in terms of service and food.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,OUTSTANDING HOTEL,"We were pleasantly surprised. Having to re-book a flight and overnight at the airport, we decided to try the Weston at DEN the Terminal. What a fantastic hotel. Outstanding accommodations, service and food.We would highly recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great service,To only is the room wonderful but bed is great as well. Restaurant while not fancy offers good food and wide choices for dinner and breakfast. Having walking difficulties the best thing was they provided wheelchairs and luggage assistance right up to the delta checkin in bad weather being attached to airport is a major plusFront desk superior !,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A truly beautiful hotel!,"I chose this hotel for its convenient location at the Denver Airport, and did not expect to find such an architectural masterpiece. It is stunning, both the exterior and interior. Our room was comfortable with contemporary finishes and the bed is heaven. We enjoyed a delicious meal at the hotel restaurant Grill & Vine. I will now make Denver International my connecting airport just to stay at this hotel again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Absolutely No Complaints,"Usually, as a seasoned traveler, I will find something that annoys me or is an issue. No issues or complaints or problems with anything. Peaceful, quiet, efficient and relaxing for the short time we were here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best 35K points to spend IMO,"I traded 1 night stay at The Westin DIA for 35,000 points and it was the best decision ever. We last minute had to take a late flight to Denver. Our flight was delayed and by the time we arrived in DIA, it was 1am (3am eastern time, we were officially walking zombies)I fly alot, and DIA may be pretty, but it's horribly designed and their signage is highly inefficient and inadequate. For one, don't even bother to look for anything besides ""Baggage Claim"" or ""Terminal"" once you arrived because those are the only 2 things they care to point out - which implies Ground Transportation, Transit Station and Westin. Allegedly there is a walkway from Concourse A to Terminal but besides 1 little sign, we couldn't figure out where it is. So we took the train instead, which at 1am they were running single train. That translated to taking a full tour of DIA as we arrived in A, but now we had to ride to B & C, before getting back to A and subsequently Terminal. Fun time. Thus we're very happy that Westin is only a short walk across an open area once we got ourselves out of that maze. I know we arrived late, but it was a little annoying to find NOBODY at the front desk. The lobby bar was still running, and I was that close to ask them to please page someone. Check in was fast once someone appeared and as member, I was granted late check-out.Room was spacious and modern. I enjoyed the soft robe. The bed was comfortable and loved the lavender oil. And thank you for the complimentary bottle of water because Denver is dry. Being at the airport, once the air traffic starts running in the morning, you can hear subtle noises like a white noise and our room faced the train station away from flight traffic. Overall it's what one can expect a Westin to be. They have a nice pool & hot tub but I didn't bring my bathing suit. The workout room is nice and open. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant is very pricey. There is a small deli for coffee & small snacks/breakfast sandwiches etc. I simply took advantage of the in-room Starbucks coffee. I did in-app check out as both the front desk staffs were tied up forever with guests. We went down to the train platform and took A Train into Union Station.Best selling point of this hotel is the location - super convenient if you have late arrival or early departure.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Can't beat the location,Check out security from your nicely appointed room. Grab a coffee from Starbucks on the first floor then you are ready to go through TSA!  Dropped off my family and went back in to the gym and pool.  Great view from the treadmills too.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Sleek Modern in a Convenient Airport Location,"We needed a place near the airport on our last night In Colorado, and you can't get closer to the airport than The Westin Denver International Airport. The hotel is clean (literally as well as well as in design), is basically connected to the terminal so super convenient, and has a pretty good restaurant. The standard room was beautiful with huge windows giving a surprisingly nice view over the airport highway. And totally quiet. All in all, perfect for what we needed.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,very comfortable,had a late flight in and a early flight out.  This hotel though pricey was worth every dollar.  The bedding is top of the line!  Great shower and loved the soap and shampoo.  I did not hear a thing!  Just knowing that I could walk out and be in the airport took a load off my mind.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Pretty Cool,"Really surprising property, might be the best airport hotel I have ever stayed at.  It is attached to DIA, steps from the United baggage claim.  We had a corner room with sweeping views of the DIA airfield, room was great!  Bed was typical Westin, which is a good thing.  Very quiet, no jet noise.  Room service while pricey was tasty and service very friendly.  Would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Management is as terrible as the ludicrous ""Bonvoy"" branding","I am a Titanium Elite Member. We had two one-night stays at the Westin Denver International Airport approximately one week apart from each.On Sep 20, which was two days before the check-in of our first stay, I used the Marriott app and requested additional toiletries (3 shampoos and 3 body washes).  However, the hotel did not honor that request and completely ignored it. Let me remind you that the average nightly rate at this hotel is around $400 and it is completely unacceptable for the hotel management to disregard a request placed through the Marriott app two days before check-in.On our first stay on Sep 22, we were given a room which turned out to have a broken shower head that was not functioning properly.  We had an early morning flight on Sep 23 and we found this out on the morning of Sep 23 before showering.  Due tho this issue,we could not use the shower properly on the morning of our flight and could not take a proper shower.  Such an issue would not even happen at a Motel 6 or Rodeway Inn, but it did happen at a Westin, whose average nightly rate is $400.On our second stay on Sep 28, I had also made an advance request for additional toiletries using the Marriott app. However, the hotel management disregarded it for the second time in a row and had not honored it by the time we checked in.Using the app, I just requested 3 additional shampoos and 3 additional body washes.  After I brought this up, the front desk manager promised to send them to my room soon.  About an hour later, a staff member brought 2 shampoos and 2 body washes.  The hotel management clearly did not even bother checking request placed through the Marriott app and did not even take it seriously at all.  Again, this happened multiple times in a row at a Westin Hotel with an average nightly rate of $400 and even after I reminded the front desk agent of the request for additional toiletries, the hotel management could not even get it right.  I expressed my frustration to the hotel front desk during my check-in on Sep 28 afternoon, sometime between 6 and 7 pm.  A front desk agent, who had brownish hair and green/blue eyes working at the ""Elite Member"" desk (about 5'6"" tall, very very slightly overweight) told me that she would upgrade me to a ""deluxe"" room.  However, our original reservation was indeed for a deluxe room and that would not be an upgrade at all.  So she made a dishonest statement. Upon this, I told her that our original reservation was already for a deluxe room and what she offered would not be an upgrade at all.  She then told me that she would love to upgrade me but she had NO suites available at all for that night.  Upon this, I checked the Marriott app and found out that several suites were available at the hotel for that night. When I used the Marriott app and showed that front desk agent that suites were indeed available for Sep 28, she suddenly made another dishonest statement and said ""I meant to say no suites with two beds"", which was indeed a dishonest statement. Let me clarify that we did not expect or want a suite upgrade.  SPG used to be a great loyalty program and used to be very generous with suite upgrades for top-tier members.  But when Marriott took over SPG, it ruined it and no North American properties upgrade top-tier elite members due to Marriott Bonvoy's excessive corporate greed.   After all, instead of a suite upgrade, we just wanted to be treated fairly, but this Westin Hotel failed to treat us fairly by assigning us a room with a broken shower head and completely disregarding the requests made through the Marriott app prior to check-in. If this hotel treats Titanium Elite members this way, I cannot image how they unfairly they treat non-elite members.The worst part was what another front desk agent did to us.  She was around 5' 8"", mixed or African-American (racial information is only provided to help identify the front desk agent).  When I started to explain the persistent issues with the Marriott Bonvoy Loyalty Program, she suddenly started making funny faces and started acting like a child, and then said ""thank you"", still making funny faces.Every issue might be understandable for a certain degree, but we are not sure what to make of a front desk agent who failed to display a professional attitude by suddenly making funny faces.Because of its persistent issues, a lot of people are leaving Marriott Bonvoy Loyalty Program, which is the finest example of corporate greed just like the Westin at Denver International Airport.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Coolest Airport Hotel in the USA,"When business travelers think about airport hotels, the words ""noisy"" and ""underwhelming"" often come to mind. The Westin at Denver International is neither. It's a welcoming oasis in the chaos of a busy airport.The rooms are well-appointed, beautifully maintained, and surprisingly quiet. I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite on the top floor overlooking the runway. The view was stunning. I could have spent hours just staring and relaxing. The common areas are inviting and gorgeous. The staff is friendly and helpful. What more could you want from an airport hotel? Well... good restaurants with good service would be nice: The two connected to the hotel are mediocre and pricey. (Read those reviews.) Other than that, the Westin exceeds expectations in every way.If you're not a business traveler on an expense account, you may experience sticker shock when you see the rates (depending on the time of year). Like most airport hotels, the Westin charges premium rates because they have a captive group of customers. The closest other ""airport"" hotels are 5-8 miles away. I used to think of airport hotels as a pricey convenience whenever I had a late arrival or an early next-day departure. But this Westin is more than a convenience: It's a real luxury and a unique experience. I'm looking forward to returning--- that's something I cannot say about any other airport hotel I've encountered.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,FAA Conference,"Easy walking distance from the airport terminal. Bright, open architecture and in great condition. Rooms are fantastic. A sports bar/restaurant and a nice grill with good selections. Otherwise, one can get a pass to use the terminal facilities, or take the train which is right outside the terminal into town.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great hotel...,"This is simply just a wonderful hotel. The front door is literally yards from walking out of the DEN airport concourse. The decor is fresh and modern. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. The hotel restaurant is excellent. The staff are usually wonderful. However, this visit I had extremely poor Internet connection in my room. So I reported it the the front desk. The front desk staff member was completely uninterested in my issue. She could not have been more unhelpful if she tried. She was horrible.  Initially she said, “I don’t know anything about those kind of things”.  I was a little shocked at the response. I tried to help her by explaining it may be as simple as an upgrade in the hotel’s router firmware and asked her if the hotel had an in-house IT staff member. She simply replied, “No.” Becoming a little more frustrated I suggested she telephone the hotel’s IT department and report it. With what appeared to be a hugely cumbersome and unwelcome task on her part, she reluctantly said, “I will”.  But I knew she wouldn’t do it and the Internet connection in my room remained virtually unusable poor the rest of my stay.  As a lifelong Titanium Elite Member, I am not used to such poor service and such an uncaring staff member.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Functional Design and Health Inspired Offerings Await  - Arrival to The Magnificent Mile High City,"The convenience and design aesthetics of the hotel are easily appreciated.  The health supportive offerings are welcoming.  The fitness area and indoor  pool on the 11th floor are part of the core offerings, along with RunWestin for the hardcore or inspired.  The comfort of the Heavenly Bed by Westin and the overall quality of the food selection for the conference that I attended were great.  There is even the opportunity for short distance travel by commuter train is available from the airport to Union Station with 6 additional brief stops along the nearly 40 minute route.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience,"Flying in from midwest with 2 little kids, 8 pm landing is not early evening.   The  ease of walking from terminal (which is a current disaster in upgrades) to Westin was easy.   Mobile key did not work and check in was slightly difficult.   A poor room was was quickly exchanged to a better, more appropriate one.   Kids loved to see the airplanes.   Able to go to Hertz next morning and get car and leave.   Valet were awesome.   Highly recommend and will be back.   Clean.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Incredibly smooth experience,"Thanks to some awkward and last minute trip planning, I've had the pleasure of staying at a number of airport hotels recently. The Westin at Denver International Airport was probably the most expensive of the lot, but it also nailed everything important to me when it comes to an airport hotel. All hotel staff I interacted with from the bellmen to reception to restaurant waitstaff were pleasant and seemed well-schooled in hospitality. My check-in was probably the most hassle-free of any I've had at any hotel this year. Luggage appeared at my room minutes after I did. Everything was clean and tidy. The in-room coffee maker was plentifully stocked. The bed was plush to the point of luxury. The sound-proofing was spectacular; here are all the things that silently passed by my window: airplanes, buses, trucks, massive lightning storms. I was surprised to discover no bathtub in my room, which was fine for my purposes, but could have been a hassle had I been traveling with children, so it might benefit to pay attention to what amenities the room you book has. The Westin has two hotel restaurants. I tried the one that had less of a sports bar vibe and it was quite tasty. Lots of local, healthy, and veggie options alongside traditional fare like burgers. The deserts were ginormous! (although tasty, but better to order if you've got folks with you to share). If DIA were not immersed in the chaos of major renovations, I would have had a leisurely stroll to checkin from the hotel, but with dodging construction walls and hunting for detour signs, finding the Delta desk was quite the hassle (so probably better to leave a little more time that you would normally expect until DIA gets its mess under control).",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fabulous from check in to check out!,"Recently had the pleasure of staying at the Westin DIA with my coworkers. Fabulous stay from check-in to check-out. Maddie Scoggins at check in gave exceptional customer service and certainly made me feel like a valued Titanium Elite member. We all agreed as we left early the next morning that we wish we could have enjoyed the rooms, beds and service for just little longer. Thank You - already booked my next reservation!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Expensive but great location,"We stayed due to a very early flight, for convenience only. It cost a bomb, but was clean and comfortable, and we had a great view of planes, trains and automobiles!Probably would not stay there again due to the outrageous price.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,GREAT LUXURY AT DIA,"If you fly though Denver International, you are used to figuring out where to spend the inevitable ""unexpected"" night on the road. While possessing a Westin property price point, being able to walk from baggage claim into a quiet, well-appointed, upscale room, certainly takes the edge off another set of cancelled flights and missed connections. And Westin amenities, from multiple restaurants to a late night bar to complimentary work-out clothes, make an extra day on the road productive and doable. Great staff who work very hard to be that welcoming oasis for many customers who no doubt thought they'd be elsewhere that evening.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Place,"So delighted there is a hotel adjacent to the airport. Design is great, staff friendly. Rooms very nice though pricey. There was no information provided on restaurant or room service nor was WiFi information provided at check in.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,I wish every airport had one!,"Having traveled extensively both domestically and internationally, I have declared this my new favorite airport hotel!  The rooms are large, comfortable, and incredibly quiet.  The staff is pleasant and very accommodating.  There are restaurants onsite, although we had room service.  The food was good, although nothing extraordinary.  What is amazing about this hotel is that, unlike other airport hotels where you take a shuttle or walk half a mile to the airport, all you have to do is take the elevator to the fifth floor and you walk out into the airport - with security mere feet away!  With TSA Precheck, we were out of our room and on the way to our gate within 15 minutes!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best STAYCATION Ever!!,"Not only is this hotel gorgeous and super clean, but the views of the airport are stunning! Our boys had a blast watching all of the airplanes take off and land! I cannot say enough WONDERFUL things about this Westin at DIA!! Especially one of the employees, Carrie ~ she went more than above and beyond to make sure our stay was as enjoyable as possible! My family and I stayed there with our dog, they even provide food and water bowls as well as a dog mat and comfy bed! Miss Carrie offered to send cookies and milk up to our room that evening for our two kiddos, which truly blew me away! I’m 43 years old and I’ve never ever had someone offer to do this for me while staying at a hotel! Top notch cream of the crop service! Not only did Carrie offer to send cookies and milk to our room for the kids, but she also gave us fun airplanes for my children (being that this hotel is located at DIA) ~ how awesome is that, every hotel should have a Carrie working for them...she is clearly a huge asset to your company and operation as a whole! Unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to swim in the pool during our stay, but Carrie encouraged us to check it out and it is in fact beautiful! We will definitely be take a dip next time we stay there...and we will for sure be back for round two sometime in the next month or so! BIG kudos to Carrie at the front desk, she deserves a huge pat on the back and some recognition for her hospitality! We will be regular local fixtures there in large part because of her exceeding our stay expectations!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Surprisingly quiet!,"We booked overnight as our flight arrived too late to begin a lengthy drive.  The hotel was easily accessible from the terminal building and was exactly what we needed after a long transatlantic flight.

Lovely check in and nice bar in a great designed building .Gym and pool on the top floor , were both quiet. Restaurant was good but you aren’t able to charge to your room. Room was lovely. Nice design , large , great view and extremely quiet. 10/10!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent choice,We booked this last minute when we decided to be at the airport the night before an earlier flight leaving from Keystone. We used Marriott points. We had a beautiful king room. Beautiful bathroom. There is zero air traffic noise here. Great nights sleep. Wish we could have enjoyed the room a bit longer. I would stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Printing boaridng pass,"I had reserved a room here because I had a 5:45 flight out.  I realize it would be quite expensive but was surprised that $736.25 was charged to my credit card.  That was for a stay from 11;30 PM TO 4:30 AM.  When I called I was told my bill was ONLY $681.77. The lobby area was extremely loud.   I tried several times to print my boarding pass at the computer behind the registration desk.  It would not print.  Several times I walked around yet all of the staff were very busy.  I finally called the operator who printed my boarding pass and brought it to me.  There is no free internet.  The bathroom had a minimum of toiletries, much less than an a Super 8 and they provide free internet.  The room was not sound proof I heard slamming doors. The only reason that I am not rating this way overly priced experience is that it was convenient to the airport and the staff, although very busy, were polite and tried to be helpful.  Bottom line, lesson learned I will NEVER make the mistake of staying there again.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,President Ackley Florida Property Management,"Coming to the Westin Denver International for a quick  business trip was such a delight to meet some of the friendliest individuals in the hospitality industry!

As a business owner, I appreciate when team members go above and beyond to make their guests feel special! Totally recommend the Westin Denver for business travel!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect airport hotel,"We arrived late at night for a flight the following morning and it was perfect.Room was spacious, air conditioning quiet, and we were unable to hear any planes.And the bellman took our multiple bags, on a trolley from our room door to the checkin desk.We had a stack of bags someone else carried!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Problem Checking Bags, not for the handicapped","The Westin promotes that you can check your bags at the hotel, The reality is that is the case for only four airlines and only when the contract provider help elects to show up. The hotel takes no accountability for the service.\When we arrived to use it their was sign on the door open and the doors were locked, no one was in the operation . So we had to rush to the airport and get our bags checked at Delta and what had been planned as a casual morning turned out to be a hectic disaster. We were lucky we hadn't waited to the last moment.When I complained at the desk they were rude and said they were not responsible for the service they promoted on the internet as a benefit of the hotel. The manager came out and once again took no responsibility for the problem. We had stayed two nights and on the first night the bed looked as if the bed had not been changed and on the second night they complementary soap, shampoo, etc were all empty and placed in position as if they were full. This is a very expensive hotel with a take it or leave it attitude.  They could care less about the customer.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Terrible customer service,Ordered room service through Alex and called an hour later to ask where it is and he said 5 minutes after another hour he said he didn’t have a record of it. Jason was the manager on duty. I would’ve stayed at a much cheaper hotel to get this service.,1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Westin at DIA,Decided to stay here since we had an early AM flight the next day.

"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Incredible airport hotel! Clean, QUIET rooms with outstanding service!","Valet was easy to find and check-in was a breeze. My status was acknowledged and, when I asked about a room similar to a previous stay, I was upgraded to a gorgeous room with a view of the runway and the mountains. All on an award stay! In spite of the fact that the room was suspended above a busy roadway (and runway!), it was exceptionally quiet. I enjoyed taking breaks from work to watch the planes take off and land.The room was spacious, well laid out and very functional with a desk space, separate seating area and a very cozy bed. The sheets were super soft with a sheeted duvet and plenty of pillows. Truly a resort room feel.Aside from that, valet parking was a breeze and I will definitely stay here again for an overnight layover in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Exceptional Valet,"My friend and I were lost coming from the airport to get to where we could meet and Uber driver.  Desta, the valet, was kind enough to help us get where we needed to go and communicate with the driver to make sure they knew where we were.  When I let him know we did not have cash for a tip he didn't hesitate at all.  Instead, he continued to help until the car arrived and even assisted in loading our luggage.  WOW!  This is quality service!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Hospitality expertise,"Ending a long trip with a one night stay here, the Westin team understands hotel hospitality . It was the best hotel night of the trip. Well marked from airport arrivals, we were greeted cordially at reception. Check in was quick, staff were friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.Room was very nice, large and very quiet. We had worried that folks catching early flights and aircraft noise might be a problem - but we didn’t hear a thing.Hotel AC lets you adjust room temp and it works - not the case in several places we stayed!Bed was very comfortable.Only complaint: was told WiFi was free but system makes you accept a ~$15 charge. Then you get the charge reversed.  We had free WiFi in every B&B, Airb&b and tiny hotel on the trip. Not sure why the big guys don’t understand that free WiFi is expected.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful Welcome !,"The engaging young woman at the reception desk sought a 'nice"" room for this writer.  (She was assured that a crappy room was not desired.)  A most very non-crappy room on the 12th floor was assigned.

I dropped off the rental car the day before our flight and the day of the flight it was very convenient to walk just 5 minutes into the terminal.  The hotel has a modern-looking feel and a unique design, which we enjoyed.  On the lower level walkway to the Airport, there is open-air seating, with lounge chairs and the airport set up a miniature golf course for visitors.  The rooms were up to par with Westin standards, and we also used the nice indoor pool.  We really liked this hotel, the only thing I could say somewhat negatively about this location, was the lack of restaurant options, but I would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Flight Cancellation Oasis,Last leg of our two week cruise vacation and a cancelled flight! No luggage and exhausted we were told about the Westin by the airlines. It is right out the airport door. The hotel is new and very nice. The Check-in desk was very helpful and did everything to get us settled as we had been sitting at the airport for a long time. The rooms are large and comfortable. Sleep quality was great and you are literally a two minute walk to the terminal. No cabs no rush. This is a great oasis!!!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent,"Two night stay for business meeting. Staff was fantastic, rooms quiet and clean. Great airport access, literally just steps away. The conference center was terrific, fabulous amenities for anyone doing business planning. Restaurant and bar were also nice. Nothing outrageous, but very nice airport-attached property. Great business meeting solution in the Denver area.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Walking distance from airport terminal but still quiet rooms.,"Stayed here just one night but loved it. A short walk from the main terminal so no concerns about waiting for airport shuttle on departure. Great breakfast selection, everything from light breakfast to a full meal available. Large clean comfortable room, well designed, couldn't fault it,",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful Location,"This Westin is steps away from the DIA terminal.  Rooms are pleasant with modern furnishings.  Surprisingly quiet given its location but we did hear some takeoffs in the early morning.  Room service was a long wait but quite good.  This was our second time staying at this Westin, and we'll be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Lost item can’t be found????,"On Monday July 1 we checked out of room 622 at 5 am. We stayed one night. I left my precious bag of earrings on the bed, must have gotten covered up by a sheet. I have called and emailed and left voicemails for the “lost and found” with no response all week. How could a maid miss my bag of jewelry?  What is wrong with their lost item process??  Yes it was dumb not to double check the room but we were sleepy and I thought I had everything. I will be calling and sending emails daily. These earrings were not valuable in the monetary sense but they were sentimental to me. It was a colorful little bag. I can’t believe that it was not found.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A great stay,"We stayed here after arriving in Denver,and the night before flying back home. The hotel is attached to the airport which makes it so nice when coming in from a late flight and when leaving for an early morning flight. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were great. The hotel offers dining but there is lots of dining options outside of the hotel as well. Valet parking is available and isn't much more than parking yourself. I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Not Overwhelmed for the Money,"A delayed flight meant that I landed after midnight and had to be downtown for a meeting at 8am. Because I live in the mountains of Colorado, it did not make sense for me to drive home and then come back for 3 hours of sleep. There must have been a convention in town because *every* decent hotel was booked (and trust me -- I scoured). Truly, my only option was the Westin at the airport -- for $600+. It nearly killed me to spend that much and I seriously considered sleeping in my car. But I was desperately tired so I went to the Westin. There was a line at the front desk at 1am. The front desk agent was very friendly and efficient, but I still had to wait for over 10 minutes. The hotel is incredibly quiet given that it is connected to the airport. I never heard a plane when I was in my room. The bed, like every Westin, was amazing. I wish I could have spent 15 hours there rather than 5. BUT there was hair in the bathroom that was not mine. It was near the toilet and in the shower. For the amount of money I paid, I would have expected an absolutely spotless room. Ironically, I had to travel the next night and stayed at a ""standard"" hotel for $120 -- and there was no hair to be found. It's a great hotel and convenient if you're traveling, but I'll be reluctant to ever spend that much money there again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient to Airport,"Had a fab-u-lous stay at the Westin Airport hotel. We had a 5am flight out of Denver and as it was such an early flight we decided to stay at the Westin as it is directly connected by a 2 minute walk to the United terminal. It is so close that it only took us 50 minutes leaving the room, checking in, security, etc. to the boarding gate.  We were pleasantly surprised to have a 4* Westin experience for the one night we were there. The lobby and rooms are what you expect from the Westin luxury hotel chain. As our stay was due to airport convience we were not anticipating the great service, kindness and delightful hotel ammenities. Would absolutely stay here again if have an early flight out of Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"lovely, convenient hotel","Lovely modern hotel. great that is was close to the airport. we don't typically spend this much on a room so it was a splurge. nice to use a lovely pool and fitness center. the pool overlooks the south around the airport and was nice viewing. the room service list was decent.  very quite, you can not hear the planes taking off. the whole place felt very clean.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Expensive for the what you get,"I was stuck in Denver airport overnight and after traveling for 24hrs really wanted to sleep in a bed. The Westin was 100% successful in providing this and I do have to admit that the location to the terminal in phenomenal. What the Westin did lack at the airport was what I expect from other stays at level 6 SPG hotels. For instance, once lying in bed there was no way to turn off the lights except to get out of bed and walk all the way to the door. It took an abnormally long time to check in even at midnight and for over $400 for the cheapest room unless you do not have time to take a shuttle to another hotel I would not recommend this hotel for the price.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Above and beyond,I was stuck in Denver and choose to stay at the Weston airport hotel. I was greeted promptly by Natasha McCay who turned my unfortunate situation into a much better one! She helped me get a room at a reasonable rate and provided me with a few items I really needed.  I’m now safe comfy and happy in my nice room!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful Convenience!,Great convenience at airport.  Wonderful room with great views.  Excellent spa area.  Wud stay nowhere else if catching a denver flight! Check in was very efficiunet.  All employees were very friendly. Efficient management!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Pricey but super convenient,"I stayed here before a 5 am flight and you cannot beat the convenience of walking across a courtyard to get to the airport terminal. Denver’s other “airport hotels” are actually several miles away, and although they have shuttles, I did not want the stress of a possible transportation glitch. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the location is unbeatable. The price ($300 including tax) was worth it to me under the circumstances. Make sure you join the Marriott rewards program and look for deals.I got into the airport early morning the day before my next flight, and the hotel was happy to store my luggage while I took the 35-minute  light rail ride into downtown Denver. The station is right below the hotel, and the cost for a day pass is $10.50 for unlimited use. Downtown Denver has lots of fun things to do.Early morning tip: while Denver usually has three security lines, there’s only one open at 4 am, so the line was LONG.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Watch the Wind Blow from Room 849 (But the Electronic Key is Sketchy),"My husband and I recently stayed at the Westin Hotel at Denver International Airport.  We arrived too late at night to risk a drive into the mountains after dark.  And, on the day of departure, our plane left at 6:15 am.  That was much too late and much too early to stay anywhere else, so we chose the Westin at Denver International Airport for convenience on two separate evenings, one upon arrival and once immediately before departure.I love exercising in water, and the pool on the 12th floor has a spectacular view.  The temperature was just right, there were plenty of fresh towels, the water was crystal clear, and the jacuzzi so relaxing after a short swim.  I swam in the morning and the pool was empty except for one other guest.  Pools are important to me, and the pool at the Westin is quite lovely.  I enjoyed wearing the robe provided in the room to the pool and back, an extra luxurious touch.Both nights, the beds were comfortable and bathroom spotlessly clean.  The Westin does not have much color, but it is modern and attractive.  The USB charging ports were convenient, as was the tea/coffee machine.  However, there was no creamer or sugar in the morning beverage station.  I enjoy sugar with my tea and this seemed like an oversight.My husband enjoys using technology, and he was very excited to try the electronic keys.  However, we could not get the electronic key to work either time.  We did not try to troubleshoot the problem, but the first night the associate at the lobby could not get the electronic keys to download properly either.  So, we remain skeptical about the electronic key system.Although the hotel is at the airport, both of our rooms were extremely quiet.  We we exhausted both times, so we were very grateful for the ability to sleep without excess noise from planes or airport operations.The downside, of course, is that this hotel is frightfully expensive.  We enjoyed our stay, the rooms were well maintained, service was great, and the pool was fabulous.  But, I still think that the price was too high.  If we had had a choice we would have opted for a less expensive hotel, but given our schedules we chose convenience over price point.  If you choose the Westin, you'll be well looked after.  But, you will pay dearly for the convenience of staying at the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Stay here only if necessary,"We had an early flight out of Denver. Given a very busy airport with huge security wait times, and a 45 minute train ride from downtown, we had no choice. So we swallowed our pocketbook and our pride and payed $402 for a room. The internet did not work. So, I called the desk and asked for the code. He said, “Sir, Internet is $16 dollars extra.” I said, “If you stay at the Hampton you get free internet and breakfast to boot!” Sad that our country is run now by yuppie beancounters! Ask them to split a cord of wood! Jake",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Second Business Stay,"In November, my wife had a series of meetings at the Westin DEN Airport, so we booked to stay there. Oddly, at the last moment, those meetings were moved to another near-by hotel, but she just grabbed a taxi from the Westin.As we fly United Airlines mostly, access to this Westin is really just steps from the United Baggage Claim area at DEN, and the access area is flat, so rolling luggage traverses the open space between the terminal, and the hotel easily.We had a similar room, as we had on our first stay in May, Room 1072, actually next door to our previous room.Our room had a very comfortable King bed, with a fairly large closet with iron, ironing board and safe, a bathroom with a single sink, and a combo tub/shower. The shower had very good pressure, and wide distribution. It also had a separate spray wand. We had adequate AC & USB charging ports, plus horizontal surfaces to place our devices on. The room was comfortably sized, and though it had a “corporate feel,” it was more than adequate for this short stay. We had a flat-screen TV, atop an extension to the small desk in the room. We had a mini-fridge, as well. The room had an alarm clock/radio, and neat built-in reading lights, above the bed. The Mr. Coffee (not our favorite) coffee maker had an ample amount of coffee and creamer, in the caddy.Our bath amenities were the standard Westin White Tea Aloe products, which we have found to be nice. We had comfortable bathrobes, and ample, nice towels. One nice touch at many SPG/Marriott properties is the little container of “Lavender Sleep Balm.” that one can rub on their pillows, for a bit of “aroma therapy.” We both find that this balm is conducive to a good night’s sleep.We were also able to print our boarding passes at the little business desk, just behind the check-in counter.I dined on-property, while my wife had meals with her meetings. I enjoyed my experience at the on-property Grill & Vine. I also had wine in the lobby bar.The staff, with whom we dealt, were excellent and very friendly. For convenience to DEN Airport, this Westin is ideal, and when overnighting at DEN, will always be our choice of lodging.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Cost vs Convenience ,"If you like the Westin Brand and do not mind paying top dollar for convenience this is your place. This hotel is a Standard Westin (clean, functional, great staff, restaurants, room service, etc) in an incredible location. Connected to the main terminal the hotel location cannot be beat (other hotels miles away). FYI - DIA under construction finding check in can be a bit of a maze.Gym is top notch and will satisfy all but the most fanatical. Indoor Pool area (think cruise ship size pool) is on 11 floor with killer view and a hot tub.If you have the cash (or Bonvoy points)This may be your place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Definitely Upscale and Handy for Travel Interruptions,"This Westin is on Denver Airport property and a very short walk from the terminal building. It is very nice, with a lot of clean white and aluminum used in the decor. The restaurant has an interesting menu and glass wall looking back towards the terminal building. The rooms are plenty spacious and well appointed. The staff is definitely above average and sensitive to the issues of travelers. A strange charge showed up on my credit card and the first person that I talked to (by phone) resolved the issue within minutes. All of this does come at a premium price, but when you factor in transportation to off-airport properties and the time involved it's worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Exceeded expectations!,"The Westin at the Denver Airport was excellent. There is a nice outdoor space that connects the airport to the hotel. The design of the hotel is interesting and compliments the airport. The hotel itself is clean and quiet with spacious rooms. I stayed in room 985 which was on the end. As a result, there were numerous windows. The food was also excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Short Stay,"My wife and I were forced to overnight at Denver International Airport due to flight delays. Our rebooking was extremely early the next morning so offsite lodging was extremely limited due to travel time and warnings of early morning airport congestion. This onsite hotel was really the only option. The hotel is excellent. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was excellent and very quiet considering its location on an airport. The only drawback is its price—it is expensive-one pays dearly for its convenience. Regardless, it is worth it. This hotel is the only part of Denver International Airport that actually works!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,First time stay for me ,"I used to travel to Denver for business 7 years ago. I knew my way around the airport and the highways to Denver Tech center. I stopped going for change of job. This year, my new job brought me back. We had a leadership retreat at the Westin at DEN. For me this is a new hotel - it is only 3-years old. So it is pretty new! Loved my experience here!!! First the architecture of the whole building is creative, innovative and fun. It looks like a space ship and feels like we were in The Enterprise (fir Star Trek fans). The rooms are spacious, as it is with a Westin, the beds are heavenly !! The conference space is well designed. For some people, they complained about the distance they had to walk from rooms to conference centers. I loved the distance - it helped me get my steps for every day :) There is a ‘front lawn’ between the hotel and the terminal. I enjoyed sitting out there to soak up the sun for 30 min. The convenient location to public transit system and the airport terminal (walking within a couple of minutes!)is wonderful. This is a very ideal conference center to bring people from all over the US. Enjoyed our experience here!! Oh, the food was really good too!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Conflict Resolution (Jessica),"Jessica the night manager caused me to have a wonderful stay. At check in I experienced a few issues however, Jessica exemplified exceptional professionalism, understanding and conflict resolution skills which I appreciated. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't had enjoyed my stay. Thank you Jessica!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fine Hotel and Convenient Location,Hotels in airports are a great way to start or end a vacation if an early or late flight is part of the travel plans. We were trying to fly home this week when our flight was cancelled at 10:30pm due to severe weather. Being able to grab our bags and be in the hotel lobby withing about 15-20 minutes is really nice.This is a wonderful hotel and we will be back.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice hotel; walk to airport terminal,"We stayed here 1 Friday night mid May 2019 as part of our vacation. $323.00. We were flying out the next morning. The hotel is separated from the DIA terminal by a large open section. You have to walk across the section. There is a glass awning over the middle part of the section, but you are out in the open. It was raining and the wind was blowing. We froze crossing over to the hotel. I really thought it was very poor planning for the hotel company to charge what they do for this place and not provide an protective walk-way over to it. Due to the nature of DIA being out in the middle of nowhere, I imagine the wind is probably always blowing there. On the positive side of things, the hotel is extremely convenient for jumping up and running over to the terminal. We stepped right into the security area. Unfortunately, they are doing construction in the middle of the terminal to make it nicer, I guess. I was pretty nice already. I think there are less food places now in the terminal, before going through security, so not a lot of eating choices. Ok, so back to the hotel:  Very nice, clean, rain shower heads, comfy bed. Very contemporary, all the usual complementary items. I love it when the bathroom/shower is in its own room and not out in the room. This room had a BR in its own room, out of sight of the bed. Everything looks just like the pictures. The desk people were very nice. There is a general snack market and a fancy place to eat inside the hotel, and a Tom's Urban rest. right next to the hotel.We ate at Urban place that night and were not impressed by slow service and mediocre food.However, there's not much inside the terminal as far as food due to the construction. Hotel is great, food places just so-so, though we only ate at one, bad walk to the terminal if weather isn't nice, way too much money for it, but the convenience of being that close to the terminal can't be beat. I gave it 4 stars due to the exorbitant price and bad walk from the terminal.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect for biz travel!,"Westin's have a standard of excellence you come to expect and I was not disappointed with this location.  In fact, I was overjoyed. I was attending the Outdoor Retailer trade show and had to change my reservation at the last minute because I had so many issues at the Sheraton downtown Denver, I was willing to pay almost double. Yes, Westin is pricey, but for the convenience and class, it is well worth it.   I cannot begin to express the joy that I had when I saw how close DIA was.  Literally, 15 steps and I am in the airport.  It was VERY new and clean when I was there, the staff was friendly, the bed was amazing and I had peace of mind staying there.  The service in the bar downstairs was extremely slow, they needed more staff but my overall experience was so good that I am still giving it a 5 star.  Perfect for business/travel if you have an early flight out of DIA and honestly even if you don't.  It's a unique travel experience to watch planes come in and out and the noise didn't bother me.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent airport hotel,My daughter and I were in Vail this week for medical treatment and stayed at the Westin in order to be in position for a 9am flight back to the east coast.  Excellent choice.  Room was great. Room service was good ( although  they left off the desert and a spoon for the soup - the sent somebody back up daily quickly) and breakfast at the restaurant was pleasant. But the best feature is its convenience - there is a bag drop in the hotel - at least 90 minutes ahead of your flight they can check your bags through - and the security line is literally a two minute walk from the hotel.  Brilliant. Would certainly recommend and return.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wish we could have stayed longer,Wish we had more time at the hotel to enjoy the gym and pool. Amazingly well located for overnight connecting flights. Given a larger easy-mobility room with windows on two sides. Amazing views to the mountains too.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Must have,"Every time we travel anywhere, we’ve been staying at the Westin. Like any Westin, great beds and pillows, guaranteed a great night! Best of all, so convenient to vale your car and walk right into the airport. They offer all accommodations you might need.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Solid hotel,Clean and friendly. You can’t go wrong with the location and bright feeling of the hotel. The check in staff were efficient which is always appreciated when it’s late at night and you missed a flight.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Its all about Convenience,"I had an early business flight & decided to get some extra sleep by booking a room here. Denver happened to have a snowstorm , so it ended up being an even better decision. The price is on the higher range,but well worth it. The huge windows in the guest rooms overlooking the airport were awesome. Restaurant was good, so was the bar",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Bad experience,"The Positives....The hotel and rooms are beautiful and the location is fantastic for an early morning flight. My teenage daughter and I stayed at the Westin the evening of 19th April. The check-in process was quick and easy. We ordered room service for dinner. I had the cob salads and my daughter had the salmon . Everything was delicious. The room was quiet and beds comfortable. The Negatives....We ordered room service for breakfast for 7am. There was a knock at the door at 6 am. We were still in bed sleeping so I sent them away and asked them to come back at 7 am. At 7:20 I called down and asked were our breakfast was. Our breakfast arrived at 7:35. We had ordered pancakes, a basket of pastries, oatmeal, a small carafe of coffee with milk instead of cream and a kids smoothie. Well....the pancakes were dry and cold and alone on the plate ...they were not served with whipped cream and fruit as stated in the menu. The pastries were also dry and cold and were not served with butter and jam as stated in the menu. There was a bottle of 2% milk and a glass to drink it with....no coffee. No oatmeal. The smoothie was delicious. By the time they delivered the coffee and oatmeal it was time to go. Although I refused to sign the check...I was charged for the breakfast. My daughter drank the smoothie and had a few bites of her pancake. I had a few sips of coffee. Nothing else was touched. The stay started out fantastic...5 stars. The morning however ruined the experience. The person answering the dining line was also rude and unapologetic.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,great location,"Stayed for a business meeting.  Ultimate convenience, right across a plaza from the terminal with a number of restaurants and bars handy.  Quick check in; very standard room for this type of hotel but clean/well looked after.  Excellent service.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Westin at Denver International Airport - Billing Issues,"I stay at Westin DIA often. It is a beautiful place, well cared for, good dining and relaxing. I always sleep well here. All the public facing staff are accommodating and polite. I always enjoy my stay at Westin DIA and although it is a pain to stay between late night and early morning flights, I really look forward to staying here.So why a crappy review for the Westin DIA?I like visiting the 6th floor Sky Lounge for something quick before retiring for the night. I always use room charge to collect all my costs and gain points. Finally, something totally unexpected happen on my last stay, March 22, 2019. Obviously an error, someone else's tab was charged to my room. I have been working for weeks to get this resolved. 22-MAR-19 57205 Sky Lounge F&B 28.0022-MAR-19 57205 Sky Lounge Other 2.2422-MAR-19 57205 Sky Lounge Other 4.20Now, it is a pittance of a charge and the other person is a cheapskate tipper. If I can afford to pay $300+ a night in this upscale on premises airport hotel with airline ticket prices, I should not complain about a measly $34.44 charge and just suck it up. I did pay it. No problem. I am moving on.So behind those well dressed, proper, attractive, smiling, eager to please, customer centered Westin employees that greet and serve you, I think there is a is group in the backroom who are evil and sinister, and likely think I am a stupid customer.1)	The Front desk manager said she could not correct the bill on check out. Okay… next.2)	I accessed the website to report a claim and received a beautiful email that the mistake will be corrected and my credit card will be credited in 2-10 days. It never happened, yet3)	I finally called a human at the Westin DIA backroom and got the answering services. Before the end of a day, I received a call from a nice sounding voice indicating that they found their billing error and my credit card will be corrected in 2-10 days. I am feeling really good at this point and confident that the issue is finally resolved!Nothing has happened yet to refund me. I will be back to the Westin DIA because I like the place, but how I spend and where I spend will be on my mind, when I never in the past had to think about customer fraud before, especially in a place like this. So maybe I am not stupid, but not ruling out a dumb customer. Have a nice day and pleasant travels.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect Hotel for Tired Traveler,"We had zero problems with our stay and the beds are very comfortable. We were surprised with how quiet it was from airplanes, however we could hear the people in the next room. The room cost was very expensive compared with others close by, but the location is awesome.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Useless management,The staff at the front desk are of no help.  Our reservation was made 45 days ago... Why does it take 75 minutes to get rooms?  The management would not come out of their office to explain anything to us.  I had to call the hotel from my cell phone to talk to a manager.  Kept being promised 5 minutes until we had rooms... For 75 minutes!If you have a choice... Find better.,1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great experience!,"Stayed here the night before an early-early flight from Denver to Milwaukee with our 3 year old grandson. His comment sums up the experience perfectly- “This is the best place ever!”  The people were friendly and the room was spotless and quiet. Just what we needed!  Comfortable beds and pillows, beautiful building. It’s a bit pricey, but we’ll define back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Best in convenience, really cool hotel ","We stayed on Starwoods/Bonvoy points so booking was easy and we arrived in the evening, with young children so was over the moon when we realized that the hotel is attached to the airport, past the bagging area. The kids were wild, but staff was amazing and The room was really nice and we had a good view of the “circus tops” of the airport. Loved our stay and we tried to stay on he way back, but there weren’t any rooms with points. Highly recommend staying here for airport related activities.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"New, Convenient and Beautifully Designed","As you approach the Denver airport, the unique look of the terminal is now challenged by the hotel’s design.   Architecturally striking on the outside, and beautifully designed on the inside.   It is just steps from the terminal and straddles the train station.  There is a bar, a restaurant and a coffee shop.   The pool, hot tub and gym are a great plus.   It is expensive as airport hotels go at $368.00 a night but the convenience and luxury are worth it.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,I paid what!,"When I arrived in Denver I was extremely jet lagged. I was told I requested a king size bed. I said it didn’t matter the size of the bed as I was tired. The first room they gave me was on the same level as the lobby, which was okay, but it was in a hallway by itself with three doorways that had heavy doors that I could tell would be banging as other guests came and went. Also, no bath and that was important as I was also stiff. I wasn’t too polite at the front desk, which I give the staff credit for calmly changing my room to one with a bath, on a hire floor, and away from doors. This was all great except, the bed was so tall (yes I’m short) I had to jump onto it, and I will include a picture of the bath. In case you don’t see it, if you are sitting in the bath you can’t reach the faucet to turn off the water. For what I paid for this room I expected a free mini bar, help with my bags, and a jacuzzi. What I got was a joke. I would have been better off having a layover at the airport as I got no sleep. Save your money.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Super convenient, if pricey","Nice hotel that still feels new. Room was good, though nothing particularly memorable. For the most part, the outside noise stays out, but I could hear the train bell several stories below in the transit center as well as some other outside noise. If I was a lighter sleeper it may have been a problem.Cool lobby. The bar was ok. Bartender wasn't super knowledgeable about beers (and this is in Colorado...).While not operated by the hotel, Tom's Urban restaurant isn't worth a trip. Had a poor experience before but tried again and was still disappointed. The other restaurant, operated by the hotel, has been good, though I didn't visit on this trip.The best part if the convenience to the terminal. I woke up for an early flight and from my alarm to being in the concourse, with TSA PRE Check (and no bag check), was 25 minutes. It allowed me to get nearly an extra hour of sleep from probably anywhere else and having to deal with a shuttle and more walking.Oh, and great pool/hot tub with a view and fitness center. The fitness center seemed small-ish for the size of the hotel, but wasn't crowded when I was there at least.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great airport hotel ,"Really liked this hotel. Spent one night there flying out early in the morning. The room was big and clean and modern. The bed was cozy. The bathroom was huge. All in all, an upscale airport hotel. The window treatments were electric and really cool.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Worth the fly in the sky?,"Now this review is coming from a handicapped point of view.  $400 and up per night.  I checked in handicapped, but was given a non-handicapped room.  When you’re tired and move on 2 canes like a turtle, and you’re only there for a day, you take it and don’t want to move rooms again.  You pay here for the convenience of walking from the airport directly into the hotel itself.  Is that worth the cost?  I had a free night, so in spite of the room mix up, it was to me!  It would not be otherwise to me.  The rooms are mediocre at that rate.  Food though at the restaurant, spectacular.  I had a kale and blueberry salad, half portions, gotta love that option, and a full loaf of homemade, warm crusted bread that was out of this world.  Wine excellent, and diner after diner ordered the homemade peach cobbler with lots of ice cream dripping down the rim of the bowl.  I asked everyone who got it, now was that worth it, and all answers were a resounding “you betcha”.  There is some wheelchair transfer issues from personnel at the airport to personnel at the hotel that seems very redundant and non customer friendly, a switch of staffing, like a handoff at a relay race, the human being the baton, that is stressful and costs in tipping more, when you’re in a hurry.  I wish this procedure had worked better.  All in all, I’d stay again, if I had a free night!",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The absolute worst service I have received at a Marriott property,"When I came in to check in, I stood at the check in counter for 10 minutes, waiting for someone to take care of me.  Once in my room, I dialed three different numbers with no answer trying to get room service.  No one ever answered.  I went to the front counter and asked for the manager.  She had a real attitude.  She took my room service order.  I waited an hour and nothing showed.  I went back down.  More attitude.   She stomped off and FINALLY my food showed up.  Really bad management at this hotel.  And  . . . I have spent over 500 nights in Marriott properties.  Really disappointing.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A good airport hotel,"Denver is a key airline hub, so its just as well that this, the airport hotel, is unusually good. Efficient and friendly staff, clean rooms in which everything works just as it should, a reasonable choice of restaurants either in the hotel or very close to it. And a fabulous view of the mountains in the background with the planes coming in to land in the foreground. I doubt whether any airport hotel anywhere is a destination in its own right; but this one comes closer than most to being just that. So if you have to stop over for whatever reason, this is the first airport hotel I can honestly recommend!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great, great stay","Perfect for a weary and hungry traveler.  The basic rooms were a generous size, inaccurately clean and current! The hotel itself is an architectural gem.  The on- site restaurant was lovely- great beer and cocktail  selection and some creative small plates and entrees.  I especially enjoyed the breakfast.  Awesome, attentive service everywhere!  Literally next to check in and out and the train line that leads directly to downtown Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great location,"This Westin is connected to Denver airport, especially easy to get to the United check in area. Getting to the location can be slightly confusing from inside the terminal, since there aren't as many obvious signs from inside the terminal as one would suspect. I stayed here upon recommendation from corporate travel for an early flight out of Denver, which was an excellent idea versus flying from Colorado Springs, even more so if flying United.I parked my rental car initially since I didn't know about the parking or shuttle situation, but it was easy enough to return the rental car and take the shuttle back to the terminal. Once dropped off in the terminal, it was easy enough to walk through and get back to the hotel.Check in process was fairly quick. Status was not mentioned at check in, no upgrade or any mention of amenity. Unfortunately, it seems this is more the norm since the switch to Marriott from SPG. They did have my member number on file and thanked me for being an elite after mentioning if it was on the reservation. Staff was nice and friendly besides that.Room was nice and modern, very comfortable bed as all Westin hotels have, the bathroom was small but functional with a standing rainfall shower. The view was... well, it's next to the airport, so I didn't expect much for a view. The room itself was great though, with no noise from airplanes, unlike some other airport hotels I have stayed in. It was easy to get some rest before an early morning flight.The hotel is connected to the train that goes into Denver. It was very easy to get to and from downtown, about a 30 minute ride each way. The ticket machines were having some issues, unrelated to the hotel, but having the train down on the first floor was a nice bonus and it was easy to get some dinner without having a rental car.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has an early morning flight out of Denver and will be staying here again in the future for business trips.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,You get what you pay for!!!,My daughter and I stayed for 1 night for plane watching. Carrie checked us in at 11pm. She was absolutely amazing. So friendly and helpful.She addressed our every need. The hotel is new and beautiful. Hotel very clean.The staff seems happy and always smiling.Highly recommend the hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Exceptional stay!,"This hotel is clean, fresh, welcoming and quiet. The rooms are spacious, feel recently renovated and clean. The beds were super comfortable! You can’t beat the convenience of being steps from the terminal. A+!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Airport convenience at its best,"If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the Denver airport, this is literally attached to the airport.  The exterior of the hotel is beautifully designed; however, the curve of the design makes the front desk area (that shares space with the bar) incredibly loud.  We reserved a conference room for a meeting and the conference staff was A+ service.  The rooms are all brand new and on brand for the Westin.  Only real issue with the hotel was the price - I would expect the price flexes with whether they are holding large conferences, but this is by far the most expensive Westin I have ever stayed at.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very nice room but restaurant a big disappointment ,"Stayed overnight recently and thought the room was terrific, quiet and comfortable- facing south, which is best. But the grill & vine restaurant was mediocre and horribly overpriced. I suppose if you don’t have any food issues then it would be OK, but I need to limit salt so for them to make a $32 dinner acceptable for my needs, I was served a pretty plain, over cooked, rather tasteless piece of fish. With a really boring side salad that had nothing but romaine lettuce and finely chopped tomatoes and cucumber in it.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wow!  Awesome hotel!,"OK, it is a little tricky to drive into especially if you follow the GPS and not read ALL the signs coming into the airport so pay attention.  The awesomeness started with Miriam at the front desk who could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. It was early in the day so it was a roll of the dice about getting a room.  Nope, she worked me into an upgraded room and it was spectacular.  I was somewhat concerned about the noise due to the proximity to the airport (right on the airport) but they obviously soundproofed it, it was very quiet.  My room was actually right next to the road leaving the passenger drop off for departures on the east terminal and I couldn't hear the cars either.For a 0630 flight, nothing betas walking less than 50 yards into. the terminal!  Even though the construction has the terminal in a freaking mess, it was still easy as could be.  Had dinner at the Grill and Vine and the food was excellent as well as the bar choices.I will definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,WOW! Gorgeous hotel and saves us an hour on travel day. ,"We have been waiting for this hotel to open! With a shuttle to the rental cars at this airport, having a hotel on airport premises is EXCELLENT! This hotel is literally steps always from check-in. The pool is beautiful and With a hot tub on the 11TH floor looking out over the city it is my favorite space! The workout room is full and nice too. Room service was delicious and serves 24/7. A little pricey but definitely worth every penny as the service and rooms and hotel are all amazing. Of course the location is what makes this hotel prime.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very good location,"This is a modern, chic hotel with an updated retro vibe. It's located right beside the airport but you have to walk outside to access the airport, which could be a drawback in cold/snowy weather. The room was very clean and modern and the bed was very comfortable. I loved the tea tree amenities. Would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Thank you Westin and Brennan Conant,"Proximity to the airport is unbeatable and the rooms were quiet, clean and spacious.  We did have an issue with wake up call(s) and expressed our concerns to the front office manager, Brennan.  Brennan and Westin went above and beyond to rectify the situation and restore my faith in this hotel.  I travel to Denver from the east coast often and I will definitely stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Thank you!,". We were vacationing in Vail and tried to leave a day early because of the snowstorm.   Most flights were canceled and we made reservations at the Westin for two nights. This hotel  handle the demand and the storm with a smile and were very accommodating! I am so thankful we had a comfortable place to sleep and the restaurant inside was fabulous!  I thought we would have service problems but we didn’t!  The manager stepped up and supported the wait staff with a smile!  This could have been a horrible experience but it was a beautiful hotel, restaurant, and experience. :) loved the pool and fitness center also:)",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Awesome,"First off, this location is fantastic. To step off the plane and walk to the hotel is so great! We were greeted by a friendly and professional employee ( thank you Natasha!) She quickly checked us in and gave us a beautiful, super clean room. We wanted a snack so went to the lounge for that-they had delicious chips and salsa and hot pretzels. Exactly what we wanted. We checked out the pool and hot tub-looked clean and inviting. The room and bathroom was enormous and super clean. The views of the airport were really cool.In the morning we went to the Grill and Vine for breakfast. Also delicious and the food came quickly. This hotel was exactly what we needed. Thanks for a great stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenient location, baffling service","Pros: extremely convenient location if you need a place to lay your head between flights. Rooms were quiet and mostly clean, and beds were comfortable. Cons: no one to help with luggage (was traveling with four large pieces). The hallway on our floor was littered with room service trays (I counted six between the elevator and my room), so clearing dirty dishes obviously wasn’t a priority. I would have only dinged the hotel one star for those two things. BUT, the reason for such a low rating is one of the most bizarre customer service exchanges I’ve observed. While waiting in line to check in at 10pm, the man who was checking in ahead of me was told that despite checking in online hours earlier, his room wasn’t ready. Again, it was 10pm, and he was told he was going to have to wait for his room...they couldn’t explain why it wasn’t ready, give him another room, or even tell him how long he’d have to wait. The guy was livid (as I would have been), so I spent 30 minutes waiting in line behind him while he tried to get answers — instead of bringing over one of the other attendants to check me and the people behind me in, they just left us all hanging until a manager could be called to talk to the guy who didn’t have a room. Cut into what little time I had to sleep between flights, but I guess I should be thankful that I had a room.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience is the key here.,"The food is quite extensive and this is one of the best restaurants at DIA that I have visited. This restaurant is just a short walk from the terminal and the wine selection is excellent. Prices are high, but reasonable for an airport.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great amenities & Perfect For An Early Morning Flight,"I was very impressed by this hotels customer service. They made the check in process very easy and set up a wheel chair service for my great grandmother to be picked up from her room the following morning.The room was beautiful, and the location was extremely convenient. A little pricey for stay, but it was worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Service and Overall Experience,"I travel frequently for business and stay mostly at Marriott.  This overnighter was with kids and we were coming back to the states after a lengthy international trip.  I hadn't requested it, but they put us in adjoining rooms which made things extra convenient.  They also had lots of water bottles waiting at the check-in desk for my whole crew.  The hotel was exceptionally clean, comfortable, quiet and convenient.  I look forward to staying there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Terrible room service,"Don't bother with room service, it was the worst I have ever had.I ordered sausages and eggs for breakfast which came with potatoes, toast and tomatoes. Unfortunately they delivered ham instead of sausages and didn't cook the eggs the way I had ordered. I wasn't worried about this as mistakes happen, I called to have the order corrected. However I was shocked when it arrived (half an hour after the first delivery) instead of replacing my whole meal (which was cold by this stage) they delivered just sausages and eggs cooked correctly but not the rest of the meal - disgusting considering the meal was $18 plus tax plus service charges!Other than that the room was serviceable, expensive for what it was and at the lower end of the four star rating. No minibar (items can be delivered to your room, but really, who wants to call every 10 minutes to get a drink or snack).Bed was very comfortable.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,BEWARE!!  Does not honor the cancellation policy and you WILL pay no matter what,"We had a trip to Colorado Springs last week with a one night stay planned in Denver at the Westin the night before our outgoing flight.  When our airline contacted us that our flight would likely be delayed or cancelled due to a predicted storm at home, we decided to head home a day early, leading us to not need the hotel room at the Westin.  I checked to be sure we were within the cancellation window and would not be charged our stay.  I have emails stating it was cancelled but the Westin still charged me $346.00 for the room.  I contacted the hotel and the supervisor, Jason, said the charge would be removed.  Fast forward 5 days and the charge is still there.  Called the hotel again and am told to wait and accounting department will get back to me.  They are giving me the run around and now my bank is going to fight the charge.  Definitely beware if you need to cancel, even if it is within the cancellation period.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Location and a view,This is a pricey hotel but the views especially on the upper floors are amazing especially of the DIA rooftops. Check-in is easy and they store skis and boards in a convient area. The pool and hot tub were very relaxing also with expansive views. Nice place to stay for an early morning flight.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,All about the location.,"With a 5:30 a.m. flight out of DIA and considering a one hour drive plus parking etc. we decided to spend the night at the Westin. Yes it is pricy but a very well appointed room and cozy bed. Our view of the parking garage was not great, nut we weren’t here for the view. The room was quiet and comfortable and met our needs. The Grill & Vine restaurant met our needs and we enjoyed our meal. Bottom line - cozy and convenient, easy access to the terminal (out of our room and through security in under 15 minutes), quiet.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Billing Issue,"I have stayed here in the past and there is nothing physically wrong with the property.  However, I had the option to move some meetings around and potentially fly home early - negating my need for my room at this hotel.  Before I made that choice (to re-arrange my schedule), I called the hotel - 24 hours before my scheduled arrival - and asked if I could cancel without being charged.  I apologize for not knowing the rate rules off the topic of my head - that's why I called and asked.  I was told that it was no problem - my room was cancelled without any cost to me.  Then my credit card was charged for what I am guessing is the fully night plus taxes and fees (but no one sent me a bill so who knows what is on there).  I called the hotel's account department several times and no one ever answered the phone.  Instead, I received two emails back saying that I violated the cancellation policy and would not receive a refund.  I explained that I called and asked before I cancelled to avoid this very issue - and their response was ""you must have called the main reservations line, not the hotel itself.""  So no refund.  I'm incredibly frustrated.  I would not have made the choices I did if the hotel did not assure me that I would not be charged.I'm also very annoyed by the hotel's decision to not respond to me in person - both voicemails were met with a terse email back.  I'm in Denver frequently and this hotel is now on my banned list.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient Stop-Over at Airport,"I had an early-morning flight to the west coast.  The hotel is wonderfully convenient to the airport,  Get up.  Walk to the check-in counter.  The facility is quite new and offers quality rooms and amenities.  The views from the rooms are gorgeous.Check-in was very busy but the staff handled the crowd efficiently, minimizing the wait.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very nice hotel,"100’ walk from the terminal.  This is a really great place to stay,  no waits for a shuttle and when you want to go into the city, the light rail is right under the hotel.   Very quiet and located close to the eating establishments in terminal and in hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great,"The fact that this building is 100’ from the airport is hugh considering we had an early morning flight. The facility is enormous with several elevators and escalators and not much signage for direction. Locating the front desk was a task. The room with the pool and hot tub was beautiful with a view overlooking the airport and there was soothing music playing in the background.  There are 2 restaurants, both on the 5th floor. Our room was spacious with a great view of the runway. We would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A Bit Expensive but Def. Worth It for Convenience/Wonderful Night's Sleep,"The convenience of it being practically attached to the airport is unbeatable. The beds and pillows are soft and heavenly. Yes, the price is a little high, but the product, service, and convenience matches.The rooms are spacious. Tons of compartmental and storage space for all your things. Bathroom is luxurious with a shower that boasts a waterfall and 4 speed shower head, two lighted mirrors, one magnifying, and is spacious as well. Food at the Grill and Vine was a little pricey, but the food is delicious. Variety of options for meat eaters, vegetarians, vegans, pescatarians, and even those who don't drink (they had a few fun non-alcoholic drinks). Staff everywhere throughout this beautiful hotel were absolutely lovely and genuinely warm towards everyone. Definitely worth the money!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great! ,"I stayed here the night before a 5am flight because Denver was expecting a snow storm that night/next day. The room was great! My husband came to hang out for a while and brought our two small dogs. They had everything we needed (bed, bowls, even a toy). The staff were very friendly and accommodating when we checked in. We ordered room service, the woman on the phone was very helpful in making suggestions on some local ice cream selections. I loved the attention to detail, they even had a lavender essential oil roller to use for sleep that was small enough to carry on the plane! Great experience, would love to stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Dramatically Understaffed,"I am reminded of the old saying “first time shame on you, second time shame on me”.This is now the second time in 3 years my family has reserved 3 rooms at this hotel before an early morning flight the next day. I am compelled to write a review because our experiences both times have been similar, meaning it’s a pattern, not a one-off.Here is how it has gone, more or less, on both visits:1) We arrive around 5PM.  Despite a 12 Noon checkout time, the hotel does not have our rooms ready.  It’s 5PM!  You’ve had 5 hours since people should have checked out to get rooms ready.  The hotel line is the same:  “we’re completely full and people checked out late”.  Well, guess what, HIRE MORE HOUSEKEEPERS!!!  It’s not my fault you are completely full.  If I wanted to camp out in a sterile, crowded, semi-uncomfortable place, I would have just set my family up in the airport which is 2 minutes away.  At least I wouldn’t have to pay them and there would be more food options nearby.2) once you finally get checked in, you are on your own.  Sure, the hotel says they have lots of service options, but....NOBODY ANSWERS THE PHONE.  It takes 15 minutes of repeated calling to order room service dinner.  At least we ultimately got through for the room service that time.  The next morning, when we called, nobody answered so we just gave up.   And when my daughter woke up sick the next morning, and we wanted advice on where to find a doctor, nobody answered the phone then either so we again just gave up.  HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES SO SOMONE CAN ANSWER THE PHONE.In short, the service here is atrocious.  Everyone is perfectly friendly and nice, and promises the world,  but they just don’t have the resources to actually help you in any real way.  This would all be understandable at a cheap nightly rate, by the way, but this hotel is expensive!!  They have a captive audience because the Denver airport is in the middle of nowhere, and boy do they know it.There is a way to do an on-site airport hotel right, and this is definitely not it.  Travelers under time pressure and travel stress need more help, which should mean more assistance and more employees, not less.  I have had fantastic stays at airport hotels over the years, the best of all being the Sofitel at London Heathrow.  This hotel has a lot of room for improvement and a lot to learn.The positives here are the location (literally on the airport grounds, a 30 second walk away), the cleanliness and the rooms.  Those are all important, but for the cost, the service here is absolutely unacceptable and abysmal.  Keep in mind.  There ARE other hotels on the airport grounds, they are just further away requiring a shuttle bus.  But those are much much cheaper, and maybe next time we will opt for those, simply to avoid being stranded in an a hotel lobby at 5PM with hungry and tired kids, and so that I don’t get angry at how much we paid for such terrible service.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great location but for the price charged no excuse to not have a lounge,"Great location, good hotel restaurant, but the prices for food and drink are slightly cheaper at the new Tom's Urban Kitchen and Brewery restaurant, also under the hotel. The hotel restaurant ""Grill and Vine"" and Tom's are both located on the 1st floor (basement is train station, second floor is lobby for hotel with lobby bar). You can't beat the convenience and perhaps Westin knows it and charges for it more-so than most on airport hotels I have stayed at.  Airport security from lobby is 1 escalator and perhaps a 120 foot walk to the terminal with security line 20 feet from that door.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Near perfect stay,"Let me start out by saying this hotel is absolutely beautiful. The room was so cozy and inviting and the staff- from front desk to room service- were amazingly friendly. The lady that checked us in knew we were from out of town and visiting CO for the first time so she even did her best to make sure we had a room with a pretty view. The bed was one of the comfiest I have slept in and the room service food was tasty and delivered quickly. If you have an early early morning flight like we did, staying here is absolutely worth it for its convenience to the airport. Getting to the ticket counter was so quick and easy. Be aware that the bag drop located in the Westin, which is supposedly quicker than standing in line at the ticket counter to check bags/get boarding passes, doesn't open till 6. We planned on using this service but our flight left right at 6 so we were not able to. We were told when we checked in that it would be open even though we said our flight was at 6, but it wasn't. Not a huge deal but just something to keep in mind.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great location and service,"I had a good one night stay.  This is a great property for proximity to airport.  You roll out of front door and into airport security line.  Rooms were modern, sound proof, and clean.  Service was great.  Great for early morning flight.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience At A Cost,"With an early morning flight we thought we’d give the Westin a try.  You cannot beat the convenience and there are a number of eating options available both at the hotel and over in the airport. Check in was quick and easy and it truly takes two minutes to be in the security line at the airport.  We regularly pay a lot of money to stay in quality accommodation.  The Westin, though new and modern, seems overpriced- and I realize much of that is due to the convenience.  Our room was quite warm so we turned the thermostat down to 68 degrees - this caused the blower to stay on all night and it was extremely loud.  Needless to say neither my husband or I got much sleep. I’m not sure we would do this again.  We do love the Westin bedding!",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great location, aweful service","On the positive side, the hotel is a 20 second walk from the terminal.  It is new and clean and the rooms are nice.  As such, it is an incredibly convenient location.  The flipside is that they know that no matter how bad service is, they will still get traffic from people who choose convenience.  The check-in process can be excruciatingly long at times because they just don't have enough attendants manning the counter.  Employees have been trained to ask you how your day is going. Whenever you meet someone, they ask you how your day is going.  Unfortunately, it feels very mechanical and makes for an awkward situation at times because it feels so rehearsed.The service at the restaurant was appalling.  It took 90 minutes between the time when I sat down and the time when I left.  And in that time, all I got was a main and a drink.  Our waiter would disappear for 10 minutes at a time.  I didn't have desert because I hadn't budgeted for spending such a long time at dinner.The worst is that my company often organizes meetings at the Westin because everybody can easily fly in and out.  So I will have to go back even though I can't stand this hotel.  If you have a choice, just stay away.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great location,"This review promises to base its rating and comments on:Value for moneyRelates to the existing rating for the venueReflects why the venue was booked and if it lived up to the reason why it was chosenChosen for its location to the airport, it is a 1-minute walk to the terminal. Was value for money due to its location, cleanliness, helpful staff and we platinum members of this group and were treated accordingly.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice New Property - Extremely Convenient for Travel,"I've watched this hotel being built for the last few years, so I really wanted to stay here and check it out.  The property definitely feels new and the rooms reflect that.  It's BEYOND convenient if you have flown in late to DIA, or if you are flying out early in the morning.  It's a 2 minute walk across a pedestrian bridge to get to the security line, doesn't get much easier than that!  The staff were friendly, and there are a few decent food options in the hotel, which you need given the airport is a ways out of the city.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect place to stay for early morning flight,"We stayed here overnight as we had an early 6:00am flight out to Maui. We rode light rail out to the airport and it was incredibly convenient. We stepped off the train and walked a few steps to an elevator and took that directly up to the Westin lobby. The futuristic lobby has grand views of the main terminal at DIA. The room was modern, simple, and comfortable. We dined in the only open restaurant in the hotel, Tom’s Urban. In the morning, we were steps from the security line making this hotel a must for anyone traveling with small children and on a 6:00am flight.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Airport convenience and comfort,"For a business meeting, the convenience and comfort of this location is unmatched.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  The catered meeting food was excellent.  There also is the convenience of the rail station on the bottom floor, for a 1 hour trip to Denver's Union Station.  One drawback is the occasional whiff of airplane fuel in the ventilation system.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect hotel for the airport,The hotel is perfect for a fly in and fly out in Denver.  The place is new and very clean. You can easily walk to the airport from the hotel in less than 5 minutes. The beds are very comfortable.  The hotel has 2 restaurants downstairs.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Comfort for an early flight,"The Westin is not inexpensive, but the cost was offset with money saved on airfare with a VERY early morning flight. Check-in was a breeze. Our room was beautifully decorated, spotless, and the bed was comfortable. I enjoyed the lavender oil provided with our room, and took it with us on our vacation. Our sleep was interrupted only by thoughtless fellow travelers. A pox on anyone who feels the need to cackle and talk in a loud voice at 1 AM as they walk down the hall to their rooms. We would definitely stay at the Westin again if our future travel arrangements include a very early flight.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very Nice!,"Pros:  Right outside the terminal.  VERY nice hotel.  Staff is extremely nice and helpful.  Rooms are modern and well appointed.  Nice views and very quiet considering it is right on the airport.  Cons:  Get ready to pay for it, very expensive.  Restaurant is great but again, expensive.  Only real complaint with this hotel is the doors to the rooms.  I’ll never understand who designs and/or installs doors in hotels that can’t close quietly.  Wether it is a guest or housekeeping, the slamming of doors is VERY aggravating.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Clean crisp option steps from terminal,"Stayed 2 nights on business.   Extremely clean, modern room a few steps outside airport security.    Modern decor gives sterile feel.    Heavenly bed and rain shower so welcomed after brutal day of travel.    Very quiet.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,I love this hotel,"1 of the better airport hotels out there. The rooms are very comfortable, the gym is great as is the hot tub and lounge area. Their restaurant needs work (still) but that's not my problem. I would avoid 11th floor corridor leading to the gym as there were quite a few of us there early. Great spot and super convenient for those flights home.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great stay before morning flight!,"We stayed here the night before our family vacation, because of our early morning flight.  This was a great decision - it was convenient, clean, and a new hotel.  Check-in was a breeze and with my Platinum Premier status, we were upgraded to a nice suite for the night...making it very comfortable for the family of four.  We didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel, just the one night...but it was a great experience.  The room was updated (new), clean, and comfortable.  We would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing ,"The entire hotel is outstanding.The pool is dreamy with a great view, comfortable lounging. The restaurant (grill & vine?) $$$$ but yum.Lobby is superior.The room was perfect for 4 of us. (12th floor centerish) our view of the tarmac and planes was really neat.Also, the best part of waking up just minutes before check in - there aren’t enough words.Worth. Every. Penny.",5

"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,I always stay here when I have an early flight,"The fact that you can come out of the room, go down 2 elevators (its just how the building was built) and walk directly into security make staying here perfect for early morning flights.  All of my co-workers that come to the Denver area stay here the night before they leave as they don't have to mess with turning in the car and they can find several places to eat dinner between the hotel and the terminal.I live in Colorado Springs and if I have an early flight (pre-9AM) staying here the night before prevents me from getting stuck in traffic, having to wake up at 4 or 5 AM and I can make sure that I can get through security on time.The facility is great, though I don't use many of the amenities.  Staff is always extremely friendly and takes care of any questions/concerns that I have.  And, you can't hear the planes taking off/landing.  While this thing is connected to the airport, it is both well insulated and the planes are far enough off that you don't hear them.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Luxury after Flying!,Convenient in every way. Stellar front desk and sooo welcoming even though I’m not a member or frequent Westin/Marriott guest. Best bed ever. Beautiful view. Loved the lobby bar. It was worth the splurge!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,First Class all the way,After missing a flight due to Uniteds late arrival (my connection was late as well and at the gate but I wasn't allowed to board) i was forced to overnight in Denver.  Potentially i was scheduled to spend 24 hours in  the Denver airport i immediately booked my room at the Westin.  Walking distance and a truly outstanding experience.My check in was flawless and personable.  All of the accomodations are wonderful.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Lucked into a great hotel!,My family got the opportunity to spend a night here when our flight was cancelled.  Wow - we really enjoyed the wonderfully pleasant and helpful staff as we checked in and got situated .  The bar in the lobby had good food and drink for a place to wind down.  The room had a nice modern but classy feel.  Beds were most comfortable as well.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Expensive, but FIRST CLASS convenience.","I don't normally stay in an expensive place like this, but I also don't normally like to have to get through airport security lines prior to 6a.  The Westin at this location fit the bill.  The room was outstanding with views of the light rail pavilion, Pikes Peak and the Rocky Mountain front range.  A lounge and restaurant were also very convenient, offering views of the airport terminal and skaters on an ice rink down below.  My room was so comfortable, I still over slept a bit, but being just a short walk from the terminal allowed me ample time to not have to rush from security to my gate.I might need to win the lottery to be able to stay there again, but it is well worth the price.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Top airport hotel,"Nice situation if you have an early flight. Friendly staff, brandnew rooms with complimentary coffee and bottle of water. We get late check out for free. Appreciated. Overall Clean. We took dinner and breakfast in wine & grill. Was excellent. Only one point : we are still wondering what kind of westin 's CEO or other manager has decided to charge the wifi in 2019...very cheap feeling.. Put room' s price bit higher and offer wifi!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenient and comfortable for our ""dark thirty"" flight out",We chose this hotel due to it being literally connected to the Denver International Airport.  We had a flight out at 5:40 am and couldn't bare the ride from Northern Co at that hour.  This is a quality hotel - lots of attention to detail and good service.  We would stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Close to the action ,"On-site airport hotel with easy access to the Denver Airport. This is the best place to stay if you get stranded at the airport (like me) or have an early flight. Rooms are large and clean.  Restaurant, bar and Starbucks on premise provide all you need for your stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient and comfortable ,"This was our second stay as a family. We stay for the convenience, but appreciate the quality of this hotel. Getting through checking bags and security can be stressful enough, so I am thankful all we have to do is walk to the terminal. Having to leave a farther hotel, return a rental car, and wrangle with all our stuff would just super amp the stress level. I’m thankful that we have the means to stay here. The problem I foresee for families is that I’m pretty sure the hotel does not allow rollaways, so families of five with older elementary aged and above kids just won’t be able to fit well in one room. I realize this Westin’s target audience is not families, but many families may enjoy the convenience especially with morning flights. The walls seem to be nicely insulated (at least I didn’t hear any other closing doors and such). The lotion provided was too perfumed in my opinion.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Lunch at the airport ,"We were looking for a place to eat seeing as our plane was delayed and came across the Silver BulletThe food was good the bartender Roray was more intriguing. Today he was extraordinary  but a total stranger walked up to the bar he recognized him from Vail back in the day and called  him by name Tom, 1980 he has a talent for calling people by their first names but that was over the top. It was a conversation by the whole side of the bar. What a memory!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Modern clean and super convenient,You can walk to the terminal. There are brand new rooms. There is decent food in the restaurant. You even have a scenic view of planes landing at night. What else do you need from an airport hotel? They should have built this place years ago.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Modern & convenient - but service does not match,"Arrived in the evening into DEN and had to take an early flight out the next morning so chose to stay in the Westin following the great reviews here.Hotel is certainly convenient - literally less than a 2 min walk from the terminal building, is well lit, well sign-posted and easy to find.Very modern exterior complimented with an open plan interior with plenty of seating.Rooms are spacious and very well insulated from the aircraft noise outside, well appointed and modern with walk in showers and good selection of complimentary toiletries. Small coffee machine in the room useful and delivers an ok cup of early morning coffee.Main issue we had, was the hotel was extremely busy with families who had been skiing. The lines in the reception desks (only 3 people working with 2 of those handlingSPG Gold customers) were huge - we waited at least 30 mins to have a key provided and the signage for the SPG queue was not clear.Once we got to the room (around 8pm) we called down for room service to order salad - to be told of a minimum wait time of ""at least"" 2 hours. So I walked down to the restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel and bought take away food which came in less than 20 mins.Overall I would stay again purely for the convenience - but not expect anything in the way of service.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Property. Great Location. Helpful staff!!!!,"Stayed here on the way back from the mountains before a 6am flight. I was able to drop off the family (wife + 2 little ones) and get them checked in before returning the rental car. As I checked in I asked if they minded if I brought a cart up to the room to handle our luggage in the morning. (3 suitcases, a ski bag, 3 backpacks and 2 car seats) Instead, the front desk person scheduled a bellhop to come at 4:15am to help us get to the check-in line for our baggage. He brought us all the way into the terminal. This was enormous!  It is a beautiful hotel but I would have stayed here for this service alone. The big tip I gave the guys was more than worth it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Westin property ,"Love the location!!!Right at the airport, easy access to airport. Traveled with my family of 5, stayed after a ski trip. Love that you can use a hotel porter to help with bags to the terminal. Great food options as there are two restaurants on the bottom floor.Very clean, well run property. Will certainly stay again on trips to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Always top notch!,Fantastic hotel that knows how to take care of weary travelers.  As a platinum member with SPG and now Marriott I can’t say enough about how helpful and kind they are.  This particular trip included an interaction with a manager at the front desk named Sarah—perhaps one of the best yet! She goes above and beyond to make sure that guests are taken care of.  Can’t wait until our next stay!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,WAY kid friendly ... Great stop over if you need one!,"The hotel had a free ice skating rink right outside of the hotel (mid Dec - mid Jan) ... this was a super fun treat for the kids.  On top of that they had a great pool and hot tub that we took advantage of as well! We dropped our rental car off in the city to save $70 (rental company dropped us off at Union Station for free) . Grabbed a great lunch around the corner and then took the train into the airport.   Hotel entrance is even closer than the airport entrance!  Check in was a breeze... we got connecting rooms no problem....   We saw a lot of kids at the ice rink and a couple at the pool ... but the hallways were quiet and there were no out of control crazy kid groups ... so while family friendly it wasn't over run by them!Catching our flight the next day was a piece of cake!    Next time in Denver we will plan on catching an early flight and staying here again b/c it was just so easy and stress free.Room service was ok .... I know they want to offer ""healthy"" kid options ... but seriously ... you need to have plain noodles (not wheat) and either chicken nuggets or grilled cheese etc...  The choices were a little exotic for most kids I know ...  my guess is the kitchen gets a lot of special requests!  Next time we will plan ahead and look for alternative food options.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Horrible experience ,"I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. We booked a 2 room, 2 king suite and a deluxe 2 queen room. When we arrived we were told that the suite was no longer available but that they would put us up in rooms that would give us the same amount of beds. After spending 30 minutes getting new rooms and keys we arrived to our rooms to find 2 rooms with a king bed in each. We had to go Downstairs once again to explain that we are a family of six and need minimum of four queen beds. We are  a friendly family but dont want to share two beds!!!Second set of keys and reassured that we now will have 4 beds. This time they gave us a two queen room and a one king room. Once again we had to ask for the correct room and bed configuration. This time a manager assured us. No big surprise but again they gave us 2 rooms but with 3 beds total. At this time we gave up. We had a early flight and the younger kids are tired and need to get to bed.Worst booking and check in we have ever experienced. No on demand movies. Boring rooms. Only plus is the convenient location.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,So convenient and nice elegant hotel,"We had night to spend before skiing and it was great to just walk from baggage claim into the hotel. There was free ice skating and the hotel is elegant and reasonable.  Our room was very quiet, big and comfortable.  The Concierge was very helpful when our reservation was complicated.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Not bad if you need to stay at the airport,"Great location as the hotel is attached to the airport.  The rooms were just average as was the service.  We arrived at 10:00 pm and went to the Grill and Vine restaurant.  Terrible service!  The hostess was grumpy and didn't smile once. She indicated that it would take 5 minutes to setup a table which was odd because the restaurant wasn't full. While seated, I noticed that there were several tables that weren't cleared for ~30 minutes.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great - Once You Actually Find the Check-in Desk,"You would think that finding the only airport hotel at Denver Airport would be straightforward, but the Westin t Denver Airport is notable for both its lack of signage and some is leading signage.  For example, from the United Baggage Claim Area, there are no signs that indicate where the hotel is.  Once you exit the airport, at night and in the winter when there is a skating rink set-up, it is very easy to end up in the convention center rather than the hotel.  I mentioned my difficulty in finding the hotel to the lady who helped me check-in, and she groaned.  Clearly, this is a common occurrence.One other note, this is the only hotel that has ever asked me what time I planned on checking out.  I told them ""around 9am.""  Rather than have my room key de-activate at 12 noon, at the standard checkout time, my room key de-activated promptly at 9am.  So when I returned from breakfast at 9:05 to check-out and catch my flight, I could not get into my room!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Horrible Service,After arriving by car we were greeted by a bellman who INSISTED on taking our bags . We went upstairs to check in and were told it would be delivered to our room. After 30 minutes I called and was told “they would check on it” . After 45 minutes my husband went looking for it and got no satisfaction! He finally found someone had put it all in a CLOSET! We were told “ we were too busy” . This is unacceptable and ridiculous for this high $ hotel. We are platinum status with Marriott but will NEVER consider staying here again ! Beware,1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent Convienence -- Not worth the price tag,"The main draw of staying here is that the security line is right out of the front door. The price was high and the rooms were just typical Westin (maybe even a tad less than). The service was fine and the restaurant was severely overpriced. If you are a premium member, you can get a breakfast credit ($25/per person) but this didn't even cover the entire breakfast. Be sure to ask for the credit as it wasn't even offered to me at check-in.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A great and fun place to stay before an early flight.,"We had an early flight to Honolulu after a ski trip and were so pleasantly surprised to find this hotel.  Staff Great! View of Planes taking off into the Sunset priceless! Fitness Room really well equipped!  Swimming Pool nice and the best and strongest jets of any whirlpool that I can remember.  Plus, we went Ice Skating at the United Ice Rink for free (Tip the skate shoe people please) right outside the Hotel doors.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful Place to Stay!!!,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful. The rooms offer a fantastic view and are virtually sound proof. The amenities are great, the bed is very comfortable. Wonderful restaurants to choose from. Very comfortable and relaxing.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Yet another fine stay,"This time I found need for a stay at Denver between flights and wanted to use points for a nice experience.  It is good to be a Platinum Marriott member for times like this.  Once again I was treated like royalty with easy check in and upgraded to a huge suite on the top floor corner room with fantastic views of the run runway.  Had excellent dinner in the lobby bar.  Enjoyed early morning swim in the pool, scrumptious breakfast provided for Platinum.  Enjoyed not rushing to airport as I was already there, simply walked to the gate.  Nicely done once again DIA Westin!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Westin at Denver Airport,"This is a first-rate hotel located adjacent to the main terminal at Denver International Airport. Very short walk from the hotel into the Main Terminal. Rooms are modern, clean, and remarkably quiet, especially for being located next to the airport runways. The Denver metro light-rail station for the airport is located below the hotel, with trains serving downtown Denver's Union Station. Very convenient! Hotel restaurant has very good food and friendly service, and the grab-and-go coffee shop is a quick stop on the way out in the morning. If you have a really early flight out of DEN, it's quite convenient to stay in this hotel the night before, to avoid a super-early get-up and morning rush traffic, with the chance to miss your flight. Makes for a much more relaxed travel experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A nice treat after a long week,"After a very busy week, I checked into the hotel.  Check-in was smooth.  The lobby is beautiful with plenty of activity.  Rooms are well appointed, neat, CLEAN and comfortable.  Early the next morning, I checked out of the hotel, walked to the gate and caught a flight home.  It was a nice way to end a successful week.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Front desk staff at night was just awesome. ,"Last moment trip by my 19 year old daughter, 3 hours notice. She arrived at the Westin without a credit card, just had Apple Pay and cash.  The room was pre-paid by me online. Technically your supposed to present the credit card at booking. Whoops. ID, but no card. I called, they put me on a brief hold, asked a few questions to verify my identity and boom, she has a room. They could have been , in this day and age, sticklers for policy. Instead they were diligent but kind and common sense prevailed. You have a very loyal member that is even more happy to have chosen SPG. (I know, Marriott).And BTW it’s a very well thought out property and well worth the money. Talk about convenient!  Worth every cent.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Winter stay at Denver Intnl Airport Westin Hotel,Wonderful experience; Gorgeous Hotel  with immediate access to Air and Rail and Rental Car/Shuttle.The Hotel is Grand and the Restaurant and amenities are superb. This is where I will stay when In Denver,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Comfortable but can be noisy,"We ended up having to stay here by accident. Literally. Someone rear ended us on the way to the airport totaling our car. We managed to change our reservation to the following day but at a 6 am departure. Ugh! Positives are the staff was very friendly and helpful. Since we weren't planning to spend the night we had no toiletries which they took care of. The room was very comfortable. No complaints on the bedding, pillows or comfort. Negatives are since it is at an airport people are coming and going at all hours of the night. Which means you hear doors closing all night. Then unluckily a baby was in the room next door and his time schedule was not the same as ours. Then there's also the planes taking off all night. Which with the baby crying and the jets going off did not create an ideal experience. The beds were awesome though. We would stay there again in a pinch. It's rather pricey for the stay considering there's a plethora of hotels a short hop away. But for the convenience it might be right for you.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Awesome stay! ,I really had fun at this hotel even though I stayed for 2 nights. We were greeted with an room upgrade and a bottle of champagne and my kid received a toy toy airplane. The restaurants have great food choices and the have a brewery on site. Because it is Holidays season they had a few Elf on the Shelf hidden around the lobby and restaurants; when my kid found them the staff gave him a big chocolate bar. There is a complimentary ice skating rink outside between the hotel and the airport opened from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm. I was afraid I would here the planes from my room but I did not hear any noise at night coming from the airport. Great place to stay for business or family. Can’t wait to be back!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect location for traveling,"This is a perfect location for an early morning departure flight or a late night arrival. Our room was awesome, they have a fantastic fitness center, and the morning run they have two days a week was great! It was just me and the guide (I think her name was Sarah, but I don't remember exactly!), was wonderful! She was bubbly at 6:00am and made the run a lot of fun!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,So comfortable!,"This hotel is great to stay in for early morning flights out of Denver.  The staff are friendly and professional, the rooms comfortable, and food in the restaurant tasty. Best of all is the ease of waking up and walking the short distance to the airport!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent & Convenient,The hotel is connect to and part of the Denver Airport. It is singular in this regard. All other hotels are some distance from the airport. I had an early morning flight. I appreciated the fact that I did not wait for a shuttle to the airport. You walk from the hotel directly into the airport.The hotel's design is in keeping with the Denver Airport - sleek and modern. The rooms are well designed and attractive.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience and service,"The hotel was just a few feet from terminal so I could get to my room quickly after an  unexpected travel delay. Staff were helpful, it had a comfortable bed and room, and it was quiet. Exceptional room service.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Anniversary Stay,"What a wonderful stay at the Westin Denver International Airport. This was the first part of our 40th anniversary trip and what an experience!Ms. Sarah Beckner, Director of Rooms, was kind enough to upgrade us to an executive suite for this special occasion and what an experience. From beginning to end the staff left nothing to chance and took care of every detail. They were warm, engaging and friendly - customer service at its finest. Thanks you again Ms. Sarah for a memorable experience. A hearty well done to you and your team.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Surprisingly very quiet and comfortable ,"I recently had the please of staying at this Westin property. It was perfect. The hotel is clean, quiet, and beautiful. It is right outside the airport so no need for a shuttle. You just walk outside terminal and basically there you are. They had an ice skating rink set up too, with free skates. You have access to the train that takes you right into downtown. It’s a nice place to stay in comfort and ease.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"SO convenient and nice place to stay, but not up to Westin Standards",Great location when you have an early flight the next day but check in is SLOW and lay out is not great when dragging luggage around.  I waited 15 min to check in at Platinum counter and normal line was probably 30 min.  Only 2 people helping check in and they were SO SLOW.  Digital key is not working so check in at counter is required.  Needs to have airline baggage check in within hotel available and the one on transportation level is not convenient.  Coffee shop on first floor might not be part of hotel but it is also SLOW.  1 server at 6 in the morning when there are 5 people in line does not work.,2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Convenience... At a Cost,"Super luxurious and have zero complaints... aside from the price, which is expected as everything at airports is expensive. Loved the place, but could have done without the exorbitant price. Probably worth it if you have an early morning flight or if money is a non-issue.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Easy and fast check-in, attentive and personable front desk staff, very expensive room service ","Convenient location and in-house Starbucks (2 minutes walk to Terminal) and very attentive great service makes this our choice hotel for early flights out of Denver. While the rooms are generous in size and well insulated, we could still (muffled) hear the announcements from the airport next door. Our Marriott status was recognized immediately and we received a room upgrade - nice!!We were tired and ordered room service; $120 for two light meals and one drink seemed very steep and the quality of the tuna received did not nearly match its price. Our recommendation is to dine elsewhere.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A Jewel of Denver Airport,"Four Diamonds by AAA, but 5 star by me. Our hotel experience was top notch and could not be beat. Our flight was delayed by 3 hours so I was nervous we would be a no show. I called and they held our room even though they were sold out. Upon checking in at 2am, the front desk was very thorough, and answered all of our questions. We reserved a Junior Suite as my son wanted to see the runway. Beautiful room, well appointed, and floor to ceiling windows made for a great experience. The room was large, and very clean. The bed was amazingly comfortable and linens were fresh and clean. Kudos to an excellent hotel. Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Pricey But Well Worth It!,"While a bit pricey, the Westin at DIA has some of the most comfortable beds ever, a relaxing pool, decent views, and incredible service!  When they found out we were there for my boyfriend's birthday they had chocolate covered strawberries sent up the room with a card.  What a special touch!  I'd highly recommend a stay here!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Stayed twice last month and it keeps getting better!,"We’re regulars at the Westin DIA and the experience gets better every time! Last month, we stayed there twice, each time before early morning flights the next day. We live in Denver and an overnight stay makes the travel day less stressful. It’s like your vacation starts a day earlier! Having stayed there so many times since it has opened, it’s really cool to be greeted by someone like Isabelle or Lilia at check-in, with a friendly “welcome back” and “we have one of your favorite rooms reserved for you”. And sometimes even a hand-written note from someone in the Front Office. Incredible customer service!Check-In Tip: Most of the times, the front desk is well staffed to keep lines to a minimum. But if you happen to get there during a rush, like when the airline crews are checking in, just head over to the lobby bar. Order a drink from the friendly bartenders like JP/Jean Paul and relax a bit until the line goes away.If you get there in time for dinner, stop by the restaurant (Grill & Vine), take a seat at the bar and say ‘hi’ to Michelle, Julie, Todd or the rest of the gang.We’ve already booked our next stay for December and can’t wait to get back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing,The location is perfect if you are flying.  It is at the airport.  The rooms are nice.  The front desk staff is great.  The room services is fun and different.  The pool is great and the gym is better.  If you are not flying in or flying out there is no reason for you to stay here!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,excellent airport hotel,We had a fly in for east and west coast people. This hotel was ideal. Excellent room service available for late arrivals. Comfortable bedding. Perfectly clean bathroom. Very quiet room - I heard no sounds from flights overhead and slept very well. Meeting rooms were spacious especially well catered - thank you for making that so comfortable for the road warriors! I would definitely support this option for meetings that needs to accommodate people from various time zones. It was a blessing to be within steps of the airport and have such a relaxing environment.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice but colorless,Perfect place to stay the night before an early flight. Nice restaurant and big clean rooms.I will definitely stay there the next time I play out of DIA. The over feel is cool and lacking ambience. The breakfast is excellent.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Ultra modern convenient hotel at the airport,"Hubby and I stayed at the Westin when travelling with handicapped couple.  We found the hotel to be extremely convenient  when flying out  of Denver; While it was pricier than other options,  everything about the hotel more than made up for it. The people at the front desk changed our booked rooms to be more accommodating to our special needs; the valet came and  took our baggage right to the ticket counter and then accompanied us with the  wheelchair to  the TSA portal. Our room was very spacious, clean, comfortable and  the amenities were  luxurious.  My only  concern is that the  bed was too high for oyur handicapped traveler to get into",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Comfort and convenience!,"Can’t beat the location if you have an early flight out of Denver—walk into the terminal. Really comfortable room and bed, high-quality bed linens, good size bathroom (shower only), very good food from room service for dinner and in the restaurant for breakfast. Only negative was a pretty long wait for check in— only two people at the desk, one embroiled in an evidently  intractable problem with a family, the other answering endless questions from one lucky  customer and oblivious to waiting guests, including a mother with two exhausted-looking toddlers. Finally a third person emerged to check the rest of us in, none too soon. Higher staff availability to fill in at the check-in desk during busy times might be a good idea. Mentioned this to the desk staff this morning and they say that was a very unusual situation so I am not dinging the overall rating—really enjoyed every other aspect of my stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Hotel Bad restaurant.  ,"This hotel should get a 5 but the restaurant was so poorly run the hotel doesn’t deserve an overall rating any thing but a week 2. The hotel rooms were wonderful especially Johnathon at the front desk. I really felt welcome and he was especially helpful. My wife was there for a meeting that she was directing. Johnathon took the time to insure all the rooms she booked were ready and ADA approved as this was a meeting that United Airlines was hosting for disabled passengers, their spouses and their board. Thank you Johnathon. The hotel should be proud of you. Now the restaurant was a disgrace. The first morning the serve did not take are order for 25 minutes. Then it took another 20 minutes to be served and the food without exaggerating was cool and unappetizing. The server’s comet was this happens all the time. I asked to have our order redone. He did  and it took another 20 minutes. We sat down at 8:15 and finally finished 10:10 am. Second and third mornings not any better except this time it only took a little over an hour. The fourth day, the day we checked out was the worst of all. The chef, and three managers were having breakfast. The server was very attentive to them and did not pay any attention to us until I got her attention. After 15 minute wait she took our order. No coffee was offered so I had to get up and go to the bar and help myself and brought this back to my table. This was in front of the chef and managers. I then understood why the restaurant was so poorly serviced since the chef and managers did nothing to direct the staff or help to insure a well run restaurant. I would suggest training the staff but I would be wrong, start with your managers. They are in desperate need of coaching. Maybe you could use Johnathon to teach what service is all about.  The front office seems well run. The desk clerks smile and seem happy to accommodate your guests. Where as your restaurant personal and manage do not smile or acknowledge your guest. As the General Manager you are allowing this to happen.  You should be ashamed if you allowed this to be part of your hotel company’s policy.  Spend some time in your restaurant and see for yourself!",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Absolutely wonderful experience!! ,"This is nothing short of a fantastic hotel experience. After a brutal day of travel and abuse by Southwest airlines we were put in a hotel across town that was completely unacceptable. We picked up the phone and called the Westin at the Airport. Isabell, an amazing hospitality diva listened to our situation and got a room for us at a distressed passenger rate. Upon check-in Kevin delivered gracious and aggressive hospitality. He found us the perfect room and made us feel wonderfully welcome after a very tough day. Our room was stunning and well appointed. Then about five minutes after we checked and a wonderful guy named Breanden appeared at our door with positively delicious milk and fresh chocolate chip cookies. They were sent by Isabell to us after our very hard travel. What an amazing, unexpected gesture !!  This is an outstanding hotel option at DIA and  for any guest stay in the Denver area. The property is beautiful and incredibly quiet. Seriously we didn’t hear a single plane even though they were right outside our door. All in all fantastic hotel experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Comfy,Great to be close to the airport for an early morning flight. Easy to get to the loading areas. Very comfortable accommodations. Good selection of food for vegans. Transportation for Budget Rent-a-Car was very helpful.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Milk and Cookies,"One of my executive team members and I were traveling on business from Seattle to Tulsa. Our flight got delayed 2 hours in Seattle, which meant we would miss our connection in Phoenix. When in Phoenix, they told us they would route us through Denver and they would hold the plane for us....but they didn't hold the plane. No flights out to Tulsa for the rest of the night. Southwest gave us a hotel voucher and sent us to an unsavory property (with ripped curtains and goo on the walls and tape on the bathtub - yes, seriously - and unlocked windows to roof access...I can't make this stuff up - and we just COULD NOT stay there and feel safe...I didn't even want to touch the bed) - Instead, we called the Westin and Isabell let us know that they would take care of us! We took an Uber back to the Westin at the Airport and begged for mercy and grace with Kevin at the front desk. He gave us a distressed passenger rate and gave us an upgrade to a business queen room because they had availability. We loved the white tea scent as we walked into the property. As I was putting on my Westin robe, about to fall into bed, someone was knocking on the door. It was Breanden with milk and cookies (I KNOW!!) - He had gotten word form Isabell that we had not had a great travel experience!! I'm telling you - that...these three employees made what was a very bad experience into a story to tell!  I am now sitting in my heavenly bed at midnight writing this post so I could be sure and tell you how this team went the extra mile! Thank you Westin for your excellence in customer service!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A+ for Most Convenient Location,"Located adjacent to DIA's main terminal, the Westin DIA is the perfect place to stay if arriving late or departing early. The A line train is $9 from downtown to DIA.  The hotel's design is modern and unlike an other hotel anywhere.  Wasn't there long enough to experience bar, restaurant, fitness facility or pool. Rooms are typical Westin, which is fine. Surprised that a newly built hotel wasn't more sound proof. Could here airport operations, room to room noise and some motor-like something that churned all night.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"MESSED UP BILL, Called 5 Time & STILL NOT RESOLVED!","I paid for 2 rooms on the same exact night, checked in at the same exact time for the same room type. I was charged $78 more for one room. I called the hotel when the bill arrived. I spoke with Hannah and she assured me the the account manager would credit me back the overage that was charged. I  called Hannah 2 times since it was never credited, no luck with her.  Then I spoke with Dustin 2 times, he also assured me that it was being done, on the second call to him, he told me that they put it thru on September 24th ( its now October 26), nothing has been done.  On my 5th call I spoke to Jason, he looked into it and actually called me back with a voicemail and assured me that the credit was being processed, nothing! Hannah told me from the beginning that a man named ""Vernon Conat"" was in charge of this and taking care of it. WARNING To ALL who stay her, check your bills, they do not HONOR what they tell their guests. Shame on you WESTIN DIA.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Sarah Becker , Manager","I've worked for Marriott for more than 25 years and I was able to book a room at the Westin at the Denver International Airport. I stayed there from Sept 14- 16 and my stay would have been a disappointment if not for Ms Sara Becker. She was so very nice and accommodating and even thanked me for my years of service with Marriott. I had forgotten my Quarter century id in New York and I was so worried because I know I  have to present it at checkin. Ms Becker turned things around and took care of everything. Thank you so much, Ms Becker! You made my stay stress free and one of best stay I've had in a Marriott. You are one of the best and thank you for treating me like gold. God bless you!! I hope to repay your kindness in the future!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,NA,I recently stayed at the Westin in Denver. It was so nice to be able to grab my bag and walk right into the hotel with no transportation hassles. Accommodations were excellent. Would definitely recommend!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A Westin is there when you need one!,There's nothing like arriving after a long delayed flight knowing that you will be sleeping in a Westin bed for the night. Amazing breakfast and lots of spaces to lounge and catch up with the days news. Outdoor terrace is a welcome place to relax sipping a coffee. A few minor niggles with the app but we were taken care of by the wonderful associates.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great location for an early flight.,"We stayed at the Westin Airport hotel because of a very early flight.  We arranged our check in for 9pm and had a full day in Boulder.  We checked in, brought our luggage to the room and went to return the car.  Walk through the courtyard in the morning and you are in the airport.  So easy.  We also ordered room service, pricey but delicious.  The checkin staff was very courteous, and the room was very comfortable and very clean.  Very comfortable bed.  The actual room was a little more then I would have liked to spend but for the convenience to the airport for a early flight, it was worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Stylish and convenient,"No Brainerd if flying in or out of Denver, especially if you have an early morning flight. Literally 30 second walk from hotel to security. I could not believe how quiet the rooms were. We also ordered room service and everything was good. Only slight downside was the room was already showing some slight wear on the bathroom fixtures and the furniture. I would recommend this to anyone. Also, was very surprised how long the airport security lines were before 6AM.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Clean & Convienent,"Newer Westin hotel which is basically connected to the airport. Great for the late arrival early departure traveler.  There is a bar area in main lobby where many travelers like to congrugate.  There is an, in hotel, Starbucks, but does not offer Starbucks fare though breakfast sandwiches are available.  A nice detail is the multi-use outdoor seating.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Walking distance to the terminal, too expensive ","A cool hotel, with a neat bar (but small tv) is great for the business traveller who has a super early flight. We were flying out at 6am. However, the cost is incredibly high. This is not a 5 star hotel. $350+ for one night when I booked. It will be interesting to see the pricing strategy when the new Marriott opens down the road in December.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful quiet hotel ,"The lobby area is a bit cold and loud with the open bar being right next to check in, my room was clean, quiet and very comfortable.  So convenient to baggage claim.  Not your typical airport hotel.  Great breakfast too.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect start to a vacation,"Booked one night's stay with our children before an early flight the next day --  not only avoiding travel hassles the next morning but an enjoyable start to our vacation! Front desk staff was super friendly- upgrading us as Starwooid Gold members to a very cool corner room our children loved, restaurant was yummy and kid friendly- and the indoor infinity pool before bedtime was treat. We will do it again a future trip!  Thank you, Westin DIA!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Incredibly convenient, and with great views","My family had a great quick stay here.  It helped that as a Platinum member I was upgraded to a 1BR corner suite - it is hard to beat views of the whole airport and a separate room for the kids to sleep in.  Food was high quality with a good selection of healthy and hearty.  Not much reason to go here unless you are going to the airport, but this was the nicest on-airport hotel I've stayed at.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Stay for a Redeye flight,"The Westin Hotel was an excellent overnight stay for a last minute flight into Denver with an early flight out into Riverton Wyoming. Check in was a breeze. Early breakfast in the hotel was fabulous and we got through security and to our gate for the flight into Wyoming in plenty of time. Accommodations were comfortable, service was great and there was no shuttle to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenient, expensive, cuts corners","Nice hotel, room, but toilet paper and tissues very cheap, WIFI $15 a day.  When paying over $300 a night, expect more.  Had paid additional fee for breakfast but had great difficulty getting them to acknowledge it.  Restaurant was very kind and took my word for it.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,My boss loved the service he received!,"My boss just got back from a business trip in Denver, CO. He had nothing but great service provided by Natasha McCoy, Front Office Supervisor at Westin Denver International Airport. Natasha went out of her way to make his stay great! The service she provided was above and beyond. Thank you for leaving a great impression on my boss!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Thank You Alma!,"I have seen this beautiful hotel - the ONLY one on the Denver International Airport property - for years, and I was truly excited when my wife finagled a free night stay when we had an early morning departure October 8th. I was expecting a ""luxury"" hotel, but discovered it was more like a Wyndham than a Westin. Older carpet in the hallways and rooms with a heavy musty smell, escalators that were out of service, and no real dining options available. The WORST was dinner where the hostess insisted on sitting my wife and I at a 2 foot by 3 foot table for 2 when there were several larger tables all around us. We asked for one of the larger tables and were given a definitive NO by this very rude hostess. Give someone a menu and a seating chart, and they believe they rule the world. Immediately after we were seated, this same hostess sat a party of 2 at the very same table we had just indicated we wanted. My wife had to talk me down - I wanted to raise hell, but she has a way to calm the beast within - I let it go. My wife ordered an $18 glass of wine (one of the lower priced options), and I ordered an $18 vodka and cranberry served in a 6 oz. rock glass - finished it in 3 sips and stuck with water the rest of the way. We split a pork chop that was ordered medium, but served charcoal - totally inedible. So, all we had so far was a salad each and 2 bad bites of burnt pork. The manager comped the entree and suggested a peach cobbler dessert that was delicious. I ordered an ice wine called Inniskillin (I think - another $25 for 3 oz), and my wife thoroughly enjoyed it. When we asked our waiter for another, he said,""That was the last of the Inniskillin, if we want more, we would have to go some where else"".The ONLY reason I give this Westin 2 stars was because of Alma, our waitress at breakfast the next morning. Alma was a breath of fresh air after our horrible dining experience the evening before. She was friendly, helpful, and maybe a mind reader, because she was one of the best servers we have ever had. Thank you for a wonderful breakfast experience Alma!",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience,"Although it appears very fancy, it is your typical overpriced airport hotel. The convenience of being connected to the airport would be the only reason to stay. Checkin can be inconvenient because of the lines at the counter.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Disappointing Denver Hotel,"We prepaid $299.00 for a night at the Westin Hotel at Denver International Airport. Our flight was delayed and we arrived at the hotel at 22h25. There was a queue of seven people in front of us and three hotel staff at reception. It took them 35 minutes to book us in. Not good.Our room on the eighth floor was clean and neat but the toilet gurgled loudly off and on at random intervals all night and the old fashioned explosive door closures woke us at 05h20. We awoke unrefreshed. The only good thing was that we were awake as our wake-up call was 15 minutes late. Not good.The next morning there was no place in the hotel where we could have breakfast and we were compelled to order room service. $76.00 for two fried eggs, soggy bacon and the worst scorched English muffin I have ever been served, plus a flask of hot water and tea bags x 2. I was taken aback until my wife later pointed out that in the smallest of small print at the very foot of the page in the menu, 24% is added as a room service, service charge. I thought this slight of hand was very poor as the next morning we had the same breakfast in Crested Butte for $19.00. These events soured our stay. Not good.The hotel is very conveniently situated for flights to and from the airport but, given our experience, we will probably book one of the many good hotels close by and save about $120 even taking the cab fare into account.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,great for overnite stay for AM flight,"My room was upgraded to a room on 14 floor, free internet, very large room, and a rain shower in bathroom. The view faced north of airport with views to west and east also. Enjoyed watching takeoffs and landings, Great mountain view.  Checkout available by phone. In morning it is just a short walk to the security area for your flight. No shuttles, you are there. Also you could not hear any airport noise at all. Enjoyed the convenience of it very much. Lovely room and service. employees very nice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Quick stay before early morning flight,"The room was gorgeous, the facilities were excellent. The service is impeccable.  But it was a very short stay.  Convenience cannot be overrated, a short walk to the security lines if you've no bags to check and have your boarding pass.  Slightly longer walk to United check in but very convenient.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful clean room near restaurants & shopping,"Nice area, we enjoyed our stay! Great breakfast & comfortable room with a great view of the mountains. Helpful staff, & valet was excellent.  Few minutes walk to restaurants & shopping. We stayed for only 1 night but if we knew how comfortable the room would be...sectional couch & kitchen with separate bedroom additional TV we would've stayed longer. Enjoyed our stay; clean room & private.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient on aiport hotel with a touch of luxury,Excellent boutique hotel on airport so very convenient when you've just arrived on a long flight. Finding the entrance into the building is challenging but you can take your airport cart in the lift and then leave it when checked in. The reception is upstairs and very minimalist.Our room looked out over the sails of the airport roof and it was very comfortable and well sound proofed. Expensive when you consider breakfast is not included and that is also a little pricier than usual but the food was good. There are a couple of eateries on site.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Just up the escalator!,"This hotel is positioned right next to the airport and, for two tired travellers arriving very late at night, it was so easy to access.The receptionist was efficient and helpful and we were in our room in no time. The room was clean, quiet and everything worked.Breakfast was served downstairs and was very good. The check-out was quick and efficient- and off we set to pick up the car and set out on our ""Western Adventure""",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Nice rooms, poor dining service and wifi","We just had dinner downstairs in the dining area. Very slow service, but good food. I'm sorry but for $300 a night they really should provide Wi-Fi. They want another $15 4 Wi-Fi. This is a non repeater for my perspective. It is just as easy and much cheaper to stay on one of the many hotels on Tower Road",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great stay...,"This is a follow-up review from my initial stay at this property last year. To say that this hotel is convenient to DEN airport would be an understatement. It couldn’t be more convenient unless the jetway of the airplanes opened up to it. The decor has a pleasant modern feel and clearly kept up well. Now that Marriott and Starwood merged rewards memberships, I vaulted to SPG Platinum status and received a room upgrade upon check-in. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The furniture is rather basic and mundane but in good repair. Train service to downtown Denver is but a few steps away from the lower level.  Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The 'brand new' top place to stay at Denver International Airport,"This Westin feels brand new and probably is, and is just a few paces from the terminal, making it perfect for overnighting between flights.  It's sleek and well-run, though a bit pricier than other airport options given its optimal location.  The fresh hotel rooms are perhaps too cookie-cutter in the current Westin style, but I couldn't complain overall. Staying here made my life a little easier that night and the following morning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,September get away,Cannot beat location if flying in late or leaving early.  Lobby was beautiful.   Restaurant is fairly good but pricey for breakfast.   Rooms were just ok but clean and comfortable.   Pretty view from the pool area.  Nice workout facilities.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Bad service... 2 star service,I just vhecked in for two nights I waited 2 hours for my room and then got something else. The desk clerk Eliezer? Was less than caring. I could get the room I wanted if I came down and waited more. Never coming back go downtown to a nice hotel,1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,My Westin Denver Connection,"This is my first time flying into Denver. I fly win and spent the night until the next morning. I loved that I was able to walk through the airport right to my hotel. Nice hotel if I may add. With a nice covered, lounging area between the terminal and the Westin high five on creating the passenger experience. As I walked into the hotel and up to the lobby area I was taken away by the decor. Very upscale, modern and chic. Greeted with fruit-infused water that I enjoyed throughout the day. There is a restaurant, pool and fitness center on-site. It may have been lazy of me but after I checked in and got to my room and cut on the TV, I watched an hour of SPG Moments. Thank you for sharing, different, scenes, hotels and stories of places and travelers. It was very interesting. I also loved the ease to walk down the escalator of the hotel, pay to hop on the light rail ($9 roundtrip) and enjoy the sites, scenery and take in the new fresh air of Denver Colorado. I took the light rail all the way to Union Station and loved hanging out there for brunch and uptown on a Saturday afternoon. I was able to enjoy the Farmers Market and hopped on the free train going up and down 16th Street Mall. So if you are ever in Denver for a quick trip, choose Westin! #spglife #spgmoments",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One of the Best Airport Hotels,"I have stayed at several airport hotels, like most people for convenience, and this is the best I have seen.  Of course it isn't cheap, you are paying for location.  That said the hotel is comfortable, clean and very welcoming and helpful staff.  Our room was high up with great views, large and very comfortable bed.  The swimming pool, on the 11th floor, has views over the plains and has loungers to enjoy the view.  In the morning it was a leisurely stroll across to the terminal and for domestic flights you can check baggage in the ground floor of the Westin so you don't even have to drag that arround.  We had dinner and it was very good. Would definitely use this hotel again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience and Luxury,"Out of convenience (a 7am flight) we chose this airport location and are so glad we did. We stayed in one of the 14th floor suites with amazing views of Denver, the Rocky Mountains, and the airport activities.  The room design and decor is modern and fresh, and the amenities luxurious. The signature Heavenly Bed is just that-heavenly. We checked in early and were pleased to enjoy the outdoor lounge and craft beer tasting complete with live music. The gym is well-equipped and pool and jacuzzi did not disappoint. At dinner time we opted for room service, the staff were accommodating and the food tasty and served hot. Best of all, a short elevator ride and a quick walk into the airport, made an early morning check in convenient, fast, and easy. This was a perfect finale to our vacation and a new tradition in our annual trek to Colorado - although we may try for a later flight next year to extend our stay just a bit!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A great place for a layover,"The Westin is adjacent to the Denver Airport; maybe 5 minutes from the baggage claim area.It is a modern, very clean hotel.  Tje desk staff eas great. Gave me a food voucher for my birthday!Our room was spacious,  extremely clean and quiet. Exceptionally comfortable beds, too.The onsite restaurant and coffee stand are very good. We had a nice lunch at the restaurant.  Try the Bison Reuben. Inside the airport is a subway restaurant and airport restaurant.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Silence!,"Weather caused me to be delayed which resulted in missing my connection on the last flight home of the night. Rebooked on a 6am flight i knew I didn’t want to get far from the airport.  I was able to get a room at the Westin, assuming it would be noisy because it it at the airport.  I did not hear one single airplane the entire time I was there!  I was very pleasantly surprised. Of course the bed was heavenly and the room was very nice.  The hotel is quiet, well appointed and I’m so glad I finally sprung to stay there.  I highly recommend for a layover in Denver or an early flight!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Treated like royalty!,"Easy check in, was treated to upgrade in enormous suite.  Outstanding view of runway activity as well as the mountains. Excellent pool and work out area.  Enjoyed the lobby bar and restaurant for dinner.  Platinum is treated to breakfast, yummy omelette.  Over all extremely clean, quiet and comfortable.  It's apparent there is a showdown between Marriott and Hilton for frequent guests.  They are keeping each other on their toes.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Denver Airpot ,"Super a great hotel beautiful decore and very comfortable. The restaurant fair to good better stay with simple items.

"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A modern Oasis at the DEN airport with a view,"I stay there about once a quarter whenever I have early morning flight out of DEN. I do fly often to Denver.THis is by far one of the best airport hotel I have stayed at: modern, sleek, right next to the TSA line, god gym and restaurants.And nice views of the runways without the noise.Did I mention it is close to the train (RTD) as well?",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful and Fun Terrace to Lounge At,"In between Denver International Airport and the Westin Hotel ( probably the most architecturally stunning design of a hotel you've seen in a while....) is a casual, airy and hip open space to lounge at before starting that security line. It was my first time here and out of all the times I fly a month, I'm shocked I've never seen or been to this place--- it's a haven! From cornhole, to live music, to 'Colorado-esque' wooden tables, and a perfect breeze to soak in before you cram in those tiny airplane seats.... This place is Amazing! You just stroll right through from either the lightrail dropoff or from the door by security . Super easy and laid back---- it's also a phenomenal place to catch a Denver sunset before heading to Union Station for a delicious dinner via the lightrail. All in all, a wonderful addition to DIA-- thank you Westin Hotel! For more tips in Colorado, follow me on Instagram @wildflowerwanders_ ... Cheers!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing Hotel,"We recently stayed here for 1 night prior to an early flight out of Denver.  This hotel is amazing- architecturally gorgeous & the hospitality/amenities/location are all wonderful.  It is new, clean, spacious & designed to allow you to get a great sense of space & relaxation.  The views from everywhere are amazing and it's so much fun to watch the airport/planes/traffic/trains along w/ some fantastic views of the surrounding plains, mountains, & downtown Denver.We had our kids w/ us & this hotel is comfortable for families.  The rooms are spacious and not cluttered at all.  The pool is fantastic and your kids will have a ball swimming with views of the airport & planes!  The staff is very courteous, knowledgeable, professional, & kind.  We checked in early & Lise Marie at the front desk was able to accommodate our timings and even upgrade our room to one on the top floor.  We ate at Grill & Vine for dinner and the food & service were again, wonderful.  A great way to end our vacation in Colorado/the Rockies.  While there is direct access to the main terminal of Denver International Airport, my only issue would be that it would have been nice to be able to access the restaurants/shops in the terminal while we were there.  It's just a nice option to have.  However, there is an area outside the hotel between it & the main terminal where you can relax outdoors- sit & lounge, play bean toss, badminton, & people watch. One of the best advantages of the hotel is its location- since you are just across from the main terminal, it's a simple walk across the next day to check in & be on your way. We would definitely splurge for another stay at this hotel on a return trip & recommend it highly.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Easy way to catch an early flight from Denver,The new Westin Denver International Airport is a beautiful hotel with amazing amenities.  The hotel's gym is the nicest I have ever seen.  The pool area is exceptional as well.  What I was most impressed with was the comfort of the bed and pillows.  AND how quiet the room was considering it is right at the airport.Great place to stay!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent property; expensive but worth it,"Got stranded overnight unexpectedly at DIA due to missed flight connection. This property is literally a 30 second walk from the terminal. We had no luggage, but they happily supplied us with all sorts of complementary toiletries, etc.  Room was large, spotless, quiet, nicely furnished. Had a fabulous server at the house restaurant -- Robert R. This hotel turned a lousy day into a pleasant evening. Will certainly return, hopefully not by accident.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,AMAZING GUEST SERVICES TEAM,Angie Rodarte the front desk manager was amazing. The entire staff was extremely helpful but Angie went above and beyond to make this special 25th Anniversary one my sister will never forget.Thanks Angie,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very nice and convenient!,Very nice room and the convenience of the terms nail so close by was the reason for our stay as we had an early flight.

"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great Location, typical room, great front desk","I had a flight delay that landed me in Denver. The Westin is just a few feet from the airport. For the stranded traveler, this is an amazing location. 10 minutes from gate to room. It is a typical Westin, nothing new to report other that it was a very nice hotel. My front desk person, Alexis, was great. She recognized my status but also, more importantly, could tell I was tired and having a long day. She booked me an upgrade, handed me a drink coupon, and went out of her way to welcome me. Thanks!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful new hotel!,Hotel is new and perfect in every way.... only thing missing in king bedded room is phone by the bed.All else including room service is 5 stars!Staff very courteous Cooling wonderful Very convenient to DIA terminals,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Surprisingly okay,"One rarely thinks of an airport hotel as being anything more than a place to lie down when you're there on business (as I was) or in transit. I arrived late after multiple flight cancellations and delays, and there was a restaurant still open and people about in the lobby. I wouldn't necessarily say to stay here if you want to see Denver, but it's definitely a very viable option. And since it's literally across a courtyard from the airport, extremely convenient. (You can get a glimpse of lovely blue sky there, too, if you're stuck in a meeting!)",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Take some hints from a Lifetime Platinum Elite,"9.1-9.2.18Westin Denver International  Cool 😎 building shaped like an airplane wing. Nice hotel terrible shower, why does anyone think rain shower heads with no pressure, no water volume are something a business guest wants? No in fact we want a shower head that delivers pressure and actual water volume. Someone at SPG should take a hint as loyal biz customers want a great shower and a biz guest loathes rain shower heads. Built 2015, modern FFE, I like the hotel but if I come back again and it still has rain shower heads with low pressure and no water volume we will not ever return.I am Lifetime SPG Platinum Elite VIP with over 1,000 nights my business is valuable hope someone is listening as if not you will lose customers like me.Nice hotel otherwise.the Doctor Hit me with some BIG LOVE ❤️💕 and a helpful VOTE!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best Place to Get Stuck for a Night,My flight into Denver was delayed so I missed my connection & needed to stay overnight in Denver. I splurged and stayed here rather than taking a shuttle to an off-site airport hotel. It was totally worth it!  The staff was lovely. Room service had tons of gluten-free options for me to eat in the middle of the night. The room was exceptionally modern and clean. (I kinda wish I could’ve spent more than ten hours here!),5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,First Class Hotel With Prices To Match,"A luxury hotel right at the Denver Int'l airport.  We booked it because we had an early flight.  It's expensive but it beat trying to navigate driving in the dark to this complex airport from an off site motel, a rental car return and an airport check-in - all before 6 AM.  We were impressed with all aspects of this hotel.  The room was great and the service polite and professional.  The sheer convenience of staying here the night before our flight took some of the sting out of the expense.   An outdoor, covered veranda area had seating and even several corn hole boards for guests, a nice touch.  We were lucky enough to get an upgraded room where the bedroom was separated from the living area.  It was one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Or felt transit hotel connected to DEN,"Stayed here one night for an early departure.  The hotel is connected to DEN near the baggage claim belts.  Check in was a breeze.  As SPG gold, i was upgraded to a deluxe room with a view of the iconic DEN “snow-capped rood” The room was large, quiet and had excellent amenities.The perfect hotel to stay at if you are transitioning g at DEN",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Last night 8n Colorado,We traveled to Colorado for over a week for a family wedding. I decided to book our last night with the Westin at DIA. This was really convenient. I checked in and sent my wife up to the room with the bags while I returned the rental car. The staff was super helping with luggage and holding the car for me.We had a fine dinner that evening and getting to our flight the next day was a snap. The terminal is right next door.The room was spacious and the bed was great. I highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Messy Visit to CO,"My family and I have to spent the night at the Denver airport unexpectedly. We had a very difficult visits to Boulder. On the way to the airport trying to change our tickets we had an issue. We ended up having to stay at the Westin hotel. I walked up to the front desk, a wonderful young man named Dustin greeted me. He asked me how my visit to Colorado was and I fell apart. He was kind, considerate, professional and helped us get to our room very quickly. I saw him later in the evening  and apologize falling apart. He smiled at me and said he have seen much worse and was happy to help me. “Can I help you now?”This young man is a Jem.  We also had a great meal downstairs and I had a very nice cocktail. I recommended 100%. If this review gets to management, Bravo!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Welcome To Room #1070,"I really, really want to like this property, but I don’t.The property is a new build and very modern.Nice linens and toiletries.The few times I’ve stayed here and the rooms were clean.On this stay, check-in took more than 30 minutes. After a lot of frustration, they finally went to their back office to get things straightened out. After all the waiting around, I found out that the back office staff had not done their job with my reservation.FYI, the rooms are not completely sound proof. This room was directly over the light rail station (see pic). I was able to hear the coming and going of passengers and trains.I hope your stay will be better than mine.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Place to Sleep!,"This hotel is a stunning addition to the Denver International Airport.  The hotel is a bit austere but is impeccably clean at the same time.The bed and pillows are delightful. Air Conditioner is quiet, WiFi is fast.  The only problem is dining options.  Very limited options and many of the affordable dining options in the adjoining terminal have closed for a big remodeling project.Staff were very friendly and welcoming!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Easy place to flop,"We scheduled this hotel as our flight didn't land until 11 P.M.  It was a great place to flop when exhausted. The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable.  The lobby is a very quiet place to spend time after check out.  And the outside patio for all airport patrons is spectacularly fun.  This hotel is not inexpensive but it was worth the money for our stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great experience once you get through the check-in and check-out,"Checked in at 10pm for an overnight stay before early flight next morning.  Room was comfortable, modern and quiet.   Good WIFI and coffee in room.  Ordered cheese plate  and snacks in the lobby bar which arrived quickly and were delicious. Good selection of draft beer.  Lobby bar is good for people watching, mainly the tired souls waiting in line to check-in.Hotel is right outside the main terminal so its super convenient from baggage claim or airline check-in next morning.  Westin needs to improve the efficiency of their check-in and check out.  There was a huge check-in line at almost midnight and my check-out was problematic due to poor staff responses.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Surprisingly disappointing ,Flew in very late and decided to stay at the Westin out of convenience. Checked in via the mobile app that still requested that I check in at the front desk. I realize that this is an airport hotel but at midnight the line for the front desk was about eight people deep. Three people were behind the front desk but everything seemed to be moving at glacial pace at midnight. Finally got to the front and was told they couldn’t find my reservation. You’re kidding right? Oh apparently they were because they found it eventually. Said my name was entered wrong (As a gold member I found this amusing). Didn’t acknowledge my level and I was grateful to head to my room for a few hours of rest. The hotel is very spartan and bright. Room was adequate but didn’t think it was worth $450. Staff were brusque and clinical. Weirdest Westin experience for me ever.,3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Unexpected awesomenes,"My company booked me here at the tail end of a long trip. When I got to my room....surprise!!! It was on the top floor and a gigantic ,beautiful suite. The view was 180 degrees of the airport.....not much to look at but spectacular in its own weird way. The bathroom was probably 15’ X 15”....huge... had a rain head shower and a seperate tub ....like a mini spa.  The suite also had a living room and a second bathroom. The bedroom had 2 sides of walls of windows, yet it was super quiet,from inside the hotel and from outside. The gym is great and they are super convienient to the airport. Who knew an airport hotel could be so nice!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Super Convenient at DIA, Well Appointed!","Arriving very late from overseas and connecting out very early the next morning, this Westin, right at the airport was the perfect solution.The new, bright and airy glass-and-steel structure is literally 15 seconds walk from the terminal. A sprawling lawn is fitted with sofas tables, and bean bag toss boards.Our room was very comfortable with well designed built-ins for storage, great beds and linens, and ample space in both the main room and bath.We will most certainly stay at this Westin again prior to a super early flight  out of Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Sweet Location+Dope Architecture,"Check in was rough but the location right at the Airport was great! Nice connection to trains and other transportation. The room was clean with a dope view of the runway. Nice green space and public art. Indoor pool on the 11th floor. Breakfast was very nice, vegetarian friendly and satisfying! I consider it a honor to have stayed.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Disappointed ,"Stayed one night for an early flight the next morning. There was only 1 person at the front desk and had to wait 10-15 minutes to check in. Once given room key card, went to room but keycard didn’t work. Went back front desk and was told they told me the wrong room. Was told the right room but this time the wrong tower. Finally got unit correct room and tower. One of the beds was obviously not cleaned as there was marinara sauce (I hope) on the skirt of the bed. I pulled back the sheets and found hair, wrinkles, and dirt. Called the front desk and got the bed linens changed. We ate at the restaurant for supper and it was delicious.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Airport Hotel,"We have stayed more than 12 times- often coming in on a late flight or leaving the next day on an early flight.. the hotel is very convenient to the terminal- a short easy walk. The rooms are clean and very quiet- especially for an airport hotel. Restaurant has good food for lunch and diner, breakfast disappointing, but there is a Starbucks for  a quick bite on the same floor.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect Airport Hotel,We stayed at the Westin on our last night in Colorado.  We actually dropped off our rental car.  Took a shuttle to the airport and then walked right into the hotel lobby.  It was early in the day but our room was ready.  We dropped our bags in our room and then took the train which is right outside the hotel into Denver for the afternoon.  Once back at the hotel we had a light dinner and drinks at the bar.  The hotel is lovely and the location could not be any better.  Room was clean and comfortable.  Beds were great.  Staff were all friendly and very attentive.  Check-in and out were very easy.  Next morning we dropped off our bags at the baggage check-in located in the lower level of the hotel.  Then headed straight into the airport.  Smooth and easy.  Highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,This is where we stay.,Love the coffee love the rooms love the staff.  My wife however is completely in love with the soap and conditioner and body wash.  I like the fact that I can leave the Denver airport pick up my car parked in the garage and be in my room in 30 minutes,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Making travel easy,"Stayed here before flying out in the morning. So convenient to be able to return the rental car the day before, enjoy a more leisurely morning without any stress to catch our flight. The outdoor area on the walkway to the terminal is a great addition and the new brewery will add to that. Had a room that looked out on the runways, a favorite activity for my son. Added bonus of being able to watch planes come in and take off from the salt water pool towards the top of the hotel. Grabbed a snack dinner in the lounge (great setting) and had breakfast at grill and vine before the flight (delicious). Have told friends and family this is the place to stay the night before flying home for a hassle free start to the day.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Pleasant surprise ,"Here for a conference and was initially disappointed that we were staying near the airport and not downtown. However, the room was clean, comfortable and quiet despite being right next to the airport. Even better there is an amazing gym on the 11th floor that is fully equipped with all the usual machines but also has kettle bells, bosu Ball, exercise balls, weighted balls, foam rollers and ice cold towels to cool off with. The food at the conference was decent with many healthy options. Would have no problem staying here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,ONE GREAT NIGHT,We stayed here the night before flying out for a “Pack Up and Go” surprise weekend. We were celebrating our 50th anniversary. Our suite was on the eleventh floor with a panoramic Mountain View. The bed is amazingly comfortable and the shower is huge. The Westin surprised us with champagne and chocolate strawberries in honor of our special day. The food and service at the restaurant were both excellent. Staying at the airport Westin before an early morning flight was perfect for us.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wish We Could Have Stayed Longer,"We got stuck in Denver and decided that The Westin was the best option for our 6 AM flight the next day. I checked in with three kids and most of my luggage missing. The front desk was awesome and provided me with some toiletries to help me freshen up after 12 hours of air travel. Our room was so clean, the beds were so delightful, and I got a glass of wine at the bar on the way to my room. They have Starbucks coffee was essential in my room for my 4 AM wake up. Conveniently, I could see the security line from my room which prompted me to head down to the airport earlier than I had originally planned. This hotel is conveniently located, appointed with really nice amenities, and just pretty. Thanks for a great stay for some realllly weary travelers.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great for family with kids and a early flight,"We stayed here one night as we have two under 3 so we decided it would be easier to stay here to catch our early flight.  Check in was easy and they let my three year old pick a toy out of a box.  We got dinner at the in house restaurant and we had one of the best burgers (wife and I agreed) in a while, very good.  The gentlemen busing tables was great he made both of my daughters laugh I wish I caught his name.  Pool was great, my 3 year old and I loved watching jets fly in and out.  Loved seeing a  property use a salt water system as well.  Hot tub needed a defoaming big time.Room was rather tight to put a crib in, we put it right up against the door (our own fault for booking a two queen).  Getting ready for bed I found a very unsightly blood stain along the edge of the sheet very hard to notice.  Being a former Hotel GM this should have been caught by housekeeping and the person inspecting the room.  Didnt want to call as my daughters were sleeping and it was late.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Clean and modern,"Stayed one night to be close to airport. Nice, clean, and modern.Comfortable bed. Priority check in saved me about 30 minutes as the regular line was long. Tried full check in on the app but that wasn't assigning a room.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Top Notch Airport Hotel,"It's a shame that we were only able to spend less than ten hours at this hotel.  We had arrived after 11pm from an all day drive and had an early morning flight.  A friend of mine told me that this airport hotel is relatively new (opened three years ago) and very convenient to the airport.  I don't think he knew just how convenient because we happily found out that you can WALK from the hotel straight into the check-in lines at the airport!  Because of that, we didn't find ourselves rushing around, worrying about traffic or parking, and instead, leisurely walked to our gate with plenty of time to enjoy a coffee before boarding.  It just doesn't get any better than that!    The hotel itself is clean and modern with comfortable sitting areas both inside the lobby area and outside. They even had corn hole and a volleyball net on the grounds. Check-in was friendly and professional, despite a little bit of a line late at night.  We were given two complimentary bottles of water at check-in as well - nice touch!  The room was also very clean, sleek-looking, spacious and comfortable.  The layout is truly outstanding.  The bed felt like you were sleeping in a cloud and the amenities in the bathroom were more than adequate.  And I'm a huge fan of hotels that understand the importance of recycling!  We didn't get the chance to check out the fitness center but found that you can borrow workout clothes for a minimum fee.  Again, I wish we had the opportunity to spend more time at this particular Westin Hotel - TOP NOTCH in every way!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,I keep wanting to go back here!,"We stayed here for one night (my husband, my 5 year old and I). We had spent a week in Breckenridge and had an early morning flight. We were completely surprised by how wonderful this hotel is. We arrived around 4:00pm, had some early dinner in the restaurant (delicious!) and then went to the pool. The pool area is wonderful, you look out at incoming/outgoing flights and can see the commuter  train tracks below (important things for a small child). The view is pretty unique and awesome. The rooms are perfect, modern, clean, and quiet with regular Westin amenities that you would expect. We ordered room service dessert and enjoyed the view of the Denver airport at night. It's a gorgeous hotel.This will be where I stay if we are ever in Denver again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,What a blessing this gentleman was to our stay.,"My grand daughter and I arrived worn out, not feeling well.  His gentleman, Teddy, a restaurant manager, came right over, took some of our luggage and walked us thru the process of checking in and got us to our room.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Very nice hotel, great rooms","If you ever have meetings outside of Denver, or find yourself having missed a flight ...this is the only hotel to stay in ! Large rooms, great beds, and super clean. Lots of cool things, sliding drapes...and good service.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fantastic airport hotel,"We booked this hotel because originally we were supposed to land in Denver around midnight and then we had a very early morning to get to our next destination. Having a hotel that's walking distance (all you have to do is go out of the terminal, and then walk into the hotel) to the airport was clutch. We managed to switch our flights so we arrived in the morning instead, but we decided to stay at the hotel anyway.We're so glad we did because this was an incredible place to stay. We got upgraded to a suite, so we were able to watch flights take off and land from our bed all afternoon. When we got ""bored,"" we went down to the pool and hot tub. There was an art installation outside of the Westin that was a mini golf course. We had a lot to do to keep ourselves occupied for the day. The suite was beautiful. I loved the full floor-to-ceiling windows. The bed was sumptuous and oh so relaxing after a long flight. The only downside to staying at this Westin is the limited options for food since you only have the airport restaurants available to you.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,1st Class Hotel,"Westin DIA - Our company had our 2018 mid year performance review at this beautiful, convenient and 1st class hotel at Denver International Airport due to the fact that Denver was centrally located between our east coast leaders and our west coast leaders. All we can say is WOW... What a great hotel that is VERY conventionally located in the country with great guest rooms, stunning meeting space (We were in the Alder Room) and a world class staff. Timothy at the front desk was very engaged and friendly and Greg Merrick was extremely helpful in banquets. We had a wonderful stay and will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Super Convenient, BUT forgot my early wake up call","I decided to splurge the night before an early international flight and stay at the Westin DIA. Needing to be at the airport at 5am, it was super convenient to already be parked and just walk out the door and into the concourse. Checkin was efficient and the room was beautiful and quiet.  The prior month I had stayed at an airport hotel a few miles away, but the bed was uncomfortable and I decided to splurge on a Heavenly Bed to be well rested ahead of jet lag. Well, the Heavenly Bed must have changed over the last few years because it was very firm and I didn't sleep well. I had arranged a wake up call for 4:20am as a backup. Thank goodness there were no glitches in my iPhone alarm going off because the hotel failed to send the wake up call.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Exceptional Service!,"We loved our overnight stay before our flight. Watching planes, summer rain storms and relaxing were a perfect end to our trip. Checkin was a little complicated because of a failure on Expedia’s part, but the staff at the hotel were able to accommodate us and make a stressful moment way less problematic. The one minute walk to the terminal was amazing! We will definitely be back!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing stay,"We highly enjoyed our stay. We decided to stay the night here for our wedding night as we were leaving for our international honeymoon trip the next day. We had an Amazing experience! The facility is very clean modern and well-kept. But an employee by the name of Natasha was the real stand out, she definitely went above and beyond to make our stay special. She has wonderful customer service and was extremely personable!  Thank you for a great stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful Hotel,This hotel is connected to the Denver airport. Our flight had been cancelled so we were thrilled to see how nice and clean this hotel was. We enjoyed dinner on the rooftop it was so lovely and the food was excellent. We had no trouble getting rechecked in at out gate all was very smooth. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. I only wish more Airpot hotels were as nice and convenient as the Denver hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Gorgeous Hotel, Fabulous Rooms!","I am blown away with this hotel. It’s immaculate. The rooms are modern, welcoming and relaxing. The beds and pillows are absolutely heavenly. I travel four times a week and I am always overjoyed when I get to sleep in these beds. It’s literally the best hotel bed ever. The front desk employees are welcoming, friendly and helpful. There is a Starbucks on location, which always a plus. I have not ate at the hotel, so I have no input in that area. Access to the train into the city and outlying areas is located steps away. Extremely easy to access from the airport as well. Airport is a 3-5 minute walk away from the hotel. the views from the hotel are beautiful.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,LOVED this hotel!,"We stayed two nights at the Westin and loved it for so many reasons! The staff were so kind and accommodating. Our room was large and luxurious and the views overlooking the airport were lovely....especially at sunset. We traveled from WI to Denver by Amtrak, and then took the light rail directly to the Westin. This was a very convenient way to travel. We also took the RTD bus directly from the hotel to Boulder which was also very convenient. The staff was also generous with bottled water which really helped adjusting to the higher altitude. I highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,An excellent first night of our vacation in Colorado,The hotel truly is just a short walk from the main terminal. However this is not your usual airport hotel. It is a truly luxurious property. Room was large and comfortable with excellent views of the airport. Staff were friendly and helpful. Food in bar was superb.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience and Comfort ,Had an early morning return flight and decided to stay at the Westin Denver Airport. The hotel is located literally steps away from the airport as well as the train into the city. The room was great and check in a breeze. The only downside was no free room WIFI but The was a large WIFI lounge which also had a bar.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nicest Airport Hotel Ever!,"This Westin property is truly a breath of fresh air. You can walk from the airport terminal right into the hotel. From the time you enter the lobby the signature Westin scent makes you forget that you're at the airport.The architecture is stunning! The meeting rooms are tastefully done as are the guest rooms. My king bed room was spacious and completely sound-proofed. The bathroom was large and well-appointed and, as always, the Westin Heavenly Bed, did not disappoint.There's a train that will take you from the hotel to downtown Denver in about 3 minutes.The staff are all helpful and friendly and the food at the restaurant as well as from Banquets/Catering was tasty and fresh.I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this property and look forward to going back again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Well done every time I stay on a business layover ,It’s so incredibly convenient to layover here. It adds excitement to a business trip being able to have dinner at the restaurant bar watching sports on tv with friendly bartender banter. Then go up to the lobby bar to people watch. Ask for a room looking at the security line and you know exactly how to plan your morning catching the next leg of your trip.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Smart hotel,We stayed one night in order to leave on an early flight.  The hotel has a smart and beautiful feel.  The parking attendants were very helpful and professional. We had dinner at the on site restaurant and it was great.  We will definitely stay again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Fantastic Hotel, But Don't Bother Sitting On The Furniture","The Westin at DIA is only 2.5 years old and is incredibly convenient for catching a flight the next morning. Check-in kiosks are a 3-minute walk from the hotel.We were not bothered by noise at any time during our stay, so the soundproofing is excellent.Rooms are clean, spacious, and the service was very good.I do have one big negative: the furniture in the sitting area is so ultra modern as to be incredibly uncomfortable. Don't bother. It's more comfortable sitting on the floor.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A Short Business Overnight Stay,"We have overnighted near Denver International Airport, but never at the Westin, which is a new property. We were doing an overnight at DEN, between Phoenix and Omaha, for a May business meeting, and could not leave Phoenix, until rather late in the afternoon. As there are no flights from PHX to OMA, we have to connect somewhere, and decided that this trip, it would be DEN, and that we would stay at the new Westin, right at the airport.We arrived at about 7:00pm, and walked over to the Westin, which is essentially attached to DEN, right at the United Baggage Claim – OK, there is an elevator involved (sort of hidden behind the baggage carousels. We checked in, and were assigned room 1070.We were going to stop by the lobby bar, but it was very full, and the crowd was extremely loud. It was actually difficult to hear our agent during check-in, due to the extreme noise level – just not our style for a glass of wine, after a flight. We dropped off our luggage, and went down to the restaurant, Grill & Vine, for dinner, and found the food to be quite good, though with a short wine list. This restaurant will be reviewed separately.Our room overlooked the airport, and one of the main access routes, plus a Light Rail station. We heard no noise from the airport, the roadway or the Light Rail.We had a comfortable King bed, an ample closet with iron, ironing board and safe, a bathroom with a single sink, and a combo tub/shower. The shower head had good pressure, and wide distribution. It also had a separate wand. We had more AC & USB charging ports, than we had devices, and most were on/near a flat surface, so nothing had to be placed on the floor. The room was adequately sized, and though it had a “corporate feel,” it was comfortable. There was a flat-screen TV, atop an extension to the small desk in the room. We had a mini-fridge, as well. The room had an alarm clock/radio, and neat built-in reading lights, above the bed. The Mr. Coffee coffee maker had an ample amount of coffee and creamer, in the caddy. This was nice, as we had an early flight to OMA the next morning.Our amenities were the Westin White Tea Aloe products, which we have found to be nice. We had comfortable bathrobes, and ample, nice towels. One nice touch at many SPG/Marriott properties is the little container of “Lavender Sleep Balm.” that one can rub on their pillows, for a bit of “aroma therapy.”We had no complaints about the room, as we had everything we needed. We did print our boarding passes in the little “business center,” behind the registration desk, the next morning. There were likely amenities, that we did not see, or use, as this was for but one brief night’s stay. The staff, at the front desk, and in the restaurant, were excellent.Proximity to the airport was excellent, with but a short walk. I would rate this as good as the Hilton at ORD (Chicago, O’Hare), and the ParkRoyal at MEL (Melbourne, Australia), or maybe even better.The only negatives were the noise level from the lobby bar, but I attribute that to the crowd that night. Many of those folk wandered in and out of Grill & Vine’s bar/restaurant area, and were just as loud there. I think that this was a business group, meeting at the hotel, but am not certain. Then, there are a few elevators to negotiate from the terminal, and then in the Westin, but they were quick, and adequately large, though we did not have that much luggage – Omaha was only a couple of nights, then we returned to Phoenix, to sleep in our own bed for one night, before heading out again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,DON'T COME IN ON A LATE FLIGHT,"We booked this hotel because of a late flight from Florida to arrive at 2 am Florida time. When we arrived at the airport we found no signage to tell us how to get to the hotel. We are unfamiliar with the area and I could not find any directions on the reservation either. We finally asked the cleaning crew at the airport. The airport was almost empty, and they were locking down bathrooms. The crew told us to just keep going straight we would see it. This may seem simple to someone who knows the airport. We had no idea. We found the sign near an exit and then had to walk OUTSIDE!!!  THIS IS NOT A CONNECTED  AIRPORT HOTEL IF YOU HAVE TO WALK OUTSIDE. We finally found the lobby only to also find a long line. We were supposed to have the e key on the phone, so we could go right to the room. It did not work until the morning of checkout! We had no view. The room was ok. Nothing special and I found the beds to be uncomfortable. The whole hotel to me looks very worn. We were very surprised to find it is only a few years old!I would save your money and go elsewhere.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect for Late night arrivals ,"After riding the tram and gathering luggage upon arriving after midnight flight, this was the perfect place to rest before getting the car rental the next morning. I’d never stay here if not flying in or out but the views are amazing as is the hotel itself. Westin Heavenly beds can’t be beat. They’re the most comfortable beds ever. The aromatherapy included led to an even better nights rest and was a nice touch as was the water bottle for the dry Colorado weather for the flatlanders arriving to Denver. Beyond the comfort of the bed, this hotel was immaculate from a cleanliness standpoint. Sparkling stainless in the bathroom as well as spotless public areas. We did visit the pool which was so heavily chlorinated that we couldn’t remain in the area. And a quick visit to the gym that was well stocked with a nice variety of machines. A great place for a quick run on the treadmill to be enjoyed with the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the terminal!Will definitely stay again if leaving early or arriving later to Denver International!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Overnight at the Denver Airport,"Obviously, people stay here because it is adjacent to the Denver airport, which is otherwise deserted in a far off barren landscape. I enjoyed the interesting architecture of the hotel, and the fun turf yard between the hotel and terminal.  The room is completely standard fair. Beware, they charge for wifi! Since they have a corner on the market in this location, I wouldn't expect huge changes or improvements.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Oasis at Airport,"Very convenient and modern for overnight stay or just lunch or a snack!We use the hotel regularly when arriving on a late flight late from London or as this time for lunch at the Grill and Vine restaurant with the family before evening departure.The receptionist was a little bossy- the Burgers 🍔 we enjoyed and recommend highly. The Chicken Breast was small, totally dry and expensive. The children were welcome and looked after ( special menu).Overall very enjoyable and to be recommended.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Location couldn't be more convenient - Excellent hotel and stay!,"Check in, room and bed comfort and view were fantastic. Small conveniences such as the reading light recessed into the headboard and lighting around the bath room mirror were lovely touches and appreciated. Artwork was really nice and of course the Starbucks coffee in room. Convenience to the airport is superb and “no airplane noise” was a huge plus. Just a terrific stay overall and was reluctant to leave! This is a Westin, so don't expect low budget prices, the convenience and brand quality are worth the price!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great location, dirty","At first it looks like a great choice. Location is awesome, if you need to catch an early flight or just have a stopover. Walking distance to gate. Nice pool & fitness. We were more than surprised how dirty the room was. Tissue and dust under bed, hair bathroom floor & toilet, chewing gum in trash bin... we should have complained. But the nice check-in, ok restaurant & nice pool are above average, so we would give this business hotel another chance.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Lovely clean hotel,"I am so happy to be able to stay at the airport for an early flight. This hotel has huge windows so you can see the planes taking off and landing. The pool,jacuzzi and gym are perfect and clean. The dining choice is healthy salads and vegetables. At your bedside is a little vial of Lavender to roll on your temples for a good sleep. A+ Westin- you outdid yourself on this one.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"More Than a Great Hotel, a Great Experience in Travel","For many people, travel is just getting from point A to point B.  But for seasoned business travelers like myself (I have flown over 1.5 million miles) who have learned to enjoy the journey, the Westin DIA is simply the best airport hotel in the country! I have stayed at so many hotels, I forget most of them.  But like my stay at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York and the Ritz-Carlton in Los Angeles, I will always remember my stay at the Westin Denver International Airport. The modern glass architecture of the Westin hotel that is shaped like a wing blends nicely with the Rocky Mountain inspired design of the airport terminal.  The lobby of the Westin is simply stunning where you can hang out at the lobby bar or just relax in one of the many chairs.  The rooms are modern and the Westin has the best bed in the business!  Truly it is!!!  The staff of the Westin DIA--from the General Manager to the front desk staff and server in the Grill & Vine restaurant---are among the best I have encountered in my travels.  My wife and I spent our 37th wedding anniversary at the hotel and received an upgrade with a room with great view.  When we returned to our room after dinner we were greeted with a bottle of champagne, chocolate strawberries and a congratulatory note from the Westin team!  When we were packing up the next morning, my wife said, ""We will have to come back and do this again!""  Whoever says this about an ""airport"" hotel?  You do when it's the Westin Denver International Airport.  It's simply on another level!!!  We will be back and we live in Denver!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,They will help you.,We had an overnight layover that was about 6 hours on our REALLY long trip. They gave us a discount due to the shorter stay. We ordered room service and passed out. Food was tasty. The room was great and comfy! Perfect!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Special deal when you need it.,"Frankly, the rates for this hotel are normally out of my range. However, as an SPG member and with SPG points from the credit card and other Marriott stays, you can put together a great deal when you need to be at the DIA early or are overnighting between flights. Currently, with 6000 SPG points and $127, it is a good deal in my book. Hotel is great, service great, and you are right at the airport. Can't be beat.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One night only,"Stayed here just for one night whilst on business. It is pricey, but once you factor taxis and downtown prices, I think it’s pretty fair. Very comfortable room, great views and perfectly handy for the airport, as you can easily and safely walk to it. I’d stay again if I needed to be near the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great stopover hotel,"Stayed here overnight en-route from London to Idaho Falls to break up the journey.  Clean, comfortable rooms, received an upgrade to a business room (free premium wifi) on arrival which was a nice touch.  Check-in was quick and staff pleasant.Good nights sleep, quiet hotel, good shower and bathroom.Great proximity to airport - less than a minutes walk to the terminal.  Ate in the restaurant, which was very good, also grabbed a coffee from the snack shop which was good, if a little pricey!Would recommend for an overnight stop, or if you have a conference on site.  Handy too for train downtown, with station immediately below the hotel.A great way to start your vacation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Unique exterior ,If you’ve seen the unique architecture and outside artwork you’ve seen the best. Definitely skip the dining. Nice if you need a place at the airport with no transportation required but nothing special otherwise.,3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very nice but very expensive. ,Early morning flight so this was perfect. Walk out and in 2 minutes you walk right over to security check in. Not sure why you have to walk outside the hotel to get in the airport. Not bad for nice weather but can’t imagine middle of winter. I’m a rewards member so I didn’t pay for WiFi. Very comfortable room. Nice shower. No tub. A bottle of water. Frig and safe. Comfy bed. Very clean. Seamless check in and check out. I just wish their rates were lower. That was a real con for me but the convenience made it easier to swallow.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great for early flights but pricey,"Seeing that you are right next to the security checkpoint it's great. But overall very pricey for what they offer.  Bed was soft,. Rainhead shower head was good.  Rooms are soundproof which was great when you have an early flight.  Didn't care for the   Wi-Fi that you had to pay for.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient and Classy,"The hotel is right next to the airport which makes it incredibly convenient, especially if you have a 7am flight out the following morning. The hotel itself is very modern, new, and clean. The staff was all really helpful and professional. Would highly recommend for anyone traveling on business that needs to be near the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Relaxing Stay,Getting to an airport usually means stress but getting there via the Westin lets your vacation start right away. Enjoy a wonderful stay in their excellent rooms with a nice dinner before you leisurely walk over to your check-in counter the next morning. Highly recommend this place!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Gorgeous, convenient facility ","I was very impressed with the convenience of this convention center/Hotel. I literally walked out of the airport, and there it was. The rooms and the pool area have beautiful views. The convention area is very functional and comfortable. I loved it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Awesome hotel,"Connected right outside TSA pre check and clear lanes. Great food, rooms are great and the conference center. Has a deck to play putt putt and worth the stay when you are traveling thru. The building is a beautiful addition to the airport. Also connected is a train center to get to downtown",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Blown Away,"When my husband told me were staying at an airport hotel for our quick stop over in Denver, I was dreading it. I have always had a good experience with Westins, but airport hotels are always so...gross. And loud. This hotel was so lovely, you did not feel you were in a airport hotel at all.First of all, it's gorgeous. Feels very clean and fresh and new. Very bright and modern.The staff is friendly and professional.Our room was so comfortable. Breakfast was OUTSTANDING. It was honestly a complete to delight to stay in this hotel. I will definitely return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wow,"From the woman on the phone taking my reservation, to the lobby desk, a grand experience.  This was a sudden flight out of Denver, and I was exhausted.  Being in such a beautiful, well appointed room, most comfortable bed EVER, was truly a pleasure.  Welcoming, kind staff a real bonus, not to mention just walking into the airport to catch my flight.  Would stay there again in a heartbeat.  Loved it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,3 night business trip,"Stayed here for 3 nights in April for a conference.  The proximity to the airport make it worth staying here alone, but it is also very convenient to the A Line train rail which we took to downtown a few times for shopping, entertainment and a few meals. It was very nice to be able to hop on the rail and be in downtown in a few minutes while watching the mountain in the background.The hotel is very clean and smells divine.  There must be a scent diffuser through the common areas of the hotel because it always smelled very fresh and clean, like a white tea. We never tried room service, but we were a little disappointed in the restaurant choices.  There was a little market that had snacks and some premade sandwiches and salads and then a restaurant called Vine and grill.  I thought the food was expensive for ""just ok"" food. We ate there once and luckily had the rest of our meals catered by our conference (which was much better quality in my opinion) but if I'm ever in Denver again, we will definitely consider staying here.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Proximity trumps price,We stayed at the Westin DIA since we had a 5am flight and didn't want to deal with airport shuttles from hotel (a lot do not run until 4 am) and wanted to be able to get some sleep.   @$500 for a double queen was high but the proximity and ease to access the airport outweighed the price.   The pool is beautiful (and salt water) really nice fitness center and very plush mattress and bedding.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great location for early morning flights,We decided to stay at the Westin DIA the day before our vacation as our flight left very early.  The rooms are nice and quite.  We never heard any airplanes.  We had a great view of the DIA tents which should be attached to the review.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Avoiding a long drive overnight ,This hotel is very clean and modern. The rooms are large and spacious and the windows are floor to ceiling. You can walk to several restaurants in the airport and the hotel restaurant is great as well. We would have had to drive in from Vail at 5 am to make it to catch a morning flight. Now we can relax and enjoy this lovely resort. Great Westin and such a surprise as airport hotels are normally mediocre. This one was extraordinary!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Futuristic and clean, avoid breakfast","Futuristic and clean. Don’t do breakfast. We had a very early flight out of DIA and we decided that with a toddler it would be easiest to stay overnight at the airport so we didn’t have to get up as awfully early. It is incredibly convenient and you can just roll out of bed, walk downstairs, and glide through security (depending on your travel priority). The outside the building is beautiful and looks like it’s designed for the futuristic age and the inside pretty much holds up to the idea. The hotel lobby is futuristic and kind of serene with a small round bar and a lot of different seating options. Some tables and desks for working, some high backed chairs for a little privacy, and plenty of bathrooms make it easy to really lounge here. There is free mini golf right outside, too (we didn’t do this so I’m not sure exactly how it works, but looks like a lot of fun). The room is equally exciting with windows that angle out from the floor and just enough room on the sill for a small kid to stand safely and look out at all of the planes, cars, and excitement happening below. From our other window we could watch the train coming in as it passes through Patrick Marold’s “Shadow Array”, one of the many art installations that have come to decorate DIA over the years (including the infamous Blue Mustang lovingly monikered “Blucifer”). The building fits into that endeavor towards artistic, with a definite beauty amidst the functionality. The shades are electric and, while they don’t keep out all the light, they function well enough to do their jobs. The bathroom had only a shower. Ok for us because we’ve gotten our toddler used to the occasional shower rather than bath, but take not anyone with smaller or younger kids who are used to (or require) a bath. Perhaps some rooms offer a tub- if you need one inquire ahead of time. Also note that we could hear our neighbors (or someone) clearly through the venting in the bathroom, so let that be known to anyone planning a jewel heist or writing the next Avengers movie your secrets might not be safe in this Westin’s bathroom!They did provide a crib that was safe and sturdy. We brought our own sheets to travel and glad we did. But our plans to have breakfast while we got in order the next (early) morning were sorely shorted. The continental breakfast of pastries and fruit with juice and coffee consisted of exactly 2 small pastries, some grapes, and a wine glass half filled with some yogurt. The coffee was fine but not very hot. And with the delivery charge we spent over $50! Don’t make the same mistake!Friendly staff, clean rooms, nicely appointed. I would stay here again, even if our flight were not so early in the morning. Maybe have a round of mini golf before heading through security.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect Place For A Weary Traveler,"Stayed here after a long flight from Europe, which arrived in the evening.  It was such a pleasure to just grab my bag, walk to the Westin, and collapse for the night.  Room was typical Westin - clean, conservative styling, some luxury touches.  NO sound bleed from the jets coming and going.  The price is high, compared with other hotels in the area, but after multiple hours on an airplane, the convenience was worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,excellent for early morning flights,"I had an 8am flight from Denver and decided to stay at Westin Denver Intl Airport hotel for the simple fact that the next closest hotel is at least 5-6 miles away and would have required a shuttle transfer etc. Denver security lines can be exceedingly long so I wanted the most streamlined process possible and while also maximizing sleep the night before. The Westin delivered on those goals very handsomely.  I had an upper level room facing away from the airport. Soundproofing was excellent. I heard zero jet noise all evening/night. I slept well, was able to leave the hotel, walk staight across to the airport security area, and be through the TSA precheck line in less than 20 minutes. This convenience simply cannot be beat. SPG members enjoy free wifi, so sign up for SPG prior to your arrival if you would enjoy this benefit.  My room also featured a notice that I could ""rent"" workout clothes for $5 if I desired to use the gym but not have to worry about traveling with soiled clothes. That is a nice amenity.  I didn't use the minibar nor inspect it, but the complimentary coffee was Starbucks. The bed was great, and the bathroom featured a rain shower overhead or a hand-held shower head. Bath products were standard. As an aside, friend from Denver took the train from Union Station and met me at this hotel for dinner and drinks the evening before my flight. Again, the convenience for Denver residents is similarly fantastic: you simply disembark from the train and take elevators straight into the hotel. We had a light meal and cocktails at the restaurant, and both were good and well priced (I live in LA, so the prices seemed reasonable to me, but they might be on the expensive side for travellers coming from less expensive areas). My only complaint would be that the room and bath design / materials / decore seem a little bland / generic-corporate and do not necessarily speak to the price point of the room. However, the time saved in convenience and overall refreshed feeling I enjoyed prior to the flight went a very long way toward justifying the room price.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice hotel; shame it's not connected to the terminal,"Overall, this hotel was pretty good. You'll pay a massive premium for staying at the airport as opposed to the cluster of ""airport"" hotels that are a 20-minute shuttle ride away (more so than in many other cities for on-airport vs off-airport, in my experience), but the convenience factor is high.Rooms were pretty nice, no complaints there.But the mind-boggling part of it is that the hotel is not connected to the terminal. I was there in August, so the weather wasn't an issue, but I can imagine being pretty miserable if I were there in a February snowstorm - that 50-100 foot walk outside wouldn't be much fun.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Clean fresh and comfortable,"We landed at Denver international early in the morning after a long flight with a one year old, we were getting ready to rent a car and drive to our hotel downtown. But they could not check us in till 4pm! So we decided to check if Westin would give us a room for a couple of hours.As we exited the main terminal and walked across the plaza, we realized how calm and relaxing it is here.it does not feel like an airport at all. As a bonus there was mini golf set up for everyone to play.Inside the hotel you will quickly notice the fresh modern decore. With light colors and lots of natural light. The ladies at the front desk could not have been more helpful and friendly.We we're quickly given a nice room with a check out time late in the evening. The clean and comfortable room was just what we needed to rest and recharge. The most amazing thing is the level of sound proofing that this building has been designed with. You can't hear absolutely any noise from outside the hotel or the adjoining rooms.They have a great restaurant and room service and you can also walk across the plaza for more dining option inside the terminal.This is the best place to relax during a layover, beats waiting at the gate or the lounge. Wish we had known about this place before our trip to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful for a stop DIA layover,"Boy does the location and style of this hotel make a layover at DIA easy. The bright new rooms, contemporary lobby, beautiful gym and pool area outshine the rest of the choices  out in ""airport hotel row"".The in-house restaurant is pretty good but it would be nice if there were more dining options even a taxi ride away.We had helpful and professional service.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Made travel so easy! ,"Stayed for one night before a flight out of Denver. My father had a flight at 7am and I had a flight at 7pm so it was nice to be able to walk my dad over early in the morning and then just go back to the room to sleep for a bit longer. The beds were amazing and there was no noise in the room from either the hallway, other rooms or outside.It was a bit pricey but definitively worth it for the convenience and comfort.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One night wonder,"Stayed here one night for a flight the next day out of Denver. Enjoyed the airport proximity and the professional polite staff at the Westin. We arrived early enough for lunch, then, enjoyed the beautiful pool with Mountain View’s from floor to ceiling—just like our room. Had a great dinner and breakfastBefore our return home flight. Such a wonderful one night stay",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Favorite Westin Ever 💯,"This was our 3rd time staying here and it was actually our best! We visit family in Denver a couple times a year and this hotel has made our visits soooo much easier! Our favorite things:1️⃣ always able to get connecting rooms so our girls have their own space and we have our own space!2️⃣ unbelievable views of the airport terminal and runways! We can spend lots of time just people and plane watching!3️⃣ Hotel restaurant Grill and Vine is great! We had breakfast 3 times this visit and every time the food, views and service was excellent. All this and it was free as we are platinum (pass on the points). We even went down at night to get chocolate milk and ice cream for our girls - they let us order at bar and wait for it in the lounge area then we just took it back to the room.4️⃣ indoor pool and fitness center!!! We have been to a lot indoor hotel pools and this was the nicest indoor pool ever! Very spa-like, very clean and no chlorine smell! To top all that off it is located on the 11th floor in the center of the whale tail with floor to ceiling windows. We went in the morning and had the entire place to ourselves!5️⃣ location, location, location!!!! There is nothing better than waking up, having breakfast, and walking two minutes to the security check-in! No stress at all getting to the airport...the best especially with kids.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Gorgeously designed hotel!,"Thoroughly impressive stay! The convenience of walking into the hotel from the airport was A+ in our book.  We arrived into Denver Intl airport around 1:00am.  The customer service upon arrival was warm and welcoming, the lobby modern and aesthetically pleasing and Room service available 24hrs. The food was was delicious and well presented.  Westin has the most comfortable beds and the Heavenly shower - such a treat after a long day.  You’d never know you were staying at an airport hotel - never heard any noise outside our room. The pool and gym were gorgeous! Wish we had more time to stay and enjoy. Our family loves Westin! Yvonne Young & Family",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Major disappointment,"Even though it’s on-site, the hotel does not do enough to make it convenient or hospitable. The signs and directions from the arrivals area to the hotel are almost non-existent. Once you get to the outside of the hotel, there’s a complete lack of assistance in finding the front door, lobby, and checkin. A single sign as you leave the airport building points to the big building in front of you as says ‘hotel’. I had to walk thru side restaurant to get into the hotel. Pickup at the hotel is similarly frustrating. The lack of signage and directions for front lobby and pickup area make this an inconvenient labyrinth. Finally at time of checkout when things could have been smooth —since I was the only one in line —was further complicated by the Westin employee who decided to help a customer who basically ran to the side of the desk, flashed her a smile and suggested he was in a rush. Poor location services and poor customer service add up to wishing I had stayed in downtown Denver.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Fabulous hotel and room, horrible front desk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This was my second stay here. I like the convenience and the hotel rooms are lovely and the tiny bit of Av geek in me wants to watch the planes come and go. I arrived at 5:50pm and we were spending one night, but my husband was flying in later, so it made sense to stay here. I not only booked through the app for SPG, but I also had an email confirmation, that had the same number as one the app. The dates were correct, all my information was current and correct and the front desk agent, Fan, could not find my reservation. She searched and searched and I showed her not only both confirmations, but asked for the MOD. Before she got Natasha McCoy (who I do not believe was the MOD, but she went to find her) Fan told ME TO CALL SPG and figure it out because SPG doesn't want to talk to them and the confirmation number on the app and the email was wrong. I'm almost laughed, but realized she seriously wanted me to call SPG! I called SPG and Natasha came over and was doing some things on the computer and I finally was connected to SPG, explained the situation and handed my phone to Natasha. She then told the same story and that they couldn't find the reservation and kept saying things like ""should we just make a new reservation and have her pay with more points or normal price?"" to the gentleman on the phone! I did use points for this stay, but no way in hell was I paying and using points (or letting them touch any other points) because they can't figure out what the problem is!!!!!!!!!!! After about 23 minutes (give or take a minute) Natasha finally beckoned over Jillian Maffucci, who was walking a small dog around the bar and Natasha is still on my phone talking to the SPG agent and still talking about making me make another reservation when Jillian finally said that they should take down my confirmation and SPG number and they would figure it out, which should have been done 27 minutes prior!!!!!!!!!! I am still seething that Fan and Natasha thought it appropriate to keep me cooling my heels for 27 minutes when it was their problem and obvious! And only when I was walking away did Jillian tell me they switched over to Marriott servers Monday (this was Thursday) and having issues. IMHO, under no circumstances should I have ever had to stand there 27 minutes because of their issues, nor should a guest be told to call and fix THE HOTELS problem with SPG. Jillian gave me a lovely room that I wished we had more time to use because it was very well appointed and had huge windows and a fabby view of an active runway at night. The hall was silent all evening and I went down to the bar and had grilled cheese and wine and it was quite good! If you can do keyless check in, on the app,  and avoid the front desk, stay here. The location is worth it and the rooms are what I expect from Westin. There is also a small pool and a nice full service restaurant.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Overpriced, poor service",Other than convenience to the airport I wouldn’t stay here again. Wish I’d chosen a 3 Star nearby with a shuttle over The Westin. Arrived & porters watched me get all the bags out of the taxi & push then inside to the lifts without once offering to help. Reception staff were aloof. Room service staff had no clue at all about their menu or possible options. Hotel has no service ethic; clean; comfortable rooms but totally overpriced. Disappointed.,2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Lovely hotel, unacceptable customer service.","I’ll start with the positives. This hotel is modern, chic, convenient and updated- everything you’d expect from a nice Westin. It is also conveniently located directly outside the main terminal of the Denver airport. However, my entire experience was muddled by the extremely rude staff. During check-in they told me that mobile check-in doesn’t work anymore because “Marriott took over” and gave an eye roll. Perhaps the most glaring issue was shown when I asked for a fedex that had been shipped to me there. I called down, as I do 2-3 times a week in hotels, and they said they would deliver it. After 30 mins I called down again, they said that the bellman was too busy right now. So as I checked out to head to my meeting, I went to the desk to retrieve it myself. The agent told me repeatedly they didn’t have it. I shared the tracking number and she said “oh s***, I guess we do have it”. I explained, frustratedly but did not raise my voice, that I needed to head to my meeting in the next 10 minutes and had called to get this package over an hour ago. She then called again and said, with my standing in front of her, “have you found the fedex? Yea she’s being a b**** and still saying she needs to leave for some meeting”. I eventually was able to track it down but if this is the standard that Marriott and Starwood are moving to for customer service, I may be looking for a new loyalty program.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Several Stays Here,"This Hotel is great.  Nice clean rooms with great views from rooms on the southern side.   Nice bar and food there.  Right above very convenient light rail,  you can bag the rental car and ride rail to the city.   1 Minute walk to DIA and almost zero airport noise in rooms.   Many positive points to this hotel,  staff and rooms.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,OUTSTANDING LOCATION / PROFESSIONAL AND WARM STAFF,We were on a 5 day business trip and on the last day my husband and I decided to stay as close to the airport as possible because we had a 6am flight. We were so happy we chose this property. We checked out the hotel at 4:15am and was checking our bags in the airport at 4:30am... HOW AMAZING IS THAT?,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,People skills and hospitality lacking.,"Was traveling with my veteran brother who is an above knee amputee and in a wheelchair. We had an 8 hour layover and decided to try the bar/ restaurant here. After paying $60 for 2 burgers and 2 drinks we went across the way to a lounge area which was unoccupied. The door to the outside balcony area was locked so we had to wait for someone to notice we needed back in. After a very good meal and 1 drink each we sat and relaxed in the lounge are and fell asleep watching the 2 tv's that were on different channels with different volume levels and no remotes to adjust. We weren't stretched out and laying down as if we were in a room, we were sitting up and ended up talking a short nap. We were awoke by 2 employees yelling very loud at us that they couldn't allow us to be sleeping there. I apologized and said o.k. I stayed awake but my PTSD buddy fell back asleep and 15 minutes later the 2 returned to yell again. I asked why not, we weren't disturbing anyone and were just relaxing and waiting. All they could say is they couldn't allow us to be there so we left.  Seriously, what was the problem? If it was a fire code or safety issue you would think the door to the outside lounge area would be unlocked if they were so concerned about safety. Personally, I think they had issue with a man in a wheelchair being so close and visible to anyone entering the restaurant/ bar area. After reading many other reviews (along with this experience) it seems the hospitality, service, and people skills are in dire need of improvement. Will never set foot in this ""upscale"" location again.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect for a one night layover in Denver!,"Room was good, quiet (couldn't really hear the airplanes overhead).  We were traveling home from an extended trip in Europe with LOTS of bags and skis.  We loaded an airport cart up and basically walked across the terminal to the hotel.  The hotel stored all our bags for the night and the porter brought them to the terminal for us the next morning (there is also a check in in the lower level of the hotel, but that wasn't working).  The line was long to drop luggage in the terminal, so the porter suggested curbside check in and away we went!  He said next time we arrive we can call the hotel and they will meet us at the baggage claim to transport our bags to the hotel.  What service!  We even had some extra time in the morning after we checked our bags to have  breakfast in the hotel grill, great Benedict.  It is worth the extra points (or cash) to stay here instead of riding a shuttle for 20 minutes to an overpriced highway hotel.  No question that we will do this again on our next layover.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Simply Wonderful,"Wow. Just... wow.Made a last-minute reservation due to some weather issues during travel. I arrived at 2am and they had me upgraded into a suite. Incredible service. Incredible room. The room service I ordered (full breakfast) the next morning arrived in 18 minutes.I ended up spending the day in the room working remotely before meetings in downtown Denver the following day. I asked for a late check out and they gladly extended it to me until 4pm. It was marvelous. I went to the gym about 2pm to work out. It was quiet with lots of machines and some free weights. About the only complaint I could make is that the pool is tiny. But I never used it so, whatever.Great stay and will probably be back there again. Loved it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A surprise for the family,"We have stayed in a few hotels that are attached to the airport....this is the BEST! I am an SPG member and received exceptional welcome when we arrived.  The rooms were large and well done.  Could not hear one plane but the kids watched them for an hour after dinner.  We ate the hotel restaurant, good food and not overpriced.  The 3 minute walk from our hotel room to the check in was 'the best'.  We will do this again.Thank you Westin",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Luxury hotel with a lovely staff,"Room was excellent, food was really good and the pool area is great. This was a luxury hotel located so near the airport that it was almost too good to be true! and it still felt like you weren't next to an airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,So very nice,"This is why I love Westin. Checked in got upgraded without even asking. Room perfect, spotless with awesome shower! Had an early flight wanted a quick bite had a coupon for the restaurant but had no time to order so the hostess walks me over to the snack bar and they give me a shot of espresso and an awesome burrito and I am on my way! This is why I will stay loyal to SPG and Westin!!! Thanks you guys",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Worst check in experience ever,"This was the worst hotel check in experience. I had reserved a double queen room 4 months ago. Because I checked in later in the night, all double beds were reserved. The attendant promised a roll away bed that never showed up.  I’m also a SPG rewards member too with a husband who travels with his job...this didn’t concern her. At $350/night, there is no way I’d stay here again!",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Night before our flight...,What a way to start a trip. Don't be late for your flight. Relax and no rushing around. Have breakfast here or on the concourse... Do it. We checked in to this fantastic Westin DIA and loved everything. The staff is amazing. We had drinks at the lobby bar... Even watched the Superbowl game.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Easy in easy out,"If you need a great place to do some business and don’t want to venture far, the Westin at the airport is ideal. Great gym and pool with fantastic views, clean rooms with super helpful staff and a cool little lobby bar scene. The restaurant down stairs had a great sampling of local food and beverage and a solid selection of Bourbons. Bartenders are great at mixing libations while providing entertaining conversation. Staying at the airport is never ideal but the Westin made my quick business lay over extremely enjoyable. Will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Pricey but worth it,"We saved $250 a ticket by taking the early flight out for spring break with the kids, so decided to spend the money to stay at the airport so I could sneak down and check the bags in and let the kids sleep an extra two hours than they would have had we left from our house. Headed early to enjoy the pool - which is quite an experience.Requested a quiet room based on past experience at other airport hotels - and got top floor with no connecting door.No airport noise at all. Wonderful experience all around.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Night Before Early Flight,"Opted to stay at this hotel the night before an early morning departure as it was way more convenient than having to deal with hotel shuttles or Uber/Lyft so early in the morning.  You obviously cannot beat the convenience - it is literally right out the door of the terminal.  Picked up my luggage and was on the elevator to my room in about 15 minutes!  It was also very quiet.  Outside of that, nothing really to write home about for the price.  I thought the $395 rate was a little ridiculous, although it was my choice to pay it.  Was so tired so ordered room service - $30 for ramen noodles with veggies and chicken and a diet coke...bill came to $50 with delivery!  That was a little bit of a shocker.  In any case, if you are looking for super convenient and quiet and don't care about price, this is the place for you.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Welcome OASIS After A Tough Travel Day,"Location: If you are coming into Denver International late or leaving really early you can not beat this location. Literally right outside the terminal is this modern, quiet hotel.Price: There is a premium placed on convenience. This hotel does not really offer discounts and if it does they are hard to come by and small. You are paying for the location. Rooms: The rooms are quiet and comfortable, our room was well maintained, clean, modern and had everything we needed. Restaurant: This restaurant is not your standard hotel restaurant. The food was very good and in fact, our meal was a bright spot in an otherwise frustrating and long day. Staff: We found he staff cheerful and really went out of their way to be helpful, which was much appreciated.Other: Internet was free and water was provided at the front desk.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great addition to DIA, perfect for early morning traveling, clean, quiet, convenient, close to security!","We live in Boulder and normally would not stay at DIA but my daughter had an early morning flight so I thought we would have a staycation. The location is convenient for parking, flying, easy airport access, and security. We asked for a mountain facing room but ended up with an airport facing room and it was beautiful! The indoor pool is beautiful (for an indoor pool) and the workout room is nice! The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and modern! I do feel that the rooms should have a mini bar, and movies available on TV. There will be international travelers with jet lag and they would love to watch movies and have snacks from the mini bar!The staff and service are very nice! My only other comment is that the hotel is quite expensive but we would return again!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient and comfortable,"My family stayed at the Westin after a late evening arrival at DEN.  We appreciated the easy access from the terminal and comfortable, quiet room.  Although the price was a little high, it was preferable to navigating the rental car lines and driving into the city.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,My Favorite Airport Hotel in the United States!,"If you need to stay near DIA this is the place!  I love this hotel and have stayed several times since it opened.  The rooms are gorgeous, the hotel architecture is stunning, and the staff is excellent.  Rooms with north views look right into the security line so you can watch the crowds.  I was from my room to my gate in under ten minutes.  I highly recommend this hotel and will always return.  Drinks are both bars are a must!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wow Westin,"My wife and I decided to stay at the Westin the night before our flight to Puerto Rico the next day.  It was a beautiful hotel with clean, safe rooms and I was able to use my Marriott Rewards number there.  It sure beats the morning traffic.  Cannot wait to comeback!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Start or finish your trip here!,"We stayed at the Westin both before and after a trip to Europe.  It was wonderful to get a good night’s sleep and just walk into the terminal before a long flight.  It was even better to fall into bed after a long flight!  The Westin is a great way to start a vacation and to end one.  The beds are very comfortable, and the rooms are silent.  Great soundproofing!  We had a 90 minute drive to the airport, and staying at the Westin alleviated any traffic concerns.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"This hotel is a must stay, especially if you have an early morning flight.","First off, you can’t beat having a hotel just a baseball toss away from the Security check in at DIA. But that is just the start.  I was blown away at how clean and well designed the hotel is.  Amazing.  Over the top nice and friendly staff.  Everywhere! No matter where I turned a friendly/welcoming staff member was making me feel welcome.I sat at the bar with my wife and had some delicious appetizers that were served by a smiling friendly bartender.  The room? THE ROOM! Was amazing and the views of the planes taking off and landing was fun to watch.  I don’t think anyone grows out of watching this. I may start booking my flights early again just so I can rest the night before at this Westin.  Thank you Westin for building this property.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great building with appallingly slow service,"This hotel is a terrific building (fantastic location, looks architecturally smart, beautiful lobby bar area, nice rooms, great views of airfield), but:1. it had the longest line to check-in that I have ever seen, took about 40 minutes; they didn't have a line for SPG privileged members, which was probably a good thing, as I would've felt bad using a short line in front of everyone else2. there was no bell service for luggage, so as people endured that check-in scenario, there were suitcases and bags spread everywhere chaotically around the otherwise-nice lobby bar3. We were told it would be a half-hour to get a table for dinner, despite the presence of empty tables everywhere4. We were then told it would also be an hour wait for room service5. Despite being told that my final bill would be emailed to me, it still hasn't been, some 6 days laterThe one positive exception was Lexie in the lobby bar, who remembered our lengthy food and drink order correctly without even needing to write it down, made suitable recommendations, and brought everything quickly. They should put her in charge of the whole hotel (although more likely she will probably leave and move on to work somewhere more organized).This building has enormous potential, but it desperately needs new management. Perhaps Westin/Starwood need to get out of the way and let someone else have a go.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Perfect location, wonderful wheelchair service","I stayed at the Westin the night before my flight left Denver.  I had broken my leg in a ski accident, and wanted to ensure that I would be at the airport in plenty of time for my flight.  The staff was very accommodating --- the brought a wheel chair for me to the car, got me to the front desk and up to the room, and then, in the morning, arranged for me to be wheeled to the airline for my flight out.  Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Hotel - communication could be better,"It was a fluke, and one if our favor, that we ended up staying at The Westin. The room was great and the staff was pleasant, but when we checked out at 5:30 am and tried to collect our car to move it to DIA parking, it was a bit of a cluster. The valet was no where to be found and by the time we located an employee, it took them twice as long to find our car. Clearly it would have been easier for us to leave our car at The Westin, but the additional cost to do so can hardly be justified when you can park at the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Location, Location, Location","I stayed at the Westin DIA because my daughter was arriving at 12:30 a.m, and we both had to leave on a 5:30 a.m. flight.  We debated the $315 room price for the extra two hours of sleep we'd gain by not driving home and back: We chose to pay. The hotel rooms are nice: clean and modern, and the beds comfortable. The staff was friendly and our view of the terminal intriguing.  Typical Westin property. No complaints except that to pay for wi-fi these days is irritating, particularly since most hotels offer it, at least to their loyalty members (which we are) for free.  It all comes down to the money.  For location and convenience, you can't beat it. They have the monopoly on location, and they charge for it.  If I did it again, I'd check in earlier and take advantage of the view, the pool and the restaurants.  Checking in at 12:30 and out at 4:30 is kind of a bummer because had we stayed longer, I'm sure I would have appreciated it more.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The absolute worst - huge disappointment - NOT for families with small children!!!!!,"I would NOT recommend this hotel to families with children! This was one of my worst hotel stays ever. Booked a room with two queens to stay in for one night before catching our flight out of Denver the next day. The day of arrival, was told that we couldn't have a cot put into the room to accommodate a 3rd child. Something to do with fire codes. The staff person then offered to put us in a junior suite (for a higher rate, of course). I neglected to ask how many beds were in there, just assuming it would fit our needs because I had told her we didn't have enough beds in the other room with two queens. We get there and the associate tells us (after seeing our 3 kids) - ""you know the junior suite has only one bed, right?"" No, the person on the phone never told us that. Why on earth would she put is in a room with one bed, when the original room with TWO beds wasn't even going to meet our needs? Unbelievable. Thankfully we were able to be put back into the original room and they offered to give us an extra set of bedding so someone could sleep on the floor. Great. AND I noticed that instead of going back to the original rate of $319, they tried to sneak in the price of $459. Luckily I had my original email confirmation stating the rate of $319 and they switched it back (it was the same room). Even a rate of $319 is absolutely ludicrous for this type of tiny room. Also, given that this hotel is in the airport and obviously caters to travelers, I was astonished that they don't do more to make it easy to return your rental car. When I asked the lady at the desk whether they had a service to assist with that she looked at me like I had two heads. Couldn't even tell me directions to the Enterprise office, said I needed to figure that out myself. You'd think that they would make it a little easier since many people probably need to return a car who are staying there. We had to return it ourselves and take the shuttle back, same as at any other random hotel. When I went to look up the directions to the rental car office, I then found out that WiFi is $15 per day!!!!! Unreal!!!!! The ONLY good thing about this place was the proximity to the airport. I will avoid staying at another Westin from now on. Horrible service. The worst is that you cannot even call this place directly. Even the number listed as the hotel number goes to the main call center for Westin, and the people answering the phone have absolutely no customer service skills. Can't even remember how many times I was routed here and there trying to talk to someone to simply book my stay or ask a simple question. Got different answers from different people. Worst customer service I've experienced in a long time - the whole thing was a frustrating hassle from beginning to end! Do NOT recommend!!!!!",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,U14’s,"Love the atmosphere and convenience! This is our third stay. Second time the luggage delivery took almost an hour. The bellman was very personable and made up for the inconvenience. Check in was average. We have stayed before and looked forward to the big shower. We were given a room with a tub and without shampoo & conditioner. The restaurant is fine. Good food, but nothing special. The service could be improved-slow, uninterested and aloof. Service is not their priority.   For the price of the room, service could, without a doubt be improved upon, but would return for the convenience.  Value is not what it should be-definitely overpriced and checked out feeling under valued.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Huge disappointment!!!!,"Had to get up for a very early flight and thought it would be a nice experience and treat to stay at the Westin at DIA.  Little did I know that they had no water at the reception area for parched guests arriving at a mile high, they are terribly understaffed to the point that no one was available to answer calls from in house guest room phone, in-room dining took 1.5 hours after being told it would take 45 min to get a salad delivered, and no entertainment offered in room.  The food which was delivered after waiting 1.5 hours was incomplete to boot!!   When I finally called the local listing number for the Westin from my personal cell phone a manager answered and informed me that he was the only person available to answer the phones for the entire hotel......  Is that possible????? No front desk staff, no operator, no concierge to handle guest relations?  I have never been so disappointed and appalled by the unprofessional management of a hotel, especially a highly acclaimed Westin!  I will not recommend or stay at this property again with so many other fantastic choices at the airport.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,great option for a quick trip,"great service, great food, great design/atmosphere and only a short walk from the airport.   I stayed here two nights for a conference that was being held at the hotel.   Would def stay there again, highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Third stay,We try to stay here when we have very early flights and it helps a lot if I have a hotels.com free night. It’s hard to justify the cost of this hotel. It’s not extra friendly. It’s not super deluxe.It’s pretty cold and impersonal.The regular room that is generally around $300 is pretty typical for an airport hotel room and there are plenty of comparable rooms only 5 miles away for $150.I ordered birthday flowers and chocolate covered strawberries for delivery before arrival at 11pm. The flowers were from off property and beautiful and in room. The strawberries from the on site kitchen were not in room. I had to call at 11:15pm to find out what happened as they were paid for. We did find a bag of turkey in the room refrigerator from feb 19. This was March 3. Gross!,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great hotel if you are travelling in or out of DIA.,Great Hotel and nice rooms. We stayed here because we got in really late and were leaving early the next morning. I would say that the view is awesome and you hardly hear any planes coming or going out of the airport.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Modern chic with great location,"Wonderful experience at check in with the very accommodating desk young woman. I had booked the next day by mistake but she worked hard to help. I checked in early which was heavenly after a week of traveling. My room was clean with comfortable beds and p,easant view of airport white peaks and the Rockies. Got to my flight the next day by walking a few steps to the doors by security from hotel. You can also get on the train into the city right there. Wonderful American breakfast...enough for two.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Comfortable - Convenient - Upscale,"Arriving late on a delayed flight, this hotel was a jewel to settle into. The room was spacious, immaculate and decorated with modern, calm (but interesting) furniture. WiFi not free for non preferred guests, but stay was so good that didn’t feel too extortionate.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient.,Stayed overnight for an early morning flight. Our room had a beautiful view of the mountains. The rooms are spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed. There is easy access to airport ticketing. All in all a pleasant experience.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,spent a night before an early flight from Denver airport,The hotel was great.  Pool and spa area were relaxing.  Fitness area was also really nice with lots of equipment.  Hotel was very crowded when we were there but the service remained good.  Wait for room service was 2 hours but we were able to go to the hotel restaurant and pick it up in 30 min.  Food was good.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Pre flight must!,"We stay here when we’ve got early flights out of DIA. It’s very cool and modern with that signature Westin smell! Oh la la! We like the East wing as it has more of the airport view. Rooms are well appointed, as one would expect for the price. If you like to ice skate the rink is right outside the front doors!  Make use of their lobby bar to people watch. I forget the name of their in-house restaurant but it’s fab too.Try their deviled eggs! FYI great pours too.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Just wanted to sleep...,"The room was nice enough but our plan was to save some time and get some sleep before an early international flight with kids. The walls were so paper thin, that was impossible. We heard our neighbors talking as they walked down the hall to their door. Their door slammed and we thought that would be it, but no. They weren’t yelling by any means but we could hear their entire conversation clearly through the wall. Don’t stay here with any expectation of privacy or rest. Disappointing for the price paid...",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenience outweighs limitations, but expensive wifi","We stayed here due to a cancelled United Airlines flight. My wife booked online through Expedia and check in was smooth and efficient. It was surprised as a Starwood cardholder we didn’t get loyalty points for the stay as we didn’t book direct, but the rate we got was below rack rate.Room was very clean and well equipped as would be expected for this type of property in this price range.We found the shower somewhat challenging as indications for water flow, temperature and overhead/handheld were difficult to locate or decipher but trial and error did prevail.They charge $14.95 for their cheapest WiFi (which of course will attract sale# tax on top). This is very expensive and, given the cost of providing what is now an internationally accepted service, usury. In the end it was significantly cheaper for us to pay for a day data roaming - which is ridiculous",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"very modern, poor guest placement","Upon flying into Denver, you spot this futuristic hotel literally right across from the airport. Entering in, it's very stylish and modern, almost like a movie set. The minimalist decor is a nice change to fussy, color-overloaded others. Our room was nicely appointed and clean. However, a restaurant was being constructed directly underneath our room (we were on 6th floor, restaurant on 5th). We would hear very loud construction equipment before 7 am! When we inquired into this, it was stopped for a short while, but then continued throughout the day and each subsequent morning we were woken by this. Why would you place guests directly above a construction area? The hotel was most definitely not sold out, there were many other rooms available. I guess we should've just demanded that we be moved. Very frustrating!",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great location, nice and modern","Was diverted to Denver on a flight from SFO to EWR and had to book last minute. Conveniently located in Terminal. Looks like it was recently built. Modern, spacious, and clean rooms. Staff was friendly. Restaurant, bar and coffee shop on site. Internet worked well. One of the better airport hotels in the US. 4 stars because it is a little more expensive than it maybe should.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Average airport hotel ,"Stayed at the Westin again before my family’s morning flight. There is really nothing wrong with the place but having said that there is nothing else attractive other than it is linked to the terminals. Not many amenities for SPG members. Considering the fact that it is a airport location and most likely a favorite for business travelers, an executive lounge would definitely be a nice addition. Again, the location is a definite advantage but overall a bit pricey.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Futuristic, Clean, Convenient","We had a 6am international flight, so we decided to try out the new Westin at the airport and attached restaurant.  What a great choice!  It was so relaxing to check in the evening before departure, have a cocktail and a nice meal, and walk straight out to the terminal in the morning.  Check in was convenient and very smooth, the lobby bar has a great view of the airport, the rooms are clean and the bed was comfortable with a wide variety of pillow choices.  The restaurant was good and a bit pricey but typical for that type of locational.  Mediocre restaurant service, slow and seemed unhappy to be there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great location, nice and clean","This hotel was a very pleasant surprise. Rooms are modern, clean and fresh. Bathrooms are well appointed with “rain water” shower heads. Conference facilities were above average. Main restaurant had good/very good food and some nice wines/cocktails. Sundries shop was a bit disappointing, with a very limited inventory of accessories, but very good coffee.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Super convenient! Can’t beat location.,Our flights out of vail got messed up and we couldn’t fly back to Ny from there. We ended up driving to Denver to fly back to NY from there but couldn’t get on a flight until the next day.It was an extremely long day of travel and we got in late - but check in was seamless and the rooms were clean and well appointed. My kids seriously thought they were the luckiest kids ever to be able to stay in the airport - and the views were pretty awesome for them!We tried to go down for a late dinner but there was a wait and my kids were starving. We actually just walked into the airport and gave them dinner there! It may have not been ideal for me - but they were thrillllllled - and it was kind of a nice option to have!Breakfast was good and they had an extensive menu as well as a well stocked grab and go option. While we would have liked to have never needed to stay - it was a very pleasant experience and I would happily stay here again!,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Location,"Location, Location, Location This is great place to stay if you are flying in or out of Denver. The rooms are clean and quiet and the pool is also nice. A little limited on place to eat unless you want to leave the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,MSP flight canceled,This hotel is very nice along with a front desk staff that is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are very clean and large with nice amenities. Would highly recommend this hotel in Denver . You can get to your to your quickly as security is right by hotel entrance,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Late night/early morning stay,"Due to weather delay in Michigan, arrived in Denver 6 hours after original time so had decided to stay over at the Westin. We arrived at 3:30 am after being up for 22 hours. Hotel quoted us the rate but said if we waited another 40 min we could get a greatly reduced rate if we wanted to wait.  We made ourselves at home in their bright and very comfortable hotel lobby.  The night receptionist brought us bottles of water which we needed and said she would get us in our room as quickly as they could turn the computers over to the next day to get the day rate.   25 min later we were in our wonderfully comfortable king size bed.  Room was  great as were the lovely robes provided in the rooms. Great bathroom with large tiled shower and great bath products- for those of you like myself appreciate a nice roomy bathroom in hotels.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient and excellent,"I've had a fair amount of work in Denver over the past year and finally decided to stay at the airport after arriving rather than travel downtown. The Westin is SO great. It's ultra convenient to the airport (even when snowing you don't have to go in the snow!). The facilities are fantastic - comfortable and well-equipped rooms, excellent bar/dining options, and good fitness center (lap pool looks beautiful). Staff are friendly and efficient (even at ""rush hour"" regardless of when that is). I also love the airport views. I stayed three times in January 2018 and will definitely return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very nice hotel.,"This is a very nice hotel at the airport.  It’s is connected to the airport and is a 5 minute walk from your room to airport security check in.  It also has a train station attached to it so you can take a 30 minute ride to downtown Denver if you have time to kill before your flight.  You don’t hear planes taking off or landing.  They have a nice pool, workout room and jacuzzi.  The views from these places are very nice. I had a view if the airplanes and mountains on the 9th floor.  It was very nice for a standard room.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One of the Better Airport Hotels Around,"For an airport hotel this one does it well.  I paid a significant premium but the room is within a 5 minute walk of the security gates and also features decent amenities in terms of gym, restaurants and bars. Is it 3 times the hotel of those 5 miles down the road, no. It is a better hotel, certainly.I would definitely stay here again but I would also be cognizant of the premium over the nearby hotels and choose whatever is best for the particular trip.  It’s a nice hotel but not a luxury experience in my opinion.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Location the only merit for this hotel,"I had a weather related flight cancellation so called, booked,  and paid last minute from gate area.  I walked over to hotel which is very convenient.  Check in staff couldn’t find reservation.  She was very rude to me. Check in took a long time. My room was a king on the 7th floor.  At $359 I expected a very nice suite.  Instead It was very basic and poorly designed.  No tub, and very small curbless shower that leaked all over the floor.  The floors in the room.slope and there is no drain, so I had to mop standing water in front of sink. I checked in after midnight and maids stated knocking on door very early.  Check out staff rude too.  Honestly at $$359 for a poor experience I feel ripped offf.  I would recommennd taking a shuttle to a different hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice property but there are definitely some staff training issues,"We decided to stay at the airport as we changed our flight to an earlier one, after coming into denver for a funeral.  I asked for an accessible room, which after calling the hotel directly I was guaranteed.  We arrived from the rental area and I through that the hotel was connected by a walkway, but it was outside.  Walking with a crutch it is one long way to get to the lobby.  We checked in, I am a gold member, and was given a room key by a young woman at the front desk of 1159, in the west wing.  My wife, lugging two suitcases, I hobbled and she followed up to the 11th floor.  We looked at the numbers and saw there was not 1159...my wife went up and down the floor to look.  By an act of god, an employee came through the elevator as we went to the house phone and went back to the desk to get us our correct room, one floor down, 1004.  I do not understand how modern hotels put accessible, handicap, rooms at the end of hallways.....makes no sense at all.We then ordered room service at 7pm on this day 2/8 and was told it would be 30 to 40 minutes.  At 8pm we called down and they said 3 minutes more.  10 minutes later we called again and they said they were slammed and a bellman would be right there with our order.  He did show up and was a kind gentleman.  Unfortunately our order was missing the salads that they were suppose to be not the plates....I think for $100 room service order, or $10, someone needs to be checking the orders before they go out, as we did not get all that we should have and really did not want to wait to get the accompaniment what should have been on our plates.  No excuse for that...if they were slammed, then someone did not staff properly....I mean this is an airport hotel, nice enough and certainly for the price you pay, you should get what you pay for.  We did stay at the JW marriott in Cherry Creek for 2 nights prior to coming out here....they know how to run a property...and it is $100 less a night.Enough said, again a beautiful hotel, but not firing on all cylinders.  And since I use to manage properties, these things are an easy fix if departments are willing to put in the time and train properly.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Poor Service - Undisclosed Fees,One needs to enter through the airport parking lot if dropping off people.  You are allowed only 10 minutes before a fee is charged.  I was able to drop off two kids and two car seats but exited after 11 minutes.  I was charged $3 which the hotel refused to reimburse.  A $400+ per night hotel dinging me for $3 to essentially drop off guests seems wrong.,1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Massively overpriced and terrible sales service,"My wife spent more than 3 weeks trying to organise for us to be accommodated in a room that would allow us to watch the activity on the airport tarmacs. Clearly, this would involve being at an upper level and facing towards the airport. The sales staff seemed to not understand what this meant and kept offering the wrong type of room. Then there was the issue of trying to pay in advance for the room (which was the hotel's requirement). They couldn't take our credit card details over the phone or via email, we had to fill in a form (which they ultimately couldn't send us!!). Finally, we convinced them to take the booking and allow us to pay on arrival.On arrival and checkin, we went to our room, only to find it was on the OPPOSITE side of the hotel to the airport (facing the car parks) and on the LOWEST level!! My wife contacted the front desk and pointed out the failure and we eventually we given a room which ALMOST met our original requirements.The final insult was the bill. The price per night for the room was ridiculously expensive.The was the worst value-for-money experience in our whole 3 week Colorado holiday!",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One of the best hotels that happens to be at an airport,"Last minute my husband and I decided to fly out a day earlyso we booked our flight for an early morning and decided to stay at theWestin hotel at the airport.  What a wonderful hotel with excellent service,from Stephanie at the front desk Todd at the Grill and Vine restaurant we Could not have been more impressed.  It was a perfect ending to our time in Colorado.I Highly  recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Getting stuck in Denver is not a problem,We were forced to stay in Denver overnight when our flight was canceled. The Westin is at the terminal so we booked a room for the night.  We were greeted by Erika at the front desk with a smile and a very helpful attitude. She made our experience great with a great comfortable quiet room with an amazing view of the airport. If you are stuck at the Denver airport this is the place to stay,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Reconnect with my niece ,This was a wonderful place to stay for a few days after a nine stay in Breckinridge. Our family stayed in a beautiful home there for a ski retreat for a family reunion. I stayed a few days to see my niece I hadn’t seen for 4 years.  We had a great time.  The rooms at the Westin were do comfortable and zen like.  The food was fantastic at the restaurant and the drinks were fantastic. The staff was amazing at making our stay so very comfortable. My flight was on a Friday and this was perfect so I didn’t have to worry about the weather and not missing my flight.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Westin Denver airport is a great hotel for an airport layover,"Beautiful modern new hotel. zen decorated modern rooms. iIstopped there for the day on an 8 hour layover.  They had a day rate, really reasonable.  Very clean with upscale king bed, linens. huge modern bathroom. Soundproofed rooms, so you don't hear the landing aircraftsThere is not much to see near the airport, it is out in the middle of nowhere.  I didn't use it, but the concierge said the train to downtown Denver is $9.00 return and 30 minutes, much faster than a cab or uber.  You could actually stay here and tour Denver thru the day.The hotel itself has large open ares, an IT center lounge, Starbucks on the lower level. And a full restaurant.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Zen Space,"This place is super convenient.  You touchdown in Denver an the hotel is out the door of the airport.  Low stress!  Check-in was fast and easy and checkout bins are outside the elevators...just stick your card in and be out!  They seem to think of everything...they have an offering to give you workout gear if you forgot yours. They have a lavendar scented balm to help aid in restful sleep by your bedside.  The room was nice and even though it is by an airport, it is surprisingly quiet.  They have lots of healthy food options.  This place just puts you in a good space.  I enjoyed it.  Almost forgot I was there in a business capacity!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Not Worth Your Money!,"Our experience from start to finish was horrid! Husband and I arrived late from Cabo and went to check in. We were told we were already checked in (not possible) and when we argued the clerk told us it was being shared with someone else (what the hell?) when it turns out she read my name (reservation was under my husbands) and assumed I was a stranger (we dont have the same last name like plenty of other couples). So once we rectified that we were given keys and no clue which wing to go to or that the key would be needed to use the elevators (just not the 5 star service you expect from such an expensive place). Once we entered our room it was a bit confusing, it was dark since it was late and i went to walk down the hallway but walked into a bathroom, once we found the lights and got settled the room was nice. We walked to the airport for supper and returned to find that Wifi is an additional cost (usually included in resort fees etc that we have previously paid) so we were unable to connect to our families waiting back home (no international data plans). Figured we would watch some TV and go to bed, the TV guide had no information available for any channel and it was a complete guessing game. The bed was uncomfortable, sheets felt itchy and pillows very thin. Once we awoke to fly home, we checked out and were asked how our champagne and strawberries were (we were on our honeymoon) but we had never received anything (which is fine but sad when you hear you were supposed to receive them). The clerk was sad that she had taken the reservation and set everything up for our surprise only to find out no one followed through. All in all one of the worst hotel stays we have had (and the most expensive one on our trip)",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fabulous and oh so convenient!,"I flew in on a very late flight to attend the bridal shower the following day for my daughter-in-law to be.  The location right inside the airport was extremely convenient as I was only going to grab a few hours of sleep before my son picked me up.  (I refused to inconvenience him so late the night before.). Front desk staff were impeccable, professional, I formative and personable.  The room was beautifully appointed and quiet as can be.  I am a very light sleeper and was very pleasantly surprised at the level of soundproofing - I heard absolutely nothing!  I would highly recommend this venue! I look forward to my next stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,In the airport,"I will work this review backwards.From the time I left the hotel till I made it to my gate probably took 5 minutes, having TSA made it that much faster. Nothing like staying at an airpot hotel tat actually sits on the airport.I found it odd that the hotel bar was right next to the check in counter, it was difficult to hear the receptionist.The hotel was nice an clean, not to many amenities but enough to get by.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Location for Business Travelers,"Great location - connected to the DIA and just a few steps to the security lines. If you have meetings planned in Denver and you are just passing through, you can meet them in the hotel restaurant or coffee shop. Great place to stay if you are just passing through or a short stop for a business meeting.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great place to stay for an early flight,"We decided to give the Westin a try as we had a very early international flight. Modern, clean and contemporary is how I'd describe the property. We had dinner at the only restaurant in the Hotel - Grill and Vine (reviewed separately). From our room we had a great view of the canopy covering the airport - very unique perspective. Of course, location was awesome for our early flight ... we woke up, packed, showered, dressed and were standing in security line within 30 minutes. Rooms are pricey, but with SPG frequent miles the rate was reasonable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,waited out the storm,"I live in the mountains was driving to Denver early a.m. to beat the storm with plans to stay at the Westin and fly out the next day. I got a text from United saying most flights were expected to be canceled or seriously delayed due to snow, ice & frigid temps.  So I quickly rebooked my flight and reserved an additional night at the Westin! Such a Beautiful hotel room was spacious with a great view from the 13th floor, the amenities were nice & the bed was absolutely divine and I am very picky when it comes to mattress comfort!!  and it was quiet with no airplane noise.  and had a Ball!  yummy meals, the burger was huge, great service and staff.  swam in the pool and shopped in the terminal, an odd experience. Who really browses through the stores unless their flight is delayed haha!my only complaint is the cost of parking in the lot at $33 or $24 self-park.I wonder when DIA is going to figure out how to enclose the walkway from the terminal to the Hotel and/or Transportation center. not so efficient to Schlep through the elements with your luggage.  it was icy, snow covered and COLD.  Ugh.However this hotel is fabulous I would come back again and again I didn’t come back for a little tonight vacation and not fly out the next day anyway good job with the Westin I am in SPG member and I appreciate everything you all do at of your hotels 😀",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Splendid stay!,"I stayed overnight to avoid 4:00 AM driving to the airport in the snow. Hotel is beautiful,staff is extremely helpful and food was great. I plan to do this again the next time I have an early early flight out the next day. Check out the pool and fitness areas too. Quite good.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice hotel but BONEHEAD entry.,"The new Westin at DIA is like walking into a futuristic movie set.  It's mostly white with interesting designs.  The rooms are pretty nice with large windows (ours was looking away from the airport).  The people at the front desk were very nice.  Now for the bonehead part - you walk from the terminal to the hotel uphill (not a huge incline), but outside!  We negotiated the 50 or so yards (uphill, remember) on a VERY icy path, in the wind, after it had snowed.  The snow had not yet been removed, and it was so icy that my husband fell twice while towing luggage.  This is a liability suit waiting to happen, in my opinion.  Also, for people staying there with early morning flights (as ours was), there is no place to eat at 3 am - not in the Westin or in the airport.  We couldn't eat or get coffee until we landed in Houston.  I like the hotel itself, so it received 4 stars, but I was wavering between poor and average for the entry and the lack of food for early flights.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Everything was wonderful,"The front desk was very knowledgeable and quick to check me in. I loved the room with the view of the terminal. The bed was wonderful.  I only stayed one night but it was great. My only concern was the fee for WIFI. For the price of the room I’d have thought it would be included. Many hotels in the area include it in their price. Overall, my stay was very nice and convenient  to the terminal.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,ultraconvenient,"decided to beat the snowstorm and booked the hotel on short notice.  The hotel is very new, a bit Spartan in décor but well appointed. Rooms are spacious, got upgraded to a suite.  The main lobby has a bar, limited wine selection and bar food.  There is another restaurant on site with middle of the road food. Luckily we had eaten in Denver before checking in. I was expecting something a bit more upscale considering the overall elegance of the hotel.   You can drop your bags (at this time United Premier class only) on the lower level avoiding the main terminal.  There is a nice pool and hot tub next to a typical Westin Workout.  One other minor issue-if you drive up in your rental car and spend more than 10 minutes you will get charged $3 to ""park"" (I got checked in and left for the rental return in 15)",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Nice hotel, convenient. ","We had to grab a room as we were stuck in Denver due to weather.  Very convenient not having to shuttle somewhere off airport property.Staff was very friendly.Room was nice (standard do double queen). I have gotten much more room for the money.  I only paid that much for the convenience (worth it).We ate at the restaurant (Grill and Vine).  The bartender, Jose was great.  The flatbreads were pretty decent.  We had a bottle of the Cab made for them.  Was not bad for the price. When talking to our airline about what they could help with (because of our delay), I found it interesting that the voucher for room discount they offered was not honored by the Westin. We were in and out and did not get to use all of the facilities.  It is a very nice contemporary building. Super clean. If I ever get stuck at the airport again, I’ll be happy to stay there !!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Considerably better than you expect.,"The Westin at Denver Airport is considerably better than the run of airport hotels. First, its really convenient and is almost part of the terminal building. Recently, I was a "" walk in"" and found the staff to be very friendly and helpful as they found me a room. The standard and finish of the room was better than you find -- for example-- in the airport hotels at LAX, and much ahead of anything I've found in New York. The only airport hotel that is easier to get to is the one in Miami, but that is old and suffers from other complaints.However, the restaurant is a bit mundane and lacks any character. I sat at the bar, where the staff were again friendly and helpful and the food was quite good, even a little adventurous. Wine by the glass was very good.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Surprise!,"Who knew you could find a high class hotel in an airport?! My son and I were on a college visit and had a 7:00am flight out of Denver. I didn't want to deal with dropping off the car in the morning, so I opted to drop it off at night and take the shuttle to the hotel. It was so easy.  We had a lovely dinner and a relaxing time at the pool/hot tub and went to bed. The morning TSA was so speedy that we had more than enough time for our flight.The hotel is completely worth the extra bucks.  It was clean, stylish, and the staff were top notch.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Really good hotel poor restaurant.,"Situated just outside the main terminal, just 1 minute across a covered walkway. Very modern, friendly staff, great bedrooms, gym pool etc. The main restaurant is really poor for this quality of hotel, serving disappointing food from a disappointing menu. I was also charged for wifi when checking out which should have free for Westin Club members.It's a nice place to stay , look elsewhere to eat.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient modern airport hotel,"2 mins walk from the main terminal at Denver International.  Modern, clean rooms. Very comfortable beds.  Convenient coffee shop on ground level.  Restaurant seemed popular although we did not have a chance for any meals. Friendly and efficient check in.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Can't Get Any Closer To The Airport,"At most airport hotels you have to take a shuttle to get to and from the airport.  At he westin you literally walk out the door and walk into the airport. This makes it perfect for very early flights.  The hotel is ultra modern and has everything that you need.  The bar is nice, the food is good and the pool and hot tub are great. The beds are so comfortable that I never want to get up but I must sinc eI have an early morning flight.  The only con is that it is rather expensive.  We always get a military discount and that does help.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great bar food and wifi,Had a long wait between client arrivals. Westin staff is always a pleasure to work with. The hotel bar in the lobby has great paninis and WiFiThey even let me borrow a charger when mine didn’t work.Nice quiet place to catch up on work.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Horrific front desk service ,"After skiing and driving for hours we were excited to check in at the Denver Westin hotel and go to sleep. Unfortunately the service at the front desk is atrocious. The man who checked us in looked like he was high and hadn't showered in month. He was rude and slow and most definitely challenged in the intellect. Check in took forever and was very unpleasant. Finally we were given a room one floor above check in. It was 20 rooms to the end of the hallway. We finally arrived to find a note that our luggage had been attempted to be delivered but we weren't there. Of course we weren't there. We were still checking in. I went to open the door and the key didn't work. Back all the way to the front desk where now 8 people were waiting in line to check in. I told the same dirty front desk man that our key didn't work and he seemed surprised and handed it back. I assured him that I needed 2 new keys and they needed to work this time. I went all the way back. And IT DIDNT WORK AGAIN!  For the 3rd time I went to the lobby. I requested a manager. When he called the manager, I could hear him on the other end of the line saying he didn't want to come! Unbelievable. When he finally did come he lied to my face about saying that he didn't want to come. I asked for an upgraded room and didn't receive one. These people are a joke. They are not Westin quality. Somehow hiring and managing has gone completely wrong here. Corporate - please replace and retain!!! Avoid this place whenever possible.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect kick off to vacation ,"Even though we live just outside of Denver, the prospect of a 6 AM flight was not appealing considering the travel involved. The Westin was a perfect solution for us. It is expensive, it is beautiful, the rooms are luxurious with great bedding and amenities. We enjoyed our dinner very much at the in-house restaurant and are looking forward to our 4 AM wake up call.For those early-morning flights, I think this will become a ""must do"" for us as a stress-free luxurious way to begin our vacations.Having read the previous reviews, I do not understand why anyone would think that the staff was a less than well-trained and gracious; they met every need or request we raised in a thoroughly professional and cordial manner.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent location,"The hotel, room, and personnel were excellent.  Hotel was clean and well maintained, the room was well appointed, clean, and comfortable. The personnel were helpful and attentive. Enjoyable was watching the planes depart and arrive.  The room  was very quiet considering the hotel is on DIA property.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Terrible service,"The whole point of staying at an airport hotel is for the convenience. This hotel is so disorganized, understaffed, and completely inconvenient. We checked in at 6:30 pm after driving 4 hours from Steamboat. Our kids, ages 4 and 6 were hungry and tired. We waited 2.5 hours for our luggage to come to the room. We called twice and they said they would send it. Finally we went and brought it to the room ourselves, which is what we should have done when we checked in. We are Starwood Gold members, which clearly didn’t help one bit.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient and interesting design ,"As an SPG member, this Westin is not up to the usual standard that I have come to expect from the brand.   However, I was here on an evening when the hotel was close to capacity.Check in was exceptional, and I was graciously upgraded to a business class room on a higher floor.   I was greeted warmly, and appreciated that level of attention after a long day of travel. The corridor and elevators reeked of pot.   I am not so keen on being greeted by smoke, medicinal or not.   The walls felt thin, and we heard a lot from our neighbors.  The housekeeping staff had left behind a rag, and not replaced the daily waters.   These were minor irritants, but would have been a real disappointment if I had paid rack rate for my room.  I would stay here again for an off-hour flight- as it's directly across from security.   Overall, it was a nice property on a rough night.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Hotel Over rated,"This is a very expensive hotel with few amenities. No free parking for your trip and loud noisy hallways and doors. dogs barking and kids crying. I suggest that you stay off airport ground where parking is free, shuttle into the terminal at half the price per night at the Westin.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Last minute stop,"After we were stranded at the airport, we were very happy to have a hotel just across the street from the airport. Probably only 30 meters away. Nice rooms. Good service. Good food. If you’re at the airport and must stay close. It is a perfect choice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Overnight stay made easy,"We had to stay at this hotel as our flight got cancelled due to winter storm. It is really a nice hotel which is right at the airport and very very practical for an overnight stay. The room is great, very spacious, with very modern decoration. There is a good restaurant at the hotel or you have great room service as well. The best part is the gym or the great swimming pool. Highly recommend for a connection out of Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Super convenient and clean ,We booked 3 rooms for the family after flying in to Denver. They let our son check in early when he arrived which we thought was wonderful. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly. It was a quick visit so not much more to say. We did eat breakfast in their restaurant and really enjoyed it. Pricey but worth it for the convenience. Literally grab you luggage and walk through another door and you’re there.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great in an emergency,We ended up stranded in Denver after a flight cancellation. It was so amazing not to have to deal with a shuttle to and from a hotel. There is also a nice bar and restaurant right there. They also have a free ice skating rink but we didn’t have time. Rooms were nice and service is friendly. It is a bit expensive but there are times you are tired and willing to pay for convenience.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Anniversary trip,"We stayed at the Westin Denver airport on the day before our trip home. The location is perfect...... right next to the airport. The restaurant on the fifth floor was good, check in went smoothly, room was comfortable and very clean. The gym has everything you need for a great workout. All the staff from check in to check out were friendly and accommodating. We would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,All airport hotels should be like this...,"Ok, so from the sounds of things I really enjoyed my overnighter here at the Westin prior to my early morning flight. Hotel cannot get any closer to the airport. Dropped the rental the night before and only had to walk a couple hundred feet to the airport entrance. Nice winter touch - There is an ice rink at the entrance if you have some extra time. So the hotel. Great front desk staff. Ask for a room facing away from the big tent roof of the airport if you are going to be there for a while. Room was comfortable with nice lounge for a view of the sunset and mountains. Food was great. Also note they do have early room service that starts at 5am. So if you have that early flight you can get some food.  Bathroom was clean with finally, a shower door that prevents a wet floor. Internet was great as well. No issues. Will stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great location for airport hotel,"We arrived Denver airport at around midnight, exhausted. After a short walk from baggage claim and a quick check in, we got the rest we so needed. The room was spacious and clean. Beds were big and comfortable. Great location. It was very nice to be able to just walk to the hotel after the long flight. I also love how we could just walk to the train to get to Denver. Definitely will stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Poor communication,"The hotel does not communicate on how they charge for cars.  Traditional hotels charge by 24 hour periods where this hotel does it by noon each day.  This was not communicated when I booked, followed up before staying, during my stay or when I checked out.  Poor performance Westin.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Last Stop on the Way Home,"If you are flying in or out of Denver - these is a great place to settle your head before that early flight out or to relax after a long flight in.  A short walk from the terminal, beautiful modern rooms, great service and really comfortable beds make this worth the cost.  We were able to drop off our rental car, get dropped at the Westin's front door and relax for the evening before the 6:15 am flight.  My only regret is that we only stayed one night.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Worst Westin I've stayed at!,"I recently stayed at this Westin hotel as it was the most convenient hotel (it's a 2 minute walk from the terminal instead of taking a shuttle bus to the other hotels). The hotel itself doesn't have the same comfort of the Westin brand. Most disturbing was the lack of honesty and customer service. When I checked in, their entire system was down so they took a credit card imprint. At this point reception refused to write down my loyalty number and deferred until my check out the next morning. The room was spacious, but the heater/AC fan was incredibly loud and I had no way to shut it off. It was very late and I chose to not wait for a maintenance person. Needless to say, I didn't get a good night sleep -- it wasn't even clear to me that the fan noise was from my room versus something associated with the building. The internet was up but I was unable to log in since they didn't have me registered in the system as staying in my room. When I inquired about this the front desk was clueless and did not have a conference code I could use!  Finally when I checked out, their system was still down and they couldnt or wouldn't give me a receipt of any kind. I asked that they send it to my email and it took awhile for the person to write it down correctly. I then asked him to write down my loyalty number so they could enter it. I had to ask 3 times and he eventually did it reluctantly. If I had the time to wait for a manager, I would have demanded a refund. Needless to say, I will not stay the hotel again. I still have not recieved a reciept by email after 36 hours!",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Top-Notch Site for Meetings,"We organized a small meeting (~30 attendees) at this Westin and it went off without a hiccup. The catering was delicious. The attention we received from the event staff was terrific. All of the audio-visual needs, seating, and the like, were set up well in advance and any changes requested were handled expediently and graciously. The guest room accommodations were perfect for a meeting venue. I highly recommend this site for small meetings.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best place to spend a layiver,"For half the overnight rate, we were able to rent a room for a six hour layover. It was glorious!The hotel and rooms are beautiful, the beds are dreamy, and we used their incredible pool, hot tub and exercise facilities. I’ll be looking to book another extended layover just to stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Still Fresh and Convenient,"Location: This is literally the only hotel right at the airport terminal. If you don't want to take a skanky shuttle from a sub-par hotel 15 miles away - stay here. Not only is The Westin Denver International Airport located right on-site at the airport, but it has the RTD University of Colorado A Line train that runs every 15 minutes at peak times and every 30 during non-peak times to/from Union Station in Downtown Denver. Super convenient and cheap.Service: The service at this hotel isn't honestly that special in comparison to other comparable Marriott and SPG brand hotels - I was fortunate enough, however, to be granted an upgrade to a Junior Suite due to my SPG Gold status. Thanks, Westin!Room: Junior Suite (Corner)I can't say enough about how awesome the Junior Suite at this Westin is. Both the sleeping/living area and bathroom are massive. There was one king bed, a lounge chair, standard chair, desk, two nightstands, a TV stand with ottoman, and a king bed. The windows wrapped around two sides of the bedroom and afforded great views of the Rocky Mountain range and the airport runway. The bathroom was very spacious with a large vanity, soaking tub, walk-in shower, and toilet - again, there were massive floor to ceiling windows. The room was clean and the furniture had no damage, still appearing like-new. Conclusion: After staying in both Traditional Rooms and Junior Suites, both are splendid and I totally recommend this hotel. Would I come back?: Yes, without a doubt.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,WORST WI FI EVER,"Yes, the location can't be beat. I've stayed there seven times and the wifi suks. Yes, they know this and have been told many times. They simply don't care. In addition, there is a charge for using the work/office area. This is almost unheard of in today's travel world.When regulating a wake up call, make sure to ask the person's name. I had two back to back stays with no wake up call.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Heard a lot of good feedback, and it was accurate","I finally had the opportunity to stay at the Westin for a business meeting after trying to secure the venue a few times in the past. It was well worth it. The staff was proactive and hospitable and the architectural design is stunning. Food was very good and everything went smoothly - meals, check-in, comfortable and very clean rooms, etc. The fitness center overlooks the airport and the Rocky Mountains, which makes working out a bit more enjoyable. I had dinner at the on-site restaurant (Grill & Vine) which was very good - with friendly and timely service. The hotel also is constructed above a train that can take you into downtown Denver in 35 minutes for $9 (round trip). If you have time, it's worth the ride. In sum, if you want to be near the airport and like that convenience, this is great choice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient spot for Early AM flight,"I booked a room for our family knowing we had a 5:30am departure the following morning. We fly in & out of DIA often but this was the first time we took advantage of the Westin. Convenient location & super comfy beds. We enjoyed the selection of starters and snacks at Grill & Vine while there. Nice wine selection too, my husband & I had the Malbec. The kids menu offered good choices for our children which made me happy since I was not interested in them having a $22 burger.My husband & kids enjoyed the pool. In hindsight I wish I had explored the fitness center but it was a quick trip. We will definitely stay here again. Please consider opening Starbucks early for those of us with crazy Early flights. 5am was not early enough for us, but we  made coffee & tea in our room.I am a platinum Marriott member & converted points to make this a free night. Best decision instead of a2 alarm to drive to DIA for our flight.",4

Food was ""ok""; service was rather indifferent and not terribly attentive, which was surprising since it was not busy.SUMMARY:You don't stay here if your goal is to spend time in downtown Denver. There are other good options there. But if you need to stay at the airport, especially for early morning flights, I would highly recommend this property.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great conference stay,Visited Westin Denver for a conference recently and it was a great stay.  The hotel is attached to the airport and the design is really funky and modern.  The rooms were nice and clean.  We are at the restaurant multiple times and despite having a captive audience the food was pretty good.  Conference spaces were nice as well.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent hotel right next to the Airport,"Extremely convienient stay at this hotel. Everything was just fine. From the time you land into Denver and just walk into the hotel, the check-in , room , conference facilities. Everything was perfect.I must highlight being a vegetarian, i was thoroughly surprised that the veg food was Great.A good view from airports with flights taking off and landing however not disturbing noise.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,“Heavenly” as sand paper,"We used to love the “Heavenly” towels, sheets, robes, etc. But things have clearly changed. The sheets didn’t fit the bed properly (too small for the large mattress) and were tired and dirty, the towels were heavily used and very scratchy. The robe was gross looking! The room fee was normal, but you get nickel and dimes at every turn. $10 for 3mb internet (LTE is 9mb currently). 24% “room service” fee on top of overly priced food items. We asked if the guy who brought it up gets that fee as a tip and he said “no.” So, we ended up paying $85 for two “eggs and ham” breakfasts after the fee and tip.  Overall the old Westin experience is dead and gone. Stay elsewhere if you can.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Pay for Convenience,"I stayed here as part of a conference. My company footed the bill, but I was shocked when I booked to hear the $475 a night price tag (before taxes and fees). I expected to see diamond crusted wallpaper or a gold leafed toilet. ;) The room was clean, large, but very average. I will say, you can't beat the convenience of walking out of the terminal and into the hotel. However, you are miles away from downtown with really nothing else nearby. Also, the hotel is very well insulated against any jet noise. I never heard one plane over the 3 days and 2 nights I was there.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent Airport Hotel,"Perfectly located airport hotel in very short walking distance from the terminals. Modern hotel with spacious rooms. Good reception service. WLAN was not free. There was a free bottle of water. Couldn’t try the breakfast. Overall, quite expensive.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Nice hotel, Space-Age Design!","This hotel has a beautiful mostly white and glass lobby with small splashes of color here and there. The design is very modern space age. Loved the extremely short walk from my room to airport  terminal. My room was very spacious and looked out over the airfield and white peeked tenting on the terminal. Bathroom was very neat and clean as was the bedding, Super comfy bed and pillows. Friendly staff and great room service. We ordered  fantastic burgers.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Expensive, but very nice",Very nice hotel. Super convenient to the airport - just walk right out the door and you are there. Quiet and very spacious rooms/very clean. The bar seems quite popular. Unfortunately it is right where check in is and can be loud. Excellent choice if you have a late night arrival or early morning departure.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Conveniently Located and Beautiful new(ish) Hotel That Still has some Service Issues,"Spent one night at the beautiful Westin at Denver's Int'l Airport a few weeks ago. It's pricey (you pay for the convenience as it is the only hotel right in front of the terminal) but money worth spent if you like modern design and the upscale atmosphere and interior of a Westin hotel. While the design is very cool, the rooms feel a little too scarcely decorated for my taste. The food at the restaurant is tasty but come with NYC prices attached. The pool and gym areas are wonderful. Don't forget your swimsuit! The only slight issue I had was the service. I have read about problems with the service when it opened (1 or 2 years ago?) and compared to what I read the service did get better, however I encountered still plenty of clueless faces among the staff when it came to find our meeting room in the system and the check out was not as smooth as it could have been (verifying pre-payment of the room and releasing the amount held for incidentals). Also the bathroom was not fully stocked with all toiletry articles (which a quick call to housekeeping solved). For the high price (of roughly $360/night) one should be allowed to expect flawless service.  All in all I would definitely return but I hope that the minor service hiccups will be ironed out as the young and friendly staff gets more experienced..",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The Ultimate Non-Airport Hotel Airport Hotel,"Just a superb place.  Sleek, modern but not at all the dark, must-wear-black, groovy beat hotels that are all the rage these days.  I was there for two nights for a conference.  Going to Denver and then never ""leaving the airport"" felt like a bummer, but I never even noticed that I was caged up for two days and two nights.  Nice food selections, great room and bathroom, and very courteous staff.  Oh and you could not hear the airplane noise at all.  The kicker:  I had a migraine so wanted to lie down before heading out, but it was just before noon checkout.  I called down and explained my situation and asked for an extra hour.  She gave me 90 minutes.  Stuff like this matters!Great experience - I'll be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great place to stay for early flights,"This hotel is within walking distance to the security area for Denver International Airport.The building has all the Amenities you expect from a Westin. Waterfall shower head, clean and comfortable room, amenities such as an exercise area, bar and restaurant (and valet parking if your lifestyle requires it).We stayed here because we had an early flight back to East Coast the next morning. Staying here makes sense so you don't have to get up early to drop off a rental car / wait for cab/uber and then drive to the airport. Overall, it was a pleasant stay.",4

So excited!Thanks Natasha for going over and beyond to ensure our stay is comfortable and relaxing.Jacquie",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,In for family wedding overnight stay.,"We booked this hotel since it is next to airport and we knew we would be going to a wedding/wedding reception and leaving on a very early morning flight the very next day.   The Westin is very nice, very clean, sleek design and very cool views.   Everyone at the hotel we briefly encountered were very nice and helpful.  Well worth it for an 8:30 am. departure the morning after a wedding reception with family to be a few steps from the airport. Take an Uber downtown but stay at the airport!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The Best and most Beautiful Airport Hotel So Far!,"After reading the reviews on TA on this property and having an early flight back home(5am) this was a no brainer.  The hotel has one of its kind of architecture, which combined with the airport architecture it compliments the environs. The hotel and its rooms is minimalist with Scandinavian wood style furniture(kind of retro), which was perfect. The rooms have soundproofing and very but very comfortable beds. As a matter of fact, the amenities were very complete and the Westin mantra of eat well and its recommendations were superb. The restaurant Vine & Grill did not disappoint us as the food was superior to other airport hotels(including Westin airport hotels in other locations)I wouldn't mind staying at this hotel as a stopover or as a 2 day layover",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,An experience,This was great for an early morning flight out. Was extremely convenient to the airport shops when we wanted to wander later in the evening.  Stayed with my sister and more than enough room for the 2 of us.  The kinetic sculptures out front were interesting as were the solar dog houses on display.  We had dinner at the 'in house' restaurant and our burgers were perfect.  Hot tub and pool had a great view. On the down side...was not impressed with the bartender at the lobby bar (ignored us) and the AC was very loud.  All in all...would do it again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Oh wow!!!!,"Absolutely spectacular experience! Never mind the convenience factor, this place is just mint! I happened to get a stunning suite (always happens when it's just one night) and I really didn't want to leave. Dinner at the restaurant was excellent with high quality beef and an excellent wine selection. The mattress was perfect and there was 100% noise isolation. Everything about this property shined. This was probably the best in-airport hotl I've ever stayed at and certainly one of the best overall Thank you Westin DIA! (SPG Platinum Guest)",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great property but be careful,"I have had the privilege of working two meetings at this hotel and I have to say it is so convenient for meetings.  The hotel is new, and edgy, and the food venues are great.  You need to try the spaghetti squash pomodoro at the Grill and Vine...it is outrageous! The banquet staff is great especially Johnny.  Johnny was very attentive to my guests and the meals we had for the group went seamlessly because of his help.  The only issue we had happened twice....both times that I worked the property.  Changes are VERY expensive.  I had a major change the first time, and I was surprised by the amount of the charge, but understood the reason.  This past time, I asked for a simple room set change and was told that it would be $1000.00 to change the set from 32 theater seating to a U shape for 20. I could have done it myself, but I was told I couldn't because of ""liability""  After expressing my concern for the charge, it was removed, but it still left a bad taste in my mouth.  The property is so perfect, but justifying charges like that to my client is difficult and it makes it hard to recommend the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wow What a Lobby. And Lavender!  Gotta Love Westin.,"Beautiful Beautiful Hotel.The Lobby was just spectacular.So sleek and so modern, but with a warmth about it.  Exactly my style.Our room overlooked the infamous white Denver Airport Canopies and right into the glassed wall airport.So convenient.  I literally walked right out of the airplane, thorough the Gate, and within minutes was walking into the hotel.The night we stayed there, they had a beer garden set up just outside of the hotel.  With twinkle lights and some games, and tables.  Very neat.Such nice touches, the Westin never disappoints. They even had a little vial roller-ball of Lavender by the bed to ensure a ""relaxing sleep"".Ahhhh.  Gotta Love Westin.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Delightful overnight,"My room was on a 7th floor corner. Very comfy. Great view. Quiet. I could see planes , but not hear them. Restaurant was very nice for both dinner and breakfast. Check in is on the sixth floor. A bit unusual, but works. Advise ,valet parking.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,If you have to stay at the airport...,"Although it made me sad that my meeting was being held at the Westin airport conference center, the hotel was nice enough that it made me miss all the offerings of Denver proper a little less.  The entrance is about 10 strides from the main terminal exit of the airport, so in terms of convenience to the airport, it really couldn’t be any better.  It is a nice hotel with a modern all white lobby and bar area and windows cover nearly 100% of the walls.  The room was spacious and with a nice bathroom (pictured) with dual shower heads that Westin’s have.  The room had a refrigerator and a nice sized TV.  Points deducted for charging for standard WiFi, though.  I didn’t hear any airplanes from my room so it is very well insulated against noise.  The train station runs though the bottom of the hotel so if you do have time to make the long trek into the city, that is a convenient option.  I stayed on the sixth floor which is the lobby level, and that had access to the elevator bay that sends you right down to the conference center level.  This made running back to my room during he conference really convenient.  In summary, if you have to stay at the airport, it would be hard to imagine a better option.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing customer service,"I have worked in the hospitality industry for over 15 years and this is by far the best customer service I have experienced.   My daughter and I were lucky to stay at the Westin DIA before we left for a family vacation and she left her favorite stuffed animal in the room.  She was so sad and I called to see if they found him and they did.   I travelled back to the airport today on my way out of town to pick him up and received the best surprise.   Shout out to the Operations team at Westin DIA for making my daughters day and going above and beyond. I will always stay at this hotel when traveling in and out of Denver.   So convenient, rooms are outstanding and the customer service is excellent!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Super Convenient,"We were very happy with our stay at this hotel. The check in process was very smooth for us and only took a few minutes. The lobby was a little strange how the front desk was located. We walked through a few times and the check in line would be blocking the passage way. Although we did not get to enjoy the pool or gym facilities, they looked nice and clean. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The bed was amazing, which made for a great nights sleep.We will always stay here when we have an early flight out of Denver, as it is convenient to wake up and walk to security within minutes.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Overpowering Perfume!!! ,"Nice newer hotel... but there is an OVERPOWERING perfume smell in the lobby and especially in the room that is giving me a headache!  I called the operator to see if there was anything I could do, but was told the perfume is in everything... the rug shampoo, the sheets, everything.  I'm assuming it's being piped in the air ducts as well.  It's WAY TOO MUCH!!!  I can't wait to leave to get a breath of fresh air.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"If you were any closer, you'd already be in the plane but you would not sleep nearly as well.","I had a 7 am Delta (domestic) flight during a winter storm warning. At 6:00 am I was drinking coffee in my room, watching the TSA line to gauge how long that would take. At 6:10 I took the elevator down one floor, walked about 300 feet across a breezeway and directly into the security line. At 6:30 I was boarding my plane. It does not get any mre convenient than that! So if you have an early flight and/or a big storm as I did, the convenience alone is worth the extra money you'll pay to stay hear.Convenience aside, it's still a very nice hotel for the price. The pool and fitness room are on the 11th floor, where you'll have a great view of all the airport insanity below. The pool is not very big, but it is clean and well maintained. It is a saline pool so it is more refreshing and easier to clean up after, compared to chlorine. I did not eat at their restaurant or drink at the bar (I walked over to the outer terminal for some quick food instead) so I can't speak to that. My room was very nice, clean, and QUIET. It also had a fun view of the terminal, as I already mentioned. Stay on the east side if you can because it is so handy to see the TSA checkpoint line from your bedroom.As for parking, you'll need to either pay $30-some per day for hotel valet parking or else use regular airport parking. I parked in the $8 Pikes Peak lot (picture attached) and took the shuttle to the departure terminal which is very close to the hotel. That part takes about 20-40 minutes depending on time of day, weather and where you actually parked. So plan for that or use valet. The bottom line is that, yes, its more expensive to stay here. But you're not just paying for fluff, you're getting something pretty valuable for your money. I almost never give out five star reviews because there has to be something extra special about a place to earn that, and in this case I believe there is... at least when you have an important, early flight and a snowstorm to contend with.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Modern archtectural vision,"No where could be more convenient for travelers transiting Denver Airport.  It is an amazing site as you approach the airport by road. We stayed over the night before a very early morning flight. The new rail station is beneath it and how the buildings are integrated with the airport is an architectural feat. The decor is ultra modern as well with large open spaces and lots of glass and curved metal. The room we had was also large and had all the expected mod cons. The view from our room over the airport 'tent' roof is another very surreal aspect to the whole experience of our visit. We preferred room service as the restaurant was a bit loud for us when we went down for dinner. Room service was quite slow and took longer than the estimated 45 mins they alerted us to, but the food was very good. Definitely will stay again when we travel that way.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Highly recommended, convenient but great restaurant, rooms and pool","We came to this hotel due to an early winter storm in Colorado and since we needed to make out flight we wanted to be close by. We didn't have high expectations but were really impressed. Everything was spotless and new (helps hotel was built in 2015). Pool and hot tub area were wonderful with good views. Gym was very well equipped and view on runway. Our room was very modern. Most surprised by restaurant having good quality food. No it's not cheap but for a captive audience given location they don't have to try very hard yet it was a great experience. It turned our waste-of-a-day at the airport into a day of pleasure. Lastly they were able to accommodate a late check-out for no extra charge, which really made it for us. Wouldn't make a special trip but if had to go through DIA and wanted to stay at an airport hotel this would definitely be the one, and I'd be happy to pay the premium which seemed worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Obviously Convenient But So Much More,"I was scheduled for an early flight from Denver and decided to make life easy by booking a room at the Westin DIA.  Yes, it was convenient but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the experience.  Very professional staff.  High quality fitness center.  Well appointed rooms.  A good range of food options with good quality.  Overall, I was impressed by the experience.  The one caveat.....and a very real one....is that this level of convenience and quality does not come cheap.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect Airport Location,When we checked in the lobby was GORGEOUS! They obviously spent a fortune on this hotel and it shows. The staff was pleasant and helpful. We ordered food at the bar to bring up to our room -- it was good. The pool was awesome! We had a view of the runways which our 2 y/o son was enthralled with. However we didn't hear ANY airport noise! WOW! We were at the airport checking in the next morning within 5 minutes! AWESOME!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient but not Much Else,"We checked in about 2:00 in the afternoon.The desk clerk was not welcoming at all.We were given a room with a view of terminal lobby, and I’m sure the hotel was not busy at that time.Hotel has a very cold Stark atmosphere.We asked at the desk for a newspaper and were told we could buy one at Starbucks. At a $300 a night hotel a newspaper   should be provided free of charge. It’s a good thing they have a captive clientele at this hotel because convenience is only reason to stay here.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great restaurant. ,For a Westin property the hotel is a bit sterile but what a wonderful way to fly. An early morning flight from Denver gets more and more difficult but this makes for a simplicity. If your flight is domestic you can check your luggage downstairs from the hotel and go directly to security. So early morning flights are much more convenient. Another $150 or so is worth the convenience and comfort. Not much interaction with the employees at the hotel who for the most part are efficient and friendly. The restaurant is superb. Just being there is a treat,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Big dollars per night but the convince was worth the cost,"The staff was very helpful when I needed a wheelchair to the airport which was just next door.  The altitude was difficult for me to walk so the security personnel took me to my airline counter via wheel chair.  The hotel has a good dinning room, clean clean clean and very comfortable.  Perfect five star!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Welcome To Room #909,"Beautiful, modern hotel. Convenient to Denver International. About a 2 minute walk, outside, from the terminal.Check-in was efficient. The room was modern, clean and minimal. I had a pleasant stay and slept well.Enjoy your stay here",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Handy, but pricey","The rooms were very pleasant.  Given the space dedicated to the bedroom - which was substantial - I would've preferred to instead have a marginally smaller bedroom area and a larger bathroom, thus facilitating a bath.  That said, that was the only gripe I had with the room itself.What I would warn visitors though is that the available restaurants for breakfast, dinner, tea, etc., are really quite expensive.  This is probably understandable given that if you're staying here you are a captive audience, but even so something to keep in mind.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Incredible and so Convenient ,"My husband and I stayed here for one night the end of September for the convenience of an early departure. All the employees were so pleasant, the facility was modern, clean, and so bright. We had a great dinner at Grill and Vine, wine, dessert, and the service was outstanding. Our guest room was very tastefully decorated, comfortable bed, and feather pillows. The bathroom was large, all the necessities, plush towels and even a robe. We were very impressed and will be back!!! Highly recommend, and convenient for flights at DIA.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Comfortable luxury steps from the terminal,"Early morning flights are challenging, so rather than worry about finding a shuttle or a car at 5AM the Westin DIA offered great convenience steps from the security checkpoint. The room was well appointed and the view of the activity in the terminal was reassuring. I look forward to staying here again with more time to enjoy the fitness center and the pool looking out at the mountains.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One night stay,Excellent location for in and out airport - excellent room and facilities but bad food in the restaurant was sick the next day just eating a salad.  How sad was that?  Salad far too large and a peculiar taste!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,our go to airport hotel in denver,"We stay here just about every time we have to catch a very early flight out of denver to other destinations, or on occasion, we've stayed here when our flights return after midnight.  Why do we return here each and every time?  As many have already noted, it's the most convenient airport hotel.  And that's just a good starting place.  Aside from convenience, the staff have always been welcoming (no matter the hour) and helpful to us, the workout facilities are top-notch, the beds are comfortable, rooms are spacious, the dinner and breakfast options are tasty, and the entire place is designed to instill calm.  In addition during the times that we've had to move a lot of luggage over to the airport, there's always a friendly porter who is more than happy to help move  luggage to the check-in line at the airport...a really nice touch and service to get from the hotel.  we look forward to another night's stay in october and again in november!  kudos to all the staff at this hotel for always being gracious despite having to deal with a never ending stream of tough airport customers!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Sleep like I'm at home,"Yeah, it can get pricey.   I also won't put a price on rest.  The first night we slept for 12 hours.  Great view of the plains.  The concierge had coffee at the door at 930 am every morning.  When princess doesn't have coffee, the prince gets no pumpernickel.  This is going to sound silly, but we sit in bed, drink coffee and watch the Starwood Preferred Guest channel.  Extremely clean rooms.  Late night french fries are perfect.  The Valet has your car ready to go with a phone call.  Can't go wrong.  We always come back if for nothing else the gardenia soap.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful stay...,This is my second stay at this property. I was here at the same time last year for the same annual conference. As a Marriott Platinum Premier Elite member it was my understanding that Starwood Hotels would honor my Marriott status. But I have to admit I was a little skeptical. My skepticism was immediately alleviated upon check-in when I was upgraded to a junior suite. The suite was spacious and absolutely lovely!  The room decor was very nice and spotlessly clean. I couldn't have been more pleased. I especially appreciated the vast windows in the room overlooking the airport and the touch panel opening and closing the drapes. I look forward to staying here again next year!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Stopover on the way to South Dakota from London,The location is very convenient if you are stopping over for a night before flying on from Denver. The room was well appointed with good views over the plateau. The amenities were adequate for a short stay. Rooms are well insulated so no problem from airplane or traffic noise,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The Manager Came Through,"I spent over a week talking with customer service reps about a problem with our reservation. No one seemed to be empowered to do anything. One rep sent an email to the property and I received a terse reply from the front office of the hotel. No apology, no reply, no action. The last rep I spoke with called the property and was told to have us speak with the manager on duty when we arrived. The manager on duty (Richard) listened to my complaint and immediately upgraded us to a beautiful suite. He also comped our dinner when we told him that we planned on having dinner at the hotel that night. I can't say enough about this man. He understood our frustration and took action. Westin/Marriott should be very pleased with him for keeping a a gold level customer happy.We will definitely stay here again when we have an early flight out the next morning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Erin Duffey, Jeremy Sullivan and JP at the Skye Lounge Bar - Fantastic Job!","Erin Duffey, Jeremy Sullivan and JP at the Skye Lounge Bar did a wonderful job coordinating our Meet and Greet that could have ranged from 5-10 people but ended up having our whole group of about 25 people. They had everything ready to go and JP was a wonderful, friendly, helpful bar tender. I called about 4 or 5 days in advance and they got this together last minute. I appreciated the flexibility, honesty, and helpfulness of the Westin crew! Thank you for a great experience! It made my job so much easier.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A Nice Dining Experience,Spent the afternoon at the Westin Hotel and stayed for an early dinner.  It was a great place to eat with excellent food and service.  The hotel is located at the Denver Airport for convenience.  From the hotel you can use the light rail into downtown Denver or to the Denver Tech Center.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Top Notch,"We arrived 3 hours before check in time and the hotel extended the courtesy of early check in.  We were also given a free upgrade from a standard to a Deluxe room.  The view from room was amazing.  We could see planes taking off and landing.  Trains were coming and going under us and shuttle buses were all around.  In spite of all this activity, our room was quiet.  The hotel is beautiful and modern.  Real glasses, metal ice bucket and robes all denote the VIP treatment this hotel gives its guests.  The main terminal of airport is literally just steps away from the hotel entrance.  All the staff are oriented to assisting guests and they do everything for you short of carrying you piggy-back to your gate.  I had no problem with free Wi-Fi both in the hotel and airport.   This hotei is pricey but it's a real treat and worth the convenience of being at the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Never Again,"We stayed here over night after our flight got in late. It was very expensive but nice and even awe inspiring. At 325 bucks for a Friday night that is about my limit. Nice fitness center. Coming back home we stayed there again the night before our early bird flight out on a Thursday night. The price jumped up to 550 bucks a night. They lower the price on weekends and raise it up during the week. So after paying 550 a night they want 10 more dollars for wifi. Gee, maybe 550 a night could get you free wifi, not here. They have a monopoly here as the next hotels are 6 miles away. Not only will I never go here again. I will not go the the Denver Airport again or Denver. I just came here to go to Colorado Springs. My next trips out west I will go directly to Colorado Springs, Salt Lake, ABQ or Chy. So long Denver",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wish I could say differently.....,"Unfortunately, I was not impressed with this Westin.  I am a SPG member.  Other Westin hotels are, overall, much better (and more reasonably priced). Some drawbacks that travelers should be aware of:  (1) if you drive a rental car up to check in and drop off your luggage, be prepared to pay at least US$3.00 to get out so you can drop off your rental car. The bell desk said I had 10 min to get in/out.  I am not sure how anyone can do so with having to travel upstairs to check-in, meet the bell person bringing your luggage in and then run back down to get in the car and drive it out of the gate (which is not ""right there""). Ridiculous.  (2) if you travel in winter months with blowing snow and the like, you will be cold and wet by the time you get to check-in.  The hotel is not inside DIA. You have to walk outside to get into the hotel with no cover.  (3) the check-in seemed to be a longer process than other Westin hotels.  Perhaps their computers were down or something.  We waited a long time (over 20 minutes) to get checked in.  I was surprised, as an SPG member, I usually get more expedient service when checking in.  (4) this hotel was a much more expensive property and, I believe, the other Westin properties I have stayed at had more to offer.  This Westin has 1 restaurant and 1 convenience store.  With DIA only providing fast food choices outside of security, I was surprised the Westin did not have more to choose from.  The good: (1) The service team (including the bartender and wait staff at the restaurant) were courteous and friendly.  (2) The rooms and facilities were clean and comfortable.  The view was great (even from the pool).  (3) It is nice to stay at the airport and not have to take a shuttle from the other surrounding DIA hotels.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very expensive. Basic service. Pay for 'extras' such as WiFi.,"As a member of the SPG scheme I stay in Westin hotels reasonably regularly. I was terribly disappointed in this hotel. I suppose it has a 'captive audience' being next to the airport terminal, but I did feel exploited. Not only was it incredibly expensive ($403.71 for one room for one night for a couple).  The bedroom was modest. The bathroom was basic AND WiFi incurred an extra charge.  If every corner store and cafe can offer free WiFi why in goodness' name can't a hotel such as this?I'm hoping this establishment is a 'one off' in the Westin chain and not part of a trend. Most others I have stayed in have been fine.  Here's hoping. I'm in another Westin on the East Coast for 3 nights next week. If it is similar to the Westin Denver International Airport it may be my last.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing in every way!,"Logistically speaking you couldn't ask for a better setup. The hotel is connected to the airport and is just a short walk to your flight. The rooms are extremely quiet and provide a good rest before or after a flight. I've stayed here a few times and while some rooms are better than others- they are all new and have amazing views.  During my most recent stay I had a corner room on an upper level- we had panoramic views of the Rocky Mountains and all the planes taking off. It was spectacular! However, what really separates this hotel from any other is the service. Every single employee from the bellhop, to reception to room service goes out of his way to provide excellent service. It comes across in every single interaction and makes such a huge difference to the overall experience. Hotel managers should come here to watch how a hotel should be run. It is impressive!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Very nice, well located airport at the hotel",The hotel is really quite pricey but you are paying for convenience.  You can literally roll out of bed into the security line you are that close.  The hotel is deadly silent.  It is beautiful though a bit oddly designed but who cares for the location and convenience.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Horrible Customer Experience,"This is one of my most disappointing experiences with Starwood. When we arrived the room we were supposed to receive was not available unless we were willing to be next to an elevator, my profile clearly states I am in a light sleeper, not to be near an elevator, ice machine, service closet, etc. Consequently our only option was a standard room instead of an executive suite that we were promised. The two associates we dealt with at the front desk should not be customer facing - in over 30 years of travel, they were two of the most horrible I have ever encountered - Jennifer - who would not provide her last name due to privacy and Richard Levine. Their contempt of guests, particularly frequent Starwood guests was palpable. I love airport hotels and usually Starwood, however I would not be able to recommend this property, and would recommend steering clear,  not staying there  - the location convenient - the staff horrible.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenient, nice but expensive ","This hotel was a very convenient, clean it nice. It is very highly priced, we paid over $300 for two queen size beds for one night. We literally got in at 1 a.m. went to bed and left at 8 a.m. . A very pricey night but the convenience of it was amazing. We literally got off our plane and walked to our room. It's right in the airport which is rare to see and it's what we wanted so it was worth the price. The hotel is very clean with a sterile feeling. I guess very contemporary and plain. If you are looking for convenience this is it. I definitely wouldn't stay more than one night, nothing exciting. But none the less it made our stay worthwhile.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Good but not great,"Booked this hotel using points from my Marriott account.  With the merger the Starwood and Marriott allow the transfer of points.  One big issue is that the points are not of the same value with each hotel.  Makes booking a 12,000 point room at the Westin using 25,000 points from Marriott account.  I have been a Marriott Platinum for many years and this year dropped to Gold as I have moved my loyalty to Hyatt.  One big reason for leaving is the inconsistency in the hotels and the benefits of the levels. While I am Marriott Gold that allows lounge access at Marriotts it doesn't provide the same benefit at Starwood hotels.  Very frustrating to say the least to feel so undervalued at a chain owned by the same company.  My stay at this hotel was to burn points as the rate for this hotel and the location so far from town is also askew.  When checking in for my stay I attempted to check in via the Starwood app.  It said I would be notified when my room was ready.  Never received a notification.  When I did check the app after the 3pm ""normal"" check in time I received an alert that I had to see a front desk clerk and that I was not able to use the keyless check in system.  I approached the front desk and the agent had difficulty finding my reservation with my name and when she did find the reservation she asked if I was checking out early?  I said no I am trying to check in but did have that concern that perhaps I had booked the wrong date.  I double checked my app and it was correct for the date that I was trying to check in.  She then stated ""why are you here, you are already checked in?""   I said I was attempting to check in and received the message that I needed to see the front desk and even showed her on the app the verbiage.  She said, ""Oh we need to verify your credit card""  I find this unusual as it is the same card I have used and it is also my Marriott card.  Any way after a cumbersome check in process I was finally sent my ""keyless"" key to my phone and went to check in to my room.   The agent was very kind and offered a $25 food voucher for the inconvenience and it was greatly appreciated. It just seems that there are way too many inconsistencies and hiccups when using the starwood IT systems.  Marriotts seems a bit better and again these are the same owners of both brands.The rooms are nice because they are new but they are nothing exceptional. Views were obscured by the terminal building.  TV's are on the small size compared to Hyatt brand hotels.  Room was quiet and the AC was cold.  For the price there are much better options that are a short van ride away.  The area that is about 3 miles away from the airport has several hotels and restaurants that are better options in my opinion.  They are also building a large Gaylord hotel and convention center in the same location.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Lovely airport hotel,"I got stuck in Denver overnight due to weather issues, and only had 8 hours between my arrival and take-off the next day. I booked a room at the Westin last minute, and had a wonderfully relaxing long layover. The convenience can't be beat:  No airport shuttle to deal with, and the TSA check in area is within a 2 minute walk from the lobby. I would not hesitate to stay here again, and hopefully next time I will have more time to enjoy the amenities that the hotel has to offer.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best airport hotel,"This is a great hotel. Beautiful architecture. Very new with modern, well appointed rooms.  All the plugs you need. Good workspace in the room. The staff is friendly and the dining options are diverse and nice. I'd put it on the better end of the Westin spectrum with a little more personality given the architecture.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great in airport hotel. Very luxurious,"Perfect hotel if you have an early flight. This is an elegant and beautiful property. Ask to be as high as possible, failing the airport terminal. It's an interesting view. Somewhat slow check in that I attribute to a shift change that created a cue. Good room service. Good TV. Great gym and an amazing (seriously amazing) salt water pool overlooking the runway.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Good experience ,"Flew in for a one-day meeting. Right at the airport, walking distance. Interesting architecture, complements the airport; rooms are nice; people are friendly; very nice conference center. Conference food and service better than most!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Well done and so convienent!,"Beautiful and unique architecture. Easy access from the west surface lot parking. We had an early flight and my husband was coming in late the night before, so we decided to stay here and sleep an extra hour. Lovely check in and bar, fast service, we had  high floor, facing the terminal. Nice beds and pillows, well thought out storage and decent bathroom, albeit small. Never heard a peep from the hallway and my daughter loved standing in the giant glass window watching people. We will definitely return! Didn't have time for the pool but it looks great for kids or a quick soak!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Efficient modern airport for tourists,"Used this airport as ski arrival and departure location when skiing in Breckenridge . No delays on arrival and very efficient handling system to collect baggage as well as great customs automated  system for arrivals passengers Transport to the hire car area very user friendly too. On our departure had more of a opportunity to look around a well laid out airport with convenient restaurants and fast food cafes . Really sells the culture of the Colorado and the USA architecture of the terminal is very modern and in keeping with a international airport . Liked the surrounding scenery on our arrival and departure ,very extensive flat plain surrounds the airfield and great interconnecting highways to and from Breckenridge with great signposting easy to find on outskirts of the city ..",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"nice hotel, incredibly convenient for early morning flight","I really enjoyed the hotel.  Room was spotless, shower was great, easy check in, beds were very comfortable.  My only gripe was the charge for wi-fi.  If lower-end hotels can offer free wi-fi, then Westin should bite the bullet and offer it as well.  Stop nickel and dime-ing guests.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A travelers dream,"This new hotel is outstanding for a traveler.  It is connected both to Denver Airport and train station.  You can go directly from your flight right into the hotel.  No bus, car, rental, etc. is required.  And if you wish to go to downtown Denver, take the train which is right at the hotel also.  Obviously the Westin is excellent. Very modern and easy to get around.However only coffee available in the room. No microwave.  All food is by room service.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Meetings and Rooms,"Room were great, clean, spacious, all new type upgrades for a hotel room. We had some meetings held here during our stay too. Meeting rooms were great, conference center is big with variety of meeting rooms. Staff and service was fantastic. Johnny and Hannah took great care of our group. Very nice and welcoming people. Great customer service from both of them! Guest loved that they could basically walk off the plane and be at their meeting and same with catching their flight. Easy access to get to.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Love staying here!,"Stayed twice this month. First time was for the night before our outgoing flight, then we stayed here again the night we returned. The rooms are always clean. We never have to worry. Loved the room location for the first stay - we could watch the planes land and take off. I had contacted Jillian in advance for the return stay, as we had a late flight and I wanted to make sure they didn't give our room away if we arrived too late. I heard back from Jillian right away and she put a note in our reservation. That was so helpful because we ended up being delayed and didn't get in until after midnight. Thank you, Jillian! We were given the most spectacular room. Words cannot describe it. I wish we could have stayed for a week. Thank you!!! We always jump at the opportunity to stay here. Yes, it’s convenient. Most importantly, however, the staff is exceptional. Thank you once again for a great stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Overpriced...""just okay""","Hotel was nice at first glance; however, unclean sheets, lightbulbs out, very overpriced for the Deluxe Room with what we were told was going to be ""a great view of our city"" (we got an ugly airport carpark view instead).  I do have to say it was very convenient to the airport, though.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Would have been very good, if not for the price","This was a wonderful hotel, clean, modern, quite, convenient for those looking for a stay at the airport without getting on a shuttle bus.  Restaurant was above average for an airport hotel.  However, my rating was lowered to average because of the value proposition.  It was average for what you would expect at that price.  There is a lot of walking involved, compared to walking out to the curb and catching a shuttle bus.  Also, the layout of the Hotel is unusual, the room tower is across the walkway from the restaurant area, so you have to walk again when you get there to get to the restaurant or go down to sets of elevators.  But if money is not an issue and your in average or better health.  This is a pretty convenient stop in Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Ok but not as good as I thought it should be,"Ok so I was incredibly jetlagged when I arrived but there was no warmth in the welcome (although efficient) and the room was minimalist. No bath gel only soap, no shower cap, and the bed although comfortable was not spectacular as other hotels I have stayed at. The cafe for breakfast/lunch/ dinner was downright surly entering but at least my server was friendly. As I was in transit to Boulder I ate there twice and it was the same both times. Very off putting. It may be an airport hotel but that doesn't mean less service! Really disappointing for a Westin. The check out was efficient but sterile. They need to work on friendly service.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent service & location,"This was the perfect location after an unfortunate hospitalization while on vacation in CO.  It was certainly a nervous time, and we were not of a vacation mindset.  Rex went far above and beyond to make our stay as smooth and comfortable as possible.  His attitude was ""old fashioned"" in the best way in that he truly cared about us and served as both concierge and friend.  Ray was another plus as he was able to provide wheelchair assistance both to our room and to the airport the next day.  The rooms are certainly nice, though the price is quite high - it was worth every penny for us due to the airport proximity.  Again, Rex is a gem - I will always remember his kindness.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Location is the Best Thing this Property has Going for It,"Denver airport is huge and is very far removed from anything (it's in the middle of a giant grassy plain).  So, if you are using this major airport to connect or as an access to more remote Western destinations, then this hotel will prove most convenient.  Other than that, there isn't much special and there are a few things quite wrong.  The property itself is brand new, so the rooms feel modern and clean.  The beds are comfortable and the TV's and electronics are very up to date.  As with a lot of modern hotels, I found the walls to be too thin for my taste (I could hear a lot of noise through the walls).  The biggest problem was the service (or complete lack thereof).  Despite having called and emailed several times to assure there would be a rollaway bed, there was none when we checked in (and we had to wait quite a while for housekeeping to retrieve one).  The lines at check-in and check-out were very long--and there wasn't a bellman in sight our whole visit (if there is one working in the hotel, I never saw him/her).  Most of the staff seemed very confused and untrained.  A few I encountered spoke no English.  The ones who did speak English were not particularly polite or gracious.  Honestly, the whole place seemed grossly understaffed (and undertrained) to me.  One example:  the woman who checked us in was in a dirty t-shirt eating her lunch while she was checking us in.  She seemed very bothered when we brought up the issue with the rollaway (and we had to escalate it to a manager to actually get it resolved).  The food at the restaurant was quite good, but again the service was unprofessional/lacking.  They really need a good manager to come in and fix this property (because it has the potential to be much better than it is currently).  For the prices charged, it should be at a much higher standard than this.  I gave it three stars because it was convenient, the rooms are not bad, and the food is pretty good (if you can manage to actually get it served to you competently).  Glad I was only here one night for this recent visit.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Quiet and comfortable,"Three night visit.  The pros: 1.  Super quiet;  even the cycling of the AC!  No airport noise or sounds from other rooms.  2.  Easy airport access.  Great for arrival and departure, but also a plus for grabbing a quick bite to eat from DIA. 3.  Large comfortable room.  We had two queens, and plenty of space for three of us. 4.  Easy train access.  Union station is a 30 minute train ride, so no need to keep a rental car.  5.  Nice workout area and pool.  The cons:  1.  Truly nothing around other than the airport.  Train or car ride to get to anything other than hotel or airport amenities.  2.  No real walking options.  I'd rather explore an area by foot than walk a treadmill.  Walking through hotel, train terminal and airport got old quickly.  3.  Key needed to access guest floors.  If you are sharing a room everyone needs their own key.  Not  a negative as long as you know ahead of time and get the keys at check in.  4.  No note pads, info on the hotel, etc. Restaurant info was there, but nothing on amenities, where the business center is, etc.  Not a big deal, but if you are in vacation and not work mode  you might not notice until needed.  Great hotel if you are flying in or out, or for a business meeting with participants flying in from various areas.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Hip, even for an airport hotel","An upgrade from your typical captive airport lodging.  If your flight is cancelled or leaving too early for you to make the drive out to DIA, or you're visiting Denver for a fly-in/fly-out meeting, this hotel is a great choice.  It offers all the modern amenities you need (multiple food and beverage venues, a very nice gym, and comfortable furnishings).  It has a futuristic design offering cool views of the airport.  And, its steps to the terminal (underground or across the plaza).",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Restaurant,"I had a long layover in Denver and decided to give the restaurant in the hotel a chance. It was a wonderful experience. The food was amazing and the service was lovely. I had a chance to talk to Jasmine, the manager there, she was charming and friendly. I have a pet peeve for bad customer service but this place was great. If you're at Denvers airport and you have the time definitely swing by and give it a try.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Unplanned stay turned positive!,"Stayed here for one night thanks to a United Airlines flight cancellation. We weren't happy about being stuck in Denver for the evening, but this hotel turned it into a positive! The hotel is absolutely beautiful! Employees went out of their way to ensure that we had a great stay! Room rates were very expensive, but it was worth it for the Westin Heavenly Bed and Shower, and the convenience (right outside the door from the ticket counter and security checkpoint). I wouldn't recommend this hotel for anyone needing to do anything in the city of Denver as it is WAY out from the city, but if stuck in Denver, or taking an early flight I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing Architecture But Please stop restraining the cord on the Clock,"Absolutely beautiful architecture here, the lobby interior looks so futuristic, really all amazing to behold. The room themselves are quite standard Westin rooms, I was hoping for a little bit more, it reminds me of the rooms of the Westin St Louis.  My huge Pet Peeve is that they have taken the cord for the alarm clock and restrained so tight under a enclosure on the side night stand that you can not even turn the clock sideways to view from bed. At a airport property ""Time"" is important and this is just beyond ridiculous.  Best Airprot Hotel Location. The employees were all amazing, Great Staff, Great Hotel, just give us a little cord to turn the clock Please.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent Modern Hotel,"My husband and I stayed overnight at the Westin Denver International Airport Hotel, on our way to view the eclipse. The hotel is right at the airport, so very convenient when you fly in. It is very modern and clean, and the staff are very welcoming and friendly. The room was very comfortable and clean and the restaurant and bar are lovely. Definitely worth a stay if you are in Denver. ",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Night Before Flight ,"The 'way to go' if flying out of Denver early in the morning.  I would reiterate what another rater said about the $3 charge for parking when using rental cars.  If you don't have a lot of baggage the best course of action is to drop your car at the rental return and take their shuttle to the airport.  Ask the driver to drop you off at the Westin Hotel and you have a short walk to the hotel, elevator/escalator to the next floor (higher) to the lobby.  Not that obvious and you'll need to walk to the lobby.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Hotel Location is Terrific,"Attended a conference at the Westin.  Flew into Denver International Airport.  I was very pleased to find that the Westin is located right outside of the exit to the airport.  It is actually attached by a walkway which is peppered with marble benches and interesting metal landscaping.  The front desk allowed me to check in at 12:00, which was excellent as I flew from the East coast.  I took a brief nap then took th elevator downstairs, paid 9$ and caught the train (not subway) to Union Station and walked, shopped and ate for a couple of hours.  The room was comfortable and the hotel had a very nice air system and smell.  It was easy to navigate around the hotel and transfer to the train and into the airport terminal.  I ate during the conference and the food was good.  I would recommend this hotel to travelers who are in Denver for an overnight trip.  Otherwise, it's far to take the bus or transfer trains for a trip to the mountains.  So I guess if you had more time, it would be ok.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Clean, convenient, expensive","Stayed here at the end of a trip to CO, to be easily in place before at 10:30am flight the next day - avoid LOOOONNNNGGG trip out to DEN airport and rental car returns etc.  This is the only hotel to wake up, walk across a tiny covered plaza and straight into security.  For that, worth the money.Its modern and super clean.  And quiet.  And eerily peaceful for the amount of people coming and going  - thats a credit to the design.  Wife and daughter used the saltwater pool right after check in.Other commenter's statements I agree with: staff isn't really super accommodating or friendly - I'm assuming they generally deal with people very quickly, just in and out. Things like asking for change, parking question, ensuring a crib, etc were answered and dealt with, but felt a little robotic and gruff, not graciously and fully accommodating like you'd expect at other Westin/SPG full service properties.PARKING RANT  (FEEL FREE TO SKIP): I also agree the drop off situation with rental cars is not ideal - you need to enter the airport parking ""ecosystem"" by taking a ticket before pulling up to the Westin Valet area. Having had to do this 3 times, I noted that anything longer than really 1-2 minutes you have to pay the minimum fee of $3.  First time we drove up and left the car to check in- $3, then I went out to return an item off airport, came back to pick up family to go out, waited about 8 minutes in front in the car for them to come down - $3. Final time, drop off family and then return the car - total time about 3 minutes, didnt pay.  ** TLDR: have the valets give out initial hour validation tickets to help with this issue please **You're paying for a super convenient and clean place to start/end your trip here.  For that , worth it.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,SO not worth the price!,"Went their for our honeymoon night prior to flying out the next morning.  Staff were told ahead of time and when making reservations.  Nothing special was done.  Upon first arriving tired after two hours if traffic, one of the checking staff (thin, blond young lady in a suit) saw us entering with our suitcases and ignored us.  She walked away slowly and just walked around the entry area until she saw that we were still standing in the checkin line waiting to be assisted.  She then leisurely walked over and just looked at us. Never said ""May I help you?"", no smile, nothing.  I had to ask her if she could check us in and she nodded. (SERIOUSLY?!). Once we got to our room it was very nice.  I went into the restroom and the first thing I see is a 3 inch long black hair on the washcloth.  I instantly tossed the washcloth on the floor in disgust.  I pay over $400 to stay less than 12 hours in this ""nice"" hotel and I now am concerned with how clean it really is.  We ordered a few appetizers and one glass of wine on room service and the cost was over $75.  We ordered breakfast before we checked out for the airport and my husband ordered oatmeal and fruit and we had a 2 egg breakfast with toast and bacon... it was over $68.  When I received the bill via email, .I called the hotel regarding the breakfast bill as my husband said he didn't look at it and I was shocked it would cost that much.  The concierge said she would have the manager call me as I had asked.  Two weeks later, no call and no email.  I will never pay to stay here again.  I have worked in management and supervisory positions for over 25 years and I have taught Workd Class Customer Service.  THIS Westin definitely does not have it at the reception desk.  I usually travel at least 6 times a year for pleasure and I am already booking at nearby hotels for my next trips.  Very, very disappointed in this Westin.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,If you want to be at the Denver Airport and walk to your flight in the morning this hotel is for you!,"The Weston Hotel at Denver Airport is very conveniently located in the Airport. The rooms are very nice and of course the bed is fantastic. The one problem that I think that they need to work out is if you are returning a rental and you want to drop off your bags and possibly passengers that by the time you go up stairs to register and come back to take your car back to the rental area you have incurred a $3.00 parking charge. I know that really isn't anything but, I think they should work something out with the airport or offer to pay that amount as you are staying in their airport. One final thought if you have a lot of luggage and need to have help their bell man are more than glad to take your luggage anywhere in the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great way to start a vacation...,"Finally a Westin I really love.Early morning flight necessitated an overnight at the airport.  This was a perfect choice. Friendly staff, great food and lovely rooms make it a great investment in sleep.Impressive building--inside & out.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful Airport Hotel,"This is by far my favorite airport hotel if not my favorite business Hotel. it is so convenient, clean and quiet. it has a great bar and restaurant downstairs and the rooms are spacious, they even provide you with a free bottle of water so you can make your coffee in the morning. I've stayed there several times already and will certainly return should I be in the area again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Most Convenient Option When Flying out of the Denver Airport,"This is a modern Hotel mainly catering to travelers coming to/from or through the Denver International Airport. The rooms are comfortable and the sound proofing is excellent. Even though the Hotel is next to the gates, runways and taxiways of the airport, we did not hear any noise from the planes.  The concierge lounge is well stocked and attended to. The service is friendly and efficient. The Hotel also has a nice pool area and gym area. There is a full service restaurant, a fast food restaurant serving sandwiches, snack food, etc and Starbucks coffee. There is a bar area in the lobby level. The food is good in all areas.Access to the Hotel is via a breezeway between the Hotel and Terminal, via escalators and/or elevators directly from the light rail station and via car entering the terminal west parking area and then following the signs to the Hotel.  Bell service is available at the Hotel and the car can be valet parked or parked in the airport lots.The Hotel is, as many other reviewers have pointed out a bit on the pricey side, but if you want a good nights sleep for a morning flight with the least time needed to check in, it is a great place..",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Worth the extra money to be in the airport!,"I had to stay overnight in Denver to take a very early flight... I have to say that the fact that you walk out the door and that you are at The United check-in counter made it very easy, stress free for me (i was traveling with a toddler). The only thing that I did not like, was the very few amenities in the bathroom (one soap, one tiny shampoo and conditioner and one tiny cream) when you pay that much money for a bedroom ($400!) and an empty fridge without even a bottled water. The restaurant was good - although they told me to wait one hour - but when I insisted I saw that the bar was empty and took a table in that area without the wait).... beds are super comfortable, rooms are quiet...",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Elegant convenience,What more could a traveler want than elegance and convenience. The Westin at Denver Airport offers both.  What a joy to get off the plane and walk to the hotel.  Check in was a breeze.  Healthy food options.  Take the elevator down to the new commuter rail and head to Denver.  We stayed at the Westin the day we arrived and the night before we left.  It was so convenient.  Staff helpful with directions.  Will absolutely do it again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Spartan Accommodation,"Not what usually expect for the ""Westin Standard.""  Absolutely no bath amenities in the room.  Additionally, the computers in the Business Center were buggy to the point of being non-functional, although the Front Desk staff did their best to provide tech support.  No 24 hour room service (really, at an AIRPORT hotel), so if you get in late or are leaving early you have to eat at the airport terminal.  The workout facility/pool is great.  Overall, not impressed. Per location at the terminal, it will survive in spite of itself.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Late night arrival,After traveling all day from the Dominican Republic and arriving close to midnight it was wonderful to be treated so graciously.  Check in was fast and efficient.   Falling into the Heavenly bed was welcoming and inviting .  The room was at a comfortable temperature and very clean.I definitely recommend staying at the Westin if given the opportunity,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Loved our stay,"We only stayed one night for an early flight out, but I enjoyed our stay.  I requested a room facing the runway (but I think both sides actually face a runway) and we got a room facing the terminals.  We enjoyed watching the planes take off and land and it was interesting to see how busy the airport was late at night and even at 4 in the morning (in fact, looking out the window at 4am made me realize that I should probably get to the airport a little earlier than I planned).  The room was large and very clean.  There was a tiny fridge to use during the stay.The only negative I could see was during check in.  I'm accustomed to having a separate line for premium members for faster service.  It might've been that everyone waiting to check in was an elite member, but I didn't see a separate line for members.  Also, the pool seemed a bit chilly, but I'm used to outdoor pools in hot weather.  All in all, if I'm back in Denver, I'll definitely stay here the night before any early morning departures.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Meeting venue deluxe,"We have had several meetings both large and small from 5-500. This place handles it with class. Food is very good. No ground transfer costs for flyers and locals have easy access.  Last meeting was with 25 people and we had Johnny as our host all day. Two meals and two breaks, room kept clean all day and he had everything ready exactly on time.  Food hot and fresh and tasty innovative break snacks. Great job.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Love this airport hotel!,It might not be cheap but worth every penny after a long haul flight.  The MOST comfortable beds I've ever experienced.  I had to inspect the bed in great detail to see how it was achieved.  Lovely linen.  Everything new and fresh.  Completely soundproof and we had a wonderful view over the white domes of Denver airport which are really attractive.  There is a perfectly suitable pool and fitness room.  Its hard to find fault with the dining or bar.  The breakfast was really really good. We've travelled a lot and we had one night before a 2 week tour of Utah and Colorado.  Perfect way to start!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Expensive but convenient to Denver airport ,"We chose this hotel because it is onsite at the Denver airport. We stayed 1 night with a family of 4 in a double queen room. Beds were comfortable.  We ate at the hotel restaurant, which was decent and had a children's menu. An added bonus was that we could check our baggage right downstairs at the hotel - 1st floor - because we were flying Southwest and we checked it at least 90 minutes prior to departure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Architecture but some issues,"I stayed in a suite for two days. The architecture of this new hotel was excellent but for the sky high price I felt let down by a number of details:- the furniture in the suite living room was chosen by a designer who preferred design over comfort; the chairs were impossibly uncomfortable- the suite had a very large but very poorly designed bathroom with a half size bath- I bought a chicken Caesar salad in a tray in the cafe. Having poured the dressing onto the salad I could find no chicken until a plastic bag full of chicken emerged from the bottom of the tray under the lettuce leaves. The bag was covered in dressing and in any event was so well sealed that it was impossible to openPay attention to the details, Westin.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best airport hotel in Denver,"This hotel is connected to the airport, so there is no need to take a shuttle to and from drop off as is the case with all the other airport hotels. The hotel itself is new, modern, and comfortable. The fitness center is great, with a variety of cardio machines, weights, and space for stretching. The pool area is also one of the nicer indoor spaces I have seen. All together highly recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Simply lovely.,"Service was excellent, room was immaculate. Highly recommend staying there. Mine was a short stay for a layover but they were lovely to deal with, from the phone reservation to checking out, all was very good.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Expensive but worth it,My SPG status was recognized and we received an upgraded room with spectacular views of the flight line. Service was top notch and the room very comfortable.  It makes an early morning flight out of Denver stress free.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,walk out of the hotel into the airport,This was perfect for an early morning flight -- stayed at the hotel overnight and after a leisurely room service breakfast walked into the airport. Staff was helpful and responsive -- immediately sent someone up when I reported a burnt out lightbulb.It's astounding how quiet the room was -- I didn't hear the airplanes that must have been arriving and departing all night.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Gorgeous, convenient and quiet","I have to say, I relished my visit. My plan for this last business trip with a 6 AM flight out of Denver included to stay at this hotel as a splurge. I was not disappointed in the least. My only disappointment was that I was hoping to arrive earlier to enjoy more of the amenities. But luckily for me my flight was changed to a later time and that gave me the opportunity to linger in the morning. Absolutely beautiful views, excellent staff and amenities. And there is no possible way to make a fly out better than scooting across the plaza with your bag straight to security. Worth every extra penny to stay here as opposed to a few further that you would shuttle from. Additionally, one of the things I appreciated most, aside from a beautiful room and bathroom, was the soundless nature of the room. The hotel was virtually packed because of canceled flights yet once in my room I could not hear a peep. And I had the most gorgeous view out tall ceiling to floor windows overlooking the airport and mountains. I was really thrilled with my decision to stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Contemporary and Convenient ,"This is a new, modern and convenient offering literally attached to DIA. Westin has always been a brand for both business and upscale travellers.          I never heard a plane during my stay. Amazing right? The lobby is neatly appointed with a bar and lounge  across from the front desk. My room was consistent with what I expect from Westin, the Heavenly Bed and the Heavenly Bath included.                 I will incorporate my travel around flying in and out of DIA with a stop at the Westin always included.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is absolutely stunning, and the staff is friendly and helpful. Perfect for catching the first flight out in the morning after a late meeting. Check in was seamless, and the room was amazing (thanks for the upgrade). The cost was very reasonable, too. Highly, highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Staff, we were as impressed with the team that has been assembled, over and above, any hotel we have visited in recently","Convenience coming and going, from Denver, is second to none, but that coupled with the staff support, view, quality, and amenities, makes for a whole new flying experience traveling west.Even though the cost is higher, the time and travel efficiency, more than offsets.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Downtown quality at... THE AIRPORT,"My stay at the Westin DIA was unplanned, but I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to experience this property. Although I arrived late there was adequate staff at the front desk to handle the surprising (to me) amount of check-ins. The hotel is very modern inside and out. The basic 2 queen bed room is noticeably larger than most other hotels. The same goes for the in room bathroom. The breakfast menu has good variety. My co-worker and I were more than satisfied with our selections. Our server was pleasant and helpful as well.  After my stay at the Westin Denver International Airport, I look forward to another cancelled flight when I am at Denver International.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Awesome Hotel,We stayed after a nine day road trip with our family to fly home the next day.  The convenience of it being on property of the airport was wonderful.  We also wanted to spend the day in the city and were very happy to find that a train leaves every 15 minutes to the city right from the center of the hotel.  The front office staff was wonderful and the hotel has a great vibe to it.  Very clean and the rooms are spacious. Great job Westin!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great place to start a trip,"We arrived at this hotel after a long flight, our plan was to start a trip to the Canyons in Utah and Arizona early next morning. This new hotel was the perfect solution to rest, enjoy a restaurant and bar and the day after easily reach the car rental to start a journey.We were too tired to go to Denver, but those who want to go to the city have a comfortable train from the airport and back. It seems to me that this hotel is also a great solution for people with early morning flight. Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One Word - WOW!!!,"I have been wanting to stay here since I saw it first being built! As a Colorado resident I couldn't see that happening until I had a very early flight (5:00am) and I live 90 minutes from the airport. Not wanting wifey to wake up at 2:00am to get me to the airport I decided to go to dinner with her and take my grandkids to the hotel to swim. The view from the 11th floor pool was incredible!  Double WOW for the swimming pool and sauna! From the moment I walked into the hotel I was wide-eyed. It was magnificent. After the wife and grandkids left, I took my own tour. The convenience from the hotel to the terminal was better than I expected. It was great! The hotel staff was very professional and went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of. I checked in the same time as a Denver Nugget (basketball) and while he was getting the Presidential Suite, I was treated exactly the same. Thank goodness I had points available so I could use them plus cash! Well, well worth it. This place truly, truly was wonderful. I look forward to the next time I can stay there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience and comfort,You cannot beat the convenience of the airport Westin. It is just steps from the airport entrance and a 30-minute train ride to the center of downtown Denver. The train leaves every 15 to 30 minutes and costs $9 round trip. The hotel has a very good restaurant and extremely helpful staff. The exercise facility is top notch. I would definitely stay there again.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,First class propeett,"We chose to stay here the night before our early morning flight so we didn't have to get up so early to get to airport. This hotel is literally steps from airport terminal.  Beautiful rooms. Excellent staff. Clean & new. We were on the 12th floor in an end room so we had 2 windows. One overlooked the teepee roof of the airport, the other overlooked a runway so we could watch the planes take off. The bathroom had its own window as well. Massive widows with electric shades. Pool & hot tub were very relaxing & again could watch planes take off. The hotel has 2 wings & it was confusing to get to the right side. We did not eat or patronize the lounge. However, the lounge was in the very open lobby area & looked quite classy.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,First time,"This hotel is wonderful.  Just few minutes walk from airport to the hotel.  Check in was very easy. Front desk were friendly.  Ambience in the hotel is very nice. Got to my room.  Spacious , clean room.  Nice shower, good facilities.  Nice gym and a decent size pool.  Restaurant and bar downstairs.  Didn't go but looks good.  Overall great experience for the first time stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,efficient and easy for fly in business meeting,"I attended a 10 hr business meeting spread over 2 days at the Westin. All the attendees were able to fly in from all over the country in time for a 2 o'clock start. We met in the Cedar room at the hotel. Both the AV specialist and servers were very attentive. Service above and beyond. The rooms were clean, modern and sooo convenient. We finished at 2 the next day with a short walk to the airport check-in. Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,First Class All-Around!,"My colleagues and I hosted a workshop at The Westin Denver Airport and it was first class all-around! The hotel it's self is beautiful! The rooms are large, the beds are OMG comfortable and very clean! The staff is truly wonderful and very friendly. Not fake friendly. Johnny in catering is hands down the most professional and kind person I have worked with for business trips. If you are looking for a place to host an event or even rest your head at night, I HIGHLY recommend The Westin Denver Airport. Make sure Johnny is your catering guy. You won't be disappointed :) AND- you can check into your flight, check your bags and get your boarding pass from the hotel directly. Can it get any better? NO! I'm sad to be leaving. Thank you for the top notch hospitality!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The building is viisually spectacular and very functional to the Denver Airport.,"It is an upscale hotel, but it offers great convenience for the Denver traveler.  The hotel is but a few steps from the terminal (less than 5 min walk).  I had a 6:10 am return flight the next morning and found it easy to check out of the hotel and be in the terminal in 5 minutes.  The staff is very good and helpful.  The dining situation is a bit limited to one major restaurant, but I had an excellent Colorado stripped bass meal there.  The layout of the hotel is a bit odd but those sort of things are not that much of a problem.     One of the major reasons for staying at this hotel was to attend a family reunion in Littleton, CO.  Part and parcel of this is the new light rail train that runs from the airport to the downtown part of Denver at the old Denver Union Station.  There one can connect with other light rail lines to other parts of the city.  The trip is same and economical, with a charge of only $9.  Previously, this would have cost me about 60-80 dollars.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very noisy blowwer in the room,"The hotel is very pricey.  Landed up there due to a flight cancellation...paid rack rate of $475 + a lot of taxes.  The room was nicely decorated and the bed was comfortable; but I just could not get the right temperature in the room....something wrong with the thermostat.  The blower motor was quite noisy.  If I had not been that tired; I would have asked for a change of room, but decided to make plug my ears and make the best of it.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect Place After A LONG Day of Traveling,"We stayed here after returning from Alaska late at night with our 4 children.  I have stayed at hotels in the airport before and my expectations were not that high.  I was SO pleasantly surprised.  This hotel was beautiful, clean and so easy to get to as it is adjacent to the airport.  I would stay here even if I wasn't traveling, it felt brand new.  It was a great place to rest and recuperate before continuing on with our trip in Colorado.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Wonderful, QUIET hotel","Our family stayed at The Westin DIA for one night before an early flight, but I wish we could have moved in and stayed forever. The room was large, the beds were outstanding, and all the amenities were upscale. My daughter enjoyed the pool and hot tub. We didn't use the fitness room, but it looked great. The hotel restaurant is very good (see separate review), but a short walk across the courtyard to the airport gives you access to other food and shopping options without going through security. We had a room on the 13th floor with a great view of the distinctive canopy of the terminal. Most amazing was that although we were right at the busy airport, we didn't hear any airport, train, or traffic noise at all.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best airport hotel,We spent a night before our morning flight. Brand new hotel. Building is attached to the airport. Modern building with decor.  Rooms are large. Beautiful view of airport.Lobby is open and large. Drinks were great. Food was good too. People are friendly.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,great rooms,"Spent 3 nights at the hotel, the rooms were great and spotless!!!!!!  The service when asked for was spot on and they seemed to go over and beyond to make sure that the meet your request.  Was their on business and was provided breakfast, lunch, dinner and snakes during the breaks.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"A little expensive, but a nice hotel","We spent the night prior to an early plane.  The hotel is new and everything works very well.  The extra large bathrooms (relatively) are very welcome.An important treat for the Westin is that the train to central Denver leaves from the lowest level.  We were able to go to downtown Denver for a very cheap rate, have dinner and return to the hotel.My one real objection is to pay more than $300/night and still have to pay for internet access - which was not cheap.  For that reason alone I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Upscale & convenient,We made a quick overnight trip to Denver in May & chose the Westin for the convenience. You literally walk out of your room into the airport. The staff was wonderful & our room was large & comfortable.We met friends at the bar & did not die from sticker shock when we cashed out.Great stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent Hotel!,"The Westin Denver International Airport hotel is a phenomenal hotel in a great location. While certainly not on in the inexpensive side, it can't be beat if you need a place to sleep -- even if it's just for several hours -- before a late night flight. The rooms are gorgeous. The property is clean. The location can't be beat, assuming you need to be at the airport. The only head scratcher is the fact that the airport isn't actually connected to the hotel, so you must walk outside to go from hotel to airport. It seems if you're building a multi-million dollar hotel at the airport in a place where it snows, you might want to go ahead and build a covered walkway to get guests from the property to the terminal which is maybe 25 yards away. But no. You must walk outside to get inside. Otherwise, highly recommended. Great hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The smoothest of transfers from plane to hotel.,"The outstanding feature of this hotel was that we were able to wheel our luggage trolley directly from baggage reclaim into the hotel room. Check-in was friendly and efficient and our room was large and bright and airy - perfect after a long flight. The bar area was comfortable and friendly and the ability to get off the plane, stay overnight in the hotel and return to the rental car transport without having to unload the luggage trolley made this the perfect way to start our holiday. Top marks for the Westin.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Good value and convenient,One night stay wit wife and kids for early morning flight next am back to home. Rooms are very spacious with the classic Westin beds. Hotel is clean and modern. Easy to airport terminal. They have 24 hour room service. The windows are sound proof. You would never know you were at airport.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience Not Worth It,"We spent the night prior to a very early morning DEN departure.  Check in went fine.  Room was on the small side, but clean and well appointed.  Because we didn't check in using an SPG ap, we were charged for internet connection (for a $260 room).  Upon complaining about this, the charge was dropped.  No movie channels so we watched a movie on a laptop.  Workout room was a good size with all we needed; pool too short for laps.  Fair quality of food for room service but overpriced.  Overall, the convenience wasn't worth the price or experience.  Stay downtown and take the train to the airport.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great Architecture, Modern Amenities, and Views All Around","The Westin at DIA appeals to me for many reasons. I have an appreciation for architecture & engineering, so this was a fun stay for me. The hotel is modern, clean, and it has the best location and views of the surrounding areas.We stayed for two nights in a deluxe Queen room on the 12th floor. I would think the higher the floor the better for views. The hotel lobby is located on the 6th floor. Our room faced north overlooking the terminal, and my dad's room faced south overlooking the light rail and rolling plains. Each had their perks, but I think we would enjoy a room facing south next time. You get quite a bit of sunlight reflecting off of the bright white terminal roof during the day.The room was spotless, comfortable, and the bathroom rainfall shower head added a feel of luxury. The beds and pillows were very comfortable.We enjoyed room service breakfast both mornings, and I think the quality of food was fairly decent for room service.Do not miss the swimming pool on the 11th floor! At least go see it.The staff we encountered from the front desk to the bell hops were friendly. We would most definitely stay here again... especially if we had an early flight to catch.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Luxury @ the Airport,"Literay steps from the Airport Lobby, their luxurious hotel has it all.  Large well appointed rooms, an outstanding fitness center and pool, both with 15 foot window views, and excellent WiFi,it was a pleasure just being here.  The Gril and Vine has good food with decent prices and they even had erecte a put put golf course on the 5th level deck as an attraction.  There is an express train to Union Station in Denver with smart shots and restaurants.  A 40 minute ride but well worth it.  Finally, this hotel is at the Airport but I did not hear a single plane!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Westin Hotel, Denver International is the way to go!",Remarkable hotel and so close to Denver Intl. that you can walk from baggage pickup to hotel check in in two minutes.  Train station is on the opposite side of the hotel where you can catch a ride into Denver for great night out around Union Station.  30 minute ride back to the hotel.  Most convenient and least hassle hotel I have been to in a very long time.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Not the average airport hotel!,"I really enjoyed my stay here.  Unlike many hotels that are attached to airports, the noise was not very noticeable and I had a great night's sleep in my Heavenly Bed!This is a great place for a fast trip.  There are small plates to order for dinner at the lobby bar which was just enough after arriving on a late flight.  The lobby is large and very well lit, perfect for business.  The full-service restaurant below the lobby on the first floor is great for a business meeting, and I did just this for lunch.There is also a coffee place on the first floor for a quick cup of coffee and breakfast on the go.  I loved being just steps from airport check-in.  You can't beat the convenience or comfort of this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Overnight on the Way Home from Europe,"My wife and I were returning from Europe and decided to spend the night in Denver before flying on to Portland.  The Westin offered a convenient, easy transfer from plane to hotel to plane, only steps away from baggage claim right at the airport.  The facility is recently opened and sparkling.  The lobby is a modern, clean and welcoming room.  The guest rooms on the south side of the building, where we stayed, offer a sensational view of incoming planes, an interesting lighted/log art display and the city beyond.  The room was large and the bed was comfortable.  For the tired traveler on a stop-over, or a business person seeking a conventient meeting venue, the Westin at Denver International would be ideal.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,I've been waiting for a hotel option connected to DIA!,"This hotel is a long time coming, and I appreciate the fact that it is a hop, skip, and jump from DIA.  The staff are welcoming and have upgraded me on numerous occasions.  Some say it's pricey, but the location more than justifies the price for me.  Good room service many and the food is delicious.  Good insulation and airplane noise is almost non existent.  No disappointments from me!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing hotel,"This hotel was absolutely fantastic. It was very clean and the staff was amazing. They were very quick to handle our requests and very friendly. The hotel seemed very new as it was very clean! Plus I loved being able to walk out my room, get on the elevator, and be at the airport. Saved me 30 minutes of sleeping time. I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Quiet, comfortable stay...","I was part of the Campaign for Grade Level Reading conference held at the Weston.  I was skeptical at first being that the Hotel was so close to the airport runways.  It was wasted skepticism.  I never, never heard a plane anytime while inside the hotel.  My room was the quietist rented room I have ever been in.  My outgoing flight was not until 8pm.  I had plenty of time to sit in their breeze way over looking Union Station, book in one hand and a beer in the other.  I could not have been happier.If you are in Denver, you will not find better accommodations.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Short notice stay,"Hotel is fantastic, right at the airport door, was given a room on the 10th floor and was surprised to find two large double beds waiting for me. The bed were the most comfortable I have been in, in a long time. Has a nice sky bar located across for the reception which had a wide range of choice at affordable prices.Ordered room service and this was brought quickly with a smile to the room.  Also they currently have a mini golf section set up outside the entrance and best of all its free.Check out was fast and effective.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One-night Stay - Very Convenient Location,"My family and I spent one night at the property. It is just a short walk from the terminals, such a convenient location. The hotel itself is a beautiful, modern and well-maintained facility with clean and spacious rooms.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenient, Modern, Great Hotel","I traveled to Denver for work meetings that took place at the hotel. I was a little bummed that I would never actually step outside of the hotel for nearly 3 days. But thankfully the hotel is awesome so I didn't feel trapped! Really nice gym, lobby bar is fun, great restaurant. The rooms and bathrooms are sizable and very well designed. The conference space is terrific and a great place to host a meeting.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Short stay - great property,"I made my first trip to Denver last weekend to attend an event held in the hotel, and all the attendees also stayed at the Westin.  This is a great property, and so conveniently located adjacent to the airport.  My room, the meeting rooms, the fitness center, the snack store, were all very nice, clean and modern.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Modern hotel attached to the main terminal,The Westin at the Denver airport is the most convenient place  for an overnight stay. The hotel main entrance is connected to the main terminal building. The hotel is a very modern architectural structure with the shape of a wing. The rooms are very comfortable with great bedding and a nice ample bathroom. There is a bar in the main lobby as well as a modern main restaurant and bar. Very convenient location just walking distance from the gates.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Incredible Front Desk Service,"There was an unexpected mix up in my reservations at the Westin Denver International Airport (though my reservations had been confirmed a number of times by my office). Natasha McCoy at the Front Desk took over, took matters in her own hands, figured out the problem and though it required a number of calls, solved the problem quickly and efficiently. While I waited for my room, she set me up in a meeting room for calls I had to make and then came to get me when my room was really. She also took steps to ensure that this problem doesn't happen again to others. Natasha exemplifies what the word hospitality at its best stands for-very welcoming, a problem solver, and a provider of great service.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,So good we stayed twice.,"On our most recent trip to Colorado, we had a late flight into DIA so decided to spend the night here and get started in the morning and boy are we glad we did.  Everything about the hotel was perfect. Incredibly large room with very comfortable beds and amenities. The service was spot on and the location can't be beat with the option to run to the terminal for breakfast or stay in the hotel.  The views and scenery were very relaxing.  My family enjoyed the hotel so much we changed our hotel for the last night of our vacation and came back to enjoy the hotel and the pool for my kids.  The pool and hot tub is great on the 11th floor and is very comfortable unlike most indoor pools which can be muggy. This was very comfortable.  We also had an issue at the end of our stay when my 8 year old daughter left a hat she loved that she got as a souvenir on the trip. She was very upset but when we got back we placed a call to the hotel who was able to locate it and send it back to us.  It is so nice to see somewhere putting the service back in the service industry. I can't imagine future trips to Denver that don't include the Westin DIA. Well done.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great stay!,"Thanks to United Airlines I was stuck spending the night at Denver International Airport.  I believe Brent was the night managers name, him and his staff were incredibly gracious and helpful.  Room was huge and everything was extremely clean.  I would stay here again for sure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Makes the Airport fun again,Outstanding customer service.  I was contacted by Robinson K a week before arrival asking what he could do to make my stay PERFECT.  I asked for a west facing corner room with view of the runway and was given exactly that on check in.This is my 5th stay at the Westin DIA and have had an outstanding experience every time.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great staff and hotel,"Walk to the hotel from baggage claim to this rather new hotel. The staff are very helpful and professional. The hotel rooms are modern and comfortable. Great beds and bathrooms. Nice linens. Thee are plenty of electrical outlets as well as USB plugs in the room.There is a pool and fitness center on the upper floors. There is room service and restaurants on site or you can walk back into the main terminal and find plenty of places to eat there, too. In the wintertime, they offer a seasonal skating rink. The light rail train station is just below the hotel for easy access into Denver city. Nice place to stay if you are stuck at the airport or for business.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great hotel at Denver International,"We had the opportunity to stay at this new hotel prior to and at the end of an overseas trip.  The hotel is just footsteps from airline check-in counters and security, as well as, train service into the city.  The design of the hotel and its surroundings is very nice and soothing.  Check-in was quick and efficient.  The hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly.  We had a  2-queen bedroom which was very spacious.  The room was quiet and you wouldn't know you are adjacent to a major airport.  This property is well-designed.  I highly recommend a stay at this Westin, and we surely will return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,This is the place to stay after a long journey or an early flight to catch!,"This beautifully designed hotel by Genser is surely  worth a stay.The pool,the lobby  the quietness everythinga radiates a calm that soothes any soul with fear of flying.The rooms,even standard room are plentifully equipped .Comfortable beds in a spacey room Even the shower is of a modern design.Is there anything to wish for? Yes... wi-fi should be complimentary in all rooms as in most lodgings hotels,motels over the country",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Returning home,"After 29 days traveling the National Parks from Mt. Rushmore to Yellowstone, Grand Teton and all the Parks in between it's time to go home. With a 6:00 am flight we decided to stay a the airport Westin and what a great decision it was. The rooms are very nice and the shower was fabulous. If you have to catch an early flight try this hotel because you can walk to the terminal, it doesn't get any easier.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice and new,"This hotel is a great place to stay before an early morning flight.  They provide cribs.  There is a cafe and restaurant.  It is right outside the doors to the terminal.  You have to go back and forth up different elevators to get to ticketing which is really annoying, but other than that nice place.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,best airport hotel,"I don't make a habit of staying at airport hotels. That said, I recently stayed at the Westin at DEN. The room was super-comfortable. The airport staff was very professional, courteous and friendly. The food ... not bad! My room looked out over the airport main hall structure, which was quite fascinating.All in all, Westin does it right at this location. And, oh, by the way, the access to the airport can't be beat!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Spartan room but amazing convenience,"Walking into the lobby of this Westin is like entering a space ship...all light and interesting architectural design.  The basic Queen room is nicely appointed but lacks the wow factor that the rest of the hotel has.  Disappointed as a Starwood Preferred Guest that for $350 a night we don't have a soaker tub, but the convenience of stepping out of the hotel, walking across a courtyard and immediately entering security in the hotel is worth every penny, especially when you have an early morning international flight. The hotel restaurant is quite good but be prepared for small portion sizes for large prices. Overall a great experience!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best Airpot hotel to date!,"I stayed here from 5/18/2017 through 5/20/2017. The Hotel itself is very modern, clean and friendly. First it is only about 30 steps from the airport and there is a tram that takes you to Union Station for only 9.00 and the ticket us food for 12 hours and you can ride many other forms of transportation with this single $9.00 ticket (you can even go to Boulder, CO.) The ride itself is only about 30 minutes (be sure you have a ticket, security regularly checks and if you have a wrong ticket they may issue you a ticket for $106.00) downtown is great all kinds of restaurants other hotels..... (but the Westin is really great!!) Anyway back to the hotel.... the staff was very friendly and my room was on the 11th floor the view was over the highway and I was able to watch planes take off without the noise of planes!!!! The Hotel is far enough away from the runway that the noise is not an issue!!!!!! As a note I did not pay for anything(this was a business trip) and I was not asked to post any kind of reviews by the hotel or the company that paid for the room!! I freely give this recommendation and stand by it!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful architecture and great location,We stayed there on our way back from a ski trip in Breckenridge.  This hotel is beautiful and conveniently located.  Great service.  Great view from our room.  We were able to walk around and enjoy the architecture.  We loved it.  Very modern.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Above average airport hotel,"Review Room 708Compared to the other  hotels available in the area of Denver International Airport hotel, the Westin stands out. Price: All of the hotels surrounding DIA are over priced in my opinion, so look for deals on hotels.com or use your free nights to get a great rate at the Westin. Room: we stayed the night April 9, and our room was cold. I immediately turned up heat. But the coldness came from all the windows, no curtains only blinds. we were a corner room. The bathroom was especially cold. The room was moderately noisy with planes taking off. But, the room itself was plush and modern.I asked for a microwave and one was delivered quickly and set up. Too bad that it was filthy inside and most likely was from the staff room.I don't believe I asked for a handicap room but 705 is a handicap room.  Which is weird as it is the farthest room from elevator. Parking: we parked in the covered parking garage near the Westin. There were airport signs indicating you could pull up to a front door. It was late at night and we did not want to be bothered with reparking or valet. It was very easy to walk out of bottom level of the airport parking garage and into the Westin with our luggage. But no luggage carts were available had we needed them, nor was any one there to answer questions or offer help.We left the room at 3am for a 5am flight and that was the best part of the stay! To exit almost directly into airport!!! No stress.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Nice, convenient hotel","Recently attended a conference held at this hotel.  Other reviewers have commented on the convenience of staying here if you are flying in and out of Denver, and I agree with them.  The hotel is simply a walkway away from the airport terminal - so it is extremely convenient!  The train that will take you back and forth into Denver stops on the lower level under the walkway - so if you need to travel into Denver that is also convenient.The hotel was very quiet - I was worried about airport noise, but it must be extremely well insulated because noise was really not as issue.We had several ""conference meals"" and the food was okay.  I will say the eggs served at breakfast were awful, but everything else was typical conference type food.I also had room service twice - turkey BLT - very good and at another time, their grilled chicken Caesar salad - I would not order this againMy room was clean and cozy.  If I am in the Denver area again and traveling by plane, I would consider staying again at this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Property,We like to stay here if we have an early morning flight as we live 1.5 hours from the airport. This property is stunning with great views and a nice pool/workout area. The team is very professional and supportive. If you are an SPG or Marriot member they go above and beyond to honor your status levels. Thank you Westin!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Exactly what I expected for an overnight stay,"Great room, easy check in/out. No spa on site but hotel was able to arrange a great massage in my room within 40 minutes.   It is a beautiful hotel and the convenience of being able to walk to your flight was well worth the extra cost of avoiding early morning shuttle bus mess from the other hotels.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing ,"Stayed the first weekend in May at this hotel and was extremely pleased! Hotel is literally within feet of the airport entrance. While you do pay for this convenience you save in possible taxi fares if hotel shuttle service is not available and you definitely save time. Not only is the airport right there but so is the A Line which will take you to Union Station in downtown Denver. The staff was friendly yet efficient. They good an excellent job of anticipating needs and offering assistance before even being asked. Hotel room was modern, well organized, and spotless. I'd definitely make a point to stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Close, Clean & Convient","After hours of travel delays, I missed my connection in Denver. I know the area well and also knew that arriving at midnight, I did not want to wait for a shuttle to other local hotels. I called ahead for a reservation and found the reservation operator VERY helpful and friendly. She took care of everything over the phone and emailed me my confirmation while I was in line waiting to board my flight in Newark. I was pleasantly surprised that the price (just under $200 for non-smoking king) was less than I expected. Considering that other local hotels charge $140-160, I felt that the extra $50 was well worth it for being able to walk right through the terminal to the hotel. While not cheap, I was already in bed before I would have been able to catch a shuttle to other local hotels. The room was large, very clean, had a stunning view, modern and CLOSE. It is also VERY quiet even right next to the elevator. It offered all the amenities you would expect from a Westin Hotel. Insider tip - As a Colorado resident (with photo ID) you can ask for the ""local"" price which will save you 15% off the lowest price ... which will almost cover all taxes you have to pay! But every little bit helps. Would stay again in a heartbeat.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Finally, a hotel at Denver International Airport","The new Westin Hotel at Denver International is a welcome addition. Up until now, the closest hotels were a 15 minute shuttle ride away. This beautiful new property is located in a new addition to the iconic main terminal. It is at the south side of the terminal and occupies the building on top of the train station. The lobby is a 2 minute walk from the security line.The hotel is modern and first class. The lobby has a white on white décor that leads the eye to the fabulous views of the front range from Denver south to Pike's Peak. There is a bar at the lobby level and a high end restaurant one level below. There is a pool and gym, although I did not have time to try them out. The rooms are super-comfortable with the chains branded Heavenly Bed. The views to the south are spectacular. The rooms are large and modern. My bath had a shower and was decorated in earth toned tiles that was very comfortable. The service was excellent. It is a bit pricey but worth it if you value the proximity to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Really nice, large rooms at DIA airport","Stayed overnight and we're very pleased.  Big rooms, nice pool (with a great view), good staff.  Of course the Heavenly beds are killer.  Just a quick visit, after a very long flight, so not much else to say.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"The perfect ""rescue hotel"" after delays and missed connections.","Tired, delayed, looking for a bed, this place was perfect. No shuttle, just walk and crash. Check in was easy in a beautiful and airy lobby. Well staffed, the check in was simple and quick. The room spacious, bed fantastic, bathroom: big and spacious, shower: great. Check out easy and convenient. In summary, if you need a place to crash at the airport, this place is it. It is not cheap, and this fact needs to be factored into the budget.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Too much,the hotel is pretty and if you have lots of time and money it may be worth it. It is overpriced and they are building more airport hotels every day. They charge you to drop off your luggage and I am not sure that I felt very safe at night.,2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Meeting Planner Dream,Held a 35 person program meet/feed/stayover for one night. The staff is awesome. The property is beautiful and CLEAN. It is an amazing location and connected to airport. Never heard an airplane in the meeting space or hotel guest room. We all loved that you could pre-check in bags with out walking over to airport. Fabulous banquet food.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Location Location Location,"My sister and I stayed at the hotel on our final night in Denver because our flights departed a few hours apart so it made sense to stay near the airport.  The hotel was easy to access after dropping off our rental car, it was an easy walk over to the airport in the morning and the staff at the hotel was very polite and helpful with our questions about the Denver airport.  Thank you Westin Denver for being our new place to stay whenever we visit again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Westin DIA is really nice!!!,"I had a corner accessible room, with electric sun and dark shades, very comfortable.  Here for a medical conference.  Easy to head to downtown Denver on the RTD train, about 30 minutes for $9 roundtrip, took me 3 block walk to the Colorado Rockies stadium.Check in, room key, linen changes, all the logistics, the few restaurants at the hotel, all smooth and comfortable.  Easy walk back in to DIA to catch some airport restaurants.My room had sunrise coming at dawn into my room....very nice!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient and great access,"I stayed here for an early departure from DIA. It was a last minute decision, but the check in was hassle free and the staff throughout was incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was your typical hotel room with standard amenities. I was rather surprised that for the cost, there was no free wi-fi, but I had to pay what I think was $9 for standard wi-fi service. I can't recall when the last time I had to do that at a top tier hotel. I would have gladly sacrificed the ""Heavenly"" products to get free wi-fi.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,It can improve,"Bed and shower were marvellous....had a great night sleep. Checkin was awkward. I made the reservation via SPG app, but when I arrived the lady could not find the reservation. After I showed it on my cellphone, she located it. It looked to me as if she did not really wanna work there...no mood for customer service. The bellmen were fantastic!!! Dinner was delicious! For being inside the airport, it is a good choice!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Meh.  It's a hotel room.  ,"We stayed overnight here because we had a 6am flight and thought it would be more convenient to stay here rather than drive to the airport in the middle of the night.  In hindsight, I wish we had stayed at home.  The rooms are quite pricey for what turns out to be a pretty standard hotel room.  Nothing special.  And none of us slept more than a couple of hours because the beds weren't very comfortable and the air conditioning was unusually loud.  Next time, we'll stay at home even if we have to drive in the middle of the night.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent location at airport and quiet. ,"Quiet after a long day of travel the hotel was easy to find. Clean, spacious and everything you need. Open concept lobby area. Same great food offerings and gym amenities. If you don't know about the gym amenities: you can rent, very reasonably, workout equipment and runners located at the hotel. This is a great option if you're like me and like to travel light with just a carry-on!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Lovely stay ,What a lovely easy way to be ready for early flight and have no parking hassle.   The linens were spotless and the room was quiet and restful.  Fun lobby to check in and have a quick beverage before moving on. A respite before entering the storm,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very nice rooms,"This isn't the largest Westin, but if you have to be at Denver International overnight, there's basically nothing within 20 miles. Or you can walk to the Westin. If you score a room upgrade on the upper floors (especially the end rooms), you can have 180 degree views of the Rockies. Cool Jetsons lobby bar, most of the usual amenities, a good restaurant and a very cool vibe. The food isn't cheap-it is an airport-but good. Rooms 1201 and 1202, which were the only ones I saw, were among the best hotel rooms I've spent time in almost anywhere. You can see the highway, but the cool window screens roll down at dark for perfect privacy.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Unbeatable convenience,"Walk out the airport door and straight to your hotel.  Beautiful design, pool with an amazing view.  Easy 35 minute train ride into Denver Union Station from the train station below the hotel.  Everything you expect from a stay at a Westin",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Love being near the Airport after a trip to the mountains,We've been staying here the last night of our ski vacation since they opened. This hotel is amazing! The beds are super comfy. Rooms are clean and the hotel is clean. Staff is pretty friendly. The new train runs under the hotel and straight into downtown Denver. It's $9 one way or $9 all day pass... Buy the all day. We were able to take the train into Denver and catch a ball game!! Amazing! It's so easy to stay here and then take a flight the next day. My kids love watching the planes coming and going. We ask for a room that looks over a runway.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect for Late Arrival / Early Departure,"I booked here during a week of 8 flights between AB, SK, WA, CO. My arrival was scheduled for 23:45 and I'm sure glad I planned ahead as we were delayed with a medical emergency and arrived near 01:00 the following morning. I was the 2nd to last guest to check in and was warmly greeted and thanked for my loyalty to the SPG (Marriott) brand. The room was spotless, wonderfully equipped with furniture, outlets, a spacious bathroom and a wonderful view of the arriving/departing vehicles to DEN. I ordered room service that morning and thoroughly enjoyed the prompt service and delicious breakfast. The only difficulty I experienced during the stay was actually navigating from my gate to the hotel at 01:00 - however, I attribute that in part to the airports lack of signage and my sheer exhaustion at the end of a 18 hr day.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect for overnight near the airport,"Very clean.  Very new.  Actually, feels quite luxurious... and then you realize you are at the airport.  I had a morning flight out of Denver but was coming from Aspen so I decided to drive the night before and stay at the airport.  I arrived late and was very pleased to see the bar was still open and serving food!  The staff -was very nice and courteous.  In the morning I was so comfortable in the luxurious bed that I decided to take a later flight!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Relaxing Overnight Stay,"Our most recent stay was my third but my husband and sister's first stay.  Since my sister had a late night arrival, I decided to use my points to book the room so that we could all rest up before heading out the following morning.  We all enjoyed our stay -- the hotel is so conveniently located within walking steps of the airport.  Staff was very courteous and helpful.  Room was spacious with beautiful views and the most comfortable beds.  Would not hesitate returning to this hotel in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Next to Airport; Quiet; Clean; Great Staff,5 minute walk from Denver Airport. Brand new and clean.  Fabulously comfortable beds!  Gracious employees.  Felt right at home here.Had room service for dinner (tacos) and they were fresh and wonderful.   Definitely will be back for quick business trips.  Good value for convenience and ambiance.  Extremely quiet!,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Had a Great Stay,"Living in Denver, I was curious about this hotel.  My wife and I made the quick drive, and spent an evening using points.  The parking isn't super easy to find, but with a bit of pre-planning and GPS, it can be found.  If you're an air traveler staying, this isn't even a concern.The check-in process was easy, and the front desk staff was friendly.  We were assigned a room, and pleasantly surprised when we walked in, as it was a western corner room facing the mountains, and a view of the terminal out he other window.There were electronic blinds which were awesome...especially since they were two later - the first blocked the sun, but were able to be seen through.  The second were complete black-out shades.The size of the room was large, and it was very comfortable.  The king size bed was also quite nice.  The shower was a bit awkward as it was an accessible room.  It was turned sideways, and the width was very small.  Since the water was on the 'long' wall, it flowed out directly on the shower curtain.  As a 'roll-in' shower, the water easily rolled out all over the bathroom floor.  I'm not certain if other bathrooms had a similar setup, or if this was specific to the accessible room we were assigned.We ate at the Palm Restaurant, which was decent.  The drinks were okay, and the food was okay as well.  the service was great, and we enjoyed talking with the wait staff.  Overall - a very good stay.  Compared to other hotels in this range of hotel, I thought it was on par, and maybe a bit better.  Since it's at the airport, there aren't many areas to explore, so that limits the experience.I would say it is very convenient if your flight is canceled, or if you have an early morning flight.  If you are staying at the hotel with a bit of free time, it would be worth hopping on the train to Downtown Denver to find some more upscale restaurants and nightlife.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Outstanding service in a beautiful and convenient setting.,"Our stay was outstanding.  The room was immaculate.  The pool and hot tub offered gorgeous sunset views as we relaxed.  The proximity to the airport is why we chose the hotel, and this couldn't have been more convenient for our morning flight.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Service!,"I travel a few hundred days per year and had a difficult request that I needed assistance at the hotel with. I received such warm, friendly and competent service from the front desk team that I had to share! Both Tom in the morning and Amy the evening prior absolutely excelled and made my stay the best. I'd recommend this hotel 110% to anyone needing a place to stay in DEN. Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very Very AM,"We had booked a red eye - or ""Black Eye"" as the captain announced. So, we stayed the night at the Westin to eliminate an hour on the road (and add it to the night's sleep). What an amazing experience! It took a bit of hunting to find the lobby. Check-in, however, was a snap. The young man at the desk was efficient, friendly and got us on our way. After a bit of confusion about the elevators, we dumped off our stuff and headed downstairs for a light snack. Pricey, but the drinks were awesome and the food damned decent. But, the best was yet to come.The bed was one of the most comfortable ever. Soft and inviting, it didn't sag. The comforter completed the effect of being tucked gently into a dream state. I fell immediately asleep, awaking to the alarm that summoned us into the airport proper. Even given the early hour and short night I awoke refreshed.We may add this to our travel repertoire just on GPs!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Airport Hotel in total isolation,"I attended meetings at this hotel and stayed two nights. This is the quietest, most airy, modern and comfortable hotel at an airport that I've ever stayed at. (Connected to the terminal). The modern design of the Denver airport and this hotel make it very unique. The entire hotel is full of light, open and airy, but it's really quiet. I had a corner ""Jr. Suite"" - it was all one room, just big with a lot of wasted space - and my room had a great view of the runway. That was cool. The airport/hotel is completely isolated but there's a train station right in the middle of the hotel that takes about 45 minutes to bring you smack in the center of downtown and life. THE ONLY NEGATIVE - the food served by room service is really sub-standard. My soup the first night was completely inedible and the second night I ordered eggs and toast to make it easy - it was still really bad. If they improved the food quality they would really have the best airport hotel ever.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The BEST Airport Hotel,"I travel frequently to Denver on business and I prefer to stay here vs in the city! It's a beautiful, clean hotel. The lobby bar is fantastic in that it stays open until 1am! The restaurant is also fantastic for a hotel restaurant - the food was fantastic. The room was clean and so spacious. Most importantly, I NEVER heard a single airplane! That's amazing. I will continue to request to stay here anytime I have to travel. It's worth the drives to the city in order to wake up and walk across the sidewalk to check in for my flight on my early return flights home!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Still great airport hotel,"Not brand new anymore, but feels and looks like it. Can't beat the convenient airport location.  Nice touch is the free bottle of water in the room. The only improvements can be made with cleaning.  I airways seem to find minor issues,  this time it was a black hair on the toilet seat and make up on one of the small white towels.  I just didn't use the towel and got rid of the hair quickly, but a thorough cleaning could have avoided that.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great place to stay,Stayed there twice on a recent leisure travel i had.  First night I had a room that faced the airport terminal.  Was interesting to watch people come and go and when time for bed i pulled the drapes shut and you would never know that there was an airport terminal 200 ft away.  The second time on that trip I had a room that faced the other direction so had a great view.  I was amazed at how quiet the hotel was being attached to a major airport.  The in room amenities were great and there was an excellent gym with very up to date and new equipment to challenge anyones fitness level.  Pool area was very clean and relaxing as well.  I really liked the scent that is just barely noticeable and is injected through the ventilation system.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A destination in itself,"I spent the night here due to an early flight.  I didn't want to leave.  This is an amazing property.  Beautiful rooms with views of the airport. If you like to plane watch this is the place for you.  This hotel is a little pricey, but it's worth every penny.  I wish the hotel room I went to in Hawaii was half as nice as this place.  I can't wait to come back again.Pluses - Great location - walk right into the airport terminal.  The light rail to downtown Denver is right next to this hotel.  The bathrooms are very fancy.  Negatives - Going to any other hotel that is not as nice as this one.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Surprisingly quiet being attached to airport,New and great looking property. Was shocked how quiet it was even though it was attached to airport - couldn't hear any plane noise. Convenience of being able to walk out lobby and into security line is nice. The flipside though is it is a trek to go into town for dinner. One other negative is the food for our business meetings/conference rooms was subpar compared to other comparable properties we usually go.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Weekend Trip,Since we knew we would arrive late we made a reservation here. It is super convenient and worth the price. Walk to Hotel from your airplane. Very modern and roomy bathroom. Restaurant area for breakfast is great and staff is great.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Love this hotel,"How convenient to stay in the building next to your gate. Attached to the airport at baggage claim, this is a gorgeous, high-end wonderful hotel. The rooms are beautiful and have the Westing Heavenly Beds; such a dreamy sleep. The restaurant is delicious, the bars great (of them so far), the service unquestionably good, and there is a Starbucks by the front door as you are ready to head to the gate or your meeting. Love it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very Convenient Indeed!,"This hotel is quite expensive (for me), but considering that it is a mere few steps from the airport, that's not too surprising. My room was very nice - clean, comfortable and a surprisingly quiet night's sleep for being at an airport. The food at the restaurant and room service was very good. The view from any side of the hotel is nice, especially if you like to watch airplanes take off and land or gaze at the mountain ranges. There is plenty of room for meetings and conferences and the hotel staff handled them all very well. I arrived for a three night stay on a Monday and woke up to snow on Tuesday morning. I remember thinking that this was the first time I was at the Denver airport during snow that I didn't have to worry if my plane was going to leave on time or not!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Denver Airport,Stayed at the Westin Denver International Airport for business meeting. Room was fine but the lobby is small and with limited spaces to meet. Hotel restaurant was fine but nothing special. Cab fare is expensive to downtown Denver.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient location; excellent service,"Enjoyed staying at this hotel on a recent business trip to Denver.  The airport location is most convenient.  The staff are friendly and go out of their way to make you feel at home.  The train service to downtown Denver is fast & an efficient way to travel.  $9 round trip, too!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenience is key,"We stayed here for a couple nights due to a canceled flight. This Hotel is connected to airport so it's super convenient for catching flights or in our situation, finding a quick and nice place to stay due to a flight issue. Hotel is modern in design, clean and staff is friendly. Even though hotel is located at airport, the rooms are super quiet. I didn't hear a plane one  while I was there. They have a pool which my kids loved and a pretty good restaurant inside with good food/drink menu. If you don't want to eat at their restaurant, there are many quick bite options in the airport you can get to very quickly. Also, big bonus, the train station is also located on site where you can jump on it to take about a 30 min trip into downtown Denver, which is an awesome city! Overall, very pleased with the Westin Hotel. Don't hesitate staying there for an early or canceled flight.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Good for an early flight,"Rooms are a good size, nice beds, nice bathroom and views of airport are interesting. Quiet room so good sleep. Can't get any closer to airport terminals if you tried. Staff were very helpful. We had a 6am flight so this place was good for that but not sure if it's good for holidaying more than one night as it's pretty boring around there! Nice pool but spa was ridiculously hot.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,I love this hotel.   I can't stay here often enough. ,"Its not the typical airport hotel at all.    If you get stranded because of a snowstorm you will count your blessings if you can get a room.   Its the little touches - the lavender oil on the nightstand, the incredibly comfortable beds, and the robes.   I love the view and always make sure i get an odd numbered room so i can see the airport.  And while you are at the airport, the sound proofing is fabulous.    This hotel is simply a gem.  For me its perfect if i have an early morning flight because i can unload all my gear, return the rental car, and in the morning just wheel it over to the United check in counter.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful Design,I have been eyeing the amazing design of this hotel during my frequent flights into DEN. I finally got the opportunity to stay in and was very pleased. The front desk staff were pleasant and well informed. The room was well designed with fabulous views. You also must spend some time in the pool and gym! Such amazing views.The lobby bar staff were not overly friendly...but this was an outlier.I will definitely be back!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Outstanding for early flights,"My family stayed here because we had an early flight. I live over an hour away from the airport and have a young child. Waking up late and being right at the airport is really nice. I had one of the end rooms with the slanted glass walls and a nice view of the runway. My son got a kick watching planes take off and land or looking straight down and watching the vehicles drive under him. I didn't have a problem with airplane noise which it isn't loud at all, it is quieter there than at my house which is some days right on final approach path. Could it be a bit cheaper? Always yes but I think it is worth the price for being able to sleep in for an early flight. Staff was helpful and had no problems with them. They were having an issue with the keyless app the day I stayed but system issues happen and I got a key card to access my room with out issue. I would much rather pay to stay here the night before a flight to relax than stress the morning of a flight.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A Great Hotel Across the Board,"First off this is one of the most architecturally beautiful hotels I have been in a long while. The staff was top notch from the front desk person who noted my loyalty status and made sure I received the proper upgrade to the two ladies in the Starbucks who remembered me and my name and drink on the second day. (better than my starbucks here in Philly). Room 1032 - facing south, well designed and appointed. I really liked their gym on the 11th floor. A very good selection of machines and treadmills. I did not take advantage of the Westin workout offer. Next time!! The restaurant was great. I think the menus could be expanded, good quality, need more depth. Prices were typical of a high end hotel. The only improvement I can suggest is the signage in the DIA. The Westin name is in 3 inch type on most signs and barely noticeable. I was there for a confeence and can say their conference center is the best in the city. Great staff - thanks Bobby, Jeremy, in AV and Johnny our banquets captain.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Up Market Hotel, but...","This is my 6th time staying at The Westin Denver International Airport. All of my stays have been 5 stars +, but I knocked off a star because of an issue I had with dates on my valet parking ticket that caused me an extra hour to fix due to communication problems with employees who don't speak English very well. It finally got fixed from a hotel manager, but an apology was never extended from anyone. The hotel manager didn't even address me when he came to the front, he only spoke to his employee then proceeded to tell me that I left the hotel on a flight somewhere and came back. Excuse me??? I stayed and paid for 2 nights/3 days at this hotel before my husband left to London, UK. I never went anywhere and we ate twice at the hotel for dinner with a bill exceeding $200 and he thinks I left the airport to go somewhere?? Apparently, unbeknownst to me, people are staying at the hotel and leaving their cars to cash in on a $33/night (no day charges) fee to park. I didn't appreciate being accused. Although it was rectified, it took my time going to the DIA parking lot cashier who appeared to think I was pulling a fast one, and then back to the hotel to deal with employees who don't understand me, and to a hotel manager that didn't have ""customer service"" skills. Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay and my food. If I stay here again, I'll be sure to address the parking concerns. It's always a few bad apples and employee mistakes that causes us honest, good people.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One night at the Denver Airport Westin,"We had a wonderful stay from beginning to end at the Westin Denver Airport Hotel. Our daughter, who is a Colorado resident, met us for dinner....valet parking for her was so helpful.  The restaurant is great But the only downside was after we were seated no one waited on us.  Once we did get someone to wait on us they bent over backwards to make our evening run smoothly from then on.The pool is amazing....the workout room is sufficient....the entire hotel was very clean.Our son had an injury that prevent him from walking ....they made it easy for him to get around especially leaving the next day to catch our flight.....they met us in our room to collect our luggage and had a wheelchair waiting for him at checkout in the lobby....they escorted us, wheelchair, luggage and all, to baggage check and arranged for our airline to meet us with a wheelchair",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenient, Pricey","My son and I stayed for one night in order to get a good night's sleep before our early flight.  We were told that we were on the 12th floor which is an upgrade and available with key access only.  This may have given a false sense of what to expect.  For $260 we had a hard lumpy mattress, flat pillows, terrible water pressure and were expected to pay for wifi.  This hotel is new and the architecture is beautiful.  My husband and I have had wonderful experiences staying with this chain of hotel until now.  Nicer hotels for half the price are only 8-10 minutes away.  Pro:  This is a convenient location for travelers headed out or in from DIA.Con: Very expensive for what you get.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient for Business,"Location and having a full service Hotel is important when you consider for a business stay.  Pricey, but you get what you pay for.High end style is impressive for Business meetings.At airport, but didn't seem to have any aircraft noise that was noticeable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Only worth it if you have an early flight and more than 8 hours at the hotel,"Perhaps if I had arrived when it was still daylight out, my stay would have started out better. As it was, I was driving  from the mountains and a ski vacation. I  put the address (8300 Pena Blvd) into my GPS. Both the  directions on Booking.com, and the Google maps  sent me to the longterm parking lot at the terminal. That was fine, until I noticed that I couldn't turn right on 84th street, which is how you get to the Westin parking garage. There was a  ""Do Not Enter"" sign. So I had to park in Long Term parking and pay $6, which wasn't bad, but it took about 8 minutes to walk to the hotel with my luggage.  I got to the hotel, and arrived at the transportation level which was  a big empty space with stairs, and luckily, a security  guy who directed me to the elevators and told me to go six floors up to the lobby. There are no signs pointing out  the restaurant (the Grape and Vine, or something) but luckily I saw it when I looked down the stairs to the floor below the lobby. I arrived at 9 p.m. and had to leave at 6 a.m. so I didn't get a chance to try any of the amenities.Yes, the  hotel is very modern, and very Jetson-esque (as in the old TV cartoon) but being tired from skiing all day, and then driving, I didn't get to appreciate it.  The hotel was very quiet, and I didn't hear any airplanes. But I did hear my neighbors next door, and the sound of slamming doors.  For the $300 price,  I was hoping for free wi-fi, but you only get that if you  are a Starwood Preferred customer. However the room and pillows were very comfortable, and the room was very clean. And yes,  it's easy to get to your flight from the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Glitzy new hotel, poor service","We arrived late and left early so didn't have time to experience the all the amenities.   The hotel appeared modern with smallish, functional rooms (typical for an airport hotel).   Expensive for what you get -- both for the room and for all the add-ons like wifi ($10 for the night), breakfast (priced like a luxury hotel and this isn't one).   We were traveling back from a ski trip and had more than our typical carry-on luggage.  Between the curbside team and the bell service, it felt like our luggage was held hostage for 30+ minutes.   Not a big deal if they had told us there would be a delay, but they did just the opposite (implying it would be there immediately) and we sat around in the hotel room late at night waiting for our bags with young kids.   Phone calls to the desk generated excuses, no answers and no apologies.   Clearly no one felt accountable for or even cared about the quality of our experience.  The stay was a pure transaction -- we wanted to stay close to the airport for an early flight and Westin has a hotel.  We had luggage and they had two teams of people who need tips and are not well-coordinated who shuffle your bags for ages.   All good individuals but the management clearly hasn't thought about (or doen't care about) how that impacts the customer.  Nothing about this stay makes me want to return or seek out Westin hotels.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"So Close, So nice!!!","This modern edifice, almost attached to the airport terminal (you walk outside 150'), is both super convenient and almost guaranteed to offer a sound night's sleep before the next day's travel. Typically, we stay at the hotels on Tower Road before traveling the next day, but decided to try out the Westin before a grueling 30 hour trip to India. Staying here gave us an extra hour of sleep!  The room was spacious, clean and extremely comfortable. The view from the room overlooked the light rail, airplane taxiways, and Peña Blvd for a real traveler's feel.  The staff was polite and helpful. The only downside was the ""cheap"" way the hotel charges for wireless internet in the room (wifi in the lobby is free). In the era of wireless phones with unlimited data, this anachronistic practice actually is so customer unfriendly as to warrant a downgrade to four stars. (Message to Westin: you don't make enough money off this practice to offset the customer ill will this generates. Too many other high end hotels provide this service for free!!!)",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Underwhelming and NOT worth the price,"My stay at the DIA Westin was a treat to myself (used points).   For the cost in points (and advertised cost of a basic room per night) this hotel is definitely not worth it.  The rooms are basic.   The same as you would see anyplace else.   WiFi costs $10 extra per day.  The amenities are standard.  Truth be told, you can get equal or better amenities at nearby hotels.  The only benefit for the hotel is that it is AT DIA.  However, if you are willing to take a free shuttle to any number of hotels within a 5 mile radius (about a 10 minute ride) you can find equal or often better lodging at a fraction of the price.I will admit, the Caletrava exterior and lobby is very cool.   But the excitement ends at the entry.  In room, everything is as basic as you would find in any other reputable hotel.   In fact, I've stayed at many nearby hotels with better in room things and FREE wifi. All said, for $330 per night at the cheapest room, I would suggest saving your money 10 out of 10 times.   Go somewhere cheaper and just as nice or nicer for a fraction of the cost. Totally underwhelming and a disappointment to say the least.I give it three ""stars"" as it is only average.   Not poor, but nothing more than hum drum.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Awesome location, new, clean, etc.","What an amazing location!  Literally steps from the airport, quiet and clean. Comfortable beds and friendly staff too.  I had an early flight and unfortunately the people in the room next to me were partying.  I called the front desk and told them that I would be happy to move rooms, but they insisted that security would be happy to take care of the situation and they did (a few minutes later everything was quiet and stayed quiet).",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Short and Sweet,"I had a late night meeting in Denver and an early morning flight out of DIA.  I'm not usually a fan of staying at the ""airport hotel"" but my quality of life was gong to be significantly improved by the timing of my stay.  I definitely recommend Westin at DIA..  Great service.  Nice new hotel with great art and nicely appointed rooms with dramatic views.  It so close you can actually see TSA from the airport facing rooms.  I'd stay there again despite it being the ""airport hotel""",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Mid century modern marvelous,"Just a few steps outside the airport terminal lies this little beauty. By the time you process being out of the airport and follow the signs you're standing at the checkin counter. Fast and friendly key in hand jump in an elevator to your room. Once inside you find yourself surrounded by excellent quality towels of satisfying heft, robes-a-plenty and a comforting suite of pillows, sheets, and bedding. After settling in you can trek back down for a refreshing drink and a meal at the restaurant or simply pull up a stool at the bar visible when you checked in. Either way you will sleep soundly in a super quiet room while airplanes churn throughout the night and day.  If you're short on time and long on travel pop in and recharge. Well worth it.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Surprisingly Quiet,"Stayed at the Westin DIA on business during a cross-country connecting flight. I arrived pretty late and it's easy to find from the airport terminal, however the entrance isn't as clearly sign posted once you leave the airport.Check-in desk is the next level above the entrance and there is a bar next to it. Was given a room facing away from the terminal and I was little worried about noise being right next to an airport but wow....they've done a fantastic job building this hotel! You cannot hear anything! My room overlooked the road and couldn't hear anything and not even any airplanes.The room was very well appointed, spacious and modern. As ever the bed is to die for! Westin have the best beds in the hotel business!The reason I gave the Westin DIA 3-stars is because:1. the in-room dining service charge, it's ridiculous at 28%! In addition to tray/deliver charges and taxes. I travel a lot on business and have experienced all kinds of hotels and their in-room dining and this is by far the most expensive, normally I pay 8-15% on average. 2. they charge for wifi connectivity!",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Luxury just steps from the airport terminal,We stayed here for one night before driving to Vail for the rest of our vacation. This hotel is conveniently located. The food was excellent and the scenery beautiful. The rooms were very nice. On our departure date we hung out in the lobby and ordered food and drinks before heading back inside the airport since we had arrived extremely early for our flight. Would definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful service!,"We unexpectedly had to spend the night in Denver so we chose the Westin. Khari helped us get checked in and provided us with toiletries for the night, since we didn't have any luggage. Khari was most helpful any time we had any questions. Truly outstanding service.I would also loike to recognize a front desk person called Tom, he helped us square away our reservation and make sure we got the best rate available.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Khari Rocks,"Arrived tired and anxious to get some sleep.  Bad news, there was a long line to check in, good news Khari who I guess is the Concierge saw the line and jumped in and started checking customers in.  In no time he had me in my room and fast asleep.  Much appreciated Khari!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,GREAT! Travel Hotel,"We stayed here one night over Spring Break with our teenage daughter because we were landing late in Denver and heading to Breckenridge to ski the next day. This is by far the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at near any airport. It is a GREAT travel hotel. New, modern, super convenient as it is actually attached to the airport. Very very impressed.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wow!  Step Off the Plane and Into Luxury,"Airport hotels are usually the worst of the worst.  Not the case with the Denver Westin.   This hotel is worth traveling for and is less than 20 yards from the main terminal.  Follow the signs and you will first be impressed by the thoughtful architecture of this relatively new hotel.  Service is swift and the hotel is spotless.  They have a great bar that serves well past midnight, erasing any bad will you may have towards air travel because of mechanical delays and flight attendants who have exceeded their union-approved work schedules.  The rooms are clean, have everything you need, and each floor affords a view of the plains, planes, or mountains.  In contrast to most airport hotels the soundproofing is without fault.  You won't hear the 777 taking off or the traveling salesman next door sawing logs.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One of the Best Airport Hotels,"If you have to stay at the airport, this is the place to be.  It is conveniently right outside of the terminal so no shuttle bus....but once you step inside, you can immediately forget you are at an airport.  The rooms are light, airy and comfortable.  There restaurants are good and the service is top notch.The gym has a good selection of treadmills, ellipticals, weights....there is a pool and jacuzzi.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Unexpectedly awesome,"Previous stays at other brands airport hotels left me sleep deprived and frustrated with the loud plane noise and poor service. This recent stay at the Westin Denver Airport hotel was incredibly peaceful and pleasant. The special glass was truly soundproof, and the staff were outstanding. The train stops right outside the hotel and for a $9 fare took us directly onto dowwtown and back. It was clean, safe, smooth. I would highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Quiet and Smart Looking Modern Room,We stayed at the Westin because we had an early morning flight out of DIA and one never knows what the weather can be in CO in March.  Efficient staff.  Room was of average size but nicely appointed.  Felt like a new European hotel.  Floor to ceiling windows were wonderful.  Room was quiet: very little airport noise and we didn't hear any noise from the hallway and adjoining rooms.  We used points for our stay and the property is expensive.  Not sure we'd stay their if we weren't on an expense account.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent Airport Hotel,"Stay at Westin DIA before while it's still pretty new.    I've noticed that airport hotels typically age beyond their years due to the turnover traffic but the Westin at Denver International was terrific.     Be sure to request a room in an upper floor.  If you are an airline buff, just about every room has a view of some part of the airport....runways, terminal, etc, so if you are going to get stuck at an airport, you might as well enjoy the activity under your window.     My only disappointment is there is no concierge lounge.   The heavenly bed, excellent internet connection, perfectly moderated AC, and well provisioned bathroom compensate well for no lounge.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Expensive Convenience,"Whenever I fly out of DIA it requires me to allow enough time to return my rental car and take the shuttle to Departures. I hate getting up early, so this past trip I checked into the Westin Denver International Airport the night before my flight. It is directly connected to the Airport Departure Security Lines Entrance by a 20 second walk across a covered concourse. I had already taken advantage of using the convenient checked baggage counter located one floor below that concourse. It was accessible from the same hotel elevator I would later use to get to those Security Lines, so all I had to do was leave my room, take the elevator down to the lobby, walk 10 yards to the elevator bank that takes you down to that concourse-and voila!   Great convenience: but was it worth the price?The hotel itself fulfills all the expectations you have of what the rooms should be like and the amenities you expect. The lobby is minimalist and modern and spacious. There is a circular bar and places to sit that offer a view of the aforementioned concourse below or of airport views.One convenience to think about is that the train to downtown Denver's Union Station is located one floor below that aforementioned concourse-close to where that baggage check-in is.      However: I had previously stayed at other Hotels (on Tower Road) about a 5-7 minute drive to the airport and found them to be very adequate and 1/3 the price of the Westin: so what price glory?",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wow- so convenient and great service,"Ask for a room with a view (mine didn't have one, but others I was travelling with got lucky and they were great).  There are huge windows in the room, really made it feel open and airy. Rooms are super clean, bed was a dream, towels were the over the top soft. Incredibly convenient location- you walk straight into the security entrance for airport!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Modern, clean, convenient ","Here for 2 nights for a meeting. Loved the proximity to the airport. We left our room and were at our gate in less than 15 minutes. The room was nice and clean, spacious, and modern. The meeting facilities were also nice and accommodating. I usually am not impressed with meeting food, but thought the catered meeting food was the best I've ever had. Great experience!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent Concierge,I was on an eight day business trip and had missed my flight home. The Westin attached to the Denver international airport was right there when I needed rest. I entered late in the evening not expecting to find a vacancy. I was greeted by such a nice person by the name of Khari Robinson. He instantly recognized my lack of sleep and need for shelter. Mr. Robinson expeditiously checked me in and made me feel right at home. He is by far the most extraordinary concierge I have ever had the pleasure to do business with. I would recommend the Westin at Denver airport to anyone simply because of Mr. Khari Robinson.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,So big,Thank goodness I had a long layover. My terminal has 95 gates and of course I'm 95! Even arriving at gate 30 was a hike. It's clean though and a lot of great places to eat in the food court. Didn't see a lot of carts to take you to gates though. Bathrooms are large and well designed in and out.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Futuristically nice but overpriced ,This airport hotel ranks very high for convenience and sort of feels like you're walking into a space station in the lobby which is pretty cool . But don't expect a lot of glamour for the price that you're paying. Rooms are modern crisp clean and pretty simple. Feels more like $150 to possibly $200 room .The food at the bar was very good and it has a great aesthetic. But it was also pricey.I would definitely recommend but just be prepared to see the bill .,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Service over and above!,"Our check-in clerk, Khari, went above and beyond to find a birthday gift that we could use, having noticed that my husband had just celebrated his birthday the previous day. So, at our next visit, later this month, we will be enjoying credit for dinner!We are fortunate to be able to use points as SPG members, to enjoy already being at the airport the night before a very early morning take-off. However, if we were paying in $$$, it would be out of our price range! The expense is what brings the rating down from ""Excellent"" to ""Very Good.""",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful,This is one the most unusual and beautiful hotels in Denver. The building is a dramatic and beautiful addition standing tall next to the teepee architecture of the airport buildings. It adds to the beautiful architectural statement of the airport!,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Superb service,"Arrived late, tired. Natasha at front desk kindly helped me get my clothes pressed for a meeting in a far off city and an early start. A wake up call with breakfast, pressed clothes and a spring in my step for the day ahead. Platinum status really meant something here, but I imagine the service was not entirely to do with that. Great service! Genuinely the best airport hotel I have stayed at. I've endured a few! Thank you Westin DIA. James from the UK",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Second Rate,"First and last time staying here. Charging for internet access after paying $325.00 night and platinum SPG member. Food is mediocre in grill, next time take the shuttle to Aloft and save 60%. Works for flight crews and business traveller with a tight layover. Otherwise forget it.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,My room was not cleaned,"I stayed at Westin DIA on 23rd February night, because I would have a flight on 24th morning. When I came to the front desk, the male officer told me available room was only the $340++. Then he gave me discount because I had a flight, so the room was just $303.When I came into the room, it hadn't been cleaned up at all. Still all in mess, maybe from previous guest. It's okay, I guess, I just stayed for several hours.When I checked-out, I was in hurry so I forgot to ask for receipt, therefore I emailed them but no response at all just for receipt request.And then this week the credit card bill has just come out and guess what, the bill is $347, not $303 as they promised though. I don't if this is because tax or what because they won't give me the receipt.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Huge, efficient and soulless",Within a short walk of the terminal this hotel has top marks for convenience but its open spaces of bare concrete create  a feeling of being in a refridgerator - especially in winter.All in all a good choice for a one night stay if you are changing planes.  Very good sized rooms and extremly comfortable bads but bath tub too short and too shallow.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Spectacular Luxury and Uber Cool,This place looks like a spaceship and the service is five star. They upgraded me without me even asking. Unfortunately the gorgeous suite was only used for a short time! But we will definitely be back to enjoy the sky bar and the suite. It was truly luxury in a star wars kind of way. It is also RIGHT in the airport so you don't need a rental car and are minutes from security to check into your flight.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Missing room service,"This is a nice hotel (my 2nd stay) was really looking forward to getting to my room, getting dinner and relaxing. Bur after waiting 2 hours for room service, I'm less inclined to give it a great review. Actually the room service never arrived. I placed the order at 7-7:15, was told that it would be 40-45 minutes. Fine. Waited until 8:20 or so to check on it. Was told it's coming right up. 20 minutes later, it still wasn't there. Called at 9, ""oh they are bringing it right up."" Needless to say, I cancelled, went downstairs to try the bar but they only had snacks and really didn't want to eat in the nice restaurant. Thankfully the airport was close by so I went and got a sandwich. 2 hours is a long time to wait for a Caesar salad and a beer. I hate when restaurant staff can't tell the truth about where the food is.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The Best Location and Hotel for DIA,"Recently stayed at DIA Westin with the family, the staff is efficient and very professional. The accommodations are beautiful, modern and have spectacular views of the mountains and airport. There is a pool and fitness center that are 5 star! The location will make your stay worth it, as it's right at DIA, roll out of bed and catch you flight. It's a no brainer! Will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Super convenient for early AM flights,"This hotel was so convenient, which was I booked it in the first place. It looks cool as you drive up to it, and it's nice on the inside.  It's new and it feels very modern.  The best part though was I was an elevator ride away from security basically, which was great because I had a 5 am flight. The staff was helpful upon check in.  Don't get me wrong, you pay for convenience, but I would stay there again for early flights. It has a nice shower and the bed is comfy.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice stay! ,Our flight arrived later in the evening.  It was a short walk from airport to hotel which made it real convenient.  The hotel was also close to rental car lots which was a plus.  We only stayed overnight because we had an early morning appt but the beds were very comfortable. We all got a good night sleep.   We got an upgraded room to business class which gave our family a little extra room so that was a plus.  Overall we enjoyed our stay and i would definitely stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Luxury Hotel Extremely Close to Airport,Recently I stayed here prior to an early flight.  Overall the hotel is very nice and the room is well furnished and comfortable.  The workout room is fantastic and the pool looked very nice.  I was a bit surprised by the stuffy nature of the parking attendant as we were asking about parking and were abruptly told that if we take longer than 30 minutes to decide he will charge us for valet.  Kind of set the stay off on a bad foot.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A top Westin steps from the DIA Terminal,"This has to be one of the best Westins and airport hotels I have ever stayed in, period. Modern, quite, convenient, luxury and well staffed are the best descriptors of this Westin.I stayed here twice within a week timespan with my first visit on Valentine's Day. The concierge spent the week before my arrival helping arrange a surprise for my fiancee with roses and champagne. The communication and attention to detail were above and beyond. For this special occasion, I was given an in advance upgrade to a junior suite, something no other Starwood hotel has given me even being a SPG Gold Member for the last five years. With this suite being in a corner, it allowed for incredible south & east views of the airport, great for watching planes take off and land in full view.  On my second stay, the communication & service was still impressive with before & after emails regarding my stay. Stayed in a deluxe room this time; while it was not as big as the suite, it was still very nice with great airport views too. Other great highlights:- The hotel lobby reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Pretty futuristic looking and unlike your typical lobby. Worth checking out even during a layover at DIA. - That wonderful white tea smell throughout the property- Literally about a 1-2 min walk to airport security; quickest & best airport hotel access I've experienced- Separate shower & bath tub in suite was nice- Gym was impressive!- The best valet staff I've ever seen; Extremely friendly!  3 valets spent 10 mins essentially playing Tetris in making bags and skis for four people and a baby fit properly inside a rented Suburban. They put five bottled waters in the car for the long drive ahead without us asking. I still cannot give enough kudos to this department- The pool area was extremely modern with a infinity pool, hot tub and great views of the airport - great for both family and adult swim- Noticed zero airport noise whatsoeverA couple of very minor cons:- Wifi, on both stays, required a call down to the front desk to have them reset my connection; fixed within 30 seconds- Having to use two different sets of elevators from ground level to room was slightly annoying- Bar area, despite being in the cool looking lobby, was rather basic. Some light music could help...Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel and I do plan on staying here again! This puts other airport hotels to shame!Preferred Needs Checklist:King Sized Pillows: YESFast WIFI Option (10mbs+): YESWalk-in Shower: YES Always-on HVAC fan or other nighttime sound suppression: YESHD Feed on every channel: YESFridge available (aside from in room hotel paid snacks): NOHot Tub: YESSanua/Steam Room: NOLight blocking shades: YES",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Looking and Convenient but don't expect much more than the room,"Striking looking and a long time coming, the Westin DIA is located within walking distance of the main security halls of Denver International Airport.  You'll walk outside, pass the entrance to the new train to downtown, take a somewhat obscure elevator and enter a very attractive lobby area.  Within the cavernous lobby are work stations, a very exposed (read: not at all intimate) brightly lit bar and a smallish check in desk off to the left.  It's designed to allow guests to have a more interactive discussion with the reception clerks.  This might be important if they knew what they were doing, were fast or efficient...these are neither.  On three separate trips to the hotel, the check-in personnel were relatively untrained and clueless.  On two occasions I was assured I would have a king-bedded room.  But after a 3 minute trip to the room, I had to come back down because they mis-read the room types.The rooms themselves are quite nice...fresh and clean and well laid out.  Curiously, they have enormous closets for a property that I doubt sees many long term guests.  The usual Westin amenities are all within the room...but be aware there are no in-room movies, I suspect because many travelers are carrying their own entertainment devices for later use inflight.The rest of the property will disappoint.  There is NO recognition whatsoever for elites.  I'm Platinum, and have never so much as been offered an upgrade.  Last night, the hotel was at about 50% occupancy.  There were corner rooms available and unoccupied, but all I received was a standard room.  There is no Club Lounge...inexcusable for a 500 room property that is Westin branded.  Not even complimentary coffee in the lobby.  Room service is an option...best go for it because the restaurant (Grill & Vine) is very over priced and mediocre and the so-called coffee sundry store is a joke.  Overall, the rooms are the nicest in the area but certainly not Westin quality...and certainly not cheap. And if you're elite, don't expect to be treated like one.BTW...If you are parking here, it's outrageous.  It's not technically the hotel's fault (a DIA thing) but be warned.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Pet friendly is laughable ,They claim to be a pet friendly hotel but you have to have a dog that doesn't bark apparently! We left the room and not 10 minutes later I received a call that I needed to get back to the room because our dog was barking. We just sat down for dinner and had to leave the restaurant. Our dog (maybe most) bark for a minute or two then lay down and sleep. Talked to the manager on duty Tom Witte and I told him we had a room that had a door to the room next to us (adjoining room). To me that didn't make much sense but no suggestion of us changing room from Tom. Here's a suggestion: don't put pet families in adjoining rooms!!!!PS go somewhere else you'll be glad you did!,1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great looking lobby and hotel overall, Front desk untrained and unhelpful,","Then hotel is very new and great looking.The pool and fitness center are GREAT. There is a serious lack of training. The check in experience is actually unpleasant.The valet and bellman barely smile or say ""welcome"" when I drove up asked if someone could  get some help with luggage and the car. They looked like it was an unusual request.I checked in andI attempted to upgrade to a ""suite"" with a connecting room.The front desk staff woman in charge couldn't attempt to break a smile while trying to train the other front desk person and help me with a check in and upgrade at the same time. They finally upgraded me with a charge after a time of them trying to figure out what rooms are what. After going to the room, it was not a suite, it was a slighty larger connecting room. After sitting in the very hot lobby for a while while they figured out the check in, I had to go back down to the lobby with all of luggage and three children to again try to sort it out.The same team wanted to charge $400 for the suite that was $199.00 more on Starwood.com.SO, enjoy the very cool looking hotel, pool and fitness center and just make sure you pay attention to the check in experience. For the GM: I think some training is in order.For the price, there are other options at DIA.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent choice to simplify life,Westin DIA is a perfect place to just pop to for a rest for an early fight.Rooms are spacious and typical westin minimalist styleBedding is the westin collection and top quality and cleanRooms are quirky design- especially if you get a corner) because windows are wideOne thing is to bring earplugs as there is airplane noise- albeit limited at nightI never travel without them anyway as you need know who is in the room  next door!Lots of pilots sleeping here- Consider eating in the restaurant- excellent!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent for traveler arriving from Europe.,"Beautiful hotel. Excellent for traveler arriving cross the Atlantic Ocean. Just few steps after landing you can relax in comfort, adjust the time difference and the Mile high City. We were very welcomed by Khair at the reception and enjoyed the room on 13th floor with beautiful view. Good breakfast at the restaurant.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great (but not inexpensive) place to stay for early morning departures,"We had an early morning flight and live in the southwest Denver area, so we decided to give the Westin DIA a try. I'm glad we did.The hotel is an architectural gem, in and out, although it really detracts from the original design of the DIA Jeppesen main terminal. It blocks the view of the ""soaring mountain peaks"" of the terminal from the South, which is where most people driving in are coming from. But if you take the unique design of the hotel on its own, it is amazing.The lobby is brightly lit -- in fact, it reminded both my wife and I of the inside of the space station in ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" and that's NOT a bad thing. It's one of the most unique hotel lobbies I've seen in a long time.The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful. Our room faced South overlooking the train to downtown Denver, and it was fascinating to watch the traffic entering the airport area as well as workers and travelers arriving and departing on the train.From the hotel lobby floor (5) it's a short walk to level 5 of the airport. What I'd suggest for anyone who has bags to check is that you stay on level 5 and use the curbside checkin. We did that and it kept us from having to take the elevator up to the normal checkin kiosks on level 6, then come back to 5 to go through security.It's a bit stupid that the hotel and airport aren't connected by a completely enclosed walkway. In the winter, snow blowing across the plaza on level 5 could make it miserable passing between the hotel and airport terminal. Of course, the same idiots who designed this also came up with the idea of having an uncovered escalator from the train platform up to level 5 -- in a city that has blizzards on occasion.But I digress. The hotel itself is amazing. And since we had a handicap accessible room (my wife has mobility issues), we were pleased with the room in terms of the spaciousness, the huge bathroom with grip bars and a walk-in/roll-in shower, even a way to pull the drapes shut for a person in a wheelchair. Kudos!The restaurant was absolutely wonderful, as was the bar on level 6.Seriously, if you have an early morning flight and don't want to have the hassle of driving in from some remote location during rush hour, stay overnight here. You'll be rested and ready for a day of travel and work.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent,"Everything went perfect, the reception was accommodating for our need for rooms nearby, both rooms very clean and ver nicely set up, soundproofing perfect, we could not tell we were in an airport, very nice breakfast.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent service,"The valet service was exceptional, especially James. James took the initiative to direct our Uber driver, carry our bags, and made sure our Uber driver had the correct directions when leaving the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Location!,"We landed late at night with a 6 year old and this hotel was our best bet! The room was big and quiet. We were thankful room service was available late, although it was expensive and took awhile, it worked for us!We were very disappointed that the pool was closed as we really needed to expend energy before our next leg of the journey. Plus there were people in the pool so that confused us. The internet was not free and I could not get my Westin rewards club (SPG) to work which I thought it was supposed to. The staff was friendly.We will stay here again!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Westin DIA,"Nice, new modern hotel.  Extremely convenient if you have an early morning flight. Easy access directly to the terminal.  Very convenient if you take the train to the airport. All the modern amenities, nice restaurant and bar, easy access to main terminal bars and restaurants.  A little too modern for my taste: lots of white and gray decorations.  Overall a comfortable, convenient hotel at the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Lovey Modern Contemporary Hotel,"Our Business Class room was very nice, comfortable bed, nice lounge next to window, quiet, lots of storage space for luggage and clothing, great bathroom with nice ammenities.  Our reservaton included free wifi, but to get it you have to click on a charge which is supposed to be removed at checkout, as well as a $20 dining credit.  We ordered room service which was very prompt with courteous service, food was hot and good, although automatic gratuity and delivery charge were steep. Room could use an additional chair so that two people could eat at the small table.  Liked being able to walk to the airport.At checkout we requested a copy of our bill but were told we could not get one, it would be emailed.  We asked if the clerk could check to make sure the WiFi charge was reversed and the dining credit was applied; she replied she could not. Have never checked out of a hotel and not been able to get a copy of the bill to review the charges.   When we got home we recived a copy of the bill and the WiFi charge had not been reversed and the dining credit had not been applied.  We contacted the hotel and were transfered to voice mail which instructed us to leave a message and someone would respond within 48-72 hours; no one responded.  We left three separate detailed messages and no one ever responded.  I finally called and asked to speak with the manager, was transferred to a person in the finance office and after he heard why I was calling, said he would hand carry the message directly to the manager.  Shortly after that phone call we received an email stating the charge had been reversed and the dinning credit applied. It should not have taken so long to sort out and could have been handled at the desk.  We travel to Denver often and will try this hotel again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Exceptional Airport Hotel.  ,Second time staying here after a week of skiing in the mountains.  I love the convenience of walking to the airport for early flights.  The beds are amazing.  Just what the body needs to relax.  Service is hands down above the rest.   Checking was smooth and bar service was prompt.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Modern -Good Stay,"Platinum Marriott/SPGGreat stay. When asked for Platinum upgrade, front desk arranged for beautiful room near pool. We were celebrating 50th birthday. Received ""welcome and delight"" gift. Great job. Only issue was that the bathroom door was broken and maintenance could not fix it.-Pool was beautiful, but water was on the cool side for a heated pool.We ordered room service at pool. Service extreme slow and food quality was poor.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very modern and very clean,This is the new hotel at DIA.  It is very modern and clean.  Valet parking is very easy and inexpensive for major airport hotel.  Plus the hotel is built above the rail station so traveling in to the city is easy.  Check in is on 6 the floor.  The rooms are very clean and amazingly quiet for being right next to the airport.  This is pricy hotel so if you are budget conscious you may want to skip it.  Restaurant food is very fresh and clean.  Service in the restaurant is a little slow for a metro airport hotel.,3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great hotel but.,"Expensive. Very nice rooms quiet despite being right at airport. Everything is brand new the beds super comfortable. Modern conveniences. There are some problems. No thought given to outlets in the room. To use iron you have to drag the ironing board to some very inconvenient spots. The ironing board is new but should be condemned!!! What a useless piece of junk. Mine collapsed a few times, no padding so ironing ANYTHING properly was a joke. How could such a upscale hotel be so cheap to put this junk in a room. So much for the business traveler trying to look good the next day.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best Airport Hotel!,"I used hotel for flight out. (I was going to have it for the flight in, also. My flight was delayed one day because of FLL shooting/lockdown, which they didn't have to give me back my points and they did anyway- so grateful!) Since I'm Platinum, I got upgraded to two executive suites and free breakfast for my party of 4 for 2 rooms. WOW, what a great 1 bedroom apt feel, and huge master bathroom! I had a great view of the runway and airport. They have a salt water pool and spa, and I enjoyed both. I didn't use gym, but I think I would have if I had more time. When I had to catch my flight, I just had to walk a short distance across the way. There is a train that goes to town, but I didn't use. Just for the fact that; the location is awesome, they have very friendly staff, and it's just so clean and new, I would say, you can't go wrong staying there. Also, I loved the fact that, when I dropped off my rental car, I got a shuttle to airport and I walked to hotel. (If you have a lot of luggage like I did, you will just have to pay $3 for parking to get to hotel entry/valet. Valet let me keep my car there while I checked in, and then I returned rental car).",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Nice Hotel, Outstanding Service","Ever hear that phrase ""the customer is always right""?  Well the staff at the Westin takes that to hear even when he isn't.  I won't bore readers with the details but suffice it to say Amex attempted to deliver a package to me and I accused the Westin staff of making an error in its receipt.  It turns out Amex was at fault the entire time (maybe another review on that).  But to their credit the staff at the Westin dutifully took responsibility.  I am 100% certain that I will stay at this hotel again.  I am 100% certain I will call corporate to commend the Westin staff.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient but soulless and expensive,"You couldn't ask for a more convenient location for Denver Airport -- it's literally just a few steps away from the terminal building.  It's a smart building too, with stylish rooms.  Ours, on the 12th floor had a great view of the planes coming in to land.  We had snacks and drinks in the Sky Bar, and the food was good.  However, the whole place is a bit soulless; for example, the Sky Bar is in the same place as reception but only opens in the evening.  If you want a coffee during the day you have to go down to the cafe and have it in a paper cup.  Why not have the bar open all day, and give the place a bit of life?  The restaurant looks nice, but claims of great views are very over-stated, as it looks out onto the route to the terminal building.  Some of the best views are from the pool on the 11th floor, but there are no changing rooms, which seems odd.  This hotel plays on its location to justify high prices.  In the past we've stayed at much cheaper off-Airport hotels just a few minutes bus ride away -- and they're much better value.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Restful,"After a day of flight delays and finally cancellation of my flight into Aspen, I had had enough of the rigmarole.  I was grateful for the option to the bus ride and motel accommodation the airline offered, and was able to walk across the breezeway to the Westin.  Within minutes I was in a lovely, clean and quiet room and enjoyed a simple meal.  Every amenity was available for a weary traveler's refreshing bath and then, the best part, hours of rest in very comfortable bedding.  It was unforgettable.The customs and check in area was visible from my window, so after breakfast, an elevator ride and short walk took me back to the airport world to resume my journey.  Thank you Westin.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Dynamic location and five minutes to checkin,Was intrigued by the photos and had to give it a try. Made it easy to turn in the rental car a day early! Two steps away from the security checkin. Stayed on the 14th floor with a dynamic view of the airport. The restaurant is delicious - there is a Starbucks inside and the lobby bar is a great atmosphere. Highly recommend a visit.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One of the worst hotel experiences,"Entering my frequent guest number took two people and three tries. The USB charging ports don't work, now my phone is dead for the one-day business trip I came to town for. The front door concierge can't tell you where you are to guide the Uber driver to the door. It's a beautiful building with the most convenient location possible but it doesn't work and the people don't know how to do their jobs.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Most convenient stay of my life. ,"I woke up at 6:15 am. Ordered breakfast Showered Ate my delivered breakfast Got dressed-hair and make up Left hotelGot to my gate by 7:05 for boarding. I have pre-check, but still.  Amazing!! And great views!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great way to start a trip,My husband and I stayed at the DIA Westin before we left for Puerto Vallarta. It made our check in so much nicer because we didn't have to get up at 4:00 to get to DIA by 6:00. We were able to take the light rail in the night before therefore saving on parking. We had dinner in the Grill and Vine and were able to relax the rest of the evening. The price for a room may seem a little daunting but since we saved on parking and were very relaxed we felt it was very worth it.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Anniversary Stay,"Had a wonderful stay........it was an anniversary stay and my husband was suppose to land at 7:45pm. Flight was delayed 3 times and finally landed at 2:00am. Most of the stay was solo but once he arrived, all was well. We had a junior suite on the east end. Wonderful room with windows all around. It snowed that evening and into the morning..... gosh what a view!!! We are both natives of Colorado but we never tire of the spectacular feel of Colorado. Breakfast was great in the Grill and Vine restaurant. Very pleasant wait staff. For an airport hotel, it was extremely quiet. Enjoyed our time together at a beautiful hotel. Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,An oasis ,Great staff. Such a relaxing 12 hours in this calm stylish and ultra modern oasis. 15 minutes from my room to the gate this morning at 6h30 am. Bravo for your efficiency and politeness.  I'll be back. Thanks.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,What happened with the design?,"OK...flight turned back and had to overnight in Denver.  The Westin is absolutely the most convenient airport to the hotel.  Literally steps from the terminal.  Can't beat the convenience.  You are also right at the terminal for the train to downtown - which can be a nice trip if you have the time.  That said, the hotel is really really boring.  Clean and comfortable and so generic.  The color scheme is monochromatic - mostly white and extremely neutral browns and a few grays.  Futuristic maybe, but not in a good way.  No warmth.  I do not like that the reception area is in the same room with the bar.  Too much noise from the TV turned up super loud so that one guy can watch football.  Could not easily hear the desk clerk.  I ate dinner at the restaurant on the property and it was surprisingly good with a very nice group of servers who were from several other countries.  Stay here if you need to be at the airport, but don't expect anything over the top.  Good, clean, close, and convenient.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient location...but,"I was forced to overnight in Denver after a mechanical issue with my United flight to the east coast.  Given that it was 11pm and my rebooked flight was 7am I opted for the Westin instead of the off airport hotels the airlines was handing out. I was told by United that they had a rate with the Westin I could use.  When I got to the hotel I was ""upsold"" the walk in rate of $299 even after telling them about the rate with United. My colleague who checked in later got the United rate of $200.  Notwithstanding the price gouge for a weary business traveller, the room was extremely noisy and hot.  There was virtually no possibility to actually stop the AC running at max fan and heat.  I was told at check out they would adjust my bill for the inconvenience and also to reflect the United rate.  To date nothing has been done even though I am one of their SPG Gold member.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Clean, comfortable and cannot beat the convenience!","My husband, toddler and I have stayed here three times now, and it is worth every penny. When you have a 5 or 6 am flight out of DIA, how can you beat a 30 second walk to the airport? You deal with the parking hassle the day before. Depending on what side of the hotel you are on, you can see the airport security line to get an advanced warning of how busy the airport is.The hotel is very clean and modern, and right outside the hotel there are often various activities (beer garden in the summer, ice skating in the winter).The only downfall is it is more expensive than area hotels. We've stayed at others that were also nice, but there was about a 15 minute shuttle ride to the airport. Not a big deal, but when you have the option to skip the shuttle, sleep a little longer, and just go right to you car once you've landed back in Denver, it is totally worth it. We will always use this hotel when we fly out of Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Service above and beyond,"We arrived late after a delayed flight from Chicago,my daughter lost her teddy bear on the plane and was very upset,Rex(i hope i his name was correct)from the check in,had surprise her next morning with new teddy and a letter from her old teddy .......it was so sweet and cute,he also got a toy for my son:)that was the best experience which we ever hadbeside that the hotel is amazing,no noise at all from the airport.The staff is just so sweet and helpfulhighly recomended",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great place!,"Beautiful, clean and so convenient. Rooms very nice, very clean and very modern. Staff very helpful. Restaurant in hotel very nice and very good food. Really enjoyed the decorations for Christmasa and the overall decor of the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Easy morning flight,"This was a great hotel for an early early morning flight, we were thankful because even with a 5 am flight the security lines at DIA were busy. We have stayed at other Tower road hotels and taken the shuttle in, but this was by far easier. We had a room where we could see TSA and baggage drop off that made it easier to see when we should go down and drop off bags. We did park at off-airport parking and shuttled in the night before, which was way cheaper. The hotel rooms were quite and comfortable, comparable to better than off-airport hotels. I would recommend despite the price. Escalator up to the hotel was easily missed.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful hotel but NOISY - we got no sleep,"Before we get into the details of our stay, we'd like to point out that we gave the Westin an opportunity to address our concern before we posted this review. We e-mailed the hotel on Dec 30, 2016, and as of the date we posted this review (Jan 8, 2017) did not receive a response. We don't enjoy posting negative reviews, however we feel it's necessary to let other travelers know about our experience, as they will most likely have the same experience as us.The Westin Denver Airport is located across from the airport itself. Travelers only have to exit the airport and walk about 45 seconds to get to the hotel. We were scheduled to fly into the Denver airport from Canada the night of December 20 2016, with a connecting flight to Houston at 5 AM the next morning. Since we knew that we'd be out of the airport by about 10 PM, and having to get up at 3 AM the next morning, sleep would be at a premium. We decided to book a room at the Westin and were willing to pay more than other hotels in the area just to be able to reduce transit time and get a better night's sleep. The hotel does cost about $100-150 more than other hotels in the area, however we'd be saving time by not having to take taxis or shuttles to and from the airport which could give us an extra hour of sleep.We have to say that the hotel is BEAUTIFUL. Checking in took about 20 minutes, however this is understandable as a few flights may have landed and many guests were checking in at the same time. The check in staff were polite and professional and got us checked in quickly once we got to the front of the line. We were assigned a room on the 9th floor (I believe room 985?), and we were so impressed with it. It was spacious, had incredible views, and we loved the retractable window shades. We got into the bed just before 10:30 PM and hoped to get a few hours sleep before our alarm went off at 3 AM.Here's where our concern was. Around 11 PM, and lasting for the rest of the night, huge trucks and bulldozers were clearing snow right beneath our window at street level. The clanging, banging, and beeping of the reverse gear warning sounds didn't stop. We got no sleep at all. In the morning, we mentioned our concern to the front desk clerk, who nonchalantly apologized and said they were sorry but the hotel systems were down at the moment and they couldn't check us out. Dumbfounded, we said we had a 5 AM flight to catch, and asked if we could just leave our room key with the front desk so they could check us out when the system came back up. The front desk clerk agreed and we were on our way. The clerk wasn't rude, but she seemed to be more concerned with the hotel's system than our enjoyment.As of Dec 30 2016, the hotel website states you have ""519 soundproof guest rooms"". The room was ANYTHING but soundproof. We may as well have been sleeping on a bed beside the trucks, it was that loud. Now we are reasonable people. We realize that the hotel is not responsible for equipment that is used or hired by the airport. However, the hotel certainly was responsible for accepting our $300+ for a room that offered no peace and quiet. Yes, you can say that we could have called the front desk and asked for a new room. But if the hotel KNEW that this was going on, why on earth would they allow guests to stay in these rooms, and have the gall to charge full price for them? Certainly, the hotel must be aware that these late night activities took place by the airport, and must have received complaints about it before. Yet there was no mention about it either on the website or at the front desk. To us, this is unethical and shameful. The fact that we had no sleep at all in a $300+ room, coupled with the nonchalant response of the front desk clerk and the lack of reply from the hotel itself, prompted us to provide this review and give a low rating. If you choose to stay at the Westin Denver Airport hotel, we hope you have a different experience as the hotel truly is a unique and beautiful building.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Good hotel in good location ,Had a forced overnight at the Denver airport and was glad that the Westin is now open. Good location right by the terminal. Rooms are spacious and the rate was excellent . I had dinner in the lobby Barr and food and service was very good . Only issue is that I had some dirty wine glasses outside my door. I had housekeeping cone for something else and they somehow didn't bother collecting them the whole day and night . A bit more dedication to detail would be good . Staff was very friendly .Would definitely go back,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Good set up - but in need of better attention to details ,"A really nice Airport Hotel, conveniently located - especially when it is sub zero outside. However, wake up call 15 min late and breakfast 40 min late is not good enough for an airport hotel. When you go to the bar and the restaurant in the hotel, you get the feeling that the staff is somewhat overworked. Room for improvement but a good ""concept"".",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best Westin ever that we experienced,"We heard about the new Westin At Denver Colorado airport from acquaintances we meet vacationing in California for Rose Bowl game and parade. Our flight home included short layover in Denver, but our connecting flight home was cancelled due to mechanical problems so we opted to stay at the Westin. You take the airport tram to stop 2 baggage claim and follow signs in airport to Westin. Exit the airport and walk short distance outside to the Westin. It is spectacular. Ultra contemporary with expansive lobby and seating all with window walls and views. They have2 banks of elevators depending which wing you are in. Each bank has 2 elevators . One to floor 5 and other for floor 6-14. Our room 13th  floor , a lucky number for us.The  room was also very contemporary and had King size bed , comfortable oversized chair, desk and chair, round table ,built in cedar lined drawers and closets, in room safe .We put the desk chair and sitting chair in front of the huge window wall with a view of the ultra modern airport that looks like mountains and valleys that are translucent and lighted at night . Beautiful view to enjoy our evening beverage .The entire room were muted shades gray , beige , off white including the wall covering and floor, and carpet . The bed was Weston's standard of the best linens, 4 King size pillows, and down comforter . The walk in shower  had the rain shower as well as hand held wand and magnifying mirror. Room very quiet !Suggestions join Starwood Preferred so get free internet vs $10 day and search lowest price online vs calling for reservation. We asked for lowest priced room on  Tuesday early evening and with tax was $369! We were allowed $100 room by airline since mechanical and had travel insurance $100 per day pp so most rate covered. The airline was willing to get us a room at one of the hotels that they had contracts with but we opted for the cash refund instead .Had a very comfortable and pleasurable stay to end our vacation until our 10:45 flight took off on time .Would definitely recommend .",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Very convenient for early departures, not a luxury hotel","We splurged on the Westin ahead of a 6:30AM departure.  It was great to get a bit of extra sleep and walk in to the terminal.  Room was comfortable with a stunning sunset view showing the airport architecture.  The room was also very quiet, despite the proximity to the aircraft.  The gym was great and the pool looked nice as well.  I was disappointed with the lack of a minibar (well, there was one, but it was empty).   We chose to just get food in the airport terminal and bring it back, to save time.  A family in the elevator told us that the service in the restaurant was very slow, so perhaps we made a good choice.  Free internet for Gold SPG.  You can't drive up to the hotel and drop luggage and then drop the rental car without paying a small parking fee.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great stay!,We had a great time staying at this Westin. Richard from the front desk checked us in and was so hospitable in answering any questions we had since it was our first time at the Westin. It was a quick check in and then enjoyed a night cap at the bar. Really enjoyed staying here and will again in the future.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Super Convenient and Fun for Kids,"We visit Denver often and love that we have a great option for those early flights! As others stated, it is quite literally next to the airport terminal check-in lines! We walked out of the Westin through the plaza to security in about 4 minutes!The rooms are adequate, clean, modern and new. The kids LOVED watching the busy airport happenings, all the lights, planes, etc. out of their window. It's a bit more difficult to see outside at night though. And surprisingly, there was zero noise from the airport. Another huge bonus for us was being able to use their complimentary business area to print our boarding passes! We did not have time to check out the restaurant, fitness or bar but all looked great!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Restaurant seems like a diner,"The ambiance of this hotel restaurant is akin to an upscale Denny's.  After the hoopla of this ""architectural masterpiece""(looks like a misplaced whale), I finally ventured from Denver to try out the restaurant.  The food (appetizer) was well prepared and good, if overpriced.  But the design of the facility was horrible. For a somewhat upscale hotel, the restaurant looked like a diner or cafeteria.  Too much glaring light; cheap tables.  Service and what food I sampled was good but the overall experience was negative due to the ambiance. True, their customers likely are travelers so they probably don't look for repeat business, but really. The Elway's on concourse B is a truly fine experience and one would barely notice they were in an airport (better than downtown Elway's).",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient and Unique DIA Hotel,"We had an early morning flight, so the convenience of staying onsite at the airport was very attractive.  The hotel staff was friendly and attentive.  The room was spacious, clean and upscale.  Although quite pricey compared to the other hotels offsite, the convenience of a two minute walk from the room to the check in counter is unrivaled.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Comfortable, Quiet Westin at Airport","Stopped here on the way to visit family. The location right at the airport was very enticing. First thing I noticed was that they had free, yes free ice skating. Small ice rink but seriously, kids would love this. Easy to get from luggage and terminal over the walkway to the hotel. Checking in was smooth and easy. Being brand new you expect modern amenities and the room delivers on that. I had a King bed which was comfortable and the space, while smaller than most hotels with a similar bed size was fine. They have insulated the hotel very well too since there're planes flying in at all hours - was nice and quiet. Not much of a view as the airport is located far away from the downtown area and the land around the airport looks like the surface of Mars. This hotel also has a restaurant; food was terrible so I don't recommend that at all. For a quick night if you have to stay over though this is as convenient as it gets.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent In All Ways!,"i was in Denver on business. I had chosen the Westin at the Denver Airport because i was going to be there only for one night, though i was skeptical about being able to reach the hotel from the airport ( short distance with luggage) and the aircraft noise. I must say that i was pleasantly surprised. Denver airport itself ( apart from the baggage handling) is one of the best airports i have seen in the world. Reaching the hotel was much easier than i thought. From the baggage carousels it was about a 10 minute walk through the doors and across the covered pathway. The lobby itself is on the 6th floor. Entrance to the hotel is via multiple paths - from the 5th floor or the 7th floor. The check-in was very smooth and the staff too were efficient. The hotel is ultra-modern in every which way, the building, the flooring, the lighting, the ambience, the elevators ( extremely smooth). The room had an amazing view of the city / airport and was very modern. The bed was extremely comfortable, the amenities were excellent, wireless worked very well. I had slept very well that night. it has a good restaurant and a decent spread of breakfast. Service was fast and courteous enough. I must say that this is one of the best hotels i have experienced in the whole of AmericaThe only negative, if at all, is the price. i found it a little too expensive.. but having seen some terrible hotels in the US, at the same price, the Westin is a class apart.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Prime airport location,"You cannot get closer to the airport.  A short walk out the door and you are in the main terminal for check in and security.  The Westin has great convenience for those early morning flights.  The rooms are very quiet and sleep quality is excellent.  Very nice fitness center with lots of glass and natural light.  Restaurant is decent with a spacious bar.  Modern hotel with interesting architectural elements.  Wifi was an issue in the guest room.  I had to use tech support as my PC would not connect.  A short phone call and it was solved, but this almost never happens at major hotel chains so it was surprising.  My next hotel on the trip was no issue so it was something unique in the Westin set-up.  Overall the stay was satisfactory.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Top Quality Service,"I booked a room at the Westin when I was stuck at the Denver Airport in a Blizzard.  It was more expensive than I really wanted to pay but in the end it was worth every dime!  We started by standing in line at the Southwest Ticket counter most of the night hoping to get out of Denver but no luck and we had to stay another night.  The Westin was just across the street so we didn't have to deal with a shuttle ride plus they were so accommodating by allowing us an early check in.  The room was clean and comfortable, the swimming pool and hot tub were the perfect way to relax and we had a nice view of the snow covered airport.  I can't thank the staff enough for helping make a bad situation more bearable!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Quick stop,We had spent a week with family in Colorado and instead of having to get up way early the next morning and chance weather we got a room here for the night. Our flight was early  we literally went from our room to security in five minutes!! This was sooo worth the price. The rooms are excellent and actually quiet despite the locality. The work out room was excellent and the pool and hot tub perfect.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Location location,"Not an original title but it is what it is. Reduces the weather risk if you are coming down from the mountains for a morning flight. You pay a premium for walking to the terminal instead of shuttle from holiday inn.  Check in desk is slow. They need to add more staff. I left something on the room and no one called me back. So they don't care about service. Because, location.  Rooms are nice. Clean. View of the funky airport architecture. And you can walk to the terminal in the am.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Walk-in, Walk-out Convenience to Denver International Airport (DEN)","With an after midnight arrival at DEN from an overseas flight, this hotel was ideal for an overnight stay before a flight departure the next morning.  Recently completed it offers easy walk-in, walk-out convenience to the airport, while other hotels in the area require shuttle pickup.  There are a variety of dining venues available and, if you are staying in the Denver area, ready access to the recently completed local rail connection to downtown Denver.  The hotel is elegantly designed and fits very well with airport facilities.  Panoramic views from the rooms are impressive.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Hit or Miss,"We had two over-night layovers in Denver recently, and had two totally different experiences at the Westin DIA. The first night was horrible, while the second night was just fine. It seems that the experience you get will be based solely on the staff on duty during your stay.Despite the hit or miss on service, the rooms are very nice and modern. Everything is new and clean, which is to be expected of a brand new hotel, really. The rain showers are amazing, and the view of the mountains can't be beat. The bed is comfortable but the pillows are not, and the walls are pretty thin. So as long as you don't have noisy neighbors, the room experience should be just fine.Rooms come with a refrigerator and a safe.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A pleasantly modern hotel with the Holiday Touch,This hotel is a weary  traveler dream  no shuttle required .Just a short walk from main terminal  and TSA check point and you are there. Front desk attendant is pleasant and recognizes spg gold and platinum memberships.The assigned room was  great  in that it compliment the Westin Theme of well being and quality of rest .The bed was super comfortable and a aromatherapy  lavender sleep lotion was placed beside the bed for guest used to enhanced sleep quality. I t nice to see a hotel a place great emphasis on customer's well being. The bathroom was ultra  modern  with the glass shower stall with fancy door . Rain Forest shower head  and shower wand paired with the Westin complementary amenities delivered a relaxing shower experience cap off with super luxurious bath robe to lounge in. The Westin room service team placed Christmas chocolates and cards in each guest room.(Very Nice touch) Thank you Westin Happy Holidays!!,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Joined & Stayed,"Was flying standby out of Colorado Springs Dec 19th.  Couldn't get on any flights and Denver looked like the next best thing for the 20th.  I am a Marriott rewards member and remembered that the Westin is on DIA property.  So, I joined the SPG club, transferred Marriott points the the SPG account (Marriott now owns Sheraton international and their hotels).  Called the hotel, got a reservation and flew home on the 20th.  Hotel was fantastic, comfortable and the restaurant food was also very good.  Room was large and very very nice.  Hotel staff was exceptional also.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing Hotel,"I recently stayed at the Westin at the Denver International Airport when heading home from ski camp. I had an early morning flight on Delta to Detroit and decided to give the new property a shot. I'm glad I did - though it's pricier, it is very much so worth it. The lobby is stunning, the entire property is spotlessly clean and contemporary, the rooms are well-appointed, the bathroom is great, and the pool offers great views of the airport. Westin did a great job with this new property. I plan on staying here again for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Modernist  Chic Lovely Views,"Unbelievable hotel! Quiet, peaceful airport hotel, with a lovely view of the mountains, Even the showers are luxurious! I really was able to relax since my flight was later in the day. Try to get a higher floor with a corner location on the west side of the complex, like 1302 or 1402. Don't forget your swimsuit because the pool is incredible! The workout room fitness center is also nicely apportioned.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Busy, but fun","We only stayed for one night, but found it very new and clean, with a fun and energetic vibe.

Front desk can get busy, so plan ahead.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Early flight,"Beautiful property with great views and totally noise free which is very rare for airport hotels of years ago - we had a handicap suite which was very well done for our needs, excellent staff, interesting menus and a very short walk to the airport. Definitely would recommend and would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Ridiculously pricey - but worth the proximity to DIA sometimes,"Quiet and very clean room, lovely bath products, VERY comfortable bed, and just steps away from my too early morning winter flight at DIA. 'Nuff said. I would never pay the $$$/Starwood points to stay here otherwise. There are other good options not too far away with reliable airport shuttles (e.g., the Gateway area just off I-70).",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A Comfortable Port in a Storm,"This last weekend we found ourselves stuck in Denver due to a heavier than expected snow fall.  Ongoing arrangements we not suitable so we opted to spend the night at this hotel and return to California the next morning.  The real deciding factor to spending the night was the fall that I took in the airport that caused a severe injury to my right knee.  The hotel is very convenient to the airport and now that I was suck in a wheelchair the choice was made.  The only thing missing here is a weatherproof way to get from the airport to the hotel.  While the outdoor distance is fairly short, when it is -2 degrees it is miserable.Check in was quick and we were given a very comfortable right room on the same  floor as the lobby.  Our clerk seemed a bit lacking in the art of conversation and failed to recognize my SPG Gold status nor did he offer the usual SPG Gold amenity.  I also asked if room service could get some ice so I could fashion an ice pack for my knee.  I was told it would be handled right away.  The ice never arrived.As mentioned, the room was comfortable with a club chair and chaise lounge for seating in addition to an office style desk chair.  Bath was clean with a nice large shower.  This hotel is still one that charges for internet access.  What most offer for free Westin still charges $14.95 for a 10 mb connection.The only other issue was with room service.  Ordered dinner for two.  Food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was nice and hot.  The problem was that the linen and silverware setup was for one.  As well as only one wine glass for the bottle that was ordered.  One of the meals was a very tasty bacon cheese burger.  Too bad that no condiments were provided including the mayo on the side that was requested twice during the ordering phone call.Other then the attention to service details mention the stay was as expected for a Westin.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Poor Customer Service for a Platinum Level Member,"Very nice, new, modern hotel with wonderful rooms and amenities.However the staff was not consistent with the overall property.My profile states high floor for a room. I was given a room on the main level adjacent to the airport roadway. I had to drag 2 pieces of luggage and my skis back to the lobby to get a room change and key. Nobody offered to deliver the key nor transport my luggage to the new room.Wake-up call was for 5:30 am. It came 12 minutes late which causes a problem as schedule is tight for catching a plane. When I mentioned this to the person delivering the call I was told ""I had a lot of wake-up calls to deliver'.This is not the level of service I expect as a guest in a hotel especially one who is a ""Lifetime Platinum Level"" member.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fantastic Place,"We decided to stay here the night before an early morning flight. Although it's a little pricey to do that before every flight, I'm glad we went out and experienced it to give the review for friends from out of town. The staff are extremely friendly, the interior is extremely nice and interesting, the rooms and bed are pretty posh (45 degree, two-layer automatic blinds!), and both the lobby bar and breakfast and the restaurant had great food and drinks. If you were already staying in Denver at a hotel downtown and have a morning flight, I would definitely consider making this your last night's stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Margaret was the best !,"After being in the airport for more than 13hours we decided to book a room at the Westin until we found another flight. MARGARET was GREAT at the front desk. She made sure we felt welcomed and enjoyed our stay ! She showed amazing hospitality and also gave us toiletries since we did not have any of our things. Although we were tired, stressed out and extremely aggravated she made us feel much better about our situation. Give Margaret a RAISE !! There needs to be more employees like her. Thanks so much Margaret !!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great hotel!,"PROS: Front desk staff very friendly and efficient.  Decor modern, sophisticated and beautiful. Rooms have great views, wonderfully comfortable beds and linens, and are sound proof. We heard no other guests and NO air traffic. On site ice rink for families and/or couples fun. Airport terminal is just a short walk across a breezeway. Perfect.  Con: Strangely, for a classy, high end hotel, the toilet paper was of extremely poor quality. Thin and rough. Not sure why corners were cut there, when absolutely everything else was high end. That said, it's a pretty small thing. We will absolutely stay at this hotel again. Loved it! BYOTP! ;)",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"High Convenience, Good Service","Stayed at this hotel due to an early flight. The location requires a brief, covered walk from the terminal. The staff was professional and courteous. The price was fairly high, but you are paying for location. There are restaurant and bar options which are good.The one knock was sleep quality for some rooms near fire doors. It would be best to find a room away from these so slamming doors do not awaken you especially if you are a light sleeper. I tried to shut them softly, but even with great care it was not possible.Will use again if stopping through Denver airport.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Love love love ,"It was the last day of our vacation and I choose this hotel because I had an early flight. I was feeling the end of vacation blues. The check in was fantastic. The agent was great and was able to change my mood. The room was great and I would normally do a quick inspection of the room this time I passed and I just sat and watched the beautiful afternoon. I love all the touches to help you get the best sleep and minimize jet lag. Room service was pretty good. Unfortunately, when I went to take a shower the shower wasn't clean and there was still hairs from previous guest. Under other circumstances I would have normally called housekeeping but it was late and I had an early flight so I just use the handheld shower to wash it off. It is hard to see in the pictures, but very easy in person. Between that the bathroom sink stopper had a yellow ring that hasn't been clean well that is the only reason why this hotel doesn't get 5 stars. I didn't have any noise problems and couldn't hear the planes at all.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very Good in an Emergency,"We connected through DEN but found our flight to Vail had been cancelled by weather so we were on our own for hotels.  Convenience pointed us toward the airport Westin and it was the right choice.The one night standard rate was $275 plus all those annoying taxes.  OUCH!  Instead I cashed in 16,000 points and we found our way to the reception desk, which, by the way, was staffed by very friendly and hard working folks.  As a gold, I was given a free drink voucher, free internet, and was told that I was upgraded to a deluxe room.The room, especially the bed, was fine with one exception.  The tiny bathroom had only a shower and no tub.  I know, I should have asked.  This proved disappointing for what they called a deluxe room.We ate in their restaurant and it was fine but what you would expect from an airport location.  Our server was terrific, very friendly and did everything he could to help us with our choices.  We enjoyed watching the skaters as the snow fell.In summary, we would certainly stay here again if our travels required an airport stay.  The convenience is worth the extra dollars.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wish I could give 4.5 stars. Definitely recommend the Westin - Pros and Cons detailed.,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin for one night in December 2016 before an early morning flight and have (almost) nothing but good things to say about the hotel. The pros and cons of the property in our opinion are as follows:PROS:1. LOCATION: This definitely is one of the best features of this hotel. Being able to walk right into the terminal building to check in was fantastic.2. STAFF: I always say that good staff can make a 3-star property 5-star, and vice-versa. Luckily the staff at the Westin, with minor exceptions (see below), were outstanding. We found the staff friendly and helpful.3. ROOM: The room was big with an extremely comfortable king-sized bed. We were only there for one night, so we didn’t unpack, but there was room for us each to have our suitcases open without impeding movement around the room. For anyone staying longer, however, there was plenty of storage space in multiple wardrobes. There was also a large desk and flatscreen TV mounted on the wall facing the bed. 4. BATHROOM: The bathroom was large with great amenities (e.g., shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, etc.) and the shower was big and had a rain-shower head, which is always nice.  The towels were also plentiful and of a high quality.5. VIEW: Our room was facing south, so we had a nice view of the mountains and the arriving trains. We would, however, have been just as happy overlooking the terminal “tents”. I don’t think there is a bad view from this hotel.6. COFFEE MAKERS IN ROOM: It’s one of my pet peeves, but I hate when hotels do not provide even the most basic coffee or tea making facilities in the room. Fortunately, the Westin provides coffee makers in the room.  There were also two free bottles of water,  which was a nice touch.7. FREE WIFI: I always say that in this day of interconnectivity, any hotel that charges for WiFi should be shunned, and any hotel that charges for WiFi “per device” should be driven out of business. Fortunately, the Westin offers free and reliable WiFi for SPG members. We are SPG Gold members, but anyone can sign up for free to get WiFi access.8. SUPER QUIET: There was never a moment when we could tell we were staying right next to a busy airport. It really was fantastic and we got a great nights sleep.9. THERMOSTAT CONTROL: This may seem silly, but how many times have you been in a hotel room where the thermostat ether doesn’t work, or it’s so complicated that you can’t make it work? The rooms at the Westin have individual room controls that are functional and easy to figure out.10. BATHROBES: Not much of an issue for me, but my wife LOVES it when good hotel robes are available for guests. The Westin has great robes! Ha!11. LOUNGE/RESTAURANTS: We had drinks and snacks in the Sky Lounge Bar at night and breakfast at the Grill and Vine Restaurant in the morning. Both provided excellent food and drinks with (mostly - see below) good service. The lounge even overlooked a free, if small, ice rink out on the bridge between the terminal and the hotel! It was really cold when we were there, but that didn’t stop a few people from renting skates and trying it out.  Fun to watch.12. GYM/POOL: We didn’t use these facilities, but I did take a look at the gym and pool, and, as someone who works out regularly, I thought they were outstanding. The gym was extremely well equipped, particularly for a hotel gym.CONS (All very minor):1. LOCATION: As I said above, the location of the hotel is great for its proximity to the terminal, but it may be a bit confusing for some when arriving by car. There is no dedicated entrance to the hotel that we could find and you need to enter the terminal via the departures/check-in doors in the terminal and then work your way down to the bridge that accesses the hotel near the TSA security lines. Also, on the way out, while there is an escalator down to the security lines, you have make your way to the elevators further away to get back up to check-in. None of this is terribly difficult, I just mention it for informational purposes.2. STAFF KNOWLEDGE: As mentioned previously, the vast majority of the staff were outstanding. There was a slight issue, however, checking in when I asked if I could use the keyless entry feature on my phone, as I had just downloaded the feature and wanted to try it out.  The young gentleman at the front desk unfortunately did not seem to know how it worked, so we had to settle for physical keys. No big deal, but the lack of knowledge was slightly disappointing. Also, as mentioned, the breakfast at the restaurant was outstanding, but our server seemed to be in a rather foul mood. Nothing too bad, and hey, everyone has the right to a bad day, but it was noticeable. Ultimately, the Cons for this hotel are extremely minor and far outweighed by the Pros, and my wife and I highly recommend the hotel for anyone wanting or needing to stay as close to DIA as possible.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Luxury and Convenience,"This hotel is as lovely as all the Westin properties. The rooms are plush and comfortable. I did not want to leave. Although only in town for 7 hours, it was the best 6 hours of sleep I have had this year.The lobby is beautiful and the view of the tufts of the Denver international airport are wonderful.And it is soundproof, so even though a short walk to the terminal, I did not hear one plane and slept soundly.Perfect combination of luxury and convenience. The staff was lovely as well.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful Hotel - Some Disappointments,"This is a great hotel.  Love the convenience of staying at the Airport.   The main restaurant is good, but, really the only option for a meal.  Some confusion about my Breakfast voucher.  The Ingredients Coffee Shop was a disappointment.  No Diet Coke.  Very expensive.  Didn't have either of the items on the menu that I wanted.   Wi-Fi worked fine.   I'll stay here again with my expectations not as high.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Just Stopped to Skate,"I took the Bustang from Frisco to Union Station, then the Light Rail to DIA. Walking in to the terminal I was curious of the ice rink. Since I had a couple extra hours to wait, I asked how much to skate? The always present ""Ice Guard"" told me it was FREE! So I went in and got some skates and had a great time.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent choice!,"The Westin at the Denver airport is finally open and very welcome. It's the only hotel attached to the terminal and so its convenience is unmatched in the area. Perfect for an early morning flight. The Westin is quite good looking and our room (basic, 2 queen beds) was large and very comfortable. The on-site restaurant was good and the food prices were, surprisingly, very reasonable despite the fact that the room rates are typically high for an airport hotel. I will definitely stay here again if I have an early flight.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The VERY worst thing about the Westin Denver Airport,"is its useless wi-fi connectivity. Surely the onus should be on the hotel to resolve this and not have the guest call a help desk to try and fix the problem! We stay here often between homes in London, UK and Telluride, CO but I'm tired of this issue every time we are here. I am pleased that the Transit system in now working and I can easily access downtown, where most of the hotels have wi-fi that actually works!",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect for early morning or late night flights,"This Westin has not even been open a year.  It is right at the airport; walk across the elevator lobby to reach the terminal.  It is extremely convenient for early morning flights or a situation in which you are connecting to a flight or shuttle to the mountains.  The room was clean, modern and spacious - all was very comfortable.  Wifi is NOT included in the room rate.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect Hotel for Early Monring Flights,If you are traveling out of DIA on an early morning flight then this place is ideal. Located directly across from the security line this hotel is very new and fun. Great restaurant and multiple bars on site. Rooms are great! Very new and beds are super comfortable (see pics),5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonerful airport hotel,I have stayed at the Westin DIA twice now and enjoyed both trips immensely.  The convenience of being so close to your gate for early flights is awesome.  I have been upgraded twice (Platinum SPG status) to wonderful suites on both the East and West sides with sweeping views of the front range and the flight approaching.  The window shades are all power operated and make you feel like you are in a spaceship.  Nice pool and restaurant bar as well.  When I was there last they had an ice skating rink set up outside the lobby.    Prices are a bit high but worth every cent.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very helpful staff!,"Stayed here unexpectedly when we cancelled our connecting flight from Denver because my wife was not feeling well. Short walk from the airport terminal. The front desk staff, housekeeping and the restaurant staff were all very helpful and accommodating as my wife recovered over a couple of days. The desk provided basic toiletries and an extra robe since our luggage continued on our connecting flight. The Grill and Vine chef even put together a special meal for my wife to have in our room to help her recover and included enough extra soup so I could have some too!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Superb!,"Awesome modern hotel steps from the airport TSA security queue, super convenient! Staff was great, the rooms were really nice, beds are totally comfortable, no airplane noise at all, fitness center and pool are great, lobby bar was a cool place to catch a drink. I spend over 100 nites per year in hotels, this one was fantastic!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent!,"We stayed here one night before our early AM flight the next morning.As we are Denver locals, we were excited to check out this new (and only hotel) attached to the airport. We checked in around 3P and it could not have been smoother. We were on one of the top floor and had an excellent south facing view. Soon after checking in, we changed into our bathing suits and headed straight for the pool and jacuzzi, which are fantastic. The jacuzzi is spacious and can accommodate a good 15-20 people. It was very realizing as massaging jets abound. The salt water pool was also relaxing and tranquil. The entire space is very ""spa"" like, even though their is no actual spa at the hotel. You can have spa services ordered for your room. After our rest in the pool and jacuzzi, we headed into the airport main terminal to peruse some of the local shops we are familiar with in the terminal. We enjoyed food and wine at Pour la France..and the price point here cannot be beat!We also enjoyed some food at the bar in the hotel, which was tasty and hit the spot. The staff are very friendly.The beds are super comfortable and ensure a good nights sleep.Check out was a breeze and we jetted right into the TSA pre check queue within a couple minutes of walking from the hotel to the terminal.I am sure it goes without saying this is a very pricey hotel. We used Starwood points to stay here. For you out-of-towners, there are several other hotel options available at much lower prices that are not at the airport, but within a few miles, and most have complimentary shuttles.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Hotel ,Stayed the night on one of the busiest travel days of the year.  Fantastically quiet room.  Bed was great and shower was heavenly.  Would stay again.  A great idea for an early flight. No worries about weather or parking. The views are wonderful.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Destination Point: Airport Hotel,"I usually turn my nose up at airport hotels and only stay there if required for business meetings or (bad news!) my flight got canceled.  Be they're more humble or plush, the architecture and décor are usually humdrum, and who wants to stay at a place where there is no outdoor space worth spending time in?!!  Such was my attitude when I arrived at the Westin Denver International Airport hotel for business in May.  I was impressed by the courtyard between the terminal and the hotel, with a stunning and fun modern moving sculptural installation (yes, it's a bit nippy in cold weather, but it beckons you outdoors to spend time there).  The minute I entered its lobby, I was wowed. The architecture is spectacular: open airy lobby with tall soaring ceilings, huge floor to ceiling windows onto the beautiful airport or the train terminal to the city -- the entire complex had a cohesiveness and grace that I found spiritually uplifting. And, my room had a striking view of the terminal, another architectural masterpiece that evokes the Rocky Mountain peaks.  I had a tasty dinner and got great service at the Grill and Vine, and the catering for my two-day meeting was always delicious and mostly healthy.  I told everyone about my wonderful stay.  This is a hotel I would make a point of staying at in the future!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great service ,"From the very start, the service was wonderful. My valet, Dre, was very prompt and professional, I really appreciated his great welcome. I proceeded to check in and casually mentioned to Robert that it was my birthday; he surprised me by upgrading my room and giving me a gift card for dinner. I was really touched! The room was beautiful, everything I expect from a Westin. Thanks for a wonderful stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Really disappointing,"It should be a requirement that a person who designs hotels should actually have the past experience of staying in hotels.  Whoever designed the DIA Westin certainly did not.   I booked in for one night since I was getting in late and didn't want to drive home in the ice and snow.  First problem is what Einstein decided that walking outside from the terminal to the hotel would be fun in winter?  OK, it's not far, but still a major oversight.  I got to the hotel at 1:30am.   The hotel is uber modern and trendy to the max.  The giant white lobby with the little bar in the middle is as cold as it was outside.  Colder, actually.  My room was the same.  Large, but cold and impersonal.  The bathroom was large but cold.  No character.  It's new so that's nice and clean as can be expected by Westin but no character at all.  I just wanted a small snack before turning in but there was no mini-bar in the room!  A $325/night hotel with no mini-bar?  Gimme a break.  And of course no vending machines.  So I ordered a small item from the late night room service menu - pot stickers.  They arrived in about 25 minutes but were mediocre at best and very salty.  Half the order was all I needed.On the positive, the bed and linens were very comfortable and high quality.  The little interaction that I had with the staff was good.   Overall a really disappointing experience and not I would expect from a Westin.   Next time, I'll head to Tower Road because the Courtyard is much more pleasant.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazingly Beautiful Hotel,We decided to stay one more night in Denver so since we had to return our rental car we chose to stay here at the Westin. BEAUTIFUL APPOINTED ROOMS! Super clean and very professionally managed.Sure it's a little pricey but you pay for convenience and upscale. We will definitely stay here again!!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Nope, not what you would hope.","I don't mind expensive, I don't mind mediocre. Here's what I do mind, expensive and mediocre combined. Bah.  A room which prices at $300 should not charge $10 for in room WIFI, and $6 for a local call.  Where are these ideas coming from 1980?  I travel all over the world, and have stayed in hostels in Russia with free wifi, cheap hotels in Iran, free in room wifi, expensive top of the line hotels in Istanbul, free in room wifi.Also the bathroom.  Why have a bathtub when there is not hot water enough to fill the tub.  Leave out the tub and there would be no expectation.  And fix the drain so when you are showering you're not ankle deep in lukewarm water. Also, we dropped the car at valet parking and were told just to take the escalator up.  How then did we then find ourselves walking through someone's very expensive wedding reception?  That was so weird.  And then up again and there was the lobby?  Really that was the lobby? Oh dear oh me. The beds were comfortable, and no airplane sounds at all.  Also for an early AM flight perfect.  My daughter says the train to the airport is still working out kinks and is not totally reliable, doesn't always run as planned etc.  So, this hotel is your best bet for early flights.  Later ones I would recommend going into Denver where there are good hotels, things to do and excellent places to eat.  Don't count on the Grill and Vine.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent hotel connected to the DEN airport,"This is a great choice if you are looking for a high end hotel directly connected to the DEN airport.   I had a large king room which had new furniture, good amenities and was sound proofed from the airplane takeoffs/landings.I had a minor issue with the wifi network not seeming to recognize me as a guest.  I did call guest services but they had to forward me to the IT customer service which never picked up.  In the end I just used a iPhone hotspot as I didn't wan't to spend more time on hold.I highly recommend this for travelers looking for a good transit hotel right at the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great place to stay before early departure,I had an early departure leaving at 6:30 in the morning and live in Fort Collins area.  I would have had to leave super early to catch my flight so decided to try this hotel out.  It started out with a room upgrade to a huge room!  Score!!  I loved the view from the 13th floor so much that I slept with the drapes open so I could see it all night.  It was amazing and a real treat!!  Food at the restaurant was okay but the hotel was wonderful!  Thanks Westin!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient & Comfy,"Arrived late and needed to catch an early flight. Easy access into the airport directly from this modern hotel.  Small rooms that overlook the buildings surrounding the airport. Yet, I can rest assured that I'll have a clean, quiet room and a enjoy great nights sleep at the Westin.  This Westin didn't disappoint.  Great service. Tasty breakfast before departure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Oh, that Heavenly Bed!","I had a meeting at Denver International Airport very early in the AM and needed to work the day before so arrived at DEN at 10:30 PM. I stayed at the new Westin DIA. The room was beautiful. The Westin ""Heavenly Bed"" was even more comfortable than their usual. I got a full night's sleep which is atypical for me the first night in. And the coffee in the AM was excellent. Add in an attentive and courteous front desk staff and it all added up to a hassle-free business trip (even the two plane flights were on time!!). Thanks, Westin. I will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful hotel and perfect location,"This is a gorgeous new hotel. It is well kept and so convenient. I received an upgrade to a beautiful suite which definitely enhanced my stay. The hotel is right outside of baggage claim. No shuttle, no street to cross with luggage. It is the ideal location if you have to catch a flight in the morning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice way to end a trip,"We booked our reservation to conclude an overseas flight from Europe to Denver.  By the time we arrived at the Westin, we had been up for twenty-six hours.  The relief of having a perfect room, and a quiet environment, just steps from the main terminal, was incredible.  The room was large, well-appointed, and the mattress, it were as if we had ordered it to our personal specifications.  This was the second time we used the Denver Airport Westin to decompress from a long flight, before going to our home on the far side of the Denver Metro area.  Well worth the price.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Lovely hotel and very convenient ,"Really easy to get to this hotel , a short stroll from baggage reclaim . Check in efficient but friendly and my king room clean and comfortable with a great view of the famous Denver airport tents . I enjoyed a delicious room service breakfast which arrived within 15 minutes of my order . Great .Only problem was I asked for feather free bedding . Half the pillows were feather and although I checked the bedding I started to feel ill and discovered that the feather free duvet had just been placed on top of the feather one . Jet lagged I had to strip the bed myself in the middle of the night ... Shame as otherwise I would have give four stars .",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very convenient,"The hotel is adjacent to DIA, which makes it very convenient for flights out of DIA. Some people have complained about the check-in - I did not have any problems, although I would say the check-in was somewhat 'antiseptic'. The room itself was beautiful and clean. I ordered room service and it came quickly and the room server was very nice and friendly. When I went to connect to the internet,  I was surprised that the hotel charged $9.95 for basic internet, and $14.95 for upgraded. I hadn't had internet access for five days, so went ahead and agreed to pay the $9.95, although I was thinking that with the prices the hotels charges, and today's world, that it was ridiculous to charge for internet. On check-out, the hotel employee, without asking, took off the $9.95 internet charge. So perhaps the hotel has learned. I would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Relax!  Sleep in!  Then check in!,"Got an early morning flight out of DIA?  Relax!  Don't get up at 4:00 AM to drive to the airport.  Instead, check into The Westin Denver International the night before and sleep in!  Seasoned travelers can appreciate the welcoming spirit of the staff at the Westin, and especially appreciate the opportunity to get up and walk across the plaza to check their bags and then board their plane.  And when you arrive late at night, you can just reverse the process!  Don't fall asleep in a dingy cab on the way home.  Fall asleep in a Heavenly Bed and wake up refreshed.  Just sayin'...",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenient, comfortable, and great service","I stayed at the Westin Denver International Airport for a group meeting. The hotel is a short walk from the airport and it is very well set up for comfortable lodging and business meeting. Although going downtown will take a bit of time but the train is clear, inexpensive, and convenient. I will seriously consider staying at this Westin if the circumstance is right.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great experience ,Customer Service at its best. Everyone made me feel very valued.  The rooms are comfortable. The fitness center is fantastic.  The restaurant was good.  Highly recommend this hotel.  I attended a conference and really hope all future conferences are held here.  There is no need to go off site !  Great job Westin !  You did this one right,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Hassle-free start to a long journey,"We were scheduled for an early morning flight out of Denver to Vietnam in December. Unwilling to get up real early and unsure if weather, we decided to book a room at the hotel for the night before the trip. The hotel is beautiful and bed was super comfortable. The staff is knowledgeable and understand that many guests are doing the same thing as we were and inquired without asking whether we needed a wakeup call or a porter in the morning. It was so nice to just get up, get ready, and walk into the terminal. I just wish you did not have to go outside to get to the terminal. Why they did not include an enclosed walkway is a mystery",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,So convenient for early morning flights,I have stayed here twice now recognizing how convenient it is for early morning flights. The rooms are super comfortable and modern. The hotel has a nice bar overlooking the terminal and the indoor pool and workout room have incredible views from up top!You may even catch a movie on the plaza or some other event hosted by the airport I believe on your stay. If you need a hotel at the airport it doesn't get any closer than this.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Exceeded expectations,"Was not looking forward to being stuck in an airport hotel, but the rooms, hallways and meeting rooms were so nice, I enjoyed my stay a lot. The pool and fitness center were excellent as well. Everything was clean and new. Very friendly staff. It is also very nice to be able to walk to your hotel from your flight and then walk to check-in at the end of your stay, particularly since Denver itself is so far away.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent hotel and oustanding service and kindness.,"I usually though that the Airport Hotels only provided basic services for passangers staying overnight for connections, but this hotel really impressed to me, for the services, cleanes and it is conveniently connected to get to the Denver Downtown on a fast, chap and secure basis by train, which terminal station is just below the lobby. I found it very very convenient for travelers who will connect the next day but have some spare time to visit Denver downtown, which is beautiful and enjoyable, in the meantime.    In spite of being an Airport hotel, you will never notice the airplanes noice as it is perfectly cancelled and the windows are roof to floor to feel the freedom even in your room.    You don´t have to take a taxi to your hotel, just cross the plaza and you are checking in.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"New,convenient but avoid the restaurant","Comfortable Westin beds , double glazed windows  ,short walk from the  terminal . The hotel suffers from some non-logical design  features such as reception ,small gym and dip pool.Do yourself a favor  and eat somewhere else . Food lacks freshness ,it  is poorly executed and its rather cold .Dont be fooled by reading the menu . New chef might be the key.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Couldn't have been more convenient and comfortable!,"I attended a 3-day conference at the Westin DIA. I  must say, being able to walk right into the hotel lobby from the terminal was a huge convenience.  Adding to that, the spacious, luxurious and beautifully appointed room (with mechanized window coverings) made it absolutely perfect. Never slept better.  It's a great place for events and corporate meetings!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best Hotel in the DIA Area,"This is still the best Hotel to stay at DIA. Whether you have an early morning flight , or one that has been cancelled, this is a great place to stay.Rooms are clean and quiet, there is access to DIA for food and shopping pre-security area.Best access is by RTD bus or commuter rail.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Right next to terminal, modern, great sleep","A very modern design, welcoming staff, neat views, small indoor salt water pool and hot tub, nice workout room and comfortable, quiet room. A great option if you get stuck at the airport or have an early morning flight. The only disappointments were the ridiculously high parking fee, no changing room at the pool and the very poor restaurant option. You can park off site and take the shuttle right to the Westin and I would go into the airport terminal to look for a better dinner option next time.It is pricy. There are some cheaper hotel options about 15-20 min away, too.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great for meeting events,I planned a lunch meeting here and everything went smoothly. Chelsey was professional and responded quickly to help me get everything set up for my meeting. I would definitely plan another event here.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Airport surprise,"This airport has a mini mall inside.  You will love to shop.  Bring your wallet for 1 of a kind finds. Shops,  eateries,  fragrance shops,  they even have a Bose kiosk. It was truly worth the 3 hour layover.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great stay,"We had a wonderful dinner with good food and great service at the hotel.  Our room was very nice with a good mattress, thus a good night's sleep.  The next morning our luggage was taken to the airline counter by room service---just perfect!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"When delayed, stay here!","Traveling back to California after I flew out to the east coast to meet my husband out on his business trip.My flight got delayed several times, then eventually canceled.... this was the closest hotel and THANK GOD. Rooms were very nice, hotel bar was a big added plus! I ordered dinner in and enjoyed a bottle of wine before my early flight the next morning! Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Wonderful hotel,"Conveniently located on the property of the Denver Int'l Airport this hotel offers upscale, luxurious accommodations. It can't get any better than this. The rooms are beautifully designed. The bathrooms are so elegant. The hotel offers a nice big gym and beautiful pool overlooking the grounds at DIA.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Just what was needed,"We booked this hotel at the start of our trip. After a seven hour delay this hotel was a life saver. It is right in the airport terminal, so hardly any walking. The staff were  quick and efficient and our room excellent.The breakfast was lovely if a bit pricey.After a bad start we felt a whole lot better thanks to the Westin.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fantastic Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here during a conference.  What makes this property unique is the location to the airport.  It was possible to fly in to the Denver airport, attend the conference and never have to leave the airport property.   Everything was assesible by foot.  The hotel is beautiful, and the rooms were as well.  The hotel is still very new and clean!  We were amazed how close we were to the airport and you could not hear the planes.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you need to stay close to the airport.  We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the food was very good.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,easy for making connecting flights,"Had to ask, but once back at terminal, head downstairs to shuttle trains. There are A, B, or C gates. Takes less than 10 mins to get to another gate. Several fast food options. Folks were nice, but at McDonalds, still unsure how ""Quarter Pounder"" can revert back into 8 syllables. Airport looks clean.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Awesome location,"My wife and I always try and stay at this hotel and we are never disappointed. We feel for an airport hotel, this is exceptional. The restaurants are always serving great food with an eclectic menu. The very modern bar next to the checkin is a special treat.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great food and shope,"An amazing number of shops for a variety of gifts, mostly pricey, but some not so much.   There is a wide range of restaurants also, something for every taste.    Signage is excellent.  Clean and neat throughout including restrooms.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Couldn't be more convenient,"Staying here is a game changer for an early morning flight. It's expensive and that is why I have been reluctant to try it but glad I did. I took the train from downtown, walked in to the hotel and walked out the next morning 2 hours before my international flight. Very easy... The hotel itself is what you would expect from a new Westin. Rooms are comfortable, clean design and incredibly well sound proofed - I didn't hear a peep or a plane (6th floor, facing terminal). The lobby has a Jetson's like quality. The pool and fitness center are a nice amenity. The only thing I found visually unappealing is the bright white/blue light present in many spaces like the lobby and elevators. There was also a very loud fan running in the room, but resolved it by I switching the fan off and the a/c on.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Almost perfect,A stunning hotel in a perfect location for the airport. It is signposted inside the terminal and easy to find. It is right above the train station that gets you downtown in about 40 minutes with trains leaving regularly. Everything is as a Westin should be but it was let down by a couple of things. First was that the water pressure in the shower was really poor which I didn't expect from a such a new hotel. A couple of colleagues said they thought the same but others didn't feel it was a problem. The lobby bar has a great view but it's a bit bland and too close to the check in desk. Check-in could have been better. There was only one person on the desk at 8pm which I thought wasn't enough. A great airport hotel but given the price it could have been better.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Another Fantastic Experience = Cool rooms!,"This hotel is now officially part of our travel routine, for business and leisure. We used to avoid early morning flights out of DIA. Now we book them whenever we can and stay at the Westin DIA the night before. The restaurant is great. (Sit at the bar and ask for Michelle.) The people at the front desk are incredible (like Gabriela and Margaret). They always note that we’re returning guests and ask if we have a favorite room, or if we’d like to try a different category or view. We just suggest that they pick the one they would like and we always end up with something fantastic. We already have 3 more stays booked before the end of the year!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Started off badly then got much better ,"I booked this hotel as I had travelled 6,000 miles to Denver and did not want a shuttle to a hotel. I wanted to make use of my SPG gold status and check in quick and get to my room.I arrived to find large queues at check in and no-one on the SPG gold/platinum check in. I waited to see if anyone would acknowledge me - they didn't. Staff then opened up extra check in lanes for the large queues but still left me on my own at the SPG check in.I would have been ok with an acknowledgement and apology for no SPG member check in and would have used the other check ins.So I decided to call the hotel to ask if anyone would be making the SPG check in. As I was doing this a member of staff finally arrived.I explained how long I had been waiting and asked why the SPG desk had been left unmanned for so long and why staff would have ignored me.Things got better - a quick apology, a room upgrade, meal credit - a genuine attempt to make things better. From then on it was superb.Stunning hotel, superb food, and tasteful rooms with superb beds, and wonderful staff.I will be back for sure and try the SPG check in again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Overnight stays,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin to break up long flights to and from Peru. Not only is the hotel convenient, it is also extremely nice.  We had excellent service for the staff at the front desk and the grill. Our room was very clean and comfortable, and quiet!  Wouldn't know you were at the airport. We slept very well. The other great thing is the light rail that goes into downtown Denver. It is just downstairs for the hotel and easy to use. About 30 min ride to Union station.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,My new favorite Westin,"I stay in Westin properties frequently for work, and this property is my new favorite (previously held by the westin downtown Phoenix). Front desk said property is about one year old and is adjacent to DIA. I say adjacent as I was not able to find a covered route into the hotel, and had about a 50 yard walk outside the south security entrance. Rooms were very modern and comfortable and on property restaurant was excellent with a lot of activity for a hotel restaurant.  Whole property had a very European feel. On this trip I had flown in early morning and had meetings in town all day with a departing flight the next am.  This worked great and will definitely try to arrange subsequent trips to town in a similar manner.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Pricey, but very nice","Stayed 3 nights for a business meeting with participants flying in from all over the US. The hotel was very convenient. I opted for self park in the West Garage versus hotel parking/valet. The available parking was plentiful and I was able to park in the closest space there is outside of the designated hotel parking. Again, very convenient.On arrival it did take quite some time for check-in. Some other participants arrived at the same time as me and we all had various issues. When the night manager finally came out to the desk things got done, but the four clerks just couldn't seem to make it happen. It took 30 minutes to get checked in - not kidding.Aside from that the stay was very pleasant. The facility just opened earlier this year so it's new - it should be nice and did not disappoint. There was plentiful drawer space and closet space, coffee maker, safe, etc. All the usual features. My room was on the ""flat"" side of the building looking south. The better view rooms are on the ""slanted"" ends of the building (look at a photo on the website and you'll know what I'm referring to). The windows go all the way to the floor. Request the end Windows on the west side if views are desired.The meeting rooms were comfortable with all the necessary technology. The chairs were comfortable, too!! Lunch was served as part of our itinerary and it was very tasty.There is a Starbucks in the hotel, and one restaurant. The lobby bar was small, but there were a number of conversation pits adjacent to the bar. But we had to order and retrieve our drinks at the bar, only a minor inconvenience.If you want more selections for food it is a very short walk into the DIA terminal where there are a number of options (before you go thru security). You can also hop on the train to downtown Denver as well - it's right at the hotel. We did a $9 day pass so we could go round trip without worrying about staying too long. Fair warning, though - it is 37 minutes to get to/from downtown, and coming back the trains leaving Union Station are not continuous. We sat on the train waiting to leave for close to 15 minutes.Other than the room price, and some pretty stiff local charges, which made for a high bill (high to me but not unexpected), this is a very nice property and I had a very nice stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect location for an early morning flight ,We had a 6:30am flight out of DIA and stayed at the Westin for convenience. It saved us a lot of time for our morning flight...super easy. We took the train in from downtown Denver straight to the hotel without a problem.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Rooms and Beds are great, food menu is limited and expensive",This is a great hotel for getting in and out of Denver for a conference or day-long meeting. The hotel is rather new so everything looks fresh. Beds are very comfortable and I never heard the planes in my room. The conference center is located on the bottom floors and very spacious. The staff is terrific and accommodating. There is a train depot straight from the hotel that will take you downtown round trip -- very convenient (about 30 minutes one way). The only negative is the food in the hotel is expensive and the menu -- both in the restaurant and room service is limited.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Upgraded Room,"We didn't expect a room upgrade, nobody seems to do that anymore.  We were presently surprised to find ourselves in an upgraded room on our second visit.  I'm sure it wasn't points or loyalty rewards.  It was just the staff making an extra effort to be hospitable.  The views were dramatic.  THANKS.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Stayed two times this month,"We stayed here coming to Denver, and again on last night leaving.  This is a great addition to airport hotel options in Denver, with all other nearby options being more budget conscious.  While the cost difference is significant, the convenience and quality of the hotel is worth it, especially if you want to have business meetings at the hotel, which we did.The restaurant in the hotel is also worth dining at...even if you're not staying in the hotel.  The only drawback is complicated access, which is accessed via the parking garage area of the airport.  Even our Uber driver took a couple of loops before finding the entrance to the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,One of the nicest hotels I have stayed,"We had an excellent stay at the Westin at DIA. We had a west facing room (12th floor) and has floor to ceiling windows in the bedroom and bath. Christian checked us in, he was very helpful.The pool was nice and the hot tub was super hot. We ate at the restaurant and it was quite good. Beds were comfortable but you do hear the planes take off!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Second time around...,"Second time around (1st last February) for us Starwood members... local residents overnighting to avoid that last minute rush to the aerodrome for an early morning flight. A bit pricey but perfect! With bathing suits at the ready we, once again, enjoyed the hot tub and pool in a near private country club setting (don't tell anyone!). Will definitely do this again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great hotel for night before departure,"Love this hotel! We travel to denver often and  like to stay here the night before we leave.Hotel is new with a nice decor. Built very well, you cannot hear any planes take off or land.  We return the car and check in late afternoon or early evening. Makes leaving the next day very easy.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient for traveling!,"The big advantage to this hotel is the convenience.  No mad rush to make an early flight.  The decor is very modern and clean.  Friendly staff.   My complaint is that it is very expensive, and I didn't feel the room lived up to the price.  Just your basic hotel room.  I expected more for my money.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Fab New Hotel, Steps from Airport Security","The Westin Denver International Airport is less than a year old and really nice.  The rooms are comfortable and modern.  The hotel is literally attached to the hotel, right by the end with security lines!  I stayed here for one night before a morning flight, and there's no better way to do it (especially since DEN is so far from the city).  There was a coffee maker in the room with Starbucks coffee and actual 1/2 and 1/2 (not that cruddy powdered stuff), which made my pre-flight morning that much easier.The main level is very futuristic, I think it's supposed to look like your in a space dome.  The bar is small, but open.  Had dinner at the restaurant which is hotel priced, but with fresh local ingredients, so a delicious dinner.  The hotel has nice minimalistic decor throughout.Shower was nice and bed comfy.  They seem to charge for internet unless you're a high-level member of Hilton Honors.I'll be staying here every time I fly out of DEN - it was great!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great hotel right next to the airport,"This hotel is very new (less than 1 year old at the time of the review), and is located literally steps away from the terminal. It's much easier to walk to this hotel from the terminal however, than to try to drop people off at the hotel since you have to enter the parking garage gates and potentially get charged parking fees just to enter the property if you take too long to exit (15 min max). Not optimal for dropping people off, checking in, and then returning a rental car.The hotel looks amazing (lobby is a little small, but decent). Front desk staff is friendly and helpful, was able to upgrade me to a junior suite. The room itself was amazing, about 600 sq ft of usable space, with automatic window blinds and a very nice bathroom (although the bathtub could be deeper). We also used a rollaway bed, and it was one of the most comfortable rollaway beds I've ever slept on (a real mattress, not a folding one). The only issue I had with the property was housekeeping continually assuming I left the hotel and kept trying to enter the room I was in. This happened 3 times in the morning, so there is a communication problem between either the front desk, the head housekeeper, and the housekeeping staff. Only reason they're not at a 5 star rating.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Weekend getaway,We were booked at this airport hotel for work meeting and decided to stay for weekend.  Had little expectations for airport hotel but that changed when we arrived.  Beautiful newish hotel located above commuter rail line into city.  Don't hesitate to stay here if you visit Denver.  Staff were very accommodating and we greatly enjoyed our stay.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Overnight stay to catch an early flight,"Hotel & staff fine. Hotel clean & quiet!!. Had supper in the Grill & Vine restaurant in the hotel & had meal tab charged to my room. Was up at 4:40 & out to American Airlines by 5:30. Got my bag checked and in line at TSA NLT 600:am. Was billed $100.72 for charges that day by Grill & Vine who didn't open till 6:00AM. Tried to take care of the prob via phone.per instructions per email to no avail. Tried to again directly with staff at the hotel when I got back to Denver & that failed. Finally talked to Kristi at the hotel and she took care of everything. Now, she is the kind of employee I would want working for me!!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient,"I enjoyed my stay at the Westin.  It was extremely convenient to walk from the airport to the hotel.  Rex at the front desk was extremely kind and helpful.  The coffee shop could have used more employees, but the 2 that were working did a good job.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Modern and Convenient,"I recently stayed at the Westin, and was extremely pleased with my experience.  The hotel was new, clean, modern, and so comfortable.  The bed was the best! My friend and I had gracious staff welcome us at valet parking, checkin and checkout.  As we were flying out of Denver in the late afternoon, we arranged for late checkout, and had time to enjoy a delicious breakfast at Grape and Vine, and enjoyed the beautiful day on very comfortable furniture on the outdoor deck.  Unfortunately, we weren't aware that the hotel offered airline bag check and boarding passes up to 90 minutes prior to the flight--next time I'll take advantage of this perk.  A wonderful hotel'",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,What a nice treat after a layover!,"I'm actually glad I had a layover in Denver. This hotel is so nice, clean and serine. Indoor pool is just beautiful! Nice rooms and located just out of baggage claim! Pure and Vine restaurant was nice and had great food! So many healthy options.All around I give this hotel the highest rating.Front desk was really nice and helpful and classy. Servers were professional and just nice people.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Surprisingly nice for the snowed-in traveler,"I broke my leg skiing, and after ten days in the hospital and two operations, we headed for the airport, where we were snowed in by a spring blizzard. Airport operations were cancelled for a day and a half, with flight delays for another day and a half.  What a disaster!  But, under the circumstances, we had a very nice stay at the new Westin, which had just opened.  We were in a lovely penthouse handicapped suite, with a large roll-in shower, an accommodating staff who helped rearrange the furniture to suit my condition and regularly brought ice for my cooling machine, and excellent room service dining.  We had sweeping views of the white out, and, after the storm cleared, of the airport operations with Denver in the distance.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great place,"Can't say enough good about this hotel.  Great for short or longer layover.  Nice rooms, heated pool, good restaurant and very convenient to airport and rail to town. Executive suites great for a few days.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Early morning flight? Treat yourself to a night at the Westin!,"Excellent design, comfortable rooms, crisp and clean vibe, and super-convenient as you walk from Hotel Checkout directly to TSA at the airport.  If you've got an early morning flight out, avoid the hassle of getting to the airport at zero-dark-thirty, and grab some z's at the Westin DIA.  My rating would be even higher, but the front desk staff seemed a bit cranky during my visit. May have just been some circumstance related to my timing, but honestly, there is no reason people working here shouldn't be extra friendly, given their surroundings!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Worth the convenience,"If it was in downtown Denver, it would be overpriced.  However, you are paying for the location. The very short walk into the airport is no big deal. I can not believe the people complaining about being outside for the short walk into the terminal.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Modern and convenient,"It was a great shame that my stay at the Westin Denver International Airport started with one of the worst check-in experiences I've ever had. The guy at the front desk couldn't have been less welcoming even if he tried and looked visibly irritated when I asked for directions to my room. He utterly destroyed the 'wow' effect that this great property had on me when I first entered its main hall. I cannot imagine why this person works in a customer-facing role.Apart from this miserable first impression, my stay was actually very pleasant. The (standard) room was of a good size and the bed very comfortable. The whirlpool was great to relax after a long road trip. WiFi is very expensive - they promise that they will waive the fee for SPG members but following my experience with the front desk, I didn't feel like trying. Come on Westin, get real - no-one charges for internet these days, this is just ridiculous. The bathroom was nice and clean but the amenity kit was lacking shower gel - who uses a soap bar these days?! The hotel is super convenient for early morning flights, although that convenience is very expensive. Overall, I got a good night's sleep and that is ultimately what I needed so I will still give the Westin a 'very good' rating - just.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Chic , Urban vibe","Luxury is not the first impression although price indicates. The vibe is crisp , clean and modern. Staff were very nice at check in but not enough to accommodate large crowds checking in at same time.the view is lovely and so convenient since it's right in the hotel. Hotel is new so everything is clean and comfortable . Loved the really large flat screen in hotel room . Bathrooms are splendid. Separate shower and tub. Room service quick and efficient .Only one restaurant in hotel and after a while that is boring . You can eat in airport but only for the desperate. You can take the train right at hotel and in about 30 minutes or so be downtown Denver. It's makes for a long evening but depending on ones schedule can provide entertainment. My room never really cooled down. They sent maintenance and response was quick. But for some reason it never cooles to set temp .If you can afford it this is a fine opttion for those needing accommodation convenience right in the airport. Not a place to stay for long vacation due to airport distance from any place . The airport itself is in the middle of nowhere a great distance . Terribly inconvenient.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient and very comfortable,We stayed at the Westin Denver for two nights and found everything to be great.  The hotel is right at the airport.  There is a train that takes you to downtown Denver quickly and conveniently.  My husband used the pool and was impressed.  We also liked that the restaurant will do take out so we didn't have to order from room service.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Absolutely gorgeous property with a healthy splash of convenience,"I travel to Denver quite often and have been waiting to book myself at the new Westin.  I finally did so over the course of a trip out west with two overnight layovers in Denver.  Chelsea at the front desk was very helpful when reserving just the right room, it was pricey but beautiful.  The first layover I stayed in the Renewal Suite which might I add is in the top five of hotel rooms that I've ever stayed in!  The property is quite simply a work of art and immaculate at every corner.  During my second layover, I picked an Executive Suite with mountain views which was equally beautiful, just not on the grand level and size as the Renewal.  During both layovers, we utilized the restaurant, bar, lounge and room service.  I can honestly say the food was very good, but the service even better, Samantha and Derrick made our evening quite enjoyable.  Justin was quick and efficient serving breakfast.  I will say one slightly negative thing regarding F&B, I imagined the menus to be much more expansive and had hoped it included more higher end selections.  The menu just doesn't match the hotel your staying in.  Only other negative I can add is that the business center is located on a desk space behind the front desk within a rather noisy lobby which is also inclusive of the bar/lounge.  It only had two workstations and two chairs (both of which were taken by an individual training another, possibly a hotel employee as I heard them talking about being on registers/terminals and helping guests).  So I stood up for close to 30 minutes while trying to work in a noisy lobby AND got charged for it.  My advice:  move your business center to a closed work conducive area and make sure you have enough terminals and furnishings before you start charging guests.  The hotel is extremely convenient when flying out the next morning, you literally walk out the door, across a courtyard and right in to the security checkpoint.Before I book again though, I might have to re-evaluate the F&B, convenience and price.  No matter how much I love this hotel, I could've easily stayed downtown at the Four Seasons and possibly even saved a few bucks.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Clean, convenient and modern...","Was here for three nights for a conference. Modern, clean, nice decore and about as convenient as you can get to and from Denver International Airport. The one not insignificant disappointment is the bed and bedding. The bed itself was hard and not all that comfortable. The bedding was ridiculously uncomfortable. Given this is an upscale hotel, the bed and bedding at a mid-level Marriott Courtyard has this Westin beat hands down regarding sleep comfort.  It's difficult for me to rate a hotel as Excellent if it's not all that comfortable sleeping there.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A welcome after a long flight,"Had a te hour flight from London, arrived evening, so nice to be able to stroll across to the hotel, no waiting for shuttle bus or taxi.  Very pristine building, friendly and helpful staff.  Beautiful architecture and pleasing sculptures in the court.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent services,"The Westin Denver international hotel it's beautiful, very modern and services it's excellent. Natasha MCCoy help me in the front desk and she was very helpful. Excellent service that make may stay amazing",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Quite Huge,The rooms are quite large and is obviously very convenient for people traveling out of airport early in the morning.  One thing I didn't like is that there is no underground connecting the airport to the hotel.  On a very windy day as we experienced you have to lug suitcases across open area though relatively short it might be.  Was wondering what happens if it is raining or snow.  Have asked several people but they didn't know about underground.  Perhaps there is.  I don't know.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Exactly what DIA needed! A Beautiful, Sparkling Westin","STARWOOD: GOLDMARRIOTT: GOLDHILTON: SILVERMELIA: SILVERAfter enjoying one fun night, and an amazing day in Downtown Denver, it was time to take the light rail from Central Station back to DIA and review the Brand New WESTIN. This property had just opened and once I navigated the insane heights on the escalators which seem to never end, I found myself in perhaps the newest Property I've ever been in. It felt like the wrapping was just removed, and it is simply gorgeous.HOTEL: Very large Hotel with direct access to all Terminals and to the light rail below, so its the perfect go between. Not sure how many floors but I would guess this is about a 300+ room property. Check-in was incredibly fast and friendly. I immediately ordered room service. Westin serves delicious and health conscious foods, you just feel ""refreshed"" with every stay, this was no different. The food arrived promptly, was a bit small for my tastes but it did the trick. I melted into my Heavenly bed, only awoken once by a Thunderstorm which was fascinating to watch as it came down from the Mountains over the city and blasted the airport.THE LOCATION: This IS the only in Terminal Hotel at DIA. You can transit in and out of the airport for all terminals to and from this Hotel. My flight was at 545am, I entered security at 430 and made it no problem. Be sure your checked in with no bags if you try that though.THE ROOM(S): It was your typical Westin room, just make everything brand new!!THE STAFF: Limited interaction with staff, but everyone I encountered was more than friendly, thank you to each of you for the splendid stay.Was my Elite recognized? Yes, I was thanked for my loyalty and assured I had the best room. While I am not so sure this was the case, it certainly wasn't a bad room.I would recommend this property without a doubt. Traveling can be tiring, and if your not up for the 30 minute rail or worse car ride to Downtown, just grab a room here. Its so easy and the rest you'll get is worth the stopover. Also if your thinking about staying 'near"" the airport, just imagine how much easier it is to return your car, and have yourself already at the airport. This IS the spot now...",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing stay at the airport in the new Westin Hotel!,"I was traveling on business to Denver as an overnight with an early flight out in the morning and wanted to try the new Westin at the airport.  Anyone who knows the Denver airport knows that there are no hotels anywhere near the actual airport, the closest ones are about six miles away, which means early shuttle bus or rental car return, etc. and a lot of extra time to your morning.  Being able to wake up and walk to the plane is amazing!  The hotel is new and very chic - clean lines and staff who are very happy to help at every moment of your stay.  The room was clean, well appointed and comfortable!  Spa-like bathroom, comfortable bed and a great view made for an amazing stay--almost wish I could have stayed longer!  The only down side is the price--it was twice the cost of the off-airport hotels, I feel like I was overcharged because I am a business traveler and my company is paying.  Hopefully the rates will come down over time to be more realistic otherwise I know I'll not be able to stay here again in the future, which is too bad because I loved my stay here!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Nice, but...","Stayed here for an unnecessary extravagance, just to see what the new DIA hotel was like. Striking architecture outside with cold, modern features inside. Beautiful views abound. Service was friendly. Check in/out was quick. Location is great given proximity to terminal. Standard room is typical cookie cutter. Not too fancy. No free wifi. That is really old school in this day. Why not charge for flushing the toilet? The price for what you get is not worth it. This property is for the business traveler with a generous expense account.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice location next to airport,"Great location for a very early morning flight of out of Denver.  Rooms are nicely furnished and clean.  Ate in the restaurant/bar and was good, good selection of draft beers, and had very good service.  Check-in was very quick and friendly.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Splendid,"We are from Denver and stayed the night at the hotel just to experience it since we have been watching it get built for years. Every part of out stay here was perfect. One of the ladies at the front desk made us laugh as we checked in. Heroot in the coffee shop made us a great latte and showed us the local products. The best experience however was breakfast in the restaurant. The servers were kind of busy so the manager came over and took care of us, She bought us an order of the fresh baked pastries because we had to ""wait"" (we were in no hurry). she talked to us about the art right outside the window. She even gave us her card which I unfortunately lost. Great service all around, we will be coming back.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great place for before an early flight or after a long flight,"It is a great hotel for when you have a very early flight or arrive late in Denver before heading into the mountains. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The restaurant is very good with a very decent wine and beer selection and great food with something for everyone. The only drawback is the walk from the hotel ""entrance"" (which actually looks like a service entrance) to the airport or the other way. You have to walk through what seems a wind tunnel in sometimes inclement cold weather between hotel an terminal. Why is it not a covered walkway?",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Westin Denver International Hotel,Hotel is directly adjacent to Denver International Airport - walking distance across a courtyard to access checkin and security.  The absolutely nicest airport hotel i have ever stayed.  Brand new and impressive. Would be a 5 star hotel at any other location.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Everything Grest except the croissants,"I took my family out for a quick end-of-summer trip to the Denver area.  Wewere arriving late and didn’t want to add a drive in our rental car to thenight’s long air flight, so we booked our first night at the Westin. I gota deal on the room and it was well worth it.The hotel was very convenient, being only a stone’s throw from the actualairport.  I saw that someone complained about walking the 50 yards underthe covered path from the airport to the hotel entrance. Well, that personmust have done it in sub-zero weather, or must have forgotten their rollerluggage, because this was no problem at all. Also, this same path takes youto the ultra-convenient train to downtown Denver. The station is locatedjust below the hotel.The Hotel was modern, tidy and appears secure as guests can only accessupper floors with a key. The front desk staff was pleasant. Even though itwas busy, the lines flowed.Our room was standard, but the mattresses and pillows were verycomfortable. We had a nice view of the terminal.  There was a desk to workon, a safe and everything was compartmentalized in sliding cabinets.The free wireless connectivity was kind of confusing; the web page asks youaccept a charge for access. The Desk staff instructed us to accept thecharge and it will be removed later.  I didn’t have the will to accept thisarrangement, and my (heavily secure) phone kept telling me the wirelessnetwork was spoofed, and therefore unsafe. I decided to just use my ownwireless hotspot on my phone.The lobby bar is pretty cool to sit in, you get this modern feeling withall the curved glass and steel around you. It was too late to have dinner,but the drinks were serviceable. You could also order bar food, but weweren’t too keen on the offerings. Food & drinks were your typical Westinprices.The 11th floor athletic area & pool was very nice.  All the equipment wasin working order.  People were in the workout room all the time it wasopen. I took a morning swim in the pool, which has a scenic view of theEastern plains and (if you look way right) of Denver. The pool is not largeenough for laps. The whirlpool tub used a very slippery tile on the seatsand the jets are so powerful you need to grip the edge of the whirlpool, oryou will be pushed right off the seat!. It’s kind of awkward.Overall, the hotel is very nice with no real complaints, except one; food.Yes there is a sit down restaurant downstairs, but the only option for aquick coffee and croissant is a small place called “Ingredients” which has,by far the stalest baked goods I’ve ever sunk my teeth into. I have neverfelt so ripped off. I mean, it is the Westin, so I thought stale croissantwas off the menu…not so.Now I could have gotten up and walked to the food court at the airportacross the way, but frankly, I was too lazy for that. I guess I reallyexpected the convenience food to be on par with the rest of the Starwoodchain and not some institutionalized bread from a Smart & Final.So, would I stay here again?  Absolutely. It was relaxing to walk off the plane and right to your hotel.  The convenience is hard to beatfor the weary traveler. Will I grab a coffee and croissant from“Ingredients?” No thanks…",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Quick rest before flight ,"We stayed here for a few (4 to be exact) hours rest before our 6am flight. Why more airports don't do this is beyond me. Bed was comfortable, pillows were soft and room was cool like I like it.  The only complaint would be cost, $250 with a discount. But you are truly paying for convenience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Met my needs perfectly!,"I stayed here for two nights during a quick trip back to Colorado. The location is really the best part. Just cross a courtyard and you are at the airport. The hotel is just pretty amazing in itself aesthetically. Beautiful art and interesting structure. The lobby was bright, clean and upbeat and the lounge must be doing something right because it was continually busy. The rooms are clean, well decorated and there is plenty of closet space. My bed was amazing and I had a great sleep not to mention a great view. The only reason I didn't do five stars is because there are only two parking options. You have to park at the airport garage for $26 a day or use valet, which I did for $33. I absolutely enjoyed my stay and will return here whenever I come back.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Last minute visit,We had an early flight out due to change in flights so decided to stay at the airport. This is a perfect location a few short minutes and you are at your gate. It was perfect no rushing. Check in was easy. The rooms themselves were very nice and modern. Puzzled why there was a tub shower instead of just a shower. Elevators slightly strange have to take multiple ones to get to check in and rooms. Convenience factor is amazing.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,I Needed That...,"Flight delay out of LGA, missed my connection out of DEN, but the Westin DIA made me quickly forget. Margaret at check-in empathized, upgraded, and free-drink couponed.  And it was one of the best sleeps of my life....#westinwellbeing",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Not downtown but a nice property.,"I decided to go cheap and bid on a downtown hotel through Priceline. BIG mistake. I got this hotel instead. It is a 40-minute train ride into Denver. The only thing close to the hotel is the airport. So bottle of water? A soda? You are paying airport prices. Food? They have a place to eat in the hotel. It's not great. However, the redheaded bartender who sings is simply amazing in every way. Go, have a drink in the hotel bar and meet her. Truly, she is breath-takingly beautiful.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Sectional staff and a surprisingly terrific Hotel,"I stayed at the Denver Airport one night for convenience. I truly did not expect to have a great experience and was pleasantly surprised. The Westin is great. The rooms are typical Weston - very high quality and well done. The lounge area is unusual and cool, and the open bar and lounge adjacent to check in is very nice place to hang out. This staff was outstanding. Even the bellmen who checked me in off the chart professional and nice. The restaurant was perfect place for business meetings and the service was terrific. This is not your typical airport hotel. It's great. I highly recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Stay,"My stay was excellent from beginning to end.  Check in was pleasant and staff was attentive.  I had drinks at the bar, great staff there also.  My room had a great view, plenty of space between the king bed and the lounge chair.   The bed was comfortable and the bathroom very nice with a large walk in shower.  The workout room had plenty of machines and free weights.  They left enough room between machines so you didn't feel too close to the next guy.  Breakfast in the restaurant was good also.  Overall it was a great stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Excellent airport access, modern, a different experience","We checked in at night and found the lobby loud due to the shared space with the open area bar in the middle. Checkout in the morning was a whole different scene, quiet, and with sunlight streaming in from all the glass ceiling and wall areas.The room was clean, modern and with terrific views of the airport area.It's hard to beat the convenient airport location. Wish the pricing was better, but it's the only hotel attached to DIA.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing Experience,"This is a great property with very cool architecture, super nice rooms and great people. We were treated like we were special. Food in the restaurant was simple but very tasty. Super convenient to the Denver Airport. Highly recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Shaped like Wings, Mustache, or Cat Eye Glasses","Please remember you are paying for the convenience of this hotel.The Westin Denver International Hotel is located at the Denver International Airport.8300 Pena Blvd., Denver, Colorado 80249.Phone: (303) 317-1800.  Reservations: (866) 716-8108There is Self Parking at $24.00 a day & Valet Parking for $33.00 a day.Other options are area Park & Rides.  Pikes Peak & Mount Elbert are on the Airport Property for $8.00 a day.  Commute to the airport from the Downtown Union Station via the A-Line Commuter Train/Light Rail is about 35 Minutes.  When you arrive at the airport terminal.  Go to Level 5 on the South side of the Terminal.  Walk across an outdoor plaza.  Enter building & take the escalator to the 6th Floor.  You will see the reception desk.This hotel is very contemporary with sleek lines. There is a restaurant, which I found a bit expensive, noisy & could use more space around the tables.  If on a budget, go into the airport & find some options in your price range.  The rooms were quiet, sleek & basic.  Because I booked early via the Westin website, the room cost was $310.00.  At the moment they are asking $400.00 +. Don't forget about the tax.  The waiting area gives you a view of the airport property.  The furniture is designed low to the ground.  If you have knee problems, it is difficult to get up from the short legged furniture.  It was a pleasant stay & convenient if you have a early morning flight.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very vanilla,"I have to remember this is a one night stay for most people. First I will give the positives. It's new , clean and convinient. We had a corner suite room 1401. The living, dining room is adequit. The bedroom is a nice size with a bench under tv. We had one full bath and one half bath. The main bath has a separate shower. The views were great from all rooms. Now for the negatives. The sofa is the hardest sofa, I ever tried to sit on. both the back and sides are high, so you have no arm rest. The half bath doesn't have room to sit anything down and there's only one sink in main bathroom. My husband and I had to share the one bathroom to get ready because that was the only counter. Just a sink and toilet in half bath.The closet is the smallest closet I've ever seen. There's no club lounge which is a huge negative for my husband. This hotel is a little too  cold in style for me, but, they missed it by not having larger closets and double sinks or a counter in the half bath.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Business trip,"The Westin at the Denver International Airport was absolutely fantastic.  Hotel staff were very nice and helpful; place was super clean, bright, cheerful and easy to navigate.I had a business meeting there at the restaurant, The Grill & Vine and the food was great; service was very appropriate and a great location for a private business discussion.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect for Early Flight,"We had an early flight booked so we decided to stay at the Westin based on so many other great reviews. This hotel is amazing! The room was spacious and mondern. The bed was unbelievably comfortable with 2 down comforters. We really enjoyed the waterfall shower in our room. The room service was a bit pricey but we spoiled ourselves and don't regret it. If you have an early flight, you need to stay here. Quick access from the airport too! We will stay again. The high prices are worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice hotel and quiet,We stayed in a junior suite before flying out. We were surprised on how quiet the room was with jets flying over. We didn't even hear the hallway traffic. The hotel and the rooms were very clean.  The bed was comfy. We ordered room service which was ok and luke warm. I would definitely stay here again but not get room service.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,So Happy with This Hotel!,"When you're traveling, tired and a bit stressed about a cancelled flight, you couldn't ask for a better sanctuary than the Westin at the Denver airport.  Sparkling new, well appointed rooms, and a top notch staff, you couldn't ask for nicer or more convenient when stuck in the middle of your transit plans.  Loved it and would happily stay there again and again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Day rate stay,"Was stuck in Denver for 10 hours after a hunting trip in Crawford.Decided to head to the Westin to get some rest and relax before my flight.Rooms were modern and clean, service was very good, although  Room service call me an hour after I had my sandwich to ask if was ok to retrieve the tray.They never came and woke me up for nothing.Next time leave the guest in peace, if there was a problem with the sandwich I would have called you.Also on that day there was some music plays down below in the court yard.Was very loud and annoying.I still think this as a constructive criticism and don't like to give bad reviews if not needed.A nice Nespresso machine in the room would have been a plus.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Unexpected diversion,"We had the misfortune of being diverted from Dallas to Denver (we were enroute to Anchorage) due to a fuel leak on our aircraft. We immediately called The Westin and they were able to accommodate us with lovely rooms and very friendly service.  It is conveniently located right out the door of the airport. The layout of the hotel is comfortable, and modern. Given the day we had their personal attention to our comfort was very much appreciated.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A little out of this world,WE always stay here for the convenience of our flights.   New clean and simple decor.  It is almost too stark and alien in the lobby.  Not cheap mind you.   Best part of this stay was the fabric closet doors,3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"""Airport hotel"" does this property a disservice!","Great service and a wonderfully appointed hotel...and it's at the Denver Airport!From check in to stay...nothing about this hotel is a step away from exceptional!Everything, from rooms to restaurants...and especially service is par excellence!Well done General Manager, Tom Curley, and team!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A Quiet Room Beside The Runway,"After a week in the mountains, our family spent the final night at this airport hotel.  The exterior of this place is beautiful.  A flowing architectural complement to visually fascinating airport. I dropped by family off and then went to return the rental car, which was the only bump in the process.  You get to hotel reception through the parking area and only have 15 minutes to unload before you are charged for parking.  Not a big deal, but wished we had been warned.   The hotel interior presents a modern design that is bright and refreshing.  The room are very nicely appointed (as expected of a Westin property) with the bathroom being spacious and appealing.  The room was very clean.  The bed comfortable.  The most amazing aspect to me was how quiet the rooms were.  Our view looked out over the airport terminal and we could see planes take off and land, but heard nothing.   Great sleep.  Wonderful to simply walk to check-in the the flight.  Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Too noisy,"Stayed here for one night in a fantastic suite overlooking the runway. One of the best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in,although I consider the wifi charge 0f $14.95 per night to be outrageous in a hotel of this standard. Major problem with this hotel is the public areas are SO noisy. Checkin desks are situated in a large open area ,near a bar, with every surface hard so that the sound bounces off. Almost impossible to hear the receptionist, who agreed it was a problem. The restaurant, outrageously expensive for the average to poor food they serve, suffers from a similar problem. I could hardly hear my husband ,at a small table for 2, never mind the waiter. Bread was delivered to the table prior to the meal, with mine arriving ten minutes after my husband's because I am a coeliac and require GF. I don't mind waiting 10 minutes for them to defrost it, but the normal bread should have been served at the same time as we were supposedly eating together in a fine dining reataurant! GF items are marked on the menu, that is the only positive thing I can find to say about it. Two glasses of wine with 2 entrees only(+ aforementioned bread) cost $140.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Modern airport hotel - so convenient for the airport,"The hotel is literally a short stroll from the airport terminal so ideal for the night before an early morning flight, which is why we were staying. The hotel is modern, light and very nicely appointed and It also has a good gym and an indoor pool.  We had a really comfortable stay and would definitely stay there again if needed.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,So comfortable,"Margaret met me at reception, checked me in and made me so comfortable. I travel every week and this is one of the best experiences I have had. Rooms are beautiful, service wonderful, and it's so nice to just walk to the terminal in the early morning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nicest Airport Hotel I've Been In,"Lovely hotel with great location to the airport, literally connected. Very stylish and new, food was pretty good and very nicely labeled with gluten free options for room service, which I really appreciated. It's definitely a pricey place and they have an annoying internet fee. But if I was going to Denver, I'd be happy to stay here again, especially if work was paying.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Spendy and i can see why as they won't give us our money back!,"We stayed at the Westin Denver International July 31-Aug 4th.  My husband was there on business, the rest of our family for pleasure.  He gave the front desk our personal credit card when we checked in even though the room was paid for with the company card.  The hotel charged our personal card over $350.00 for 1 night PLUS the company card for the 3 nights we were there.  We called the hotel and were told there would be a credit back to our personal card of which we still haven't seen over 24 days later.  The concierge also said we should contact Discover to let them know as ""they are slow with the credits.""  We contacted Discover only to discover nothing had been done.   Now we have to go through the whole process again.  The sad thing is this is a very nice hotel and all the folks there were very accommodating and went out of their way for us and our kids.  We had a great stay and this has really cast a bad light over it for us.",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Impressive welcome and lovely room,"I booked our stay for a relaxing night before an early flight. We had a surprisingly warm welcome from Margaret at the front desk. We were road-weary and she greeted us with such a professional and enthusiastic  welcome. Margaret checked us in and made sure we were ready to relax. She thought of everything...including sending sending milk and cookies to our room for the kids. Every trip out of Denver for us will now include a stay here the night before. The Westin is a perfect way to start a trip and Margaret will be our go-to rep for a smooth, stress free experience!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Upscale and convenient for early travel!,We enjoyed a spacious suite with trips to the restaurant and pool before an early flight on our honeymoon! We were greeted by friendly staff and service at dinner was relaxed but attentive! A great option that we will take advantage of again with early travel plans!,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Service!!,"We recently stayed at the Westin Denver International Airport. We arrived after midnight and had a great reception. The security team searched for over an hour to find my young daughters missing stuffed animal, jacket and shirt after exploring the hotel. This meant the world to us, especially since we were just beginning our trip. If you are passing through Denver, you won't be disappointed staying at the Westin.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Helped a Husband,"Wife loves the ""Westin smell"".  Husband staying at Westin Denver asks associate Angela if there is such a thing and how he can get a bottle of it to take home.  Angela tells husband .. got you covered.  Later in day, husband goes to pick up his checked luggage and finds a care package with note from Angela, some soaps and lotions and instructions on where on line he can find ""Westin scent"" candles, oils and more lotions (and a 15% discount) ... Nice!   Husband looks like a champ ... fist bump Angela !!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Make sure you receive and check your bill after stay,"Our stay was fine.  We arrived at 7pm, check-in took a bit long, maybe 20-minutes.  The kid who checked us in couldn't figure out how to run my credit card as a ""credit card"" instead of a debit card, so he forced me to use another card, but no big whoop.  We took our stuff up to the room and went back downstairs to have a couple of drinks.  We ordered the first at the bar and the bartender asked if we wanted to keep a tab open, and we did.  We had two-drinks each, and settled our charges plus tip, and went along our merry little way so we could get some sleep before our very early flight.Next morning we go to check out at 4am, but the girl working the check in desk said she could not provide us with our bill because her system was not up yet.  That's kind of weird for an airport hotel since I would think you would have folks checking out at all hours.  Whatever.  She asked for my e-mail address and assured me she would e-mail my bill once her system was up.  Six-days later I realized I had never received my bill, so I called to have a copy sent to me and wasn't pleased.  Again, here are the details of my stay:1.  Arrive Friday night.2.  Spend an hour in downstairs bar (one-charge for drinks, one for tip).3.  Go up to bed.4.  Check out Saturday morning.The bill I received showed two additional completely random charges on it, one for $18, and another for $5.36 for food and beverage.  We had no food.  Our correct charges were on the bill for the drinks, but these two were absolutely not ours.  Our visit was short enough that it was pretty easy to keep track!  $18 and $5.36 don't exactly go together as a purchase and associated tip.  More likely somebody walked out on their bill and the Westin just decided to put the charges on ""a room"".  I could honestly care less about $23, but this is akin to theft.  Not cool.I called to protest the charges, but they only allow you to leave a voicemail, saying they will get back to you within 48-hours.  72-hours later and no response.  Gross...",1
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Staff!,"On Friday, August 26th I dropped of my boyfriend to the airport and decided to visit The Westin and see for myself all the great reviews I see on trip advisor. For not being a hotel guest I received a warm welcome by one of your Front Office team members Kristi Garcia, she took time away from her duties to give me a tour of the hotel and told me how she's been there from day one that the hotel opened and takes pride on what she does (that's impressive given the size of the hotel and everything that goes on during opening a new hotel).I was in the hotel industry for 12years in operations, sales & revenue management, and can recognize genuine customer service from staff. You got a loyal team member that delivers excellent customer service! After the tour, Kristi concluded by providing me with  a complimentary house drink card of which I redeemed and the bartender Samantha was just as great as Kristi, not only she meet all standards (brought water, greeted me, kept checking on me to see if I needed anything in between serving drinks to guests) but she was great at multitasking all on her own. Samantha was making drinks at the bar for a handful of guest and I didn't see her loose a beat on checking back with each guest to see if they needed anything.You have two team members that are rock stars!! Thank you Kristi and Samantha for such an excellent customer service you both delivered to me.Cheers!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very sleek,Best location for travelers. The look and feel is very 21 century. Well appointed rooms and excellent A/C. Front desk staff looked under trained and our clerk was even yawning while working with us. The reception check in area looked very disorganized,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazingly Nice,"It's clear that a lot of thought went into the décor and design of this hotel. Aside from a slight hiccup at check in (7 flight crew and 3 couples checking in at midnight tends to overwhelm night staff wherever you go) everything was fantastic.  Our room was at the end of the east tower so we had amazing picture windows with a very broad view. Appointments were lovely, and everything was well maintained.Of special note is that they seem to have taken particular care to reduce energy usage here. Light fixtures are primarily LED, but of a nice warm color. Blackout shades work very well. The thermostat is equipped with a motion sensor to reduce unneeded cooling and the glass seems to be a very nice low-e variety.Fitness center is brand new and well equipped and I look forward to trying the pool at my next visit.  My one gripe - if this is the new Westin bed it is way too hard. I miss the old one already.  Still slept well so not worth knocking a star off, but worth mentioning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Friendly staff,Kevin was amazing and very helpful. Our room was amazing. The rooms are better and more modern than the one in Downtown.  The room service was busy and it took almost 2 hours. I was starving. great option if you have early morning flight.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great facility, service and location","We stayed here for a convention - great place. The facility is new and very nice. Rooms are spacious, clean, quiet and well-appointed. The suites are HUGE! Service was outstanding throughout. The convention space is very nice - new, modern rooms with AV equipment and great catering.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Friendly and Kind,"I ended up stuck in Denver when my flight -- the last flight of the night to Helena, Montana -- was canceled. I dragged myself into the Westin in quite a foul mood, but I soon felt a whole lot better. The staff member working the desk, Margaret, sympathized with me, made me feel welcome, knocked a bit off the room price, and gave me a coupon for a free drink, which I badly needed. I can't recommend the circumstances that led me to stay here, but I can definitely recommend the hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fabulous customer service and comfort after miserable United experience.,"We were emotionally and physically exhausted.  While waiting for our voucher hotel shuttle we could not help but notice the signs for the Westin and called for a room.  As soon as we walked in a weight was lifted. The hotel is stylish, clean and light even at night.  The Westin knows customer service and could tell we were frustrated and exhausted.  Christian was so friendly at check in and gave us a late check out (if we could not get on our early morning stand by flight) and a complimentary drink.  We were famished, as the airport dining places had closed in the concourse (except for Mcdonalds) so we were thrilled that the Grill & Vine restaurant was still open.  The restaurant has big windows overlooking the large wind sculpture between the hotel and airport my daughters enjoyed the view even though it was dark.  Our room was clean and the robes came in handy since we had no pjs or clean clothing.  The hotel was perfectly located for our early morning stand by flight.  When we found out we were not on the stand by list and were stuck in Denver until that evening we bought bathing suits and the Westin extended our check out again so we had a thoroughly relaxing time in their spa.My daughters decided ditching our United voucher and spending money for our hotel was the best decision we could have made and I whole heartedly agree. It turned a miserable end to our vacation to a pleasant experience of its own.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Beautiful hotel, just unlucky...","I've stayed at this hotel several times, never had any issues. Rooms are quiet and clean, and location is perfect if you have an early morning flight out. This time it seems my room wasn't double checked. I did not have a bottle of water (always complimentary) in the room. Also, the desk must have not gotten cleaned as there were good crumbs on it. Otherwise, comfortable stay as always.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Gorgeous hotel, friendly staff, a much needed rest...","My flight had been delayed 15 hours and I was so sleep deprived... I checked in on a day rate to shower and take a nap before going any further. The hotel staff were friendly, the hotel is gorgeous! I wish I could stay again to enjoy the bar, restaurant etc. The place is beautiful...seriously the best couple hundred dollars I ever spent. My only wish was for free internet. Perhaps that too will come.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Clean, modern, awesome location right in the Airport","The Westin at Denver's airport is a great choice for that early-AM flight.Rather than getting up at 4 AM to try and drive to the airport, I elected to splurge on a room at the Westin, have a relaxing evening meal, a good night's rest, and then a very brief walk in the morning to Airport Security which is immediately adjacent to the Westin.The lobby and bar are stylish and clean - quite relaxing.The room was comfortable and essentially brand new.You pay for this - the place is not cheap, and they don't include parking with the room.  That would be a good idea for the Westin marketing people - park-stay-and-fly is an obvious package which would be very appealing to customers.Overall, if you can afford it, this is a nice setup.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Superior Front Desk Staff,"This past Monday night was my second stay at the Westin DIA.  I was greeted at the front desk by a witty young woman named Margaret.  After she cleared up some confusion about the name on my reservation, I shared with her how much I had enjoyed my prior stay in a corner room on the West side of the hotel, with commanding views of the DIA runways, the Denver skyline, and the Rocky Mountains in the distance.  It literally feels like you are living as part of a very active airport.  Following that discussion, she got busy on her computer and secured for me an even more spectacular room on the West side, fourteenth floor.  Realizing I had forgotten to request a late checkout, I stopped back by the front desk and Margaret accommodated that request without any of the hassle that you get at so may hotels these days.  I thoroughly enjoyed both of my stays at the Westin DIA.  It is convenient, ultra modern, and the views and ambiance are unlike any other place I have stayed.  With staff like Margaret, what's not to like?",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect for an early morning flight ,"This hotel has been well designed,  is comfortable and likely the quietest hotel I have ever stayed at.  I had a 6 am flight and it was great to not have to worry about over sleeping and missing my flight or traveling 90 minutes to the airport at 2am. I'll definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Airport stay,We are experienced travelers and this is one of the nicest hotels we've stayed at.  The staff is amazing.  They offered us a wonderful upgrade and we had a sweeping view of the Rockies.  The room was exceptionally quiet.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great place to stay,We stayed here the night before a very early morning flight.  The rooms are sound proof so no airplane noise.  It was a very peaceful stay and a beautiful hotel.  We had a nightcap at the hotel bar and the bartender was very friendly and professional.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,So convenient for an early morning flight!,"There is nothing like a night at a Westin Hotel, and the Denver airport Westin doesn't disappoint. The room was clean, the beds super comfy but the best part is the 2 minute walk into the airport. I had a 6 am flight, so the fact that the commute to the airport was stress free was important to me. I returned my rental car in the evening and took the shuttle to the hotel so I had no worries in the morning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Westin DIA,Wow. They did this right. We stayed at the Westin prior to a trip to MexicoThe room was outstanding  very nice very comfortable linens. I easily could have made a day of it.  The bar near the front desk was busy and there were people from every where around the world. Starbucks in the lower level was a hit with our early wake up Outstanding hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenient, Great Sense of Place","The aesthetics of this hotel are not cookie-cutter; you know you're in Denver's new, modern airport -- and that's a good thing! Our room had views of the undulating airport architecture and outdoor, moving sculptures against the backdrop of the plains around Denver. Watching a storm approach was cool. We also faced the airport's giant window on the arrivals/departures side. The constantly moving people and escalators added lights and motion to ""the picture."" All of our service interactions were good. The bar also reflected the flight theme, and if you picked your seat well the music wasn't too loud. We had an enjoyable meal in the restaurant (I had the charcuterie plate, which was meal-sized and not overpriced).Our price was at the higher end, but I felt we got good value for $ - especially when we just rolled across the courtyard for our AM flight: no shuttles!! It was also an easy trip into the hotel from the Alamo car rental, drop off right by the elevator to the hotel courtyard. BTW, Alamo at Denver AP did a tremendous job of being efficient and courteous - literally the best car rental experience I've ever had. At 2:30 PM we had our pick of at least a dozen cars in our category. One point: we were advised to upgrade to a larger car if we were going to ""drive in the mountains."" We didn't do so, and since we stuck to paved mountain roads we had no issues as all with our compact Nissan.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"""Any port in a storm""","I was stranded at the Denver Airport by Southwest Airlines well after midnight one Friday recently while my luggage headed to Spokane WA.I decided a night at the Westin was preferable to a night in the airport.The hotel is a short walk from the Denver terminal and appears to be new.One reviewer mentioned overpriced-no singles, double at $346, reduced to $311 by AAA/AARP; however taxes were an additional $46.The young woman at check in couldn't have been nicer: first the discount, then a toothbrush, toothpaste, a comb, disposable razor, shave cream and a voucher forfree breakfast. She even set the computer for late check out.The room (10th floor) was spacious, clean and comfortable. Had a very good night's sleep after a trying day.Next morning, a shower and breakfast ($40-eggs, juice, coffee w/tax, w/o tip) and i was on my way to battle with Southwest.Since I am retired, I wouldn't see staying here again unless stranded. Hotel probably relies on the top 1%, business travelers and other poor saps who get stranded.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Excellent hotel with access to DIA.,"My wife and I had to spend a night between flights in Denver due to weather cancelations of flights.  We decided to stay at the DIA Westin because of it's proximity to DIA airport. (a close walk to checkin and the TSA security lines).  This is a world class hotel! Excellent facilities, the rooms are quietly elegant, and everything is just perfect.  If you need to stay at DIA and need to maximize your ""recharge time""...this is the place to do it.  Highly recommended",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Nice, new, clean place to rest before your flight","The Westin is a new hotel steps from the airport. The staff was very friendly and the place very interesting to the eye. For the price though, I expected more from their rooms. For the same price, in the heart of Boulder, you can stay at the St Julien which is like heaven on earth in decor, amenities and service. Though new, the rooms at The Westin are stark and somewhat unimaginative in decor but the view of the airport is fascinating especially if your room overlooks its tented roof. I was quite surprised how quiet the room was even though you really are situated in the middle of the airport. They also have a nice workout room and indoor pool.  If you want to relax and have a snack or small meal, you can sit at the bar in the main lobby and enjoy the view and the great service (thanks, Samantha!). If you want more, you can dine downstairs in their restaurant which was tasty and there were plenty of choices on the menu. If you like airports, you can easily walk over and go to the airport shops or sit and have a drink while watching travelers go by.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Stark. Soulless. Overpriced. ,"This brand new hotel at the Denver Airport was a real disappointment. While it is large, modern and, like all Westins, has a comfortable bed, with quality linens and pillows, it feels more show pony than homey comfort I expect. The lighting is inadequate, the furnishing are like something out of Beetlejuice (and hideously uncomfortable) and the bathrooms seem an embarrassing afterthought. And, by the way if you're platinum Starwood, it is completely inconsequential. This brand new hotel has NO concierge lounge! Might as well book the Aloft down the street. I'd only stay here again as some airline's guest on a late night cancelled flight. Too bad. I like Westin, usually.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Beautiful, peaceful hotel","This hotel is conveniently located adjacent to the main terminal at DIA.  It is new and modern, with beautiful rooms.  We stayed recently when we took and evening flight in and had a long drive awaiting us in the morning.  We will stay there again when we're flying in/out of DIA!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Very nice service, beautiful room, and so convenient","As a Starwood member, I asked for and received  an upgraded room, which was large and beautiful, and definitely laid out not like a cookie cutter hotel room. It felt clean, new and luxurious.  The front desk people were wonderful. And I was surprised at the quality of the restaurant. They had delicious healthy choices.  A very good rest before our flight and soooo convenient for our early morning flight. I will try to stay here as much as possible when we are flying out early.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice Addition to the Airport,"The rooms are new and well done, modern interior design. The hotel is a very short distance to the airport check in. The lounge area is nice to get a drink, meet up with business partners and simply walk around.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great stay,"After many hours of traveling it was a true oasis has to come to the Westin. Nice staff, wonderful rooms. Christian was especially accommodating. Our children loved the pool, I will have to find an excuse to come back to Denver just to stay at this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing Smile!!!,"I just got off a long 3 hour flight from the East coast.  I loved that i did not have to secure ground transportation and just grabbed my bags and walked about 100 yards to the front desk.  And then I received the best smile from Margaret.  She was so considerate, friendly and sincere.  She even recognized it was my birthday and she provided me with a complimentary nightcap from the lobby bar.  So nice...I can't wait to come back and this will be the place I stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great job Westin after the Hyatt Tech Center screwed us.  ,"Great service at the Westin!!!!!!So. My wife booked us a 2 rooms through booking.com at the Hyatt Tech Center in Denver.   Imagine our surprise when we landed at 10:30 pm and got an email from booking.com letting us know the Hyatt was not going to honor the reservation for the night.  Oh but they said they could probably find us a room in Colorado Springs,  SERIOUSLY.  After an hour on the phone with booking.com with no luck.  I walked into the the Westin at the Colorado Airport just to see if they even had a room.  (did I mention we are here to drop our daughter at college? So you can imagine everything is booked)  there were about 8 people in line and no one at the preferred desk.  I walked up to the preferred desk (I am not a preferred member yet) just to see if they even had a room and Victoria was kind enough to see if they had rooms an even held one for me and then I got in the other line(willingly).   Then Natasha McCoy took care of us & even gave us a complimentary drink card after hearing our story.  I won't get into the rental car fiasco in this review.  (But Budget did a great job too).  A big thanks to Justin at the bar for making a great Sidecar.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Front desk goddesses!!!,"Our trip to Denver started off on a sour note when a different hotel cancelled our reservation while we were in flight and en route to Denver (boo Hyatt Tech Center). After over an hour of phone calls to EVERY hotel and to booking.com, the front desk ladies at the Westin took care of us. Victoria and Natasha M. went out of their way to assist us, and their smiles and hospitality far exceeded our expectations. Natasha single handedly converted us to SPG loyalists. Add Justin D.'s service to the mix and we are sold. The Westin is now our preferred Denver hotel:)",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Great location, attentive service, quiet location",The property is amazing. From the bellmen at the drive up to the lobby and rooms.You are encased in quiet. It was amazing to be next to the runways and hear no sound.We loved wandering into the airport to just cruise around and then back to the hotel room. The room was wonderful Westin. Understated and yet everything needed. The staff was attentive and made eye contact when we walked up. I would recommend this property to anyone with a morning flight out of DIA. It makes getting to the airport a pleasant experience.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Perfect in all ways,"This is my 3rd time to stay here and it is so nice I could see staying for weeks!The restaurant has healthy choices and prepared with great finesse . I had the bass ir catfish (can't  recall which) , but it was excellent! I did not find breakfast as outstanding as dinner.Great Starbucks too with beautiful outdoor seating . I liked the pecan pie croissant and my hit cafe mocha was just the right temp and chocolate vs coffee mixture .The pool and workout area is fantastic with gorgeous views while you work out.Also, they have a large court area outside with picnic tables!! Great for the 4 grandchildren!They also have included a lot of natural light, wood floors and live plants to enhance a healthier environment!It makes going to the airport a very pleasant stress free event. It was surprising how pleasant.They have excellent acces for special needs. The rooms superb no matter which floor!One thing that was of note was the whirpool . The jets were so strong I had to hold on to the sides to stay seated!!! It felt great, but challenging :)))",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Board Meeting,"We hosted a Board meeting at the Westin and first of all, the location is amazing!! Nothing else better exists. Board members did not have to rent cars, they got off their respective planes and walked over to the Westin. The staff there did a great job and the food was very good. Rooms were fine. We are a non-profit so we book normal kings or queen rooms for everyone and no one had a complaint. We'll be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fantastic Stay,Fantastic stay!!  Had the misfortune of an evening cancelled flight so stayed at the Westin for an evening.  Superb staff at the front desk - thank you Delilah!! The rooms were clean and very comfortable.  Very convenient for our morning flight the next day. Thank you Westin Denver Airport!!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great stay and location,"SO happy to have spent the extra money and stayed here.  The staff was great, the room was clean and pretty, the views were amazing.  THe pool and workout room were great.  I will definitely be back next time we have a flight in Denver",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Grandmother & granddaughters celebrate a 5-year old birthday!,"When each of my granddaughters turns 5, I choose a hotel and take the birthday girl and the other granddaughters who are already 5 years old. This time I had two granddaughters with me. Because of expense, I initially steered cleared of this hotel. But with some discounts, including the Colorado resident one, I was able to get a reasonable price. I also informed the reception desk about a birthday, hoping that they would at least say Happy Birthday when we checked in,Well, from the moment we checked in until we left, we were treated royally! Margaret registered us and said Happy Birthday to Lily. Shortly after arriving at our room, a cart with tablecloth arrived with cookies and milk and a birthday card. The little girls' eyes almost popped out!The room was clean; the beds VERY comfortable, and there was virtually no noise.They loved the swimming pool (although a bit cold for them) and the giant escalators the most. The were very proud of their room keys, too! And every time we went by the lobby, Margaret said ""hi"" to us. The girls (and I!) felt this was an amazing treat. This hotel isn't just for DIA travelers.LZ, Boulder, CO",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very Convenient!!!,"My family and I stayed here for an early morning flight out of DIA. Checkin was quick and staff was friendly. Loved the rooms, super clean and views of the airport. This hotel is brand-new and very pretty. The new train into denver is right outside the doors of the hotel. We ate at the restaurant here, food was good and staff was attentive. The nighttime crowd was fun and drinks were good. Great wine list. Overall a great experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Vacation ,All the staff were very helpful.  Christian at the front desk went out of his way for us.  He was so helpful!  I mainly choose this hotel for the convenience of being next to the airport.  Definitely met my expectations and more!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"""Not what i was expecting""","So i've stayed a The Westin Lake Las Vegas before and it was average at best. Everything was dated, smelled musky, and there was even an insect problem at the time. The service there was mediocre at best.So when i found out we were having a meeting at the Westin DIA i had low expectations. I travel a lot and stay at high end hotels all the time but let me tell you that i was blown away by the service at the moment of check in. The gentleman at the front desk by the name of Christian was by far the most professional service oriented person i have ever been in contact with in my many visits to 4-5 diamond hotels. Needless to say Christian set the mood for my entire visit. he was kind, courteous, helpful, and accommodating. Truly a Rock Star and an asset to the company.Everything here is modern and beautiful. From the heavenly bed, pillows, and shower to the salt water pool and the gym. The rooms are great and comforting. As for the dinning please be sure to have a drink and enjoy the tacos and the pork belly sliders... AWESOME!!!!I was here on business and even though PSAV was not providing the service Daniel Cokewell was awesome.It a convenient place to stay as it is extremely close to the airport and has direct access to the train. Although personally i do like it when there are things to do and see in the vicinity. So the convenience is relevant to your needs.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Super Convenient, Super Clean ","This hotel is very nice. If you are catching a flight, it is also very convenient. I cannot believe how quiet it was even though airplanes were flying in and out of the airport. There was absolutely no outside noise in the room. I later found out that they had soundproofed their rooms. The staff was very courteous and helpful. I was impressed with this hotel. It will be my go-to hotel if I ever have an early flight.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great check in guy,"Christian at the front desk was amazing.  Nice you, funny and took good care of us - I come back here because of people like Christian.  He even gave us a drink coupon because it was a long day.For early flights out of Denver this is the place to stay!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,What a great place,"Wow, I am so impressed!  Not only is it super convenient at an airport where so many options are far away, but it is also beautiful with super friendly staff (Christian - front desk).  Ordered room service too and the food was wonderful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great Staff,Upon checking in I was greeted at the registration counter by Margaret who went out of her way to unsure that as a platinum member of SPG I had whatever I needed. I first thought that having the last name of Weston I was having special treatment but quickly realized that she treats everyone the same way. She was totally professional and started my stay off in a very positive way. The Westin needs more Margarets to greet guests!!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Location, location","Hotel is connected by a short walkway to the airport.  A distinctive-looking building, it has been open only since last fall.  The rooms are large, very well appointed and entirely up-to-date.  Though large, it has only one restaurant with a limited menu.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great addition walk to terminal,"I'm glad I booked this exceeded my expectations.  View was great, bed .... Fantastic and clean . Walked to terminal - I'll be back !!  Got good rate- shower nice - need more food options is one gripe !Stay here and you will be glad.  Westin never disappoints",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Practical & worth the expense,This hote lobby is a sci-fi type dream. I loved I could walk to airport security in the morning for my red eye flight and even grab a starbucks from the hotel along the way. The room was a King 9th floor and very quiet.  I felt like I was staying on the deck of the startrek enterprise in some sci-fi world. If you are the type of traveller that wants your last night to be stress free and not have to take a shuttle to the airport this place is for you but a heads up it isn't cheap so save your pennies.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Very chichi, but the location before departure can NOT be beat!","Clean, modern, AMAZING views of the Rockies, nice rooms, good beds, and the ability to access the airport with ease.  The facilities were also clean and had amazing views.  The restaurant was good, but not spectacular.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Luxury, modern, and quiet accomodations at a major airport","We chose to stay at the Westin due to its convenient location next to the terminal at the Denver airport.  It was the perfect place to overnight before a very early morning flight.We were delighted with the quality of the rooms.  The decor was modern, the beds and furniture were comfortable, the towels and bedding were extremely high quality, and the room was very clean.  Even though the property is next to the terminal of a busy airport, the room was quiet with no airplane noise.  We did not dine in the hotel.The cost of the room, with AAA discount was $305.  Taxes were high, an additional $45!  If it had not been for the extremely early flight, we would have stayed at one of the many hotels, about 5 miles from the airport, and dropped our rental car off the morning of the flight.   While the cost was higher than we typically pay on vacation, it was truly a luxury room and we avoided the rental car return hassle at 4:00 am.Check in and out was quick and efficient.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Location, Location, Location","I will pay for convenience and this fit the bill. The public spaces were beautiful. I wish I had time to use the pool and well equipped work out room.  The room was to be expected at a Westin, nice and comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Location is great .... rooms, service and food average","You can not beat the location of this hotel it is simply worth staying here due to the convenience but the majority of the service, food and hotel rooms are a little on the average side. Check-in was very slow. At breakfast the servers lacked any level of interest and one of the glasses given to my youngest child was completely cracked .... we wondering why it was leaking and then discovered that it was a completely cracked glass ..... there was zero apology which I found disturbing given risks associated with using such an item. The rooms are your typical airport hotel style, nothing that special. Special mention, however, should go to Steven Baker who really provided exceptional service.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Absolutely marvelous hotel - great rooms and service,"Easy check in and out - amazingly easy! We returned to the States on a flight from London, collected our luggage on a cart and took it straight to our room! Easiest way to spend an overnight for a next morning departure to our final destination. Lovely room, too!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best Airport Hotel Ever,"My wife and I checked in early and stayed as long as possible in order to fully enjoy the hotel. The rooms, the bar, restaurant, pool and the fitness center and the location, of course, are all fabulous. If available, be sure to upgrade to an upper story view room, the iconic airport shot was taken from our room.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!","The only reason I didn't give this hotel a 5 star rating is that you only have 1 restaurant to choose from which is on the higher end (steak $39) so if you want a causal dining experience you have to go into the airport (although only a 100 feet away). The amenities and location of the hotel however are superb. We checked in the night before our flight back home and took the rental cars back that night instead of the day we were flying out which was one less thing to think about. The staff, decor, rooms and views are worth the price. This will be my go to hotel when flying out of DIA when I have a morning flight.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Saved our vacation!!,"Christian at check in was awesome!!!! After a canceled flight on our way to celebrate our 25th anniversary in Maui, we were both upset. Christian set us up with a wonderful room and a free drink at the bar. Not to mention the girl who helped me make the last minute reservation on the phone from the airport. She was amazing and I really wish I could remember her name.Really nice place to stay, with great people.Julia & Robert Blair",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Christian was amazing!,"I had just had the worst flying experience ever, and got stuck in Denver. I walked over to the Westin, and Christian at the reception desk made my day! He was so polite, professional, and kind. He helped me get a nice room and I was able to turn the day around.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Best Westin Experience To Date,"I stayed for one night at The Westin DIA after spending a long weekend in Colorado Springs, staying at what is unquestionably the nicest hotel in the state of Colorado, The Broadmoor. For those of you not familiar with the magical place that is The Broadmoor property, its a breathtaking castle in the rocky mountains complete with its own lake. In addition to one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen, the ownership/management have been writing the book on exceeding customer expectations for the last 100 years. My stay there was outstanding in every sense of the word.Why am I sharing this with you, you ask? Despite all of it's majesty and all of it's attention to detail, not a single interaction with a member of The Broadmoor staff was as pleasant or memorable as the one I had with Christian at the front desk of the Westin DIA while checking in. While we waited for my SPG App reservation to show up in his system Christian took the time to find out that I had a 6am flight the next morning and helped me get myself set up for a 4am breakfast arrival at my door. He put me in a fantastic room with a pretty remarkable view and even hooked me up with a free drink from the bar for the ""inconvenience"" of needing to wait two minutes for his computer system to refresh. Good news for all of you is this hotel offers a myriad of other fantastic amenities aside from just Christian. The property is brand new and architecturally stunning. I stayed in a Business King room on the East end of the 11th floor, a quick walk down the hall from the   very well equipped Fitness Center. I had that drink at the bar that Christian hooked up, and had a few samples from the kitchen served to me while I did. When I left The Broadmoor I thought I was saying goodbye to beyond exceptional customer service and accommodations for awhile. This review goes out as a thank you to the entire staff at The Westin DIA for helping to extend that experience for one more day. A special thanks to Christian, keep showing them how it's done, my dude.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nothing Left to Chance!,"My wife and I were staying at the Westin Denver International Airport on our last night in Colorado before returning to Vermont. We had been in Vail for 2 months where my wife had successful spinal fusion surgery. The hotel provided everything that was necessary for us to have a very comfortable night- from a wheelchair, to a great room, to a wonderful meal as well as to a good night's sleep. The next morning, my wife was taken by wheelchair from the room and into the airport. The hotel staff took care of our luggage and brought us through TSA.This hotel and its staff could not have been better!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very nice airport hotel,"I have stayed at plenty of airport hotels.  I just need a clean, quiet room, and interior that does not smell, and clean shower, and if I am at a ""airport hotel"", I would like to be able to walk to the airport in 5-10 minutes.  Given this, I am usually not a fan of airport hotels; the implications of why are given in the qualifiers.  The Westin at the Denver airport, however, is remarkable. Check each box above, plus friendly staff, new and terrific rooms and showers, and, voila, an excellent ""airport hotel"".  I would recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,We really enjoyed our stay,We booked our stay at the Westin DIA for our last night of our trip to Denver.  We were so please with the hotel.  Check in. The room.  The staff.  Clean. Quiet. Comfortable.We working on the design and construction of the DIA and looked forward to staying at the airport.  If you can stay here instead of off site.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very Nice New Hotel!,"I had the pleasure of staying at this Westin Property recently. The hotel opened not too long ago so the rooms, lobby, etc. are clean, well-designed and have a great ambience. The thing that really impressed me was the size of the rooms. I am used to hotel rooms getting smaller and smaller, but the rooms at the Westin are spacious and well laid out. As others have noted, one of the most attractive features of this hotel is the location - you have to walk just steps from the airport  to the entrance to the hotel. In addition, the train to downtown is located just below the hotel. Although it can take 40 mins or so to get there, it is very convenient to just walk downstairs and hop on board.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Convenient, Immaculate, Perfect Stay!",This hotel is stunning! The entire property is immaculate. The convenience to the airport is like no other. You take the elevator/escalator and was a short distance directly into the airport. The easiest transition! Must stay if you have an early flight. Check in service was quick and super hospitable. Front desk staff was wonderful! They explained the hotel and with kindness answered questions and we were on our way.  The airport food court is easily accessible or the hotel has a beautiful restaurant for a nice dinner stop. The room was clean and well stocked. Bedding was so comfortable! Beautiful! Convenient! Modern! Would definitely stay again!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Overnight stay on way home from CO fire,"After two weeks in a fire camp, anything would have been nice, but the Westin exceeded my expectations. I utilized valet for dropping off my luggage before returning my rental car. The turns to get out and on my way we're a bit tricky and I had to make a U turn when I realized I was going the wrong direction. It could have been better marked or maybe I didn't pay enough attention. I checked in, as I was traveling for work did have a government rate. About 15-20 minutes in my room, the valet arrived with my luggage, and I gave him a nice tip. Right after, another person arrived with a complimentary cheese plate. Not sure why, although I had a Facebook message that had gone unanswered for 2 days - maybe that was it? Anyway, all is forgiven with cheese!I went over to the airport for dinner. The room was great. I could hardly hear the planes. Spacious, clean and luxurious. Getting over to the airport the next day was easy, it took a bit of navigation to realize where I needed to go for my airline, but I made it. I would definitely stay there again, although I can only afford it when traveling for work. Thank you for your hospitality!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A great overnight...,"My flight was diverted, which meant a missed connection, and an overnight was the only option.  It was 9:00 pm after a long day; the hotel was a short walk across a small plaza from the DIA terminal, so it was ultra convenient.  Both the reservationist who took my call (from inside the terminal) and the staff member at the reception desk when I checked in were extremely helpful and greatly appreciated.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,location location location,"I felt compelled to write a review about this property after I went on the Westin website and saw people complaining about how they have to walk a whole 25 yards outside from the airport terminal to the hotel. I'm sorry but it is NOT A BIG DEAL. If you can't walk this distance, then ask airport staff for a wheelchair. If it is too cold for you ,then stay home and don't come to the Rocky Mountains in the middle of winter. This hotel was impeccable and we had a fabulous stay there . There was a minor delay in receiving our dinner order so to make it up to us ,they sent us a free dessert. I couldn't have asked for a more relaxing , clean and comfortable stay in a beautiful and modern property.  My husband and I will be back soon. PS the pool area is incredible!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Stunning atmosphere!!,"It was just an overnight stay for my husband and I but the welcome we received was top notch from our drive into valet at 11pm. Check in with Sarah.C at front desk was efficient and smooth. She took the time to explain what amenities we had in our room to the restaurants onsite. Big thanks to the Front Desk management, Tom Witte and your efficient staff(s)!! Our bellboy, Julian.J was impressive as he managed our extremely heavy suitcases effortlessly. Bravo!! Our room which was a gorgeous suite on the 14th floor faced the mountain on the west and part of the east where we had our first sight of the light rail from DIA to downtown Denver. Thank you Kristi.G for the welcome snacks in our refrigerator! It was awesome! Overall for us, frequent travelers, we were made to feel very welcomed, very comfortable and refreshed, to tackle the long flight(22 hours) to Asia in the afternoon!! P/S Breakfast at the Grill and Vine ...Try their White Eggs omelet with spinach, tomatoes..delicious and breakfast burritos...they were huge!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL,"The hotel is steps from the Denver International Airport.  Steps away from the train and buses to downtown Denver or the surrounding area.  It is $9 for an all day pass and does include the transfers. The hotel itself is beautiful.  The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.  The bedding is top of the line quality with plenty of pillows to choose from, nice crisp sheets to slide into every night.   Comforters on the bed that keep you warm without being too hot.  Easy to set temperature controls to keep the room at your desired temperature.  Two bathrobes are furnished in the bathroom.  Two bottles of water are furnished in each room.  Along with tea and coffee.  I didn't eat at the restaurant so have no opinion on the food.  It is steps away from the airport so you can buy food at quite a few places inside the airport.I like the west wing facing the airport of the hotel best.  There is a window ledge you can sit in to watch the planes come and go.  One stay I was in the east wing facing the highway.  You could still see planes coming and going but from a distance.  All rooms are extremely quiet.  No outside noise but you do hear the slamming of doors from the rooms closest to you.One night there was a concert in the central pavilion.  Along with barbecue, cornhole game, riding the bull and other entertainment.  I was in the west wing facing the airport.  I could watch the crowd from my room without hearing the loud noise.  Very entertaining!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"DIA Westin offers ""Heavenly"" respite for weary travelers","The service.  The design.  The attention to detail.  The ambience.  The scent.  The Heavenly Bed.  Combine all the things you love about Westin properties with the view of the Rockies and the convenience of the airport location = winning.  We watched the Westin grow from the ground up over the last couple of years - this giant structure that resembled Noah's Ark more than a luxury hotel, but, once again, Westin does not disappoint.  And, now you can take the A train to and from the hotel (and the airport) from downtown.  So, the next time you are in need of a little luxury and your travel plans take you west, you can't go wrong with the new DIA Westin.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Superb stay, magnificent Westin team!","Had an unexpected stay due to weather issues, made unplanned overnight stop in Denver.  Convenience cannot be taken for granted; 5 minutes from baggage claim to hotel check in.   Was helped by a wonderful representative at check in, Delilah; she was amazing!  Helped me get a room that was very quiet, out of any busy area and made sure that I was pleased with the set up; this was difficult due to limited rooms late at night.  Michael the bellman was incredibly helpful and hard working and Brent the front desk/duty manager also very kind in his assistance.   Room was a large, end of hallway and it doubled as a meeting room; great view of one of the runways and room was well kept, spotlessly maintained.   Daniel from engineering helped me with one technical item with the room and great attitude and customer focus.  The lobby bar had nice small plates for late night dining, got chicken wings and also chicken soft tacos, great food.  Easy checkout (believe Angie helped me, thank you), was in security line in matter of minutes for departure flight.   Thank you Miguel Sanchez for assembling a superstar team and I am really excited about any opportunity to return soonest!  Thank you Westin team.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,In a Pinch,We had a flight cancellation and Christian Cameron gave us the royal treatment. Personable and helped us to feel at home. The room is clean.  The hotel is pricey but if you have AAA it helps. Great place to stay at airport. Easy access to security and check in.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Average or Very Good Depending What Price You Can Snag,"Hotel is new, nice and clean. My gripe is the indoor pool is not heated and freeeeezing so my 4 year old was really disappointed. What is even the point of having a pool if its too cold to swim in.  If you are looking for convenience you can't beat this hotel and its super quiet you cannot hear the airport at all. As for the rating, at $280 its overpriced hence my ""Average"" review. If you can get it for less like my friend who booked it for $190 then I would say its ""Very Good.""",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Fantastic service!,"If you've ever stayed at a Westin, you know that the beds are comfy and the sheets are high thread-count. You know the design is impeccable. You may not know about the level of customer service at an airport location. I was obviously frazzled by spending after spending a week with my fabulous and wonderful in-laws. I love them, but a week is a long time. Christian at the front desk looked at my furrowed brow and awkward breathing and offered solace. He told me to relax and that everything is going to be fine. I can turn around, and I can have a cocktail while I send my in-laws upstairs for a shower. I can stop downstairs for some fantastic steak tartare. I can sit in the saltwater pool or the hot tub and ignore everyone. I took him up on all of it. It made the end of my vacation the best it could be.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,My hero ,"A huge huge shout out to Margaret!! Missed connecting Flight to Dublin due to weather in Chicago with our party of 9 .. No Luggage. Had to stay an unexpected night in Denver and Margaret saved us with toothpaste, combs, deodorant and a free drink! Love her and her customer service!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Arrival and departure stay at Westin going to Telluride ,"We had a great experience at a the Westin in Denver airport!  It is so convenient for alternative destinations as well.  The Hotel is a beautiful,  green in an elegant modern style. The room was so nice with an extremely comfortable bed, and in my case, the staff graciously accommodated my need for hypoallergenic bedding. We loved the lounging chairs in the room, very comfortable! We had dinners and breakfasts at the main restaurant, the food absolutely delicious with many organic healthy choices. My favorite was Pappardelle with lamb sugo, although I was tempted by the spaghetti squash dinner. We will definitely stay again at the Westin in Denver airport and recommend it!! With one special request for future stay: please make available hypoallergenic toiletries scent free!! ",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great last night of vacation,We selected this hotel because we had an early flight the next day.  It is a new hotel and it is very elegant.  We checked out the pool and fitness room on the 11th floor and I wish I had more time to take advantage of them because they were amazing.  Our room was very modern and well thought out.  We felt like we in a 5 star hotel for sure.  It was a great experience and one that I hope I can have again in the future.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Our snowstorm escape,"We were skiing in Breckenridge for spring break when we learned of a snowstorm arriving the evening before our flight out of Denver.  We decided to leave our hotel that afternoon and head to Denver.  I booked the hotel on my iPhone while we drove to the city.  We were looking for one close to the airport and the Westin was available.  It was a beautiful, clean and new hotel.  The rooms were very modern and spacious.  We enjoyed in room dining that was delicious.  Also, the pool and gym on the top floor were amazing.  We used all the facilities in our short time there.  It was a GREAT find that alleviated our stress to make sure we arrived for our flight.  I'm so happy to have found this and will definitely use again in the future if the mountain throws another snowstorm on our…",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Nice and convenient !,Great location if flying in and out of Denver airport !  Very Modern decor. Parking is expensive but if rented a car then could return it prior to flying out and won't need it next day as terminal is attached to hotel !  Would stay here next trip for sure !,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient and Friendly,Very well done. Close to the airport and very user friendly.  Robert at the front desk does and awesome job. Nancy at the lobby bar takes great care of you. They should have TVs in the bar though instead of the club music.  Food was good. Had the French Dip -- is recommend it. ,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Check Priceline first,"Pretty cool spot. I had a 630 am flight so it was ideal. I wouldn't spend $300-400 per night but I got it on Priceline express deals. Tip: it's the only 4 star hotel in the Denver airport zone so it's no secret what hotel it is. I got it for $125 plus tax. Room was new, clean, and modern. They charge for WiFi which is lame but oh well. Lobby bar is pretty bland. Check in was easy but late that night there was at least an hour line. I think a flight was cancelled and the airline sent everyone there. It's seconds from security and easy to get around.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful Airport Hotel,"This hotel was a lifesaver during the recent Southwest Airline shutdown.  They had a room for us to stay in, as we waited for a flight out in the morning on another airline. The rooms were spacious and very clean.  Only problem was getting bottled water or something to eat.  We checked in fairly late, so if they had a store I think it was closed.  Anyway the hotel was nice, staff professional, and overall a good stay during a very stressful situation.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Very convenient but somewhat expensive,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin DIA on a return trip from the mountains as we had a 5:30 AM flight home.  We chose it strictly for convenience but also thought it would be a nice way to end our trip. It cant get any more convenient.  Its literally a one minute walk to the security section of the airport.The hotel is very new and very nice.  We stayed in a simple king room over looking the plaza.  Not much of a view but the room was very nice and very comfortable.  We were distracted several times during the evening by guests coming in and out of the main lobby in through the front door.  I would recommend a room further down the hall.  We were in 667 which was one door away from the entrance.  Very comfortable, well equipped, but with just the essential toiletries and your basic flat screen tv.  Comfortable bed and nice shower.As stated before its very convenient.  We also chose to stay here as we thought we could have a nice dinner to  finish off our stay.  Basically one restaurant with great service but limited menu.  We were disappointed in dinner but admit we should give it another chance when back it the area.Would I stay again.  Yes if I need the convenience.  No if I had access to a car and the convenience was not important.  I thought it was somewhat overpriced but admit it was worth it given the quick access to the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Anticipated this hotel for a long time!,"I've been waiting for this hotel to open.  I am not disappointed.  It is pricey, but well worth it.  It is a gorgeous property, with a unique modern style.  The rooms are comfortable, spacious, and well thought out with great work spaces, outlets, and nice views.  The restaurant and bar are nice.  Service is excellent.  It is literally STEPS from the TSA precheck line.  I will look to this as my go-to hotel when I am flying in and out of Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Absolutely Convenient,"Great location . This is a first class hotel with all the things one might need for an unexpected overnight.  Even if one needed a hotel room for a very early or late night flight , this is the place.  It is a ten minute walk from the lobby to the airport terminal .",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,No place to stay,"During the recent Southwest debacle I was stranded at the Airport, gazed across the breezeway and what a wonderful sight. Margaret set me up for the night, made sure I paid the appropriate rate (Military) and made sure the stay was better than the day.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Luxury hotel close to airport-super convenient,"We stayed here at the end of a Colorado trip to mountains with school aged kids.  The best thing was rolling out of bed and walking to check in at airport.I gave it 5 stars as I can't really find anything to criticize but I am not quite sure it was worth the money.   But for half the price you can stay 10 minutes away from DIA.The rooms are nice and as you would expect.  We had a partial view of the mountains. We could see in DIA.  When I read the reviews, the people that give this place bad reviews seem to expect more special treatment than average bear such as being checked in 6 hours before the usual check in of 3 pm, etc, etc.   -When we drove in we were met by bellstaff who took our bags up.  At first noone told us where to go but you go up to 6th floor to check in  The bellstaff waited while we checked in and then brought our bags up with us.  -At 3 pm the check in staff was ultra professional and fast.  When we went to dinner around 6 pm there was a short line.  Looked like maybe a plane got canceled.-I could not figure out a graceful way to get our rental car to the rental agency after unloading our bags.  After 20 minutes you have to pay for parking.  But at least we did not have to hump our bags from the rental to the hotel.-The rooms are clean and comfortable.  There is a fridge and safe-The room service during middle of day was fairly fast (25 minutes)  The food was delicious but not cheap, not the most visually attractive (gyoza looked 2 years old but when we tasted them they were out of this world).  My kids LOVED the fish tacos....(9 yo not fancy palate)-good kids channels on tv-why oh why does a hotel this expensive charge for internet.  it just p@#$# everyone off and there is no need.  The hotel for $125 down the street has free internet.  -didn't have time to check pool out-the restaurant is serviceable-pricey and we did not experience stellar service.  You can read separate reviews.  We had to wait 25 minutes on a Friday night so plan accordingly.   -the rail ends in the basement of this hotel so great for RTD commuting-there is a partial starbucks that you can get coffee in the am if you don't like using the inroom coffee brewWALKING to airport to catch your flight --PRICELESS",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Literally connected to the airport - perfect for an early flight or unexpected cancellation/delay,"We spent one night here before our morning flight home. Hotel is literally connected to the airport so beyond convenient. Very clean. Room sofa was crazily uncomfortable; think upholstered church pew...an odd choice, but thankfully we did not spend much time in the room. Only drawback to the airport location is that if you don't want to eat in the hotel, there is really no good place around to have a decent dinner and we didn't feel like driving into downtown. We ended up at some sort of weird cajun/asian fusion place that I would not recommend. Would stay here again if I had another morning departure; otherwise I would stay downtown so I would not feel so isolated.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Mixed business with pleasure ,"Fantastic hotel! One of the quieter ones I've ever stayed in.  The on site restaurant is pricey, but is excellent.  You can always go find something at the food court in the airport if you want to spend less. My husband and I took the light rail into the downtown area for a couple of meals. Having close access to the tram is awesome!!! The fitness center and pool are aesthetically pleasing and make working out that much more enjoyable. I had a problem that wasn't handled by the hotel, but I took care of it myself. I was disappointed in this. The fridge in the room is nice to have. Overall, the hotel is a great place to chill.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great hotel but poor attention to detail,"Stayed one night with my family as we had an overnight layover at DIA.  Our flight from DC to DIA was delayed and it became clear that we'd get into the hotel very late at night after starting the day in London.  I called from DC to make sure our rooms were held and that we had connecting rooms.  When we arrived at midnight, exhausted, they assigned us two rooms on opposite sides of the (huge) hotel.  Asked for adjoining rooms again and was given two rooms that were almost adjoining, 1 off.  Went back down to front desk and finally got it sorted out on the third try.  Rough stuff between noon and 1 am.The hotel itself is new and beautiful and the food at their sit-down restaurant was good for both breakfast and lunch.",2
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Convenient modern hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights for a business meeting. The hotel is very clean and new. There are very large, sound proof windows in guest rooms. It is attached to the airport so not convenient for walking around outside. But the train is right there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The Best Airport Hotel,This is probably the best airport hotel I have stayed in.  I thought the Westin at the Detroit airport was the best until I stayed here.  The hotel has a great modern open lobby with a nice sitting area and lobby bar.  Rooms are fresh and clean with great views. The Colorado Striped Bass in the Vine & Grill restaurant was fantastic.,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Unbelievable Customer Service!,"So, my husband was ""delayed"" in Denver.  The ""delay"" started with 5 hours and turned out to be a full on flight cancel!  The city was sold out, he had no transportation and was exhausted.  I called the Westin and they had two rooms available.  Nonetheless, the agents still helped me get the best rate and got him a room.  I knew he would be tired and hungry so lucky me got in touch with Brett in room service.  He was so helpful!  Any obstacle that was presented he overcame!  Brett made a horrible day into an unforgettable experience.  Thank you for making a difference and an experience we will never forget!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Margaret at the Front Desk is Amazing!,"We booked the Westin as a layover on a trip to move my 87 year old mother from a rehab unit in Western Kansas to one in Rhode Island after she broke her hip and wrist.  Needless to say, it was not easy for my mom to travel.  Margaret checked us in, arranged a wheelchair pickup from our room to United and in every way eased our stress over how we were going to accomplish getting mom through this transition point on the trip.  She was professional and kind and thorough in every way...a blessing to our family!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Only if your stuck or have lots of money,"It was lovely, extremely clean. The luxurious Westin bed, there could be nothing better.  However, I was stuck at the airport, and could only walk somewhere, so i chose to spend the $250 a night for a standard regular room.. Nothing against the hotel but it is extremely pricey, which if you are surrounded by other options much more reasonable why wouldn't you stay there.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"Beautiful, clean, right at the airport","My family recently stayed at the Westin Denver International Airport after visiting Colorado and since we had an early flight.  I was so pleasantly surprised at this hotel!It is fairly new, the lobby, lobby bar, restaurant were really nice.  We were greeted by very friendly staff every time we saw them. The restaurant, Grill & Vine was exceptional with great entrees and Katelyn (I think) our server was very attentive.  It was nice to actually have delicious food-not what one would necessarily expect at an airport hotel, but as I said this Westin was great!  Our room was spacious, modern, super clean with a great view.  The hotel worked out great for our early travel needs, I could see staying there more than one night if you just wanted one base and shuttled into Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,A Beautiful New Hotel - attached to the airport,"The convenience for traveling in for a meeting can't be beat.  This hotel is attached to the airport by a short covered walkway. And the hotel itself is new and very attractive - clean, modern, well-designed rooms with all the features a traveler would want. But it's expensive.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,convenient but overpriced,"booked a junior suite,which was one large room and huge bathroom with floor to ceiling windows,giant t.v. and very comfortable bed.Views are of giant parking lots with runway in the distance.Very nice, but for the money not worth it.Other upscale chain hotels only a ten to twenty minute free shuttle ride away.Would consider this again only in an emergency.Two to four times what other close by hotels charge.For the money you should at least get breakfast.",3
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,VERY convenient... right at the airport,"Well... it simply does not get more convenient than this.We had a porter help us collect our luggage, and then he just wheeled everything over to the hotel, across a very small courtyard.Amazing convenience.The hotel is very new; it was still under construction when we were here a year ago.It's VERY modern, and the lobby areas (on more than one level) feel a bit empty.From the ""car"" entry level, there are just a couple of chairs and a sofa, and then LOTS of empty space.  All very clean, but empty.The reception area was... not full of helpful people.We simply could NOT get anyone to help with the luggage.  We realized belatedly that we should have asked the airport helper stay with us, and just help us get things upstairs.We had trouble finding a cart so we could check out.LATER, we saw that on the lower level, there were a bunch of carts, and also several attendants.  They might as well have been on Mars when we needed help, including when we asked for help at the main desk at check in and again by phone for check out.Not good.But did I mention the convenience?Denver's airport is one of the worst in terms of getting to nearby ""airport hotels"" (before the Westin was built) and also to rental cars.  Two separate shuttles required, long distances.The location of this hotel, practically IN the airport (but outside Security, of course), was the most convenient we've found anywhere thus far.The room was very clean, although a bit spartan.We were ""upgraded"" on our return stay, but neither of us could see a single difference, not in size, not in furnishings.We didn't use room service here.We will stay here in the future, due to the location.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great start to our honeymoon!,We enjoyed a ride in on the A Line and checked in for a night stay. Margaret was fantastic! She treated us like royalty and made sure our stay was enjoyable! Thanks Margret for our room; it was great and had a wonderful view! We will definitely stay again!,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Friendly staff and nice hotel at the airport!,Being trapped at the airport because of flight cancellations is never fun. But this hotel located at the airport was very nice and had lots of food and beverage options.Rate was a bit high for the hotel. Stayed there in June and paid $500+ because most of the hotels in Denver were booked. I do not think the hotel is worth that kind of money but was left with little options.Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Easy walk to get to your flights the next morning.Food was pretty good. They do have 24 hour room service.All the employees we encountered were very nice and went out of their way to make it a pleasant experience.,4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Amazing service at Grill and Vine ,I was tired and cranky and was met with excellent service by Shannon and Richard. I even was introduced to Dereck the service manager. I sat at the bar dining solo and was so well taken care of. The salmon with Brussels sprouts was fantastic If I get stuck waiting for a flight again I would definitely return,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,"New hotel & nice rooms - everything else so, so.","Staying here tonight at the end of 10 days in Colorado with the family. We didn't want to mess with hotel shuttles or Uber or a cab for our early morning flight, so we decided to book a room here for the night. Here's my take:Pros:- The Westin is brand new so the hotel itself is beautiful & the rooms are very nice, modern & comfortable.- Beds are very comfortable- Pool, spa & workout center are top notch with great views of the airport and surrounding area.- You are literally inside the airport so travel is simple for flying in and out of DIA.Cons:- - Dining options - The restaurant in the Westin is way overpriced for the quality of food and service. Almost $100 for 3 of us for lunch and it was just mediocre food. Literally chicken strips, pizza & a burger. Definitely a big drawback when you're stuck without a car at the airport.- When you pay over $300 for a hotel room, you shouldn't have to be nickeled & dimed an extra $9.95 to pay for wifi. That's kind of ridiculous.- Brand new hotel & the bathtub wouldn't retain water. Makes it hard to give your little kids a bath. Neutrals:- Staff - They were cordial, but no one was overly hospitable. Not like the Westin's we've stayed at in the past.",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great airport hotel,"It is about time that Denver Airport has a hotel that gives you quick acces to the train (downtown) and the terminal.  The hotel has a modern and clean layout with great views all around. (The guest rooms start on floor 6). The soundproofing is awesome and not one bit of airport noise. The gym, pool and hot tub are all modern and clean.  Checking in was quick and it was a perfect finish to the day of working to have someone helping me at the lobby desk that was helpful, friendly and did so with a smile! (Margaret). Sadly, it was a quick overnight off a business trip so my time was eat or the gym. I hit the gym so never got to try the restaurant.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Shout Out To Austin!,"What started as a very horrible experience with an unexpected 15 hours of traveling and delays with the airlines, changed to a great experience once I arrived at the Westin. The hotel is conveniently located at the airport and connected to the train station which made traveling to downtown and back to the airport a breeze. The staff was very welcoming and turned my horrible day around so quickly! Austin, at the coffee shop, was the highlight of my time at the Westin. He greeted everyone with a warm smile, a positive attitude and makes an amazing signature drink! Austin was very personable and remembered my name and my traveling story when I stopped in to the coffee shop for a second time. He was also very helpful with recommending great things to do with my short time in Denver. The convenience of the hotel and the staff, especially Austin, make the Westin a great place to stay and keep customers coming back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Personalized Customer Service,"The hotel was very nice and well appointed. The rooms were extremely quiet especially considering it was at the airport. I set a wake up call and woke up before that time, I got in the shower and heard a knock at the door of the front desk confirming I was up since I didn't answer the phone. Those type of personal touches are quite nice!",4
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Beautiful Hotel,"Brand new, connected to DIA.  Simply walk out of the terminal and into the Hotel.  Zero noise from airport.  Rooms are very nice,  a cool lobby bar that has great service.  The nice thing about this hotel is you can jump on the light rail at the hotel and be downtown in 30 minutes for under $10. No need for a rental car or parking!",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,The Porter even took our bags to check in for us!,"No one likes to have a flight cancelled but when ours was cancelled in Denver we decided to stay in the airport hotel, The Weston Denver Airport. What a terrific place. First of all, everyone was very helpful and two tired travelers were in their beautiful LARGE room quickly. The bed was amazingly comfortable. I do not care for those puffy quilts most hotels have now. I usually have to call for a blanket but one was waiting for me in the closet. The room was very clean and uncluttered, nicely decorated with king size bed, a desk, refrig,  a comfy chair and one of those old fashioned ""fainting couches""!The bathroom had a large shower with great pressure - loved it. We ate in the hotel restaurant and the menu included snacks to full meals. The food was well prepared and the service was excellent. They even had a decent wine list! However, in the morning, when we didn't answer the phone - some one came up to wake us for our wake up call - amazing!  Oh, the hotel was very quiet. We never heard anything outside of our room. No plane take off or landing noise, honestly. The best part was the porter who took our bags - and us - right to check in at the airport (right next door) in the morning. This is a great, great hotel! I would definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,MUST STAY WHEN TRAVELING,If you are traveling  out of Denver with a early travel time .THE WESTIN AIIRPORT is for you. You walk out of the Westin right into the airport terminal or you now can take the train into Denver . Could not be more convenient !,5
"Denver, CO",The Westin Denver International Airport,Great new hotel!,"I recently completed my third stay in 2016 at this hotel; it opened in either late 2015 or early 2016.  It is a beautiful facility.  I say facility, because it serves as the station for both bus and rail service to/from Denver.  I stayed here three times:  twice the night before an early flight home, once the evening of a late flight into Denver.  To say it is convenient to the airport is an understatement!  Walk out of baggage claim about 50 yards to the hotel...done.The hotel's design is beautiful, matching the unique airport design of DEN.On all occasions, I needed some special requests accommodated.  We needed adjoining rooms for the under 5 crowd.  On all three stays, this was accommodated.  We also needed an ice pack stored off overnight for medication; again, not a problem.I'm a Plat w/ Starwood and even with the need for connecting rooms, have received two upgrades out of the three stays.  For me, the important part of that is that on neither occasion did I have to ask or beg, which is so common at a lot of the hotels I stay at.  Very much appreciated!We have eaten in the restaurant several times and found the food to be different, but not in a way that a picky person or a child can't eat it.  Example.  My daughter got a small steak with mash-your-own potatoes.  That's 'different', but fun.  At breakfast I had the bison sausage; it was awesome!  The bartender at the restaurant is awesome as well.  On one of our stays, right before July 4, he brought out a glow in the dark glove like thing and gave it to my daughter.  Very nice.The salt water pool and hot tub are great as well.  No kiddee pool, but I think the deepest the pool gets is a bit over 4 feet.  The gym is also excellent.My only gripe, and this isn't the hotel's issue, is that if I have a rental car and want to go to the hotel, check in, drop luggage in the room, and then return the rental car, I can't do it in the 10 minute grace period allowed for by the airport.  Not a huge deal, but I was hustling and just couldn't pull it off!Would I stay here again?  I would, and I look forward to it.  I love the new build Westins like this.  They do so much right.  In-room fridge, coffee, great bathrooms...just a great hotel overall.  It was a joy to stay here the night we got in four hours later than planned (after midnight)!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,The best,very clean with ease of accessing amenities and services in the area.   Would recommend to anyone and will return in the future.    Staff i engaged with were friendly and accommodating at every juncture - perfect stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Ehhh,Bed was very uncomfortable and you can hear people’s dogs barking and restroom doors were slamming all night. We were charged for parking when the web site stated free parking I would have never stayed there for that. ,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Place to Stay While in Denver,Accommodations were clean and modern. Staff is friendly and professional. Appreciate ease of booking on relatively late notice. This will be my go to hotel for future Denver area visits. Looking forward to future stays. ,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent!,Would definitely come back! Came for my 21st birthday to take a break from winter camping and it was amazing! Staff was very friendly. Rooms were very clean and spacious! The beds are kinda hard but some people prefer it that way ! ,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Don’t go here,The hotel isn’t the giant glass building that says “Hyatt Place”. It’s the rat hole behind it.  Jail food for breakfast. Entire hotel smells like a bathroom. Employees just walk into your room without knocking. Never again!,1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Non-known Parking Fee ?,"per night parking fee before their arrival would be nice. For alot of people this would make the difference in the place they select to stay. I was not happy about this as I'm sure others will not be in the future. Seriously, what are your guests to do park off property and walk to hotel ? Guests shouldn't feel like they've been tricked into paying for something. Most or all hotels provide parking for their guests, especially a Hyatt Place.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Denver family visit,"Front desk staff were excellent and very service oriented.  I requested a room change due to noisy neighbors and staff handled the situation immediately.  Breakfast was hot and plentiful, though selections limited due to covid.  Carpet in my room was worn in places, but overall it was an excellent experience.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Location Needed, Clean, Not My Fav Hyatt For Sure",It's just a good Hyatt in a needed location.  I guess at the price point I should not complain.  The floor of the room by the door was ice cold.  So cold that condensation formed on the floor from the heat of the room.  I slipped and almost fell as I departed the room.  Something about the construction of this 9th floor corner room is not correct.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Really,It's was as expected. Awesome place to stay. Defently coming back. Kdj4if dixie. Inside the house and found out today that we can get together for almost two weeks ago and it was a pleasure speaking of which one is the one who is this and what,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great for the cost,Good price for the hotel and the area.  Clean room and decent breakfast given the times we live in.  Would like to see a more clear definition of room cleaning and the schedule during the covid times as the current is every three days stayed.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great place for a 5 day stay,"Our kids live nearby and it was a great place within walking distance to their apartments and local entertainment.  The room was very comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful.  They did have a breakfast option for $9 per couple (which would have been comped if we had booked through our Hyatt World membership - but we didn't because we used booking.com for all the hotels on the trip so it was easier to manage changes).   We didn't try the breakfast but it looked good.  The only downside was that every time we got on or off the elevator it smelled like someone had just smoked pot either in the halls or elevator.  We don't smoke pot so it wasn't particularly pleasant, but I get it - its legal there and it certainly wasn't the hotel's fault.  Self parking was $7 per night but that's consistent with most inner city hotels (actually not a bad rate) and we knew about it ahead of time so it wasn't a negative surprise.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Mini family vacation,"Went with 15 family members and we all enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Check in was fast and easy rooms were clean. Close to lots of restaurants our favorite was Bulls and Bush’s 5 minutes from hotel, we will definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Visit,Didn’t like being charged an early check in fee when I didn’t have a reservation and had no where to go. I had to check out a day early from the hotel I booked through indeed with. I’ve stayed with Hyatt many times. Very upset about this,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,3 Night stay,I booked this hotel based on the reviews of the property and the distance from family in the nearby Colfax district. Upon arrival had two very nice front desk clerks that made the check in extremely quick and easy. The room was very spacious and nice.  The bed comfortable. The pillows a little flat but I could deal with it. The lighting in the bathroom is a little dark. Although I'm not a fan about seeing every wrinkle on my face  I do need a bit more light to put on my makeup. I can't comment on the breakfast as we missed it all three days. On the first day my husband wasn't sure when it stopped and got down just a bit after 10 while they were cleaning up. He asked if it was ok to still get a coffee and a bit grudgingly the man let him have one. And I know due to covid that maid service is limited but we called down to ask for extra towels and told we couldn't have any more as we hadn't been there more than three days yet. A bit disappointing but all in all we still enjoyed our stay.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Road trip respite!,"This is one of the nicest and most stylish places I've stayed at in a very long time. I will absolutely stay here again when I am in Denver next. Very nice rooms, and convenient to the great food Denver has to offer. Cheers!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Terribly noisy,"This is not what I would expect from a Hyatt hotel. This hotel looks nice but it is cheap like a Days Inn. The walls are extremely thin and you can hear everything. At 11 pm the people in the room next to us arrived and we could hear everything they said including yelling at their kids. Kids running and jumping and banging doors around. We called the front desk twice. The front desk person was nice, but really couldn't do.much about it. If you want a nice place, then the cheap price of thos hotel should also tell you something. Not great for couples! Maybe noisy families. Also, this hotel is not by anything nice. There are fast food places around, but my overall impression of Cherry Creek is not good. I hate giving poor reviews but I am just very disappointed in this stay, especially since my sleep has been disturbed.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Needed safe space while receiving top dental care in Denver,"I left an air BnB situation and opted (for not much more money) to move for the majority of my stay in Denver into the Hyatt, where I felt safe, yet cared for by staff, from start to finish. That they offer breakfast during Covid restrictions, is great. I do hope however, that in the Hyatt (and other higher end hotels) offer in the not so distant future, healthier breakfast option, such as smoothies, juices or other ""hi-end"" liquid breakfasts. so that guests have the option to leave the premises in the morning feeling fortified by nutritional, not greasy carb-rich food (sausage, fried potatoes and scrambled eggs). My personal with any hotel stay is this:  That the Hyatt Hotel chain pioneer sensitivity to EMF- wifi sensitive people: That they allocate wifi free areas, a few rooms or one floor become available to EMF or Electro Hypersensitive Individuals. Everybody ought to get relieve from 24/7 exposure to man-made frequencies. Smoking became recognized as a health hazard. Wifi-free zones will be eventually a selling point for the Hospitality industry, and Hyatt could be a leader. Since windows cannot be opened, and limited green area is available, ""naturalizing"" man0made environments adds to Hotel Appeal. This Hyatt has nice wooden tables and chairs under shading trees in the traffic-free back area, that has good wifi connection. Locatd near the Cherry Creek park is a BIG PLUS. Its a fine place to be outdoors, the water is clean and great to wade in..... I watched the sun rise over the prairie horizon from m 7th floor huge window, and watched a sunset from the common area. I felt comfortable staying at the Cherry Creek Hyatt for 5 days (with a senior discount). Many restaurants nearby make it difficult to choose one. They are modestly prices, with healthful international cuisine.  One of the best Whole Foods is also in walking distance.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Large rooms, great in-room technology","Room was great, really spacious and lots of room to work. I liked the ability to Chromecast to the TV, allowed me to use my YouTubeTV without any extra hardware, it was like being at home. Shower and bathroom were pretty modern, fridge and sleeper couch were a bonus.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel!,"We stayed for an extended period of time and were delighted with our stay! Tony, David, and Carlos made our stay even better. This hotel fit all of our needs and is close to everything. Definitely give this hotel a try.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Right location and right price!,"Decent Hyatt in Cherry Creek. Great location to almost everything in Denver Metro. Large, clean, and comfy rooms. Friendly attentive staff. Breakfast needs work. Overall I would stay here again and rate it 4 out of 5.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Ok,"I know we are in a challenging times but one of the reason we picked this place was because of the morning breakfast. It wasn’t good, and the choices were too few. Everything else about the hotel was good.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good Stay,"Staff are wonderful, and I really appreciate the lowered rates during Covid, the hotel renovation is beautiful and I really enjoyed my stay. I would definitely recommend it to friends. Recommended Improvements: -instead of a hot breakfast not being offered due to covid, at least have a staff member handing out coffee and grab n go packages of fruit, yogurt and a muffin or granola bar at the very least. - AC in room is rather weak, thank goodness I had my small desktop USB fan on my nightstand to get me through. ACs at a motel6 are better than here. - A few furniture scratches could easily be touched up if maids carried the furniture scratch felt pen set easily obtained from the dollar store and included doing that when cleaning rooms. The room is in excellent shape except for the furniture scratches (large dresser mostly)-bathroom shower tile grout discolored and yellow stains on the ceiling, also there didn't appear to be a bathroom vent, the humidity was difficult to dissipate in a room with no opening window. -Maid chatter and knocking on doors was rather loud, I could hear them all the way down the hallway. There is one vent but it is dented and dusty and looks like the HVAC vent. -wifi didn't seem that compatible with apple, I had to restart my laptop every time I wanted to get online. -closet so a bit too small to use the luggage rack and open the suitcase in, could have easily been a bit deeper to not be cramped. -since there is already a nice granite shelf where the coffee maker goes, why not stock rooms with a small cheap microwave ($40 at walmart) in the same area? -toilet flush kind of weak, so usually need to flush twice for number 2. -half the guests were not wearing masks, so mandatory mask policy not being enforced. - my other hotel had the gym open and hot breakfast every morning during covid, so disappointed that these were closed here. - the pillows are on the soft side which means they lay too flat once the weight of your head bears down in it making me want my own pillow from home.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Terrible, No Covid Precautions","We have stayed here over the years and really like it. But now, it is terrible.We watched people walk into the hotel and get on elevators with no mask-walking in past front desk staff.I see recent tripadvisor reviews saying the same thing but obviously management doesnt care.Nothing special here-stay elsewhere for safety and health. If management doesn't care about covid precautions, imagine the result of their overall negligence of the hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,3 Nights in Denver,"Staff was friendly and rooms were clean. The location was convenient but the surrounding area wasn’t very nice. They didn’t provide breakfast which should have been stated beforehand. We stayed at two other Hyatts previously in the week and both provided a to-go breakfast. Also, masks were apparently “required” yet almost every person I saw besides the staff was not wearing one inside the hotel. I won’t be returning to this Hyatt.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great stay, but no food available on site.","Very clean and staff was extremely helpful. Be aware, as of this review there is no food available on site due to COVID19 adjustments to service.  You will need to get breakfast elsewhere. Nothing was open within walking distance on the dates of my stay, was glad I had packed a protein bar. Coffee maker and supplies are in room (even during COVID 19 adjustments), so that was helpful. I was very grateful to be able to travel at all, and this place was great!BE AWARE > walls are EXCEPTIONALLY thin!! There were no issues for me as far as sleeping was concerned, neighboring guests were pretty quiet. However, the next morning my neighbor was conversing with her new employer, and I heard every.single.word. ""I have an apartment lined up, and they are giving me a $750 discount for the first month. I should be able to get wifi setup in the next day or so - will I be able to just continue working from home then?"" (silence as employer spoke....) ""Okay then, that sounds good. I need to checkout and will touch base with you again later today. Thank you!""  If she had been reading her credit card number or her social security number, I would have easily been able to capture her info. Consider asking for a room that does not adjoin other guests, if you have any privacy concerns at all.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Unsafe,"There were dogs barking inside the hotel and no answer at the front desk when we called. When we went to the lobby to address the situation, the manager asked our room number in front of multiple other guests. This is a safety issue and not acceptable. We’ll never stay here again.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent and Safe Place,"This hotel takes all the right steps to care for their guests during this difficult time. (You’d think all major hotel chains would do the same but, believe me, they don’t.) And they are friendly, too. Room prices, good parking, safe and thoughtful practices, and customer appreciation—all excellent here. Thank you, Hyatt Place. I’ll stay with you again!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very helpful people,"They were hugely accommodating when we needed to cancel a prepaid second night stay due to coronavirus cancellations. Friendly, prompt, professional, modeling integrity and quality care for their guests. I highly recommend Hyatts for any travel.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very nice clean hotel just outside of downtown Denver,"The hotel is very clean and the front desk staff are great.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Stay,"My stay here was a last-minute decision driven by bad weather and the need to get to an early-morning meeting close by. It was great and met all of my needs. Clean and quiet hotel. Professional staff. Convenient location. Parking was $7, which seemed odd given that there was a huge lot, and they don't give you a parking pass for your car. The bikes at the gym were not terrific, but at least they were functioning. I would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice stay,"Searched google for Hyatt, found Hyatt Place. Good rate displayed was at Hyatt site, better than front desk.

She was never informed that the prices were wrong. When I heard about it I called and the manager said that she did not care and would not honor their listed price.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Just ok,"- reservation was messed up and had guest service come by telling me I should have checked out earlier in the day at 8pm the first night I was there-checked out and back in the next morning as I was told to do and the situation would be rectified -at noon while I was working in my room the next day, housekeeping came by and asked me why I was still here. I called the front desk and they assured me it was fine-went down to the beautiful bar area to finish working and get a bite to eat at 12:30 pm. No one behind the bar, sat for 10 minutes and asked a maintenance man if someone was working. He grabbed one of the ladies from the front desk and she came over. I asked to order a drink and a burger thinking it would be quick and I could get on my way. She told me her coworker was on break and it would be at least 15-20 minutes before I would get helped.-the beds are comfy, pillows are bad-eggs and oatmeal were cold, but they had a nice selection of fresh fruit and yogurt..... I wouldn't pay for it.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,The Hotel is Meh.,"The hotel had a weird smell. The website said that the breakfast was free but upon check in, I was informed it was not.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Poor hospitality and front desk service.,"This establishment could not get it right.  My business office prepaid with a cresit card authorization form that Hyatt provided.  I arrive and they had no record of the transaction. Now my office does 30 + of these a year so this is not their first rodeo.  I put the 3 night stay on my personal credit card and ask that they look into what happened. My office follows up and stated that Hyatt had sent her the wrong form.  They send her the right form which she promptly fills out and returns.  I went to the front xesk and they still can't seem to figure this out.  I give them a physical copy and email them an electronic copy. Two days later when I check out there is my credit card on the receipt.  I am rushing out to catch a flight out of Denver and they stated that don't worry we will take care of it.  They never did and when I called Hunter, the manager, he said we'll take care of it and that was the last I heard from him.  Quite honestly the hotel was overpriced for the amenities that were offered. No pool,  breakfast was underwhelming and the service sucked.  Shame.  Ruined what was a great business trip.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Return to Denver,Wish they had a fireplace but is located near alot of store and businesses easy I  and out. Would stay again.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A nice surprise,"Close to the Cherry Creek shopping and dining, this hotel was a pleasant surprise.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Avoid this hotel.,"Location and local transportation options were totally wrong according to hotel website. Not within walking distance to anything. Bar in lobby was inadequately stocked, bar restaurant ran out of a majority of food for 2 days.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great location, everything of the highest quality","the usual excellence one expects with a Hyatt property--good location, clean rooms, excellent fitness center, excellent breakfast buffet. Be warned--as of November 1, breakfast will only be free for Hyatt members, which is a sham.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Denver,You will never go wrong at Hyatt! So clean and modern and the smell when you walk in the lobby is true to every Hyatt. I take a deep breath and instantly relax! They have the kindest staff members of any hotel I have stayed at.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great for long term stay,I am staying here for a business seminar. Cherry creek is a nice location and the neighborhoods are great to explore. I enjoy the varieties and good quality of breakfast. Room are clean and spacious. Minus 1 for no free water and no late checkout.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good but fragrant,"There was an overwhelming odor of some sort of cleaner/deodorizer in my room that literally gave me a headache. Otherwise, would have been an excellent stay. Good location, friendly staff. I didn't try the breakfast.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very unfriendly breakfast crew,"The stay was nice. But it was ruined by the experience at breakfast. Granted that we entered for breakfast about 15-20 mins before the closing time. But they could have been a little bit friendly and courteous. On the contrary, their hospitality was so bad. They visibly showed their frustration, did not answer any questions and if they did, ever so curtly, took away the fruit tray, almost when we were about to pick some fruits. It felt like unwelcome guests and ruined our mood for an otherwise beautiful Denver trip",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place Cherry Creek - the Apple of my eye,"Super clean, quiet, and very accommodating.  Hyatt Place Cherry Creek offered a cheery warmth and a relaxed environment conducive to a worry-not stay.  It's plunked in a less-hectic part of Denver, but is certainly not rural in nature.  Its wide and bright windows, especially prominent in the dining area, open to pleasant views.One thing I loathe about the public areas of hotels is the prevalence of blaring TV's (CNN especially awful).  There are a few, but these are placed well to allow avoidance without bother.  The background music is also just right.. at a level where even if the artist and genre would be annoying, you won't notice.Key features are the condition of the hotel and staff.  Both are impeccable.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Review of Hyatt Place in Denver/Cherry Creek,"Stayed here before and quality of service and accommodations was as good this time as last.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel,"Great hotel. Excellent service. Great location.  Many food options available within walking distance.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice stay.,"Unfortunately I was only there for one night but the hotel (lobby area) was very nice and clean. The front desk staff was very friendly and informative. The room was very clean, and the hotel is located in a great area. I was traveling with my family (6) and we fit very comfortably in one room. I will definitely be coming back when I'm in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very good!,"Cleaned, closed to airport, big rooms, rich breakfast this hotel is a great option if you are stopping before leaving for a Colorado trip or coming back before leaving. It’s not romantic and not so close to Downtow, but is close to Cherry Creek area (a shopping district and food area you don’t wanna miss).If you are planning a visit to town hurry up on week ends is often fully booked. Staff very kind.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Gordon review,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at your property.  Location great. Staff very friendly and helpful.  Would definitely stay again for future travels to the Denver area.  The room was clean as a pin.  We loved it.Mark and Karen Gordon,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great Place, Rooms, Location, Staff, Coffee SUCKS!","Best Part of Denver to be in is near Cherry Creek which is where this property is.  Everything was great except the coffee but they hear this from me every trip--we stay all over the country in Hyatt Places,  but we are also coffee snobs and the coffee they serve at breakfast is like lightly flavored water.  We go out for real coffee after breakfast which is also really good.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Will be coming back!,"I stayed at this Hyatt for two nights during a business trip.  Everything was great: the room, breakfast, drinks before dinner.  The room was very comfortable: very clean with a small sitting area and a refrigerator that actually got COLD :-)  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice Place,"The service from the front desk was  good, as expected.  The room was laid out nice, with plenty of plugs for electronics and chargers.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Dog Friendly and convenient to DU,"Spacious rooms with comfortable beds. Although it seems like a busy are it is surprisingly quiet.  I noted multiple guests with four legged friends, so clearly pet friendly.  Convenient restaurants nearby and a short distance to University of Denver",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Recommend to others,"Centrally located to freeways, shopping and downtown.Very friendly staff Very good food selections and healthy alternativeswould have liked a shuttle service option but UBER and Lyft easy to arrange",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Employee,"First off I want to say that this hotel was really nice place to stay in and should definitely deserve a 4 to 5 star rating. The problem was an employer that went by the name of Thasha or something like that. She was very disrespectful to me and especially at the new employee, he had been working at the hotel for only a few days. She yelled at him because he didn't write down to add Coconut milk to the coffee. In a loud voice she told the new employee to be more careful taking orders because it gives her more work to do. Since she didn't know what milk to add she  just added normal milk to the coffee without even asking if it was fine. I think that if someone is new to the job you should help them and not yell at them for a mistake they make.Other than that when I asked her to make another coffee without milk because my friend was Allergic to dairy she started shaking her head, then she went to throw away the coffee with normal milk and literally threw the coffee in the trash and it made a pretty loud noise. She took like 5 minutes to make the other one, I don't know how it takes someone 5 minutes to make a coffee but that wasn't it. With the coffee, I also ordered an espresso, and by the time she finished making the coffee the espresso was really cold so I asked her to make me another one. When she heard me saying that she said in a sarcastic voice ""sure I will make you another one no problem"". Then she hysterically threw away the espresso and started talking to herself. When she gave me the new espresso I left and said nothing. All in all I hope one of the managers see this and do something about it because it was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Other that that I really enjoyed staying at this hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Stay,Front desk people were great.  They helped provide information about traveling downtown and around Denver. Staff serving breakfast worked hard to make good food and to keep tables clean. Workout facility was good.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A couple mistakes dictates a poor rating.,"The room was nice, clean and perfectly acceptable. Breakfast was good and added value to the room rate. However, the problems that we encountered are important for people to know. The second day we returned to the hotel after a long day's activities and our key wouldn't work. We went back down to the desk to remedy the situation and we learned that our room had been assigned to someone else who was given access with a key of their own to OUR ROOM! We were also told that the guests entered our room, found our belongings were there and then notified the front desk. We were offered an apology but that doesn't quite match the gravity of someone being given access to your belongings. We have no idea how long the guests were in our room and we don't know if anything was taken. In addition to this mistake, we also learned upon arrival that although they advertised free parking, it is in fact not free. We had two rooms booked and after a discussion, they assured us parking was removed from both rooms. However, after arriving home and looking at the emailed receipts, we were charged parking on the second room. These mistakes were made by two different people at the front desk. Again, I don't think an apology is enough.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Experience,Central location if not going downtown. Cherry creek is a nice location and the neighborhoods are great to explore. Great breakfast. Clean and spacious rooms. Free water. Minus 1 for no late checkout.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel,"We were very satisfied with everything during our stay. The hotel is conveniently located near several good restaurants and coffee shops. Plenty of parking. The breakfast was outstanding, with lots of fresh fruit and hot items. The staff focused on our needs and were very helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Outstanding Services!,"I am enjoying the hospitality of the services and the facility.  The staff are nice and friendly.  The location was perfect right in the heart of Denver.  Looking forward to my next trip to Denver, Colorado.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Dirty Room,"My wife and I recently stayed for one night after arriving at Denver International.  Upon walking in and setting our bags down we noticed that the bathroom had a long black hair on the counter in the bathroom. Then, looking closer, we noticed the floor of the bathroom and entry was covered in hair and clearly had not been cleaned. I then pulled back the sheets to make sure they had at least been changed. Having arrived after midnight and having a two hour time change, I was relieved to find they had been changed. On the plus side, our room was spacious, quiet and had a comfortable bed.  Breakfast offered many options, but the sausage gravy was cold and condiments were hard to find.FYI, about a $70.00 taxi ride from the airport.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great reasonable Denver hotel with fair prices.,"Be sure the front desk knows what a handicap room includes..16 inch toilet, roll in shower.  The hotel is very busy...thus, check in with correct room took much longer than normal. Once that was resolved after 6 pm, the hotel excelled my expectations wth wonderful fresh breakfast.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Outwardly, A Luxurious Look","When staying at this hotel years ago, this was a Lowes property and the experience was not a memorable.  I decided to stay at the property as a Hyatt due to a special rate.  The Good: Outwardly, this Hyatt has the same luxurious look.  Friendly and attentive desk attendants, Decent size room, Small but adequate LED TV.  The Bad: $7.00 per night parking charge! but no bellman, Poor mattress, Dim bathroom lighting, and Sandpaper texture towels.  My fault for not reading previous reviews.  Not Recommended. and again overall this was disappointing this was disappointing.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not up to Hyatt standards on this trip,"Typically staying at a Hyatt is a pleasure. This time, my stay was frustrating from registering to breakfast. I kept getting kicked off the ""robot"" for reservations, calling back and giving my information 3x before reaching a live person, who would not answer my question about a discount offered through the University. I have never paid for parking at a Hyatt before, but this time I paid $7, and had to lug my bags out again to a nearly empty parking lot without curb cuts to place a sign on my car. Even a Best Western just asks you for the license plate. I couldn't put my luggage in my room before doing this?? Notably, the person in front of me who paid through a third party web service did not have to pay for parking. Breakfast was available for me as a member, but no one shared that breakfast didn't begin until 7, far past the time I would have to leave for a conference. My bathroom and shower were not up to cleanliness standards (hair and mildew in the grout). When I arrived in the lobby for breakfast near 6:30 am, employees were too busy (doing what in the empty lobby - I don't know) to greet me. Finally, Chuck offered to get me a banana (""whoops, we are out"") and then made me a prepackaged oatmeal at the ""24-7"" counter. Very nice of him. I turned in my key and no one said goodbye. I should have checked with the hotel about breakfast but the lack of customer service, ridiculous parking policy, cleanliness, and lack of basic greetings and partings is all on Hyatt.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not what I would expect from a Hyatt hotel,"Horrible pillows, no microwave, noisy bathroom fan that runs all the time and spotty wifi.  Room was clean and breakfast was very good.  Good shower and good sized bathroom. Good location near Cheery Creek.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Place to Stay at Denver,"Very near to downtown. Botanical gardens.This hotel is situated where you can reach Garden of the Gods and Colorado University in 1 hours time. Cleanliness, support and breakfast are great.Good TV channels",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Outstanding Service,"Chandler was outstanding when we checked in.  We have visited this property 2 times when she has been so helpful and service oriented.  I would only expect this service at the 4 Seasons or the Ritz but I actually got this at a Hyatt Place!  We were upgraded to a suite once we found that the original room assigned was smokey.  Then after our stay, we realized that we forgot our hair dryer.  To our amazement, Chandler found it and made sure that it was returned to us overnight.  Just outstanding customer service that is rarely seen today.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Affordable hotel,The hotel is well too beautiful and affordable as it makes it seems unreal me and my friends were astonish by all we encounter also the rooms and services were amazing and we look forward in visiting soon thanks to security officer Mr victor for his hospitality.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice place on CO BLV,We stayed here in July and were very pleased with the accommodations and service.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel,"We stayed overnight to move my son into his apt around the corner the next day.  We were very impressed.  We drove across country and came in late and tired Derek at front desk was so accommodating and friendly.  Our room was much larger then expected, clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was fantastic.   We will definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Don't stay here if you think housekeeping should be included in your room rate,"We stayed eleven nights and only had acceptable housekeeping one night.  We had to call down every day to get something housekeeping had forgotten.  The management didn't care enough to return our two requusts for them to call. Finally, upon asking and asking, I did receive a call from the operations manager and he attempted to help. However, we continued to have very sloppy, inattentive housekeeping.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Lovely friendly hotel,We stayed here four nights. The hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent and served over a long period of time. We watched the tennis in the lounge area with coffee etc available throughout. This hotel has good rooms and a very nice public area. We thoroughly recommend this hotel. You can walk to Washington Park and Cherry Creek Mall from here.,4

Not far from Downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice Hotel with Great Staff!,"Loved the hotel, staff, food, and weight room! Everyone was accommodating and really looked out for you. My only complaint would be the beds in my room (which could just deal with my room only). The mattresses were lumpy and needed to be changed. Other than that, my experience overall was great!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Cherry Creek,Hotel was okay> Window keep on making LOUD noises day & night. Its weird and scary at the same time. Location if off  a bit. But its okay. No big deal. Room is much smaller then the pictures online. Area is okay.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Denver family visit,We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by friendly and courteous staff. Room was clean. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast was EXCELLENT! Did not like the surprise $7.00 per day parking fee. We should have been informed prior to check-in.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hotel Near Cherry Creek Area,"The room was clean, and the bed fairly comfortable.  The bathroom was also clean but the shower head was rickety and did not disperse the water in a uniform way.  Overall, it was nice enough but the parking is not free! They charged us $7.00 for parking - which seemed rather ridiculous since this hotel is located in a suburb area and had plenty of parking.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,1st visit to Denver,My stay at the Hyatt Place was truly the best experience from checking in to getting recommendations for food to a late check out.  The staff was wonderful and helpful for my first visit to Denver.  Would stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,great spot,"This is a nice hotel in a great location.  the drive there off the interstate went thru a lovely neighborhood.  Great restaurants nearby.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice and New,"Everything about the room, bed, bathroom and appliances was either new or felt/looked like new. If we go back to Denver next summer we will stay here and recommend that all of the softball families stay here as well.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,We are puzzled,"We have stayed here many times as our son attends University near by. There is always something going on from computer issues at the front desk to paving the parking lot (and doing a poor job of letting guests know), makes no difference if you check-in on the app (they still ask for all the details) BUT dogs stay for no extra charge and they love my dog! Comfortable bed. Love the spaciousness of the room.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Cherry Creek,Nice hotel  with good service We arrived a bit early and was glad when we were able to get our room right away as we had been up since 4amWe had a light lunch at the bar when we arrived We shared the flatbread pizza it was Very goodIt had prosciutto on it.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Another great stay!,"I love this hotel. It’s a great place to stay. Clean, quiet room. Good breakfast. The location can’t be beat. Easy access to/from I-25, just south of downtown Plenty of good to eat within a few blocks. I can’t recommend it more highly.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very average hotel,Make sure to confirm that the room you requested is available by phone.  Having a confirmation does not guarantee that you will receive the room.   Bring your own entertainment.  Their cable provider sucks.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Mostly positive,"Good and clean. Great vacation. Some staff seemed a bit inexperienced. Items used in bathroom not replaced. A maintenance item was reported, but not fixed. Overall stay was positive, but seems like there is some transition going on.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Popping/Cracking weirdness,"This is a nice hotel, located very conviently in the center of Denver.  My room on the 6th floor had a very weird noise that woke me every morning.   It was a loud popping/cracking noise outside my East facing window.  It was like the steel in the building was settling.   Aside from this annoying problem, I enjoyed my stay. Excellent breakfast.  Good parking.  Lots of places nearby to eat.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Pleasant Nights Stay,I stayed here for one night whilst in between locations and was a bit dubious getting a 3 star hotel but it was actually a nice stayThe room was large and the bed was comfortable. It was clean and a simple bathroom. I didn’t have breakfast but there are some shops nearby if you need anything. When I checked out I had some free time and they kept my luggage safe for me until I returned. Not far from Cherry Creek Shopping Centre but get a taxi as looks a long walk. It was a nice hotel but is a little far from downtown for my liking but would still recommend this hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Don't stay next to fitness center,We had the misfortune of being next door to the fitness center. Weights dropping on the floor and treadmills running at all hours of the night and very early morning. Still giving stay a 4 because the rest of the hotel was nice.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Best Hyatt experience ever,"I’ve often stayed at Hyatt properties for work and pleasure. The Cherry Creek team was very helpful on several occasions. It may be that Denver people are just super nice, but there was a real willingness to create a great experience. We missed breakfast one morning and the kitchen staff made us a special plate. The lunch we ordered was very slow due to a new trainee learning the ropes. The front desk manager remade my meal and didn’t charge. I needed help with a legal document that was printed for me and scanned. Late checkout extended to 1pm for me. Thank you for a wonderful customer experience. FYI, the Expedia price was $100 cheaper a night than what Hyatt reservations offered me.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice property,We stayed here while attending a wedding. The room was large and quiet. The bed was comfortable and the room had nice amenities. The breakfast was very good. We got the room at a discounted rate because of the wedding but would not stay after because it was too expensive otherwise.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Step up from a normal business hotel,Great location in Cherry Creek Rooms are large & functional.Staff are friendly & Helpful.Breakfast free for World of Hyatt members and it’s actually really good.No add on hotel fees and lots of free parking available.Gym is small but Cherry Hill Athletic Club near by it you need more.FYI only odd floors have ice,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,3 day stay,"Room was clean and was well maintained.  Other than a offering a poor breakfast, hotel lacked amenities. Lobby area was ok.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Good but not great, and problems.","When room was not cleaned and we were told a manager was not on site, we were told we'd get a discount but it never came. Need better management with helpful people on site. Breakfast is offered but not served late enough. Coffee is watery and weak.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Excellent, affordable place to stay. Highly recommend.","We have stayed in this Hyatt twice now and every time have been very happy with the experience. The complimentary breakfast is very good, much better than most. There isn't a restaurant attached, but food is available at reasonable prices. If we did have any minor issues, they were taken care of immediately and with a smile.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Nice property, but beware of ELEVATOR ENTRAPMENT","I like this hotel - I have stayed here multiple times.  But this past Friday (May 31, 2019), I hopped on elevator #2 on the 10th floor, on my way to an appointment.  Elevator doors closed, but no downward movement.  I tried to open the doors back up - nope.  Tried pushing other floors - nope.  Ended up using the emergency call button to get some help.  Quite a long time later, I was finally freed by a couple of trucks' worth of the Denver Fire Department's fine firemen.    Later during my 4 day stay, a staff member told me that it has happened before - always that elevator.  How do they not get this fixed?!?   The hotel staff I came into contact with were quite pleasant, my room was very clean, parking is convenient and safe, etc.  But I can't recommend a hotel where there's a known problem with elevator entrapment that isn't addressed!  Luckily, I was alone in the stuck elevator - I'm not a particularly elevator phobic person, but many people are.  It would have been much worse for them.  Even without the fear factor, I was still late to my Friday morning.  I'm downrating the ""service"" metric, referring to whoever is responsible for ensuring functional elevator service.  In other respects, the service is absolutely fine.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Stay an Hyatt Cherry Creek,"Excellent facilities, friendly staff, excellent breakfast. We were in Denver for our grandson's graduation and stayed five days at Hyatt Place Denver Cherry Creek. We will stay there again after having a very good experience in this, our first, stay there.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good Hotel,My friends and I stayed here for 3 nights on a road trip. Checking in and out was super easy. We didn't have much contact with the staff as we didn't need it. The breakfast was pretty good the only thing I would complain about is the weak coffee. The hotel was very clean and our two queen bed room was great. We chose this place due to the location from downtown and the parking availability. I would come here again.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent 5 Night Stay,Larger than usual room - appeared to be recently updated  Good included breakfast.  Very clean with comfortable bed with good sized closet and plenty of drawer.  Important since we were there for 5 nights.  Would definitely stay here again when we come to Denver to visit family.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A Great place,The staff was exceptional in helping us get from the airport to the hotel since we lost are rental car. They were helpful in finding places to eat and shopping and just being nice to us. We had a great stay and would highly recommend this place,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Like the property, Really liked the staff","The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and everything worked as it was supposed to work.  Decor is modest but tasteful and it is worth it to get a room with a view.  Watching the sunset over the Rockies is something you have to see to believe.  Any real complaints I might have would be nit-picking.  Only tried the breakfast buffet (which was okay-not great but not bad) and the late night bar menu (the four cheese pizza was fantastic). The best part was the staff. From the young man who stapled my shirt cuff together when a button broke just as I'm leaving for a job interview to Derrick and his co-worker at the bar/front desk whose name I wish I could remember.  So, would I stay here again? Certainly!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel!,"Love this property. The employees are great and go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.   Breakfast is great, but make sure you book through their website to get free breakfast.    Also ask for an odd number floor (ice machines only on odd floors) and ask for a high floor with a mountain view!   Work out room clean and had great treadmills and bikes with the ""drone hikes"" so you are sight seeing while working out.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Recommend to stay!,"It was a great place to stay, great location, very friendly stuff- always ready to help and accommodate, great breakfast, rooms were clean. I will definitely consider to come again and recommend to my friends.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Fawlty Towers in the Mile-High City,"Where to start? How about the fact that the hotel's name appears atop a huge skyscraper that is in fact next door....and has nothing to do with the hotel, which occupies a distinctly less imposing building? That should have been our cue that we were entering a very strange place. Or how about the ""recycling"" system (in CO, of all places!)? Desk clerk told my husband he could schlep our two glass bottles way around the outside to a bin in the enclosed trash area.      As for the room: King mattress had a trough on one side. Bath design was horrendous: Clunky sliding glass door (someone's warped idea of artsiness) that slid shut on its own; sink with ill-fitted faucet that unavoidably splashed all over counter; lack of fan. When a bedside-light bulb burned out on the second of our three nights, desk clerk told us they didn't have another (we'd offered to change it ourselves) and actually said he would give us another room instead!  Burned-out bulb was not replaced until 24 hours later, after we made another request. That second night, ""room service"" was utterly unavailable; we were told the cook had not come in and the entire hotel (100+ rooms) was being managed by a staff of two! The following evening, we were able to order dinner, but 1) we had to fetch the food ourselves from downstairs, and 2) it was not cooked properly (our Beyond Burgers were nearly raw).      The two stars are for cleanliness and for an acceptable breakfast buffet. Needless to say, Never Again. For a few dollars more per night,we could have stayed in any number of hotels actually run by hospitality professionals. Hyatt's name has no business being attached to this joint.",2

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Best in Cherry Creek area,"If you're looking for a real nice, upscale, quiet, and well-darkened room, you cannot do better than the Hyatt (we call it the Darth Vader Hyatt, the reason becoming clear upon sighting it).  No worries about noisy folks upstairs or next door because it is well built sound-wise.  The window (which offers one of the best views of the Rockies in town) has a double-layered screen that makes the room virtually black, for perfect sleeping.  Best of all, the rooms are fitted with a little lounge area so you don't have to use the bed for reading or checking emails.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel for a short visit.,"Clean hotel.  Plenty of parking.  Breakfast is normally well stocked, but not this time......Short staffed?  Staff courteous.  Booked online AAA and received a good rate per night.  Hallway noise can be annoying.  No outside traffic noise.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,What a view!,"From my sixth floor room, I had a wonderful view of the city.  At night, especially, it was stunning.  From the other side, the mountains were in view.  The room was very quiet, even with a very loud party happening across the hall. The bed was very comfortable, the towels soft, and the couch provided a fine place for visitors to sit.  Breakfast was better than is typical, and there are some very nice nooks with comfortable chairs downstairs.  I will definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Denver visit,"I was in Denver for a meeting with a client, the hotel exceeded my expectations. I appreciated the 12:00 noon check out as it allowed me time to catch up on correspondence with clients before i headed out to fly home that afternoon,",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Eeekkk,Oh my.  They tried.  Not adequately staffed.  Rough night. The airvac  unit never cycled off.   I would travel all night to avoid sleeping overnight here again. To say it was a rough night is putting it very gently,2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Restaurant Non Existent the night I was there,"Went to the front desk.  Asked if there was room service.  There was none, but he handed me a HANDWRITTEN list of about 7 items that were available that evening.  Wish I had taken a picture.  Abbreviated items...not sure what the hell they were.  I sat at a table just going to order a burger.  Nobody came.  I left and went to find food outside the hotel.  Last thing I wanted to do after visiting with a relative in the hospital all day.  Big fail.  Definitely not as advertised on the website.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not enough people working their.,Breakfast service was messy.  Could not find a clean table.First day the room was not made when we returned at 2:30 from being gone for 6 hours.  had to call housekeeping. The whole hotel just did not feel very clean.,2

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wonderful hotel!,"Wonderful hotel with large, clean rooms.  Friendly reception staff and housekeeping.  Large common areas with a bar at night and a great selection of breakfast foods in the mornings.  Elevators are fast. Parking is convenient, free and abundant.  Only complaint is the pillows are VERY HARD!  Ask for the view of the front range mountains.Would definitely recommend this hotel and location.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel in a great spot!,"I stayed at this hotel for one night and it was a really great experience! The location is great, with a few restaurants close by but not too close to the city. We were on the 8th floor and the view was great. We had a little sectional in our room as well as a mini fridge. Breakfast was delicious and beds were comfy! What else could you want in a hotel?",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Value Close to Downtown,"This great hotel is located near downtown. Easy to find, with free self parking. Clean room, free breakfast.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Typical Hyatt Place,Second stop on a long road trip. Good location and all the usually Hyatt amenities. The breakfast was nice but nothing spectacular. Nice way to start a long day. Looks like this was another hotel that was converted into a Hyatt so it does not have the classic Hyatt Place feel.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wonderful stay for the price.,We had limited interaction with the staff and facilities as we were in later in the evening and out before breakfast.  The interaction we did have was friendly and efficient.  They checked us in quickly.  Our room was clean.  We were right next to the elevators and did not hear them once.  The sound quality was good and we slept well.  For the price and location this hotel can't be beat.  We will stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very bad experience,"this hotel is awful. first they made me wait 4 hours until my room was ready. second, the door to my room was broken and one day when I left the night I had to wait 30 minutes for them to be fixed and I could finally enter my room. Third, I left 4 pieces of laundry for them and they lost my clothes !! I do not recommend this hotel !!!",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good bye Hyatt,Rooms are nice - staff not so much.  Breakfast they serve is fair at best.  Every otger time I have stayed there breakfast was included so it is what it is.  But this time therevwasva charge and when they make you pay for it - not worth it at all.  To make a customer happy they weren't interested at all at waving their silly $9 fee.  That's the 2nd time I have had an issue there.   Not paying Hyatt prices to get 2nd rate motel service.  Good bye Hyatt.,1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Place,"When road-tripping, it is so good to find a hotel not far from the interstates that has great staff, rooms, etc.  This hotel has all of that, and we look forward to staying there, and we will again, for sure.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,OK hotel near Cherry Creek,"Pretty sterile, sort of in the middle of nowhere. Rooms were clean, but hotel lobby is minimally furnished. There is no food service in the hotel, only vending machines. Plenty of parking, but covered parking was a distance from the hotel. Clearly did not get the warm and fuzzies from this place, very stark.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Handy location,We had a great stay and staff were very friendly and helpful.  Don't know why the previous ratings are what they are.  I stay and Hyatt Places frequently and this property is very similar to the rest of them.  If you want fancy fancy stay at a Hyatt Regency.  If you want great value stay at a Hyatt Place.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Friendly, good price, nice breakfast.  All people all see","The staff at this hotel are especially friendly and helpful,.  Breakfast was very nice.  Staff were not familiar with the bar drinks, but did the best they could--everyone was good-natured, including the other guests.  Lovely stay.  I will book at this location for my next trip to Denver.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Worst stay I have ever had,"I was ignored when I came in to check in. I was the only one there standing waiting, but they didn't even make eye contact for a good 5 minutes. Which is awkward when you're standing there waiting to be check in. Ordered food from the hotel, it was just microwaved stuff. Better to just get mcdonalds. Breakfast was not good either, rubbery eggs and paper-thin bacon. I don't eat carbs so I cannot attest to the oatmeal or bread, I imagine it's what you would expect. I ordered uber eats for the rest of my stay. First night the room next to me had a screaming baby and I could not sleep, it was terrible. Walls are way to thin. Second night there was no hot water until around 8pm when I could finally take a shower, I wanted to be in bed early since I had an early training class in the morning but that couldn't happen with no hot water. All in all, I would never go back. However, rooms are nice and spacious, location is central to doing activities.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good but messing stuff,Need to provide breakfast betterAnd bring toilet paper when need and not let me pick it up my self it took 4 calls and I had to walk down to get it by self.Besides that I love the location and area it is in,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Better than last time, better than the Residence Inn","The room was clean and spacious. The people in the adjoining room, however, woke me up at 4:30a just by talking (not good insulation).  Breakfast was MUCH better than the last time I stayed here. One week earlier I stayed at the nearby Marriott, and had a bad experience for a more expensive room.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,This hotel is not the greatest,"Check in issues, things not working in our room, breakfast was not good & couldn't get a drink at the so called bar as the people working didn't know how to use the register! The rooms were clean, the bed was comfy, the location was ok.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Convenient Location - that is it,"Giving this a 3 because the location is convenient and rooms are clean & comfortable but thats about it. The food was awful. Noise levels were off the charts bad. I could hear my neighbors entire conversation & was lucky enough that they were young so they stayed up until 1 AM having a good time while I was trying to get some rest. Unless it was a last option for some reason, I would go somewhere else.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Pig slop served for breakfast,"Rarely have I been so disappointed with a hyatt property. The beds are hard and the breakfast is fit for feeding pigs, not humans. The strawberries were rotten (the trays were full but no one was touching them), the eggs were dry and tasteless preprocessed food / truly horrible. Most foods at 9.30 had empty serving bowls. The tables were full and those that were unoccupied (approximately 40%) were dirty. A staff finally came to bus the tables but wiping them down was NOT part of her cleaning process. The breakfast is just totally disgusting. We left with a banana and coffee. Nothing else was edible. The management should be ashamed.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great location,  perfect winter getaway.","I recently stayed for 5 nights, really enjoyed my stay.  The room was clean and comfortable with an extraordinary window view westward to the glorious Rocky Mountains.  Breakfast is pretty good, the gym is really only effective for cardio work (be careful with the altitude).Very attentive room service, much appreciated.   The hotel in just off of S. Colorado Blvd. where there all kinds of shops and restaurants.  And Cherry Creek is a nice part of the city, not too far from anywhere else in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great place to stay!,Hotel is clean and check in is quick.  Lots of parking and is in the heart of Cherry Creek. Breakfast was good each morning too! Get the Mountain View room if you can. It’s like a post card outside your window!,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Always our 1st choice!,"This property is our 1st choice when we stay over in the Denver area. Since finding this, we have stayed at this Hyatt for the last 3yrs for various events and occasions. The staff are fabulous, the rooms as well as the Hotel have always been clean. The breakfast is far above any other Brand I have encountered.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Large rooms,We enjoyed the spacious room and breakfast. The hotel was clean and everyone was so nice.  The lobby is very pretty and locations was good.  We wish it had a pool for the kids and wish it was within walking distance to shops.,5

I would definitely recommend !  Lots of hotels to choose from, but this hit the mark, and is minutes away from Cherry Creek Mall",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,The Best in Denver/Cherry Creek,"This is a first class hotel in the Denver area. I stayed in a room with two queen beds and the layout was great, with a separate sitting area and large bathroom. The room was clean and quiet. The price was fair for the area and very comparable to other hotels, yet the hotel is better than most.Front desk staff were very professional and friendly. The breakfast included has all types of food items.Although I didn't have my dog with me, this hotel is pet friendly so I will bring the dog on my next trip.Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great place to stay for business and leisure,"The Dart Vader hotel is great place to stay, very clean and comfortable, with a very kind staff. I stayed on January for a couple of weeks doing business and I wI’ll stay again in my next visit for sure",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great place to stay,"Everything was clean, the staff was nice, breakfast was great, and I was able to enjoy my stay.  Breakfast had a great variety of options.  I was also able to get my Starbucks coffee before heading out for the day.  Saved me an extra stop.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,The friendliest happiest staff,"From the time I entered this property, Brittani from the front desk had the biggest smile and welcoming tone. Never have I been at a hotel where every customer facing staff member was so happy and customer focused. It is extraordinary.  At the breakfast buffet, every server was attentive and always said good morning. You can tell when it is genuine versus obligatory. It was always genuine. Positive happy staff make your stay upbeat. The property was in a location suitable for my needs. If you are keen to save money and are fit, you can get to the hotel from Denver Airport for US$10.50 total. That is the price of the train from the airport to Union Station. From there you walk out to the street to catch the free mall bus down to Glenarm Street (which the hotel is on but 2 blocks down). The breakfast included for members was comprehensive. I totally appreciated the Gluten free bread and dairy free milk (photos attached). The reason for 4/5 stars was the pool was on the small side (not suitable for lap swimmers); I could not find a safe in the room for my passport/travel essentials; and I had an allergic reaction to something in the room. Apart from that, the staff are 5 stars. Breakfast 5 stars.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Comfortable,"We really liked the hotel. Easy parking, perfect if you have a student going to University of Denver. Located close to all the Cherry Creek stuff. Food was above average. Loved the monkey bread! A little pricey but worth it we thought.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent experience!,"5 Stars for Keven at front desk and for Jenny! 5 Stars for price, cleanliness, accommodations and staff. The bonus was that checkout was at noon (and not 10am)! We felt safe, welcomed and appreciated!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not a safe property!,"My vehicle was broken into overnight.  Despite being surrounded by lower-end apartments, this property has no security and no cameras.  I stayed here after skiing at Breckenridge; a guest reported the break-in, the staff failed to call the police or make a report.The front desk and operations manager showed no empathy and offered no assistance- ZERO HELP.  They didn't even offer to help clean up the mess.  Terrible service, unsafe location- not the qualities I look for in a hotel!",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Loved it!,"The best thing about this hotel is the neighborhood. Great place to walk and explore and go out to eat and just enjoy the clean, cool air! The hotel itself is clean and relatively new. The room was a good size and very comfortable. My only complaint was the bathroom wasn't really clean -- considering the quality of hotel I was really disappointed in the cleanliness of the bathroom and the less than clean furniture of the room overall. Despite these shortcomings, I would stay here again.Also worth mentioning is the breakfast buffet - fabulous!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Easy Peasy,"Location was convenient; close to highway, on a major street, close to food. But getting in and out to the main street was a little dicey. Hotel was nothing fancy, but it was clean and professional...everything you expect from a Hyatt.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent,"My wife and I loved our stay here (two nights over the new year, on Hyatt points). Things we liked:- The room (No. 321) was terrific. It was very large, with two queen beds, a corner sitting area, a work desk area and a little coffee worktop area. Two big windows with electric blinds and a rotating flat screen TV with chromecast. Bedroom and bathroom were clean, modern and stylish.- Receptionists were friendly, fast and helpful. Generous with a late checkout.- The breakfast/bar area was stylish and the breakfast (included) was of very high quality - lots of organic stuff, good bacon and eggs, mueslis, fresh berries etc. It was way above the normal quality of hotel breakfast food.- Free car parking.- Location turned out to be pretty good. We walked around the North Cherry Creek shopping and residential area, which is charming, and drove to the Botanic Garden, the Zoo and Wings The Rockies flight museum (all worth a visit). The hotel is not downtown, but we went downtown once for the NYE fireworks (took 15 or 20 minutes in the car,and had to pay $12 to park in a parking lot).Things we disliked:- Nothing at all. (Obviously, if you are planning to spend all your time in the downtown area then a downtown location would be more convenient, but beware high hotel parking charges.)This was one of our most enjoyable hotel stays in ages and we would definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Happy at Hyatt Placw,This hotel was very nice.  Our room was clean and quiet.   The breakfast each morning had a lot of choices.   It was very good.  The location was very convenient for us.   The staff was courteous and friendly.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Eat out, and don't leave items in your room","Room was fine. Breakfast was terrible. Left 2 clothing items in the closet, called later on our checkout day. Told to call in a couple of days when they would be ""in the inventory system"". On two days got no answer at the main number. Finally got someone and was told, ""your items were not found"". I left a Kindle in a Marriott room recently and it was promptly returned.",3

Then the man in the next room got on his phone and I could hear every word.  Not ok. Got redressed,  went down to the front desk.  The staff seemed unsurprised by my complaint (so why did they give me that room in the first place? ) but nicely reassigned me to an end room. Hmpf. But the breakfast was excellent.",3

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Best customer experience in a long time,"My stay was Dec 2018. There isn’t enough space to detail every example I can give you, but to summarize,  every single staff member, from the front desk to the managers, the young lady who serves and helps us at breakfast, and housekeeping manager... they were all extremely hospitable with cheerful attitude. I asked one of the managers “where in the world did you manage to find this staff“ because it wasn’t just one or two people altho I have to say Kevin really stood out… But everyone I encountered made me feel special. I rarely write reviews but my experience was extraordinary.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Wonderful Hotel, Nice Amenities","With the exception of a mix-up with the front desk host regarding difficulty finding my World of Hyatt membership number (a problem eventually rectified before I checked out), and a misunderstanding regarding a request for late check out, everything was great.  The room was modern with front facing hook ups for HDMI, USB and other connections, so we were able to hook up our laptop and watch Netflix from our personal account.  The TVs also come equipped with Chromecasts.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,I Will - I Will,"This location was very clean and open.  The reception area was easily identified.  The bar and breakfast area are together, so it was easy to locate and access.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  I sleep solid 4 of the 5 nights I was there (I never sleep through the night).  The ONLY criticism I have is that the front desk personnel could be more proactive is solving a problem.  I will stay at this location again.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Stay,"We always enjoy the Hyatt Place. From breakfast to the gym to the room and service.  All are great.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,deeply disappointed,"I have stayed here several times in the past few years and had good experiences but not this time!  The toilet had a large rust stain on the base, the side counter was chipped and crumbling all along the front edge and the vent cover of the furnace on the wall was covered with dirt.  The worst part however is that I mistakenly left my dance outfit hanging in the closet.  It was hanging in plain sight and I called aprox 12 hrs later to see about getting it back.  I was told (after 3 phone calls!) that they didn't have it.  I know it was there as I drove directly from hotel to home and realized what I had done immediately.  They have been very unhelpful.  No one has returned repeated calls from hotel.  I am a hyatt member and they haven't been helpful.  Rude, actually.  Very disappointed.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent facility,"This Hyatt Place is consistently a good place to stay.  The hotel is well maintained, well managed and serviced by an exceptionally friendly, customer oriented staff.  The breakfast and community room are top rate.  My family enjoys convening here for holidays.  The bedrooms need better soundproofing.  We would prefer a little more quiet.  Having said that, we will return next trip.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Worse customer care,One of the worst Hyatt's I've ever been to. Over the phone when I booked they promised they will take the Hyatt Gift card. But when I got there the receptionist said they won't accept gift card from Hyatt. Thia probably the only place that doesn't accept its own gift cards.,1

Distance wise, we were close to the church, to the place where she got her hair done and we had natural light coming in, making it easier for the photographer to take pictures.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Disappointing,"Was given a room by the exit which made for a very noisy stay. Sleep was disrupted in many occasions from purple going in and out.. also when I arrived the bathroom floor was dirty and the shower floor was scummy.. gross bathroom.. Prior visits to this hotel had been better.. the hotel looks a little run down could use a face lift.. staff was ok but not overly outgoing or friendly.. I did like the fact that they had small toiletries  for guests in case you forgot something. That service came in handy since I forgot to pack my hair spray.. the free breakfast was a nice added value can't tell you how good it was cause I slept in too late to take advantage of it..Improvements do need to be made to remain competitive: cleanliness, friendlier staff, preferential room selection for Hyatt members should be executed also a minor face lift would be beneficial for this location..",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A 4-Star Experience at a 3-Star Price,"Very nice, updated rooms with good towels. Friendly front desk people, great breakfast buffet with many  non-standard items. Mine did not come with the room but was a great deal at $9. Others got packages . I had a Senior rate.  Good after hours bar with tasty food to eat there or take to room.  Free parking and in great area if Denver. Best place I’ve stayed in for that rate in a long time, and that’s saying a lot. I’m retired now, but I used to be in a 75% travel job.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good experience. Highly recommend.,"If you want a good solid, friendly, clean experience for a good price, this is the place for you.

The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and comfortable.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Fantastic Hotel,"Fantastic hotel. Check-in/Check-out was efficient, and staff were kind and eager to help throughout our stay.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent value for trip to the Denver area,"I found the room to be spacious, comfortable and quiet and appreciated breakfast being included.  Overall, a great value for my money.  The only drawback was that, despite being only 5 miles from downtown Denver, the daily commute there took about a half hour.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Busy place, ""ok"" experience","This is your standard Hyatt Place on the inside, but not what you typically expect on the outside as it's hosted in a tall building - which makes it a bit hard to find, especially at night, driving on a GPS which leads you to another side of the building where offices entrance is. The room was pretty standard for Hyatt Places, with a mix of modern and outdated design. I think both the interior and exterior features of the hotel are a result of a takeover of another hotel (seriously doubt HP built this on purpose). The breakfast was sub-standard for Hyatt Places (at least the ones I've stayed in), unfortunately. Both in terms of variety and in terms of utensils.The hotel has a gym (a bit bigger than ""standard"" for Hyatt Places in terms of the number of cardio machines; they have a rack of dumbbells and a pulley system. All in decent shape.Staff was helpful.So, all in all, an ""ok"" experience. Could have given it a 4-star rating, had it been just a ""hotel"", but I know the general standard for HP, and this one is not exactly there - especially, for the price.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Room is gone,"This was a group reservation for us attending a convention. Checked in to the hotel and was told my room is ready only to find out a few minutes later, that it was gone and given away and they’re looking for a room for me. I’ve been waiting for quite sometime and still no room. This is unacceptable. If it’s a confirmed group reservation/booking, why give the room away? The people at the reception does not know how to communicate with their guests. With the manager who doesn’t stop and personally talk to the guest instead of the guest approaching her. Though she offered me a drink but I told her I need a bed. And with one of them blaming what the other person who supposedly gave me room away. As a guest, I don’t want to hear excuses, I want a resolution to the issue. This is a total inconvenience to any traveling guest.. 31 minutes later and still no resolution..",2

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent Service- Poor Quality Food,"If I visit Denver again I will likely look for a different hotel with a better quality mattress, fresh cooked breakfast (the eggs here are processed and tasteless), room service, and a real restaurant instead of a cafe with  mimimal fast food options. That being said the service was excellent including front desk and housekeeping. And the 24 hour fitness center was well equipped.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice place. ,If in the Denver/Cherry Creek area this is a great choice. Clean spacious rooms and if you get a Mountain View great scenery. Breakfast was free but sounds like that is changing soon. That would be the only downer.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,beautiful mountains,This hyatt is very clean and has some amazing views.  Has common areas that you can sit and enjoy visiting with family and friends while you stay at the hotel.  Nicely located near the Cherry Creek area,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice place to stay,"This was my first trip to Denver, and the hotel’s location seemed convenient to everywhere we needed to be...and you gotta love the free parking if you get a car, as we did. Note that it is not right in the Cherry Creek shopping area as the name implies, but is fairly close to it. Service was friendly. Room was clean and quiet. Nice to have a fridge in the room. Free breakfast was mediocre. Glad to have choices of hot food and not just pastries.Only thing we didn’t like was the bathroom. It was large enough, but not private enough for those sharing a room. It has a frosted glass door...and no exhaust fan...so noises travel, if you know what I mean. Not a huge issue but had to turn up the TV to mask sounds. All in all, we had a nice stay, though, and would consider staying here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Location to stay and have access to any points in the City!,"Samantha and Ally were great, and accommodated our special needs. Jesus switched out the shower head in our room, since we have a special one we use. Dog friendly with a small dog park! Breakfast and great coffee with specialty creamers. Large seating area.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Hotel is convenient, staff outstanding, bacon VERY greasy at breakfast.","This hotel was conveniently located for our trip to the Denver area and I really liked the ""points plus cash"" offer for our 2 nights spent there.  The room was okay but not as specious as many of the Hyatt Places I have stayed at in the past and the breakfast was fairly typical with nothing special or particularly noteworthy except for one very unpleasant surprise.  They offered very crisp bacon (an excellent thing) but presented it on the serving counter in a literal pool of grease!  This problem could have been easily avoided by simply draining the bacon before putting it out for the customers.  Consequently, I did not eat any of it as the grease made it look really awful!  On the very positive side, I attempted to pay for the ""cash"" portion of my stay with Hyatt gift cards.  For some reason, their system would not recognize the value of the cards and Ashley on the front desk had to call Hyatt customer service to attempt to have the problem remedied.  She was not successful in getting that done and I had to pay with a credit card, but she spent probably 30 minutes on the phone trying to get this resolved.  (I subsequently exchanged emails and phone calls with their national customer and reached a very amicable solution.)",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place Denver,"The bathroom shower needs to be updated, but the room was very comfortable and spacious.  The room was clean and had ample places to plug in chargers.  Lights were dim, but worked easily.  The door has a huge gap at the bottom.  I stuffed it with towels.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A lovely hotel with pleasant staff,“The hotel was lovely and staff were so friendly and helpful. The room was of adequate size with a big comfy bed and great clean bathroom facilities. The breakfast was plentiful with a good selection. The hotel was handy to downtown Denver. I wouldn't hesitate in staying here again if I returned to Denver.”,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Free Parking,I've visited Denver several times and stayed at Hyatt hotels.  I was happy to find one in a great location that offered free parking.  The area was also well lit.  They have a nice courtyard in the back to enjoy breakfast or whatever.  The staff was very helpful.  I did need to conduct some business over the weekend and used the business area to print off papers that the staff then faxed to the necessary contact.It's a tall building but we never waited long for the elevator.  They have a built in chrome casting option for the TV so my Netflix and other accounts were accessible without additional charges.  I will definitely be staying there again.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Motel 6 housekeeping for hyatt price.,"Pros: great location, great front desk staff, decent breakfast.Cons: Housekeeping staff does not follow the Standard Operating Procedures advertised by the hotel.I stayed at this hotel for a week and had multiple problems with the housekeeping staff. The worst issue I had was that the housekeepers left my room door propped open all day. While I was gone.   The one redeeming quality of this hotel is the front desk staff. They were all very helpful and polite, but one especially stood out. Since i always got back late, Chandler on the third shift helped sort out all of the issues I had. Her professionalism is really what made me rate this hotel as a 3 star instead of a 1 star.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,OVERALL STAY,"We would have enjoyed a pool,  Great friendly service location was close to many places to walk to within 1.2 mile to 1 miles there were so mnany places to visit.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Location worked great for our needs,Selected this location due to location.

Would stay here again if rates remain competitive.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Location and Spacious Rooms,"This hotel was close to downtown, Cherry Creek Center, restaurants, and attractions.  The rooms and bathrooms were very clean, comfortable, and quite spacious, with plenty of vanity space and storage.  The complimentary breakfast included a variety of hot and cold choices which changed daily.  The fitness center was convenient also.  There was ample parking; and the all staff members were friendly and helpful.  There was no swimming pool, but maybe that's typical for this part of the U.S.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Clean, relatively new, good breakfast options ","This was a pretty comfortable hotel in a great neighborhood. Clean and looked either newish or recently renovated. The sink in the bathroom could have been cleaner, and so could the furniture in the bedroom, but overall it was clean enough that I would stay here again and recommend it.The complimentary breakfast is very good for free breakfast fare.The location of the hotel is the best feature. The neighborhood is nice and there are several high end and excellent restaurants and shopping options within a 10 to 15 minute drive of the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good place to rest our heads ,We stayed here for one eve after we’d arrived late from LondonThe staff were polite and efficient and the room was just greatBreakfast was included which was more than substantial We felt the hotel was good value for money and we were even given free bottles of water on arrival,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,PLEASE READ,"Where do I start? First of all, whoever hired Ashley, the Hotel Supervisor, made a THE BEST DECISION! Keep reading, let me tell you why! After searching everywhere for a room near the Swedish Medical Hospital and coming up empty over and over again. I was finally able to book over the phone with Hyatt. I went to the Hyatt downtown Denver and was told I was at the wrong one (there is a lot, make sure you double check) and was sent to Hyatt Place on Cherry Creek. After the front desk staff looked up my name and told me that she didn’t see my name at this location either. I broke down in tears, my brother and I had been awake for over 24 hours after we received news that my Mom was Care Flighted to Denver with an Aneurysm! I was exhausted and overwhelmed to say the VERY LEAST. I apologized to the front desk and told her that it wasn’t her that was causing my tears. I walked outside to gather myself and get out of the way of the people behind me in line. My brother walked up (from parking the car) and saw me and of course was a bit angry for the run around we felt we were in. He walked to the front desk and talked to the Supervisor (unknowingly), Ashley. He explained the reason for our frustration and situation. And y’all, let me tell you, This sweet lady jumped at the chance to help us. We needed a place to lay our heads down immediately and she heard that! There were no rooms available for a One Bedroom, 2 bed (as it was only 10AM). She communicated with her staff and asked someone to clean the room we needed! AND lowered my original rate down. She saved me over $300!! NO JOKE! We were in a room in less than 30mins!! I can’t even tell you how much I needed this blessing. Ashley, thank you SOOO MUCH! You have no idea how much you blessed my trip!!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place an excellent place to stay,"We stayed at the Cherry Creek Hyatt Place to avoid the city hustle.  The staff was wonderful, and it was so centrally located.  We took a different day trip every day.  We used the light rail to go downtown and avoided the stress of city driving.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good Place BAD Check In Experience,Check In Staff ignored us for at least 10 minutes while she wonder around behind the desk. This is at 8:30pm on Wednesday night. No one else is checking in but this staff is super good of ignoring their guest. Check In Staff - I will give her below zero. I will give the Manager on Duty the next morning a 10+ rating as she was able to listened and promised to take action on what happened the night before,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Yes & no,"Room was lovely and spacious,  but the bed was very lumpy and felt like I was sleeping on rocks. The breakfast was wonderful and it was a delight that it was changed up so that we didn't have the same thing every morning. Housekeeping was quite persistent even when you requested not to be disturbed. (I was there for medical reasons.) My only serious complaint other than the bed was that although the facility calls itself a  nonsmoking hotel, the smoking site is right by the front door. I don't care if people smoke, but I am allergic to smoke and therefore had an asthma attack and ended up having to cancel an event I was hoping to attend. There is a door right outside the dining area that would seem to be an ideal location for smokers. Unfortunately, I will not be able to stay…",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Overall a nice spot,"The property is great, clean and well maintained. Staff was friendly enough and it's in a good location if you're not looking to stay in the city center. Free parking.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Enjoyed our stay,14 years ago when our son began his freshman year at Denver University we stayed at the Loews.  It closed and now the Hyatt has replaced it.  We were not disappointed and plan to return.  Nice clean room.  ,5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Delightful stay,"The position/ location of the front of the building is a little disconcerting... it faces a parking lot  after you enter from a main street .  Somewhat austere but inside is bright, clean, and well- maintained.  Room was great( king with sleeper sofa).  Bed was very comfortable. Shower was huge and modern. Only complaint... had to take the elevator to get ice....and no sign directing you where to find the ice machine .  Awesome breakfast buffet.... best ever!!  Free parking.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,No mountain view,"Views are super important to me. We paid extra to get a mountain view. The view was of the parking lot.  Not a mountain in sight.Also a lot of police cars around when we first arrived and it made me wonder what happened and if it was safe.  Staff didn't seem to know.Hotel's name indicates it is in Cherry Creek.  It is not, it is in Glendale. Not a very nice area.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Needs updating,"Definitely not the best Hyatt place I’ve stayed at. A positive is free parking.  When you check in, you are looking directly into the backside of the bar, it is not an appealing front desk.  The bathrooms need updating and the carpet on the halls is very weathered. For the number of hotels off of Colorado, this hotel was disappointment.",3

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Inconvenienced and terrible staff,"My friend and I got a pretty good deal booking our 3 night Denver trip through Expedia. My first impression of the hotel was meh... could be better could be worse. When we arrived, I realized that the hotel itself is not in Cherry Creek, but actually Glendale which is ridden with crime (just google it). The name of the hotel is deceptive because you think you are staying in a very desirable area but it's technically in a different part area. When we arrived to our hotel, the ladies at the front desk could not find our reservation and told us, ""we have no rooms available for your request"". I said, ""excuse me? I made this reservation in advance."" They said that because it was through a third party, they sometimes will oversell rooms and it happened to be ours they oversold. Ok, fine. Not happy with it, but I expect some sort of accommodation to be made. The front dest ladies said, ""we will give you a queen suite tonight and then tomorrow we will have a room open up that you originally wanted, and we will give you $20 off."" Ok fine. We should have walked away and gone somewhere else for not communicating with Expedia, and quite frankly it's not the guests' problem. So we decided to go for it and turned in our keys the next morning before we drove out to the Rockies for the day. The guy at the front desk said, ""leave your bags here and I will put them behind our staff doors and at noon, I will check in your belongings to your new room. Whenever you get back, show the front desk your ID and we will get you all checked in."" Cool. Easy enough, or at least I thought. Later on that evening, we got back to our hotel and they said, ""We don't have any suites available for your request tonight."" WHAT??? What do you mean?! That was the agreement. They couldn't even find a note by the other employee explaining the situation. To make matters worse, they couldn't find our bags. They searched around the hotel and came back 30 min later and said, ""your bags are back in your original room so go up there and get them and we will give you a different room."" Wow. Such incompetence I don't even know where to begin. They upgraded our room which was ok but they never offered to refund anything. At the very least, we should have only been charged for a 1 night stay. Nope. No apologies, nothing. This entire experience was extremely stressful and inconvenient. Now, onto the hotel experience itself: Like I've mentioned before, the hotel is in a sketchy area. The ""self parking"" lot was wide open and anyone could easily access it. There was no valet. No luggage carts available. The inside ""restaurant/bar area"" was an absolute joke. The free breakfast Buffett was actually disgusting: powdered eggs, dry French toast, bland cereal. The fruit was mediocre and the coffee was so bitter I couldn't even take more than a sip. The beds are so hard and uncomfortable it felt like I was sleeping on a brick. The shower and sink do not drain very well. The toilet was not clean. The walls are paper thin and I could hear parties going on down the hall from us. This place is anything but upscale. I felt like I was back in my college dormitory. This place claims to be a 4-star hotel but I have never experienced anything like this. I will never recommend a Hyatt Place hotel to any family or friends. WOW STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISASTROUS HOTEL WITH INCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT/EMPLOYEES.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Conveniently located,"We chose the hotel because of its close proximity to the University of Denver. The room was nice and clean, as well as the rest of the hotel. The check-in staff were helpful, but the whole process seemed excessively long.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Fantastic hotel, with one but.....","This is a lovely hotel with fantastic facilities, good staff and a good location.  For that reason is has got an excellent.  We could not fault the service across the board with all the employees we met courteous and friendly.  The room was well appointed and spacious and spotless.  The only but was on night two of our stay, when an ignorant female room occupant somewhere near where we were who insisted on a loud, drunken conversation about problems she was having with ‘Martin’ or someone similar.  This went on about other various subjects from about 2am to 3.30am and was clearly not not door.  So, not the hotels fault and arguably they would have sorted it if we had bothered to contact the desk.  So, for us, great place, just a shame you can’t pick your neighbours.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice and convenient,perfect for a business trip...good deal on the rate and service for the area it is in. breakfast is quality and has healthy options. the staff was friendly and welcomed me back every day.  very convenient location,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Perfect except the noises!,Great room and hotel!  Only issue was the paper thin walls.  We could hear next door’s phone conversation at 5am and kids playing in the hallway. The breakfast bar was really good!  Bacon was served two days in a row. The hotel is off Colorado Blvd so easy access to downtown and the highway system.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Enjoyable stay,From beginning to end our stay at the Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek was most enjoyable.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Rough Visit,"We had a horrible experience at our last stay at this hotel.  We typically stay twice a year and encourage our friends to stay, but we won't be doing that again.  First, the woman who checked us in was extremely unpleasant.  We had a handicapped room in between the fitness center and the elevator.  It was loud and busy.  We brought our dog and he was a mess from all of the craziness out in the hallway.  The breakfast was cold, the offerings were slim and it was crowded and dirty.  A minor thunderstorm blew through and the TV wouldn't work.  The only option was pay per view movies, which we can get at home for $1.00, for $20 per movie.  If I were paying $100 per night, I would have understood some of these issues but for $300 a night?  What a horrible experience!  We are supposed to come back and stay at the hotel in a few weeks and we are trying desperately to find an alternative.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Location and Staff,"I stayed for three nights at this hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Parking is free. It is not a long drive to downtown, depending on traffic. There are numerous places to eat in the area. The room was clean large, and quiet, but could use a little bit of touching-up. The bathroom was large, but the faucet issue that someone else mentioned was also present. The air-conditioning was very good, especially considering it was over 100 degrees outside. The included breakfast was not fancy, but good. I was happy with my stay here.",4

We stayed here 3 nights and would most likely stay here again if our preferred hotel were not available (it wasn't on this trip).",4

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Pleasant stay - clean rooms,We stayed here for only 1 night but our stay was pleasant.  The location is convenient if you are traveling to downtown Denver - only about a 10-15 minute drive to 16th Street Mall.  The staff was pleasant and accommodating.  The room was clean and we found everything in working order and to our satisfaction.  Additional perk is that the parking is free. Many downtown hotels charge $40-45 per night.We will definitively stay here again when in the area.,5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,No Complaints,"I have no real complaints about this place. I staid there for 3 nights during a recent family vacation.The room is comfortable. The bed was very good and the bathroom was clean. They sometimes seem to reduce the air-conditioning automatically at night but you can turn it back up.They offer a free buffet breakfast if you get up early enough for it. The breakfast is not spectacular but sufficient. It includes bagels, French toast, orange juice, milk, and cereal.The fitness center there is not very impressive. That is the only drawback that I saw. They have a few treadmills and bikes but no serious weight machines or weight training equipment. Another minor complaint is that they were holding some kind of rugby match down the street and there was some loud music coming from the event/stadium on the weekend.The location is also pretty good. It's not far from downtown Denver. There are a number of restaurants supermarkets and grocery stores in walking distance. So if this is the part of Denver you want to be in, it's a very decent place.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Decent stay,"We stayed at this hotel for an extended vacation and were overall pleased with our stay. The room was spacious, quiet, and clean.

The Cherry creek Hyatt is 8000 points per night which I used so the experience was totally free and look forward to 4 more free nights at the same location.Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff and given a nice clean fresh room. After a late dinner and drinks downtown we checked back in for the night and picked up a couple of large and scrumptious chocolate chip cooks at the hotel bar. The hotel location is perfect. We got into to town early, dropped the car off, got a loaner, went shopping at the Cherry Creek Mall, then checked into the hotel. The hotel is just a couple blocks from the Mercedes dealership/service center and the Mall is a couple of minutes away. The staff was extremely friendly and deserves special thanks.

We could not get chromecast ti work and we could not connect our ps4 system to the wifi so we couldn't watch our favorite shows since chromecast wouldn't work either. The movie we rented from the hotel on demand was 15 dollars more expensive then if we where at home and on top of that we couldn't turn the TV volume past 30  couldn't even hear the over priced movie.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Grad Denver,"Traveled to Denver and tried a Hyatt Place based on information about hotel. This was not a family friendly place. This is for business with no pool or spa, or kid amenities. Had to change rooms because tv, air conditioning and phone did not work. Second bad experience with Hyatt Place hotels in two weeks in different states.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very Nice Stay,"Hotel is in a nice location - easy to find nearby eating (walking distance or a short drive).  Except for the fact I like softer pillows, the room was great, stay was very enjoyable and staff members were most welcoming and professional.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Big rooms, modern looking, great views. Not the best staff.","Rooms and bar area were very nice, very clean. The elevators are very fast and in good .working order. Dissatisfied with the recommendations for restaurants, very impersonal  Was not impressed with the staffs attitude as they were not very helpful.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great value, lovely staff","RoomwS spacious & immaculate .. staff were all lovely young women who were genuinely friendly & helpful to this senior solo woman traveler .. great value for the money.. would stay again next trip, no qiestion",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Tired and Not Satisfied,"Hotel and food were nice, but the people in the room next to us were yelling and opening the room divider all night, and kept us up until about 3am. We had a 5 hour car ride with kids and, were picking up a new vehicle in Denver as well, and really needed the rest. when we told the front desk in the morning, they just said",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great experience,Staff was very pleasant and accomodating. Breakfast and snacks were very good. Snacks conveniently served 24/7. Room was clean and there were nice views of the mountains. I will definitely recommend and stay there again when in town.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Ok hotel, poor customer service",The hotel is a basic place to sleep. Nothing special. I was surprised that they don't even give you a bottle of water in the room. No pastries at breakfast either. Fruits so so. Most striking to me though was that the girls at the front desk seemed more interested in chatting with one another rather than dealing nicely with the guests. Not my kind of place.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Forget trying to have food or beverage at the bar/restaurant.,Hyatt needs to hire more staff to support the bar/restaurant. Service there was sub-par. I had to wait an inordinate amount of time to receive food or beverage as the front desk person was my server as well,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt in Glendale,"We have booked this Hyatt on multiple occasions while visiting family in the area. The hotel is clean, well kept, and pleasantly appointed. Breakfast is included and is a step up from other offerings in area. Pets are accepted but incur a $75 charge.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,College Visit,Would definitely return to the Hyatt Place. Clean and spacious rooms. Pillows were a bit hard but overall experience was very good. Morning breakfast was a nice treat. Perfect for visiting DU because of its location.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Stay away from the elevators.,"Elevators were loud. On the plus side - NO ODOR! I loved that. I didn't get sick from carpet powders or scented laundry.... That was a huge plus. Great location and nice staff. So overall, even though my sleeip wasn't 100% it was still pretty good.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Preferred over downtown,Located just south of Cherry Creek in a more commercial zone but easy access to Rt. 25 if heading out for day trips.  A quick Uber or Lyft to many fine places to dine in Cherry Creek or Denver proper.  A well maintained hotel with a convenient breakfast.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good But--,"I love to stay at this Hyatt Place, it  has always been consistently excellent.  it is clean, comfortable and surrounded by great eats.this time however i had two issues.  The exercise room was closed for renovations.  Had i known I would have stayed elsewhere. the substitute was a nearby gym but the logistics were complicated.  The other issue was breakfast--it was good but they kept running out of eggs and did not have any more to replenish. They substituted meat!  yuck.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Somewhat generic, but - good breakfast","Stayed one night in March and found this to be a decent place to stay that had recently been updated.  The mountain view was beautiful and the room was very comfortable and clean.  Parking was very convenient, and breakfast was better than the usual fare at this type of hotel; very fresh with great variety.  The only negative was that the hotel had very little personality, pretty typical of the Hyatt chain.  We would stay there again when visiting Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,overnights in Denver,"Like this central location for errands and appointments around Denver.  Rooms are very comfortable.  Breakfast has enough options to like yogurt, fruit, etc to satisfy my no gluten diet.   Price is usually much better than downtown hotels. Tip for manager - have your maintenance folks hold their subcontractor meetings somewhere other than in and around the bar & breakfast area.  Very annoying to hear about all the things being fixed while trying to enjoy our breakfast & read the morning paper.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Business Trip,"I flew in on Thursday the room was ready right at check in. The staff was friendly, approachable and helpful.  The room had a great view, was very clean and comfortable. The location was close to restaurants and other conveniences",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Decent clean hotel,"Overall, the hotel is very clean, staff are courteous, and it is in a good location. The breakfast buffet was ok, not anything to write home about.  But it was edible.  It would have been nice to have more yogurt choices.  The room was clean, and the bathroom appeared to have been recently updated.  My only problem was the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable for me.  So I slept terrible, I wouldn't call it the hotel's fault though.  Had the bed been more comfortable, I would definitely stay here again. One last note, we had a large group of family staying here.  We found out afterwards that we were quoted one price on the phone and charged another price at checkin.  THe front desk employees told us to call Hyatt to get the issue resolved.  I never heard from family members if they were able to get the price we were quoted.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nicely updated rooms,"Hotel was very clean and rooms were light an spacious.  The parking was a little too public for my tastes,  Close to a lot of restaurants and shopping.  Only drawback was thin walls, heard an entire family breakdown the last night. Good value for the money.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Peace of Mind,The best stay in the State of Colorado.  Very quiet and super clean.  Wonderful staff and great breakfast.  The only thing I would have like to see was beef or turkey bacon or sausage as well.  Will be staying again soon,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Very nice rooms, no character","I chose this hotel while we were visiting the university of Denver because it was fairly close, and a nice standard. Our room was comfortable, modern and well appointed. The woman who checked us in at 7:30 pm was in a bad mood and not friendly. I saw her the next morning and asked her if she had had any sleep. She said “a couple of hours”. No wonder she was in a bad mood!Note that the food at the hotel is not very good. The don’t have a proper kitchen as far as I could tell. Breakfast was included, which I appreciated, but was not great quality. They use those eggs that are pre-scrambled from a carton, but there was some fresh fruit and real oatmeal (not from a packet).",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Pretty Basic but Clean and Modern,"Stayed here for one night during a quick visit to Denver to look at colleges for my son. Not much to say about this hotel except that the rooms were clean, the service decent and the location pretty convenient for the University of Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Modern newer Hyatt place !,"Check in was fast and easy but I didn’t get the higher floor I requested even as a globalist . Front desk didn’t try to accommodate . Lost 1 star .Room is nice, clean and new. Bathroom deco modern , standing shower only no tub. Water pressure low and I hate the shower head .Bed is comfortable and decent .Got a fridge in the room and coffee maker.Plenty of free parking . Free breakfast , it’s the same things . A few restaurants around the hotel ,walking distance.  Walgreen and 7/11 across. Overall decent Hyatt place and yes I will stay here if price under $100. ** wall are kinda thin, I can hear next room talking on his phone . I can’t imagine late night action 🤣 ** so beware .",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,GM/Night Manager made it a great stay!,Room was great! Very modern with a beautiful bathroom. The lobby is nice to sit down and do work or grab something to eat. The night manager was very accommodating and helped us with our needs during the stay. The new General Manager is doing a great job and my group and I can tell she truly cares about her team and the Hyatt Place. Location is great as well with it being in a location that is near many places in Denver.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Okay hotel,We stayed here for one night and it was a very average hotel stay visit. Hotel does have free self parking which is great! Front desk agent when checking in was pretty unfriendly and not very helpful. Room was clean except for the window which was very dirty. View was of the parking lot so not very great. Free breakfast was average but definitely a nice feature. Only stayed for one night but definitely good hotel if you're travelling.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel!,"We acquired a corner room and was pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. I would recommend a room on the higher floor. Our check in was fast! We asked for extra towels and were impressed by how fast the towels were delivered to our room. The hotel has complimentary wifi, free parking and wifi. I was disappointed that the fitness facility was closed during the entirety of my stay. They offered free access to a facility that was several blocks away. Close to many great restaurants and Cherry Creek!!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Overall,"I chose this hotel because of the location, price and the fitness facility. The fitness facility was closed the 3 days we were there. They did give free access to a facility about 4 blocks away, but it was freezing outside and very inconvenient. Working out is a big party of my daily routine and very disappointed. Employees were very friendly and free breakfast was a plus. Will not stay her again because of my disappointment about the fitness facility.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great stay! ,"Checked in without hassle, and found our cozy room with king sized bed and couch space #on the 11th floor. Clean room. Very comfortable bed.  Room was quiet and dark. The morning breakfast spread is well - balanced with many choices.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great spot ,"Easy to get to off I-25 and Colorado Blvd. Parking was fine. Briana who checked us in could not have been more pleasant and professional. It’s worth asking for a mountain  view.   Clean, large room and WiFi was fine. Close to Denver University and Cherry Creek. Far enough off Colorado Blvd. Nice breakfast, starts at 7am on Sunday.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Disappointed ,"I was looking forward to staying at a Hyatt for a week. Was disappointed. In spite of other reviews I read here, our mattress in #410 was worthless. Hardly slept the first 2 nites. I complained and I believe they may have added a mattress topper; improved some. Pillows were hard like a blanket folded several times and put in a pillowcase. I asked the housekeeper for a softer pillow and she gave us one. Breakfast was poor. Bland (nearly cold) scrambled eggs, sausage links, cold waffles or cold pancakes or cold french toast. The dish of yogurt was good and I stuck with that. There is absolutely no ambiance in the bar area. It's right next to the check-in desk;  the same girls who check you in have to run around the corner and act as barmaids or chefs.  The whole eating area lacks any ambiance or appeal. We will not stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great area and hotel!,"This place is awesome.  Breakfast was okay, checking was quick, there was sufficient parking, rooms were clean, cleaning staff was great and the price point was really good.  The hotel was close to several businesses and restaurants.  I would suggest a room on a higher floor to get a look at the mountains on a clear day.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent hotel and service!,"We stayed for 8 nights, and found the hotel to be very good, with always friendly staff!The room was clean and very spacious, with a very comfortable king bed. Bathroom was also clean and big with an ample shower (no tub, which for us is perfect). There is a bar with some food and drinks, including Starbucks espresso drinks. The location is also very good, a 10-minute drive to the Cherry Creek commercial area.Above all, the entire staff was very friendly, and made you feel welcome at all times.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good value,"Stayed in suite for six days with family on a business/pleasure trip in advance of relocation. Good value for the money spent. The  suite was large and had all amenities that we required. the staff was very pleasant and we were greeted each time we arrived or departed. They responded promptly to any request we made. While previously living in Denver, I coordinated speaker visits for a business organization I was a member of and always used this hotel for our speakers.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,best bed ever,"I stayed in Denver for a tradeshow and was booked into this hotel, very satisfying experience... ! the breakfast was really good and varied, everything very clean and comfy. the best part was the huge and super cosy bed though, so nice to lay down on it that I didn't even mind the jetlag not letting me sleep ;) generally the room was huge and very well equipped. one slight downside was the quite boring area and the gym being out of order but I suppose that will be fixed soon. The staff was really nice as well, especially Utum at the front desk!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Excellent value, location and service!","I absolutely LOVED this hotel stay! The hotel is close to downtown, Cherry Creek mall and expressways. The value you get from this hotel is exceptional.The staff, including the GM, were extremely nice, attentive and remembered us by name. Anytime I am back in the area, I will be staying at this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel,Clean and friendly with nice decor. Great location for downtown activities and free parking. Large suites with spacious sitting area and frig. So convenient to have a real coffee shop in the lobby. Highly recommended.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great Hotel, Nice Staff, Clean and spacious rooms!","Was in town for a short business trip close to the hotel.  This location offers easy parking, and it's close to Cherry Creek shopping area.   Spacious, clean and well appointed rooms with comfortable beds.  The staff at the hotel was very friendly and welcoming.  Standard breakfast was convenient.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Comfortable and Well-Priced,"This is the second time we’ve stayed here. The room is very comfortable. We especially liked the “L” shaped sofa - great for watching tv. The free breakfast had a lot of good choices. Lighting was great. We liked that there was a mini fridge, would have been nice to also have a microwave,  it there is one is the breakfast area if it was needed.  Dry nice lobby area and business center. The area does look a bit more downscale than some of the other hotels closer to Cherry Creek drive,  but it was fine during the day. Not a place to walk around at night, but Colorado Blvd is a very busy street, not for walking at night. There is a Barnes and Noble and Starbucks that is close by plus several national casual dining chains so it is fine. ",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Skip it,Don't go here unless you must. The walls are paper thin and the area is sketchy (stretch to call it Cherry Creek). I would have switched hotels but didn't have time. The staff is nice and it is well priced for a nice enough hotel but not worth the annoyances. ,2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Everything almost eggcellent,"Great value for the hotel. The staff was outstanding. Only problem was breakfast. Actually, the problem was the eggs. Everything else was acceptable to good. The workout room was temporarily closed but weather was warm enough to run outside. ",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Exceptional customer service with comfortable, quiet rooms","Great customer service. Clean comfortable and quiet rooms. The only downside is they might use down pillows, which I'm allergic to. Didn't have a chance but worth looking into if you have the same allergy.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,I loved these room designs!,"So, I love the room designs with the corner pull out sofa in the room. The couch material is horrible, but easier for cleaning and upkeep. The rooms were very affordable. The beds were comfortable which is a top priority for me. The rooms also seemed very sound proof. I have trouble sleeping and blocking out sounds and I had a very restful few nights here! I loved that it actually had a very comfortably sized sitting room without the suite price (It was not a suite since it is all in one room, but very functional). There was a very good sized closed and a lot of drawer space. I am guessing a lot of people don't unpack anymore...but I do, and I love when there are actually decent places to put things. I also liked the fact that it was not another $25 to $75 for parking. There is a very convenient large lot right on the premises. There is a little bar/restaurant area that I did not take advantage of. Burgers were pre cooked and had to be cooked to Medium Well...which is not a good burger to me. That turned me away from trying anything so I can't comment. I did see someone with a Caesar Salad that looked vey good. I did not have a menu in my room, so I have no idea what all was on the menu. The overall experience was very good at this location. A great price for what you receive!!A few things I did not like (which will not affect most people)...I did not like the move to stall showers only. I also wish they would have had their little convenience store with snacks and things that many of the Hyatt's have. And if you have a pet there is not a great area to get out and walk...there could be...but it is not taken care of. There is no good grass space on the property...but right outside the parking area there were a good few blocks of grassy area. But it was so covered with dog poop I could not stand to even be in the area. It is not their responsibility since it is off the property...but it would be nice to walk a block in either direction without being overwhelmed with dog poop (or of course have a decent area on the property). But with that being said...I really like when hotels allow dogs!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Comfortable and Convenient,"Hyatt Place Cherry Creek is a very comfortable hotel with easy access to many stores in the surrounding area. It is located off a major thoroughfare, Colorado St, but very quiet despite all the traffic. The rooms are spacious with a large sitting area and comfortable sofa. The hotel offers all the standard amenities. Breakfast is included in the price of the room and is above average with cooked-to-order available. The variety is very good as is the quality. The lobby is attractive and staff very efficient. Nothing at all to complain about and lots to be satisfied with! The pricing for the Christmas holidays was extremely competitive and better than other surrounding hotles where we stayed at in years past - the Hilton Garden Inn and Hampton Inn.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great value in Denver,"Outstanding value - great looking and well-maintained hotel in Denver, easy 10 min drive to City Park (Denver Science Museum and Zoo), only 15 min from downtown.  Good restaurants nearby.  Great breakfast.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,dont stay here until they adress safety and food issues,"take your life in your own hands.  scary to ride on elevators, food quality that is lower than what we serve our veterans on active duty on deployment (i would know) and towels that are more related to sandpaper than cloth.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Value for the price!,We have stayed in the Hyatt Place at Cherry Creek several times over the last month.  It is a great value for the price.  They have a nice breakfast buffet and a mini cafe with food / room service available.  It is located in a great part of town.  Their tv’s have free chrome cast that can play video/Netflix off your phone/tablet.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Mountain View,"We recently stayed at the Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek for a weekend trip to visit our daughter and son-in-law.  We booked the hotel through hotels.com and requested a King room with a sofa bed as we had three adults.  Our room turned out to be just that, which we appreciated.  The sofa bed was a sectional with a pull-out.  Our son was very comfortable.  Our king bed was firm and comfortable, could have used more pillows, but we slept well.  The room was clean, we had a small coffee maker and fridge.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Bad experience at Hyatt,I believe I have stated all my concerns and dissatisfaction in several places of this survey. How many times do I need to I need to reiterate this point???  My concern was the poor service at the breakfast and the very wet carpet in the room!,2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great service and hip vibe,"Loved the staff, the bed, the location, the first floor seating area, and free business center. The cleaning staff members were warm and responsive to special requests. I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very lovely stay at Hyatt Place. T room was very comfortable. Worth mention werethe comfortable lounging sofa and,Worth mention were the fine bedding and comfortable lounging sofa in our room. The bathroom was spacious and clean. We particularly enjoyed the hitel's comolimentart breakfast served in a space off the lobby. Attentive staff further enhanced our time at the hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Room was fine, breakfast disappointing","Breakfast was disappointing, 5 mornings of dry scrambled eggs (powdered?). No donuts, muffins or danish. Nice bowl of berries two mornings but some were frozen solid. I had to add hot water to make them edible. French toast was mistaken for buttered bread by some. Still, breakfast was acceptable but dull. Breakfast area tables need leveling. Room was fine though the bathroom door needed adjustment from the start. TV and HVAC worked well, very comfortable bed",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Slim Pickings,"Gone are the days when the Hyatt was considered a top shelf hotel. This branch of the Hyatt is particularly disappointing with the minimal amenities, unforgivingly low water pressure, and lukewarm water. Excellent customer service from a select few of the front desk staff, but all that is subpar FAR outweighs.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A Happy Return to a Nice Hotel,"I first stayed here in August 2017, and returned about 90 days later.  In my first review I noted the worn and peeling black painted sidewalk out front...and now it's painted!  Nicely done.As always, plenty of ample free parking close to the hotel, most of it well-lighted.  I noticed an disabled and abandoned car in the lot.  It had been marked, but if I were running the hotel I'd be a lot more aggressive in getting rid of such distractions.I asked for a high room in a corner, and got just that.  The best rooms are the ""corner rooms,"" as they are at the very end of the corridor, so you have an outside wall and only one room wall.  Also, the corner rooms face the mountains (additional cost).  Ask for a -02 or -20 numbered room to get a corner room.  The -20 rooms are better as they are at the south end of the hotel and offer a bigger, more expansive view over the -02 rooms, as these are close to the Hyatt Place office tower, which does block some of that mountain view you're paying extra for.In my room the lamp over the shower was inoperable.  Nope, didn't call it in.  Also, the chrome structure of the shower enclosure had a huge number of fingerprints on it--it seems as if this is not on the cleaning checklist.  It should be.  There was some minor peeling of the wallpaper in the corners of the bathroom, nothing major.  The shower selector needs a bit of tuning, as it would only shut off if the valve handle were moved to just the right position.The room was clean and well laid out, with a sleeper sofa in front of the window.  The A/C was responsive and quick.TV was a nice big LG model, with capability to stream various apps from your phone to the TV.Hotel wifi was not very good.  I don't know if this is a function of being in a corner room, of being on the top floor, whatever, but it was very slow and very spotty.  At least it was free.Bottom line: this is a handy place to stay when visiting, so I'll likely be back.  The hotel is run well, with only minor problems observed during this stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Surpassed our expectation,"This hotel surpassed our expectations. Very clean, friendly staff and we loved our suite.  Since we traveled with a young child there was plenty of room for him to run around in the room and I did not feel that typical ""hotel claustrophobia"" due to small rooms. The highlight of the hotel is the breakfast. I was surprised with the variety and quality of ingredients (including Organic!).  The location was great too, close to several amenities in Cherry Creek and not far from downtown by car. We also did plenty of day trips to the surrounding mountains and attractions and the hotel was close  enough to the highways to access places outside of Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Beautiful - Good Service - Good Location ,I️ stayed here for a one night business trip.  My flight was late and I️ arrived at 1:00 AM.  Tony was there waiting to help me out.The room was beautifully decorated and clean.  The king bed was very comfortable.  The location is walking distance to everything you need.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,College Trip,"The hotel is new and very comfortable and clean, nice location.  We had a quiet nights sleep.  The staff was great!

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great service,We spend a week at the Hyatt Place in Cherry Creek.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Service and Facilities,"Hyatt Place Denver /Cherry Creek impressed this road warrior with the hospitality of it's staff and fabulous large and tranquil rooms.

Same thing on returning from the long days,  nice to feel you are appreciated as a customer",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice enough hotel.,"Lobby area, elevator area and food area needs to be cleaner. The room was comfortable, quiet and clean.  Good location.  Good staff.Very convenient to Cherry Creek shopping. Good value.  Staff was friendly and helpful.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good value but really only a step above a basic hotel,"We were a couple traveling with our teenager so a queen suite was a great value because there were 2 connected rooms so we each had our own space. The room was very clean, but certainly not plussed out in any way. We had an upper floor with a view toward the city. I was told are no queen suites with mountain views. We never ate breakfast but it looked fairly nice with hot foods like eggs as well as yogurt, cereal etc. Free parking also great. You can't really walk to anything around there as it is on a busy street but there is a Whole Foods very close where we grabbed a light lunch. It's a good location for visiting University of Denver, just a 10-15 min drive. The fitness room is very basic but open 24/7. I'd stay here again if I needed to be in this location but probably only for that reason.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,under construction,"They will try to put you into a floor that is under construction with the dust and noise----Trash cans in lobby filled and overflowing and lots of dust/ Breakfast is usually good , but this visit nothing but basic eggs/sausage cold pancakes cereal",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very nice hotel,We stayed one night and had a room with a very comfortable king bed.  It was very clean and quiet which are my two standards for any hotel.  Staff was very helpful and accommodating.  I would highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not worth the money,"Terrible stay, we had to wait 30 minutes for our room and were attending a wedding once I arrived even though I used the online check in early process that I got emailed. Because our room was not ready, we were incredibly rushed to get to the wedding. When we got into our room, the sheets were damp, the tv didn’t work and we ordered room service to eat and had to go down to get it. When I am paying this much for a hotel especially for a wedding block, I would’ve expected much better than the service we got.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Value and Friendly Staff!,"We stayed 6 nights using Denver as a jumping off point for day trips in the area.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Just perfect,"This Hyatt Place is just perfect. Not to fussy, just right. Great location, great price and wonderful breakfast.  We asked for a high floor and got the top.  I would recommend asking for a mountain view, if possible. The view from that side is amazing. Just can't beat quality and great service in one.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Nice Hotel, Vegetarian Breakfast Only!",The hotel is nice but what a surprise to find out that the breakfast buffet included with the room is strictly vegetarian! No breakfast places within walking distance either except for a Mexican restaurant and a McDonald's.,2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Post Surgical Recovery,I had an extended stay at the Hyatt Place post surgery.  It was a wonderful experience....and a perfect place to recover! The atmosphere is very positive and upbeat.  Fabulous breakfast buffet ( which I could not enjoy!) except for hard boiled eggs.  Very pleasant and attractive in all ways!,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Surprisingly great place to stay,"The staff were  amazing. We stayed at the Four Seasons after we left the Hyatt. Their staff was not as friendly or helpful as the wonderful folks at the Hyatt. Their food and travel advise was perfect. When we returned, they asked us how it went. Very personable.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Best Breakfast Ever,We chose the Hyatt Place for a family reunion.  Our favorite place to gather in the morning before setting out for various activities was the restaurant where we enjoyed the fabulous breakfast buffet.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable with great walk-in showers.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,There is no airport transportation,"I travel a lot at the GSA rate, and this was absolutely one of the nicest places I've stayed in terms of quality of finishings.  However, they gave away my reserved king room while I was standing at the counter checking something on my phone (I ended up with two queens), and they do not have airport transportation (despite what it says here on TripAdvisor).  When I asked about getting to my flight, they offered ""to order a town car for $60"".  That's ridiculous, an UberX was $20. Also, if you're making your selection based on airport accessibility... Try again.    Finally, the neighborhood is technically in Denver, but not a walkable location.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hotel Satisfaction,"My wife and I travel extensively, as a retired couple, using Hilton, Marriott, and Hyatt when possible. This stay at this Hyatt, was as satisfying a stay as we have ever had. The hotel staff went way out of their way to satisfy our needs. Could not ask for any better. Location great. Thank you.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not a waffle maker in sight!,"Very nice hotel, it is larger than most Hyatt Place's I have stayed at in the past.  My only complaint is that the room we were in needed the wallpaper changed in a spot or two.  Breakfast was great, higher quality than most.  Fresh cooked french toast/pancakes & bacon as well as a nice continental area with fresh fruit, cottage cheese, yogurt, cereal and bread etc. with good quality juice, milk and almond milk.  Nice lobby and bar.  Very hard working friendly employees.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Another great stay!,"I would highly recommend this hotel.  It is close to all Denver has to offer, with great staff and beautiful, well maintained rooms. We have stayed here our last two trips and will chose it for our next visit as well.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great stay for business travel!,"The staff was so accommodating, and the room was very comfortable. I travel a lot for business, and this hotel stay was positively memorable. I could tell the team really cared about my stay, and I will be back if I'm in the Denver area again!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Our favorite in Denver,"We visit family often in Denver.   We usually do not like hotels, but this place is awesome.   Rooms are well sized and quiet, we sleep well here.  The staff is always very attentive, and we live the breakfast.   Our ""go to"" place",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good hotel for Denver,"This  place is centrally located, so it is easy to get to everything in the metro area from this hotel. The staff is amazing! The rooms are always clean and well organized with amazing views. The food is decent.   I highly recommend this hotel for anyone.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Stay.,"An eight day visit.  The staff was warm, the maid staff efficient, the rooms very nice, the morning breakfast varied but always good.  Staff provided great suggestions for food locations.  Wash and dry across the street was clean and well cared for, so if you are going to be staying awhile there is a good facility just across the street.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Highly Recommended,"I really like this hotel.  Excellent location, near all kinds of shopping and great restaurants.  Convenient to the Interstate.  Friendly staff.  Tons of parking.  I don't know why this insists on 200 characters; I said what I wanted to say.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Vacation spot,"Convenient place to stayFriendly staff the staff always welcomed us each time we returned. They could not do enough for us Way to goIncludes breakfast Close to I-25 which goes to Denver, Breckenridge, Vail",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Car broken into in parking lot.,"Hotel was decent for the price.  But after our car was broken into in the parking lot and we lost $1,200 worth of stuff, staff told us this had happened before.  If this was a known risk they should hire a security guard or at least give explicit warnings.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel except they don't tell you about pet fees.,"Lovely hotel, I brought my dog for my daughter for college. I made the reservation and contacted Hyatt. They told me it was taken care of. I checked in and no one said anything, we brought the dog in right in front of the staff and several times more when we took him outside. He only stayed less than 24 hours but the next day they called me and said that I neeeded to stop by the front desk. They acted like I was hiding a dog and when we discussed it, she found it on my reservation. I still had to sign a form stating I had to pay a $75 NON refundable fee for cleaning. This dog did not have any accidents in the room. It was a pug. I am just very upset that I did everything I was supposed to do to avoid being embarrassed by he way they treated me by thinking I was hiding a dog and this was done in front of other guests AND I still have to conversation between myself and the Hyatt staff I can show proof. It's a lovely hotel but I would check, double check and triple check about the pet fees because apparantly it is not stated on the app or when you tell them that you have a pet and neither does the front desk when you check in.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"So Clean, Great Breakfast","We stayed for 4 nights, and the staff was friendly, room was spotless, breakfast was wonderful. We ended up with a corner room with a mountain view, which was just lovely. The only odd thing was that the faucet was so far back on the counter that the water was less than an inch away from the sink. It was oddly annoying. Breakfast was complimentary, an open concept buffet with both Starbucks and Seattle's Best coffee. There were so many choices both hot and cold. Again, very clean dishes and tables. The hotel gave us a list of nearby restaurants that delivered as well. The snacks and drinks we purchased were a bit pricey, but that is to be expected with a hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Denver hyatt,"Nice Hyatt, with good price in Denver.  Very close to downtown without downtown prices.  Not too far from the airport and Shotgun Willies is right down the street.  That place is a real treasure in the neighborhood.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Quality option near University of Denver,"Some noise from adjoining rooms.  Breakfast was inferior compared to similar hotels by other brands (Courtyard by Marriott, Hampton Inn) Room had been recently updated in a tasteful manner, sofa was not terribly comfortable however sofa bed was very comfortable for sleeping.  Bathrooms have a sliding glass door which decreases privacy level.  All in all would I stay again but will continue to explore other options near DU.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A hidden gem near Cherry Creek and DU,"Casual and lovely, with modern vibes and the simplicity of the West. Liked our stay. With breakfast were better: our scrambled eggs were cold and hard as stone. Staff a bit too casual, and a shuttle would have been nice.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,So-So Quality/service,Not the best experience - stayed here on business. Loud party the first nite - no sleep. Walls of room unclean. Breakfast - not great - total carbs only. Did like the self-parking. Would think twice before staying here.,2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Watch out for intruders,"Had someone attempt to enter our room at 3pm. Went out to the hall to see after my wife screamed and nobody was to be seen out there. We had a do not disturb sign on our door and housekeeping had already come once so don't know why they would come again. Went to tell the staff and they said it wasn't house keeping but maybe maintenance. Strange that a staff member would try to enter the room and run away after they hear guests are in the room. Ended up talking to the manager who said oh it must have been housekeeping but he would not be able to find out who it was. This is a 4 star hotel and he doesn't know who is working what rooms and areas? He was very rude and said if we didn't feel safe why don't we just cancel our stay and go somewhere else. I told him I didn't think he was taking this serious and that I was going to leave a poor review which he responded ""You are going to leave a bad review anyway why would I do more"". What a joke- Jeff their GM made this experience horrible for my wife and I and could have done much more to make us feel better after our scary experience.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Best hotel for the price in Denver,"We stay here whenever we are in Denver.  It is a great value, with comfortable beds, plenty of room and a great lobby where guests can gather.  The breakfast is the best - many healthy choices.  The staff is very welcoming and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Purple Mountains Majesty,Wonderful quiet room with outstanding mountain vistas ( Room 814). Honestly I could have sat on my sofa gazing at the Rockies for hours. Hot breakfast a nice touch- standard fare but attractively presented. Front desk v helpful and pleasant. I was having a rough afternoon and Evanne comped me a Diet Coke and a Milky Way. So kind! Our room was immaculately cleaned each day. Gym pretty standard - my only gripe no pool or hot tub but seems like this place catered to business travelers.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great place in Denver,"Came to visit our daughter in Denver.  This was fairly close to her and we were highly satisfied all around with the property.  It was clean, well maintained and the staff was gracious and kind. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  Kudos to the leadership of this hotel they are empowering their employees to be awesome!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Clean, quiet, comfortable","The hotel was easy to find and away from the downtown activity. On site free parking was an added bonus. The staff,although short-handed at times were friendly and accommodating. Wide breakfast selection and all fresh. Fitness Center was ok - could use some mirrors and more equipment.  Only complaint was the quality of the towels in the room. Hyatt can do better.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Room smells like smoke/stale,"I checked in and the first room smelled like an old hotel room that someone had smoked in.  I asked for another room, possibly freshly remodeled, but the next room was the same.  I gave up and decided to provide this feedback.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,hotel didn't care,Reservation did not note hotel was under renovation. NOISY. Arrived late so was given accessible room. Shower (because there is no sill) leaked all over floor and into hallway causing me to slip and injure myself .Told hotel staff room was dangerous and I injured myself. They didn't care or offer anything. Checked out 2 days early.,1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Business meets family friendly ,"We stayed at this hotel for 9 nights. It was nice stay for the price/location. We had business in Cherry Creek so we picked this location.For a 9 day stay it was very comfortable both in room size and amenities. Love the easy access to the 25 and proximity to shopping and restaurants. I'm super picky when it comes to comfy beds, nice showers, and clean rooms and this hotel did it all. The breakfast was a huge pro. They even offered soy milk, almond milk, and both slim and whole milk. For me that's a big plus for my kiddo (he would actually eat breakfast). The buffet was refreshed and good variety (some sort of egg, a meat, and pancakes or waffles, bagels, breads, cereal, fruits, ect) Favs/Pro's:Free breakfast daily - variety2 free waters a dayFree parking Wine/small hotel bar in lobby Fast wi-fiOn demand moviesClean Workout roomCons: really in Glendale but a rocks throw to cherry creekNo laundry on site So why 4 stars and not 5 you ask. There was a clerk on the front desk and she was kinda rude and unpleasant. She wasn't there all the time and the other front desk guy made up for it.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Location Near Infinity Park,"The property is easy to find; it’s right next to one of the tallest buildings south of downtown Denver, right next to the big black skyscraper that says “Hyatt” on it.The front entrance needs some work, specifically cleaning and painting.  The ground surfaces are in need of steam-cleaning to get rid of gum and stains, and there are some stretches of painted sidewalk that either need to be stripped of paint or repainted, as they look pretty unkempt now.  This is a non-smoking hotel—nice—but there is a designated smoking area right there at the front door, complete with benches for smokers.  So, there is a lot of smoker trash about, despite the trash cans, the stench of smoker trash, and when smokers are out front, the very first impression of the property is the nicotine gauntlet to run just to get into the building—not nice.There is ample free parking close to the hotel, well-lit, and with a number of entrances to choose from.Check-in was easy and quick, with the reception desk literally right at the front door.  Elevators are responsive and quick.The room was very clean and tidy upon check-in, with the furniture and carpet in very good shape.  The shower outlet from the wall had been knocked from its mooring so rattled when touched, but everything was in working order, with good hot water and good shower pressure.  Note: there is a small foot step in the shower corner, but at only about 12” off the deck it is too low; recommend putting these at 24” to fully enable their utility.Housekeeping service after the first night was surprisingly bad.  I sleep with an extra, home-brought blanket, which had been balled up and put on the back of the sofa.  My son had folded up and stowed the hide-a-bed, but none of the bedding had been touched; it remained balled-up in a corner.  A small piece of paper on the floor—not put there as a test, but noticeable—remained on the floor.  A trash can I had moved for ease of use of the desk had been put right back in its original place.  That being said, the next day and the other two that followed showed much better attention to detail, so the first day’s service I agree to call an anomaly.The free breakfast is pretty good, with a good selection of options.  The eggs are good, but man, are they runny with excess water.  This is easy to fix, so recommend someone clue the chef in.  Also, please get larger plates.  The breakfast buffet plates are really quite small, only slightly larger than dessert plates.  I get it, this encourages less use and reduces waste, but is frustrating for guests.I recommend the Mountain View room, as the view really is worth it.  If going for this room, ask for a higher floor and a room number in the -20 range, as the north end of the hotel is blocked by the next-door Hyatt Tower, and the view is much better on the south end of the hotel.For quiet, ask for a room close to -20 as this will get you the farthest away from the elevator lobby.South Colorado Street is a block west, and there are tons of shopping and eating opportunities.  Cherry Creek Mall is only about two miles to the north.Bottom line: this is a nice hotel, in a good location, with some nice mountain views.  And check out Infinity Park, just two short blocks away, for excellent amateur and professional rugby.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very Accommodating!,"Very nice rooms, truly lovely staff!  When the front desk clerk learned it was our 20th anniversary, they brought us a tray with snacks, waters, fresh cupcakes and drink coupons.  Breakfast were fresh, hot, very nice.  Near to shopping, LoDo, zoo, museum, etc.  we WILL be back!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Cherry Creek, Denver Excellence",Excellent stay as always.  Always have a great stay   Near DU and all freeways.  Good Breakfast with variety.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Outstanding Staff,"The staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating.  Everyone I talked to was friendly, courteous, and inviting.  Every question I asked was answered promptly and helpfully.  Loved the hotel and its offerings and facilities, but the staff really made a hum-drum business trip a pleasure.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,I want to love this hotel but can't,"This hotel has so many good things: It's clean, modern furnishings, nice staff, no mold, clean sheets, nice bathrooms, great beds, above average sized rooms, nice showers, great location. So with all that said what could be wrong? PAPER THIN WALLS. I mean, I could hear the room next to me perfectly. I could hear them pulling the curtains, text tones, yawns, conversations about their entire day's plans.  My neighbors were not being loud or obnoxious, the walls are that thin. It's such a bummer. I've stayed here twice but I can't do it any longer. Not worth the Hyatt points. I need to sleep, be refreshed in the mornings for meetings.  I do not recommend this hotel if you want to be sure you get a good night's rest. I stayed for four night's each trip and will need to stay at another hotel next time.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice hotel but had a hard time sleeping,"Nice hotel.  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  The rooms were spacious, and the bathroom was recently updated.  The free breakfast was fairly average, although it was below my expectations compared to other Hyatt Place hotels.  My biggest complaint is that in the early morning, the window frame in our room started making creaking sounds, and when I went to try and figure out the source of the noise, I found the window frame hot to the touch.  I heard the sounds after being woken up from the noise of someone closing their hotel door early in the morning.  The sounds from the window were quiet enough that it probably wouldn't have woken me up; however, once I noticed it, it was sufficiently loud and irregular that I couldn't fall back asleep even though I'm generally a sound sleeper.  We were in a room on the tenth floor on the east side of the building, so the room gets a lot of morning sun which clearly gets absorbed by the black metal frame around the windows.  If I were staying here again, I'd choose a room on the west side of the building to avoid the morning sun and resulting noises.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great hotel, great price",This hotel was located in the Glendale/Cherry Creek area which was convenient for our stay near family.  The hotel room was very spacious and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast area and business center was very nice.  There were some renovations going on in the gym on the second floor but not work was being done during our stay.  Free parking and breakfast included. Great place for the price,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Staff,Staff was outstanding. Hotel was clean. Breakfast was okay didn't serve potatoes. Beer is way over priced. But because the staff was so good didn't care I still ate and bought Beers. We will stay again.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Pleasant,"A great location, pleasant staff. Nice and quiet room. We had the mountain view side. Great view. Overall clean pleasant and very close to many things. We were visiting our son who was about 10 min or less from this hotel. Loved the locality to all that we did",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Room was nice and large. Food was greAt.  Check in was very helpful.  Poor housekeeping and poor check out,Room was nice and large.  Food was great.  Food service excellent. Check in excellent.   House keeping poor. Check out poor.   Manager contacted and helped us so much and apologized for the poor housekeeping service,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"terrible customer service, room smelled so badly of cigarette smoke","Upon getting to our room at 6pm, I noticed our room smelled horribly of cigarette smoke. It was terrible. I called the desk immediate to let them know, and they said ""we will look into it"". We left, as the smell was unbearable and we didn't want to drink of smoke. So we left for dinner to kill some time. We came back at 9pm and asked the desk if they had an update. They had no clue what we were asking about. Finally we found someone who knew the situation, and she said they had no update just that they left notes to tell people to stop smoking. I asked if we can be relocated if it stinks, and she shrugged and said I'm not sure. The only room available is on the floor with construction. (Great options..noise or smoke). It's getting late, so we decide we better go up and finally unpack. But we walk into the room and it still smells! They clearly didn't handle the situation. Long story short I had to talk to someone else at the desk to beg to be moved. No one EVER apologized nor offered to upgrade our room or take a portion of the charge off. We spent $400 and had terrible customer service. I would never come back. They really should have offered to refund us or cut the bill in half - at least then we could come back and give the place a second chance.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Previous reviewers must have seen something completely different than I did,"I stayed for four nights while in town visiting family. The front desk staff is friendly and accommodating. I was given a room on the fourth floor. The room was clean, sitting area is nice. However, the walls are paper thin. I could hear the people in the room next to me unpacking, in the bathroom. The neighbors alarm clock was so loud that I thought it was my alarm. I asked for a different room and was moved to a corner room. No better. The beds are uncomfortable and the dresser drawers will not stay closed, which is not a big deal until you get up in the middle of the night and hit your hip on the open drawer on the way to the bathroom. Breakfast is decent and the free parking is a plus. Location is good. Candace, at the front desk, should win Employee of the Month. Not only did she address my concerns but I observed her attentively interacting with others staying at the hotel. There is no pool. The fitness center is small but the equipment is in good condition. This hotel is very pet friendly. Saw numerous dogs during my stay. I checked reviews before I booked this hotel and have to completely disagree with some of the previous comments.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Quietest Room In A Long Time,I stayed on the 7th floor facing east and had the most amazing quiet nights sleep.   The buffet breakfast was delicious and was head and shoulders above Hampton Inn.  Staff was very pleasant and helpful. The only negative was thr bathroom has a sliding glass door.  That means that if someone goes to the bathroom at night the light from there floods the rest of the room.  Also the glass door isn't very good as a sound barrier.  Besides that I would give this place very high marks and would stay again just for the quietness.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,very nice stay,"Hotel was very clean, fabulous, professional, efficient, friendly staff, terrific free breakfast.  Close to Cherry Creek mall and restaurants.  Close to downtown Denver.I would stay again.  All in all, I would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great location with comfortable rooms and better service.,"The location of this hotel is conveniently located within a few blocks to I-25 and a short 10 minute drive to Cherry Creek Mall, parks, grocery store and restaurants. The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious. The service of the staff is exceptional and the onsite breakfast bar, coffee and adult beverage bar are extra perks to staying here. Wifi was quick and reliable which is key for the business traveler.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wonderful 5 night stay,"All the staff -- kitchen, room cleaning, front desk -- very nice, very helpful and all seem happy to help. They seem to really want you to have a great stay. No one seems like they wish they didn't work there.  Mountain view room very worth the extra cost. Breakfast is absolutely wonderfully delicious and very helpful with our schedule (didn't have to find breakfast somewhere). The bed was extremely comfortable. Got 5 good nights of sleep. We would definitely stay there again.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Convenient location and pleasant stay,"Stayed there as a family for a couple of nights and had a nice stay.Easy to find from a distance. There is a large sign that you can see for miles. Parking is abundant and free. Wifi is adequate and was free as well.Room was large with the standard features. AC kept up with the heat and kept the room nice and cool. Breakfast was free and offered the usual options. I would get there early though to have options. The only downside was the construction on the second floor. Fortunately I saw a review plus heard someone complain when we checked in. While they are only remodeling during business hours, do you want to be awoken up that early? I would just ask for a higher room to solve the issue. We ended up on the 6th floor and heard nothing. Not sure how long this is going to be going on. The location was very nice and convenient to freeway access. I would definitely stay there again. Enjoy",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Comfortable stay, good location",Stayed here 2 nights with family. Having the sleeper sofa was nice to each have our own beds (3 total). The rooms were clean and beds comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was above average for hotel breakfast. We had a small issue with housekeeping- they came late in the afternoon and then we were told we had only until 4pm to have the room cleaned so we didn't get the room cleaned that day. Otherwise a nice stay. Staff was friendly and helpful. Location is close to many restaurants and attractions.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not what we look for in a Hyatt Place,Noisy outdated room. Not your typical hyatt place setup.  The neighbors bathroom slider door shook our bed wall when it was closed. Could hear all conversations in hall and adjoining rooms. Also couch had stains ans wallpaper in bathroom coming off. Wont be going back to this location.,2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice place to stay!,"Just stayed there. Hotel is nice, located not far from Cherry Creek Mall and also Univ of Denver.  The included breakfast is better than most with freshly prepared eggs and even a gluten free cereal.We had requested a room with 2 queen bed but they were all gone when we got there and they accommodated us with 2 adjoining rooms with King beds at no extra cost!The bathroom is spacious which was very nice (the last hotel we stayed at had a very small bathroom).",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Summer trip,Hotel was in a really good location not too far from the city and close to shopping mall and eating places to explore. Staying here made out trip very comfortable the rooms were clean and very roomy. Customer service was excellent.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Noisy but nice,Rooms were fine; bathroom needed sprucing. Hallway loud and noise traveled. Location was in middle of nowhere but fairly close to friends house. No room service was a bummer. Only one person working counter for check in and also doubling at the cafe. Wait was long.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good choice,Great location for nearby wedding.  Nice breakfast and friendly staff.  So many Hyatt's in same location led to coordination issues.  No local transport requires use of taxi/Uber for short trips.  Friendly staff.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Comparatively Good Value for Area - a time for school commencement,"We stayed here for six nights early June. Whilst the place shows some aging and the entrance road and landscaping could do with a redo, paying with taxes an average of $200/night elsewhere averaged $50 > 75 more. The staff demonstrated an eagerness to serve you well making up for its aging. Breakfasts, part of the room charge was quite well done and served in a spacious dining area with several TVs each a different channel (sound muted). The room was well planned and spacious with L shaped couch. We valued the black-out blinds on these hot summer days. AC was quiet and effective - some days reached 100 degrees F.Location to explore Denver and beyond was convenient, and especially the downtown Cherry Creek area about four blocks north and three west. West of this location is Washington Park well worth a walk about.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Awesome,"The most friendly personnel we ever encountered. Made us feel at home always with a smile in their faces. The facility was excellent and clean at extremely reasonable rate. Will stay there again, guaranteed.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Trip Advisor Advice,"When reviews are overwhelmingly positive I look at them with a jaundiced eye. The Hyatt, Cherry Creek, had high ratings, and, as our stay confirmed, deserve all the raves attributed to this hotel. My ""trick"", is to seek out all the negative ratings, and find out what the complaints involve. I could not find any issues on cleanliness (primary when I'm away from home), room size, room service, and location. We were initially greeted by Quael (forgive me if I spell the name wrong), who gave us a big smile, showed us the breakfast area, pointed out the bar, told us about the computer room, and generally gave us quite a thorough orientation. We found all the associates very friendly, and always ready to assist. The free breakfast buffet can compare with what you would get at a restaurant. Lots of variety, and fresh. I could go on forever with the praises for this hotel, but I will save myself some time, and refer you to the other reviews -- they're genuine. In the entire one week stay, I did not see or hear anything that would discourage me from booking with them again, and if my wife has anything to say about it, we will.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,NICE HOTEL BUT UNDER CONSTRUCTION!,Pros: Justin at the front desk was amazing - other staff as well were very accommodating and kind.Cons: No bellman -had a bad back - a struggle. Second floor is under construction so lots of hammering noises (exacerbated a bad headache). Asked for any room in the building where I would not hear the hammering and I was told there wasn't one. The travel agent that put me in this hotel said that there was no info about the construction on any website.They lock the volume on the TV to only 1/4 of the maximum volume so I couldn't even relax and watch the TV. Front desk said I would have to wait until the maintenance department could come the next day - chose to checkout instead!,2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great  Location,Staying at the Hyatt Place for ASSE convention.  Great place for business or pleasure.  Extremely accommodating staff.  I made a last minute request for a meeting room.  Sean Lorman (sales mgr) did a great job getting everything set up,4

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Our go-to DU hotel,"The rooms are clean, parking is free, hot breakfast is free, and the hotel is close to the University of Denver. We stayed again over graduation weekend, and despite the fact that the hotel was full, we had a great experience.",4

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Hotel!,"The staff was extremely friendly. They even asked us if we wanted to keep our bikes in their storage area since they did not have a bike rack. We thought our room was perfect. Breakfast was a little subpar for the Hyatt Place in comparison to alllll of the other ones we have stayed before, but truly that could have just been a menu issue of the morning. We still had breakfast and it was good enough.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Worst ""nice"" hotel ever.","This was the worst ""nice"" hotel and room I've stayed in ever.  The wifi network was unsecured (didn't require a password) which meant anyone sitting in the parking lot could log on and just steal guests information and sniff traffic all day long.  The coffee maker was missing the part that holds the grounds.  The room smelled like 10 years of cigarettes.  The shower I took was cold even though I ran the water for 10 minutes waiting for hot water.  The food was ""free"" but unedible.  Really poor experience.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Awesome place,"Have stayed here several times. Always wonderful! Clea, great service, good location, and breakfast in terrific. We travel to Denver several times a year and this is our go to hotel. The staff has always been friendly. The location is central to our needs.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,First time at a Hyatt Place,First class accommodations.  We spent 6 night there while we were attending my son's graduation.  We had some issues with the rates we were charged.  They worked with us to make it right.  We will for sure stay there again.  Great hotel,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wondferful STay,"This is a great hotel.  The staff is amazingly wonderful, the rooms clean and comfortable, and their Portabella Brie soup the best!  I highly recommend this hotel.  Even for a quick overnight stay, it is the best!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A Hyatt Place to Avoid,"This Hyatt Place needs so much help, hard to know where to begin.  Place needs a total upgrade, cleaning, spiffing, upgrading.  Breakfast of powdered scrambled egg buffet is poor, no cook to order breakfast, a very meager buffet.  Needs cleaning, and staff training.  Hyatt needs to apply some corporate QA/QC on this one.  Not living up to any minimum standards.  Then, to top it all off, they turned off the water FOR AN ENTIRE DAY, with little notice, and no compensation.  Don't worry, I flushed for the last time at 09:59!  Just made it.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Red Rocks Hotel of Choice,"We've stayed at this hotel twice, both times to go to Red Rocks. It's a great location with excellent views of the mountains. It appears there was a soccer tournament in town the weekend we stayed, so there were some kids on the loose. We had them mix a new drink at the bar upon our arrival after a long drive. They did a super job.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Unfortunately disappointing,Have stayed at Hyatt place several times. This was the worst. First night we had a lengthy smoke alarm scared triggered by a room smoker which no one told us what was going on. Both nights a knocking in the wall making weird noises in the room. Add to that noisy guests up and own the halls.  Will rethink whether I stay there again.,2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Fire alarm at 2:00 am,"The fire alarm sounded at 2:00 am and the hotel was irritated that I called the front desk to see what the problem was. Hyatt did not even apologize the next morning. If this would have been a fire, every one would have been at risk.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Just needs some finishing touches,"Had reservation switched with another guest which created confusion throughout our week stay. Did not get room requested because of it. Bring your own pillow if you want a reasonable comfortable rest. Pillows are like bricks. Rooms clean, and included morning breakfast is average. Location is a plus for this property. Close to Interstate, and Cherry Creek shopping. For families the zoo and museum close by, and about 20 minutes from downtown Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Pleasantly surprised,"We book at the last minute when we were originally booked at a place that we could not stay at once we walked through their doors.  This was our first visit to Colorado so had no idea of where we were actually staying.  We were so happy with this choice.  We were able to book at the last minute, do online early check-in and received a friendly greeting when we talked through the door.  Actually we were greeted each time we talked in.  The room was very clean and the bed was wonderful.  We were also able to obtain a late check out with no hassles.  You are about 20 minutes from downtown Denver, but this area is very nice.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Value,"The hotel was clean and new, the staff were courteous and helpful, and the location is a short car ride to the Cherry Creek district of Denver which is full of great restaurants, bars and shops.  Given all these things and the good value, I would definitely recommend the Hyatt.   And the beds were SUPER-comfy.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Clean and cheerful,"We booked this hotel, as most of Denver was sold out when we  visited.  We could not have been happier with our choice.  The hotel is in a great location, FREE parking, and a cheerful and very helpful front desk staff.  I haven't seen such friendly staff I think ever.  We enjoyed the bar for a quick cold one when we felt like it, and it had an excellent morning breakfast.  You could order meals into the night, you just had to go to lobby to pick it up.  Not a big deal.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  We got a King mountain view room, and it had a nice sitting area by the window.  Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Contemporary hotel with great customer service,"Hyatt Place is becoming our favorite US hotel brand.  The Cherry Creek Denver Hyatt Place is the best of the best.  The staff is enthusiastically committed to customer service.  They were competent, cheery and unusually motivated to see that our needs were met.  This hotel also has surprisingly good food.  We ate at the informal snack bar two nights because the options were so good.  The breakfast was also much better than the usual hotel fare.  The Contemporary feel of the place is also enhanced by how well maintained the facility is.  The rooms are super clean, modern and efficient.  We are definitely fans of the Hyatt Place concept.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Uncaring and poorly trained ed desk staff,"If you like rowdy, fist fights in the next room and don't care about your safety this is the place for you.

Needed help as I'm disabled and quickly called desk for assistance and they said oh, just use the elevators.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Service and ok location,I thought the rooms at this hotel were well maintained and spacious.  I also thought the pillows and bed were very comfortable.  The service at the front desk was great.  The breakfast was very busy and average.  The location is not far from a lot but seems like it is on the edge.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great location, friendly staff, spacious clean rooms","Wanted a hotel close to many different venues in Denver and the surrounding area without constant highway traffic noise, dust, etc. This fit the bill perfectly; close, but not too close to I25, and just off Colorado Blvd. Nice breakfast included in the room cost keep us up and at it without the frantic morning search for an early meal. My only complaint would be the very limited workout facility and lack of a swimming pool; otherwise a gem.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Clean hotel & great location,Very convenient location to Cherry Creek area.  Clean and fresh rooms.   The beds & pillow are extremely comfortable!!!

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Location,Excellent condition very modern and clean. Good comp breakfast in AM. All staff attentive and friendly.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Unpleased Platinum member!,"I was extremely unhappy with the maintenance and housekeeping of the bathroom. There are several areas near the left side of the shower door that are in need of tile replacement and chalking. These are areas that could create further issues of mold, and or water damage if not properly addressed. Additionally the right side of the sink floor was not clean. Once I returned to my room I went to get ice and the ice machine was not working..",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Passing Through Denver,I stayed one night here at the Hyatt Place with my daughter passing through Denver.  The location was convenient since it was a little outside downtown so there were no parking charges which was nice.  There are a couple places to grab a bite to eat that are close and it was very easy to catch a ride downtown from the hotel.  The staff was very friendly and really made us feel welcome.  The breakfast buffet in the morning was nice also.   The room was very quiet and we never heard any noise the night we stayed.  The fridge in the room was nice and the beds were great for a peaceful nights rest.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Better Choices in the Area,"I needed to be in Denver for meetings and my company's travel agent chose this hotel as a cost effective place to stay that was in close proximity to our meeting venue.  When I arrived, the people at the front desk were efficient, but seemed more interested in continuing their conversation than paying attention to me.  The room was nice enough.  The king size bed was reasonably comfortable.  The desk area was spacious and had enough electrical outlets for me to plug in my laptop and cell phone. The bathroom was a good size with a large walk in shower.  My issues began when I tried to adjust the temperature to make the room cooler.  I had put it down to 63 degrees figuring that would be enough to cool things off.  I went to sleep and woke up a couple of hours later because the…",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Lack of interest in guest experience,"I was saddened that although my husband and I stayed at the same hotel theee separate times in the same month, we were never thanked for returning.

Price was extremely reasonable at 99 per night with AAA discount. Requested room away from elevator when booking & since they did not block it out early in the day, we were upgraded to a suite when checking in - very impressed with the customer service!!  Would definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice twist on a Hyatt Place,"I've stayed in a lot of Hyatt Places. They are understandably all basically the same. It's generally a good hotel for a good price. This one, however, is inside of a 10 story high rise. We loved it. It was just a nice change. The lobby area was very functional, all in all we just liked the change in style. Unfortunately, no pool, and our room didn't face the mountains. Our stay was nice, no complaints. In fact, they allowed us to check in at 10am. Nice Place!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place Denver Review,"The Hyatt Place is an excellent, well priced hotel in the Cherry Creek (adjacent) area and especially convenient to the University of Denver.  I have stayed there multiple times and have been satisfied with the facility and staff.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,5 star service at 2 star price,"This is a fantastic and  inexpensive hotel. We are international 5 star hotel travelers that usually prefer Four Season and Aman to Hyatt brands....HOWEVER, this hotel, while commercial, has fantastic team of employees. The entire business model of this hotel is very new and consumer centric. while there is no mini bar in the room, the lobby has a bar and a large ""mini bar"" assortment of foods, including many hot dishes like pizza and burgers that are available for pick up 24/7. Rooms were basic, as expected, but very clean and comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A great place to stay,This is a wonderful place to stay in Denver.  Staff is very friendly and helpful .  Room are lovely - beds quite comfortable.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wedding anniversary trip,"Excellent hotel for location. Very accessible to downtown Denver and other areas of interest. Extremely clean, excellent view from the upper floors of the front range. Plenty of FREE parking for vehicles as compared to hotels in downtown Denver that charge up to $40.00 dollars per DAY!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A few things that could improve this Hotel,"Overall not a bad Hotel, rates are not too bad, but high taxes in this area can really add up for multiple day stays.The sign for the Hotel is in the wrong place, it directs you to an office building, I pointed this out in a previous review as did some other people. Rooms were clean and pretty quite, ask for a room to the east and the parking lot. Overall common areas need to be upgraded.I found the breakfast area to be quite crowded, food that was supposed to be hot was not.I have my room type set for the top floor, but the person that checked me in said they were all not available. Same staff as my previous stay, really pretty cold and not helpful. They need more training in in how to handle customers.In my stays as a Diamond Member, I was never offered a suite upgrade, I wonder what they will do for me as a Globalist.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt,"The rooms were clean, most of the staff were friendly, breakfast was great, and the cleaning staff was amazing. The hotel was easy to find. We experience a peaceful night for a Saint Patrick's day weekend. The bed was firm but it was not an issue.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice hotel,"We stayed one night.  We choose the Hyatt Place because of the location.  It was close to an event we were attending at  the Soiled Dove Underground and close to Cherry Creek.  For what our needs were it worked very well.  Check in was smooth and our room was very comfortable.  It did have extra room for a desk and couch as well as a king sized bed.  The bath room was nice sized and clean.  The only downside is that the bathroom was a shower only. ( I guess it really is not a bathroom then, is it? )  My wife prefers a tub to a shower. We did not stay long enough to check out any of the amenities or the food, so we cannot speak to that part of the hotel.  However, as I said, the room was very nice and a great value and the staff was efficient and pleasant.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great value for hotel within 15 minutes from downtown,"Hyatt Place offers a great value for travelers who wish to be relatively near downtown but are on a budget.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Terrific Value near DU,"The hotel is really close to the University of Denver so it was perfect for parents weekend.  The inclusive breakfast and free parking are an added bonus!  although they do not have room service, they do have an add day menu where you can order and pick it up yourself.  The chinese restaurant across the street is delicious and the Walgreen's at the corner is so convenient.  Great location!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Beds are hard as concrete,"Very nice hotel with great people, great service, clean rooms but the beds and pillows are hard as concrete. It's great if you like a very hard bed. It is also inconvenient that you can not add your bartender and waiter tips to the tab. I was informed the tips must be paid in cash separate from the bill - what is this all about? it is a complete pain in the neck and is destroying you employee moral. They are quite embarrassed by this policy.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Denver business frip,Enjoy staying at the Denver HIIT price structure is good night because his good meals and food are good. Also enjoy the convenience of the highway in the malls. Should I drive to work in the mornings place It's clean staff is friendly.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A Welcome Surprise in Glendale/Cherry Creek,"I normally don't review limited service hotels but Hyatt Place Cherry Creek is an exceptional limited service property.  It is well located just off Colorado Blvd in Glendale, 3 minutes from the shops and restaurants of Cherry Creek and an equal distance from I-25.  There are two supermarkets and a Whole Foods close by.To start with, this property used to be a luxury hotel called The Georgio six or seven years ago.  That means that the construction quality of the building is first-rate...more importantly, the heating and cooling system is a real, honest-to-goodness first class hotel system, not those annoying, noisy ""through the wall"" units that other Hyatt Place/Hyatt House properties use.  The rooms are spacious and well designed; suites are especially well designed and provide a huge amount of space (although they are only available with two queen beds).  The only negative aspect to the rooms are that this property does not have a seperate sink/microwave area as other Hyatt Places do.  They have a few microwave ovens to lend out, and all of the rooms have refrigerators so it isn't likely to be a major inconvenience.Complimentary breakfast each day is fresh and plentiful, (although it almost never changes so repeat guests might get a bit bored).  There is a huge seating area and even when the hotel is busy (not that often) it doesn't feel cramped.  Rates are comparable to other properties in the area but I often feel you get more with this property than you do with its limited service competitors.By far the best aspect of this property is the staff...very friendly, personable and professional.  Ask them for anything, and they will handle it.  Overall, the best choice in this area of Glendale.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Good location, good value","First off, contrary to what the Hyatt's website description states, a little vaguely, this hotel is NOT ""nestled"" in Cherry Creek. Cherry Creek North is a lovely section of Denver filled with shops and restaurants a short drive away (traffic on Colorado, however, can be daunting). It is just off S. Colorado Blvd. in a fairly built-up area filled with strip shopping centers. It's also quite close to I-25 so easy access to that. The rooms are nice, but as other reviewers have noted, somewhat lacking in certain aspects (NEtraveler96's description is spot on). We used to live in Cherry Creek, so this hotel is a great way to go back to the hood without spending a fortune.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good Value,"Good value, clean, nice breakfast. Staff was ok. Rooms were large and very clean, beds are very comfy and I am pretty tough to please so that means a lot! Unfortunately I didn't have time to check out if there was a pool or gym but I will return to this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Exceptional Hotel,My stay was exceptional!  From the serenely decorated room to the food and beverages available all the time to the staff who acted as if they genuinely cared about me.  I don't think I've ever felt so well-cared-for.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,NOT A SAFE HOTEL!!  Room broken into,My room was broken into and personal items stolen.  Shared with the front desk along with pictures of the damage to the door frame and asked if the GM would call me.   The GM never called or made any attempt to contact me!!,1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Lovely hotel but room was lacking,"Updated and clean hotel.  Easy access off Colorado Blvd although there wasn't adequate signage to tell us where to enter.  There is a large office building and parking garage where you turn in and the hotel is hidden behind the building.  Breakfast was outstanding all three days!  Something for everyone.  If an item ran out it was quickly restocked.  Tables were cleared of dishes quickly and wiped clean.  The only disappointment was our room.  Although it was very clean and had updated furniture, our toilet didn't flush well, the thermostat didn't work (room stayed the same temp our entire visit), and our King bed was uncomfortably firm.  All the pillows were hard as well and some even had rough little bumps that you could feel running your hand across the pillowcase.  It would be nice if there could be some firm and some soft pillows to choose from.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice meeting base for business,"Spent a week here on business. Nice that they offered food, only caveat was you had to go down to lobby to pick it up. Staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Included breakfast which was decent, nothing special. Ample parking, room clean. I only had a shower, and would have liked a tub. Great bed and pillows.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Modern, Clean & Great Location","My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek for four nights in Feb. 2017 while in town for training.  The hotel is easy to find (right off Colorado Blvd.) and it is conveniently located within easy walking distance to restaurants (Mingh Dynasty, Carve, Tokyo Joe’s and more), coffee shops (Starbucks), and grocery stores.  Check-in was a breeze - the hotel is modern/clean and the staff was helpful and very professional.  We used the awesome workout room on the 2nd floor featuring high quality treadmills, stationary bikes, elliptical machines and free weights.  We enjoyed the complimentary daily breakfast.  There were a lot of different hot and cold food offerings and the coffee and teas were amazing.  The hotel features an on sight restaurant/bar as well as cold food case featuring salads, snacks and sandwiches.  Our room was on the 8th floor and was clean and very comfortable – loved having the room fridge and coffee maker in the room.  Parking was plentiful and we appreciated the complimentary daily newspaper and WIFI.  We will definitely consider staying at this hotel again in the future.",4

Real food, like soups, sandwiches, appetizers, and burgers. We actually chose to stay in and eat dinner there twice this trip. I have been back several times in the past year and always stay at this Hyatt Place Cherry Creek.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Thin crappy walls and you can't smoke outside,Hotel has thin walls so you get to here the couple having sex in the middle of the night and the other side some guy coughing his heart out. Would highly recommend you choose a different place. I smoked a blunt outside because there's a dispensary 5 min walk from the hotel. They found guts in the trash and the container For the medicine so they charged me for smoking inside the room...

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,nice stay,"Stayed during Christmas.  Staff is very accommodating.  Breakfast was OK with options.  I did not like the cereal being served in bins and yogurt was served in a large bowl instead of individual containers.  There was no hot chocolate in the coffee/tea area.  I have stayed at Hyatts before and for the inexpensive price of the room, it was a decent place to stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Katherine needs a raise :),"We absolutely loved our room, everything was amazing especially Katherine at the front desk, not only did she smell awesome(lol) but she was super friendly and after a 27hr drive her positive attitude and helpfulness was a breath of fresh air.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Surprised for a Hyatt,"For the quality of food presentation and false information with the website didn't justythe room rate since I stay in Hyatt's all the time. Definitely not on my list to stay at next time I'm in town, I should have stayed at the Grand Hyatt instead.",3

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent value,"I've stayed here twice and had a pleasant stay.  The lobby is very nice, and the staff is always helpful and friendly.  It's an excellent value for the moneyThe breakfast buffet usually has a good variety and is a good way to start the day.   There is no restaurant on site, but there are some items you can order and eat at the bar or take back to your room that are good and reasonably priced. (burgers, sandwiches, salads).  And you have lots of nearby restaurants.Rooms are clean and spacious, with a nice little sitting area by the windows.  The beds are comfortable, and extra blankets are available for those colder evenings.  Drawbacks for me are the lack of a microwave in the room and only having a shower.  I know more hotels are going to shower only, but a nice hot bath is a little luxury I enjoy when traveling.One note - I wouldn't really say this hotel is in Cherry Creek,  It's close - maybe on the outskirts.  But it's not within walking distance to the shopping and restaurant area that I consider to be Cherry Creek.  This hotel is in a decent neighborhood, just off Colorado Boulevard, which is mostly strip malls and casual or fast food restaurants.  Nothing wrong with it, but Cherry Creek itself is a little more upscale, so if that's truly what you're looking for, you need to look a little closer.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Haven't refunded!!,"The hotel is quite comfortable, breakfast is normal. Personnel is friendly, they are always willing to help but at the end they do nothing. I stayed there for almost a week, we were attending ISTE conference. When we arrived they asked for a card to charge any extra expenses because it was all payed in advanced.  I gave them my debit card and charged 50 dollars. When we checked out they said I was going to get the refund, I've been calling them many times and they always say they are going to check. Now, it's December and I haven't got any penny!!",2

The front desk staff were are helpful and friendly. Breakfast buffet is plentiful and good. Free wifi, free parking, free newspapers and breakfast an added plus. We will definitely stay here again when in a Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"For the price, a good hotel","We asked and were given a room on a high floor and we paid the extra $10 to have mountain views.  Since the hotel is newer, it is in good shape overall, just a few minor items starting to show a little wear and tear.  They had just completed shampooing all the carpets and upholstery, so nice to see they are maintaining the hotel. We chose the location since it is close to my daughter's apartment and is convenient to the highway. Parking, WiFi and breakfast are included-nice deal. The bedding was white and a good quality.  If the location is where you need it, I would stay here.  There are probably better locations depending on where you need to be.  There are many strip stores all around, but its not a very pretty neighborhood overall- kind ot urban ""sprawly"".  Sorry if that is not a real word, but it is accurate.  The front desk people and always nice and friendly.  This is my 2nd time at this hotel in the past year.",4

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice Hyatt Place with just a few typical issues,"The front desk was friendly, the room was clean and a good size.  I received a mountain view which was nice.  The bed and all pillows were quite hard.  I would have liked at least one pillow that wasn't so overfilled.  Typical for Hyatt Places, the fan was on 100% of the time in the bathroom.  I don't understand why this brand has this ""feature"" which I find noisy.  This room, however, was situated so I didn't hear it as loudly as I do in other Hyatt Places.  The breakfast was typical Hyatt Place which is nice for a couple of days.  The coffee wasn't strong enough, but it had great teas (Tazo).  Free parking and easy access from the freeway.",4

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Noisy room ,"Stayed two nights during business trip to Denver.  Was woke up early each morning by noises from an adjacent room - coughing, clearing throat, TV, talking on phone.   Room was potential connecting room and door between rooms needed more (or at least some) insulation.  Other than that and light pours in the bar, hotel is OK.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great view!,"This Hyatt Place is located in the edge of Cherry Creek about 5-6 miles from downtown.  It is a modern high rise (11 stories) office like building.  It is locate just off of the major road with easy access to the front entrance.  As with many other Hyatt Place, parking is free and their parking lot (uncovered) is spacious.If you don't have to stay in the middle of downtown this is a great location.  We drove into downtown to sightsee and the access was easy (various parking was easy to find  downtown).  Right outside the hotel within walking distance was Walgreens, Starbucks, WholeFoods and other eating establishments.  Also upscale Cherry Creek shopping district (outdoor shopping/restaurants streets and several department stores) is within minutes of this property.I'm guessing that this building was an office building previously?  It has a very spacious lobby and comfy bar/breakfast area with ample seating.  Staff (thank you Jordan) as always was very friendly and helpful.We paid a few dollars extra for a mountain view room and it was totally worth it.  We were allocated a corner room with a full view of the Rockies.  The view was awesome.  The rooms were spacious, clean, modern and quiet.   As it is a newer property A/C unit was quiet (we've had noise stay in other older Hyatt Place properties).  The bathroom was also efficient and spacious - it had sliding glass door and roomy step in sbower.  Sectional couch was positioned right under the picture window so we were able to enjoy the gorgeous sunrise and sunset from our room.  A very pleasant stay; convenient location and good value for money (if you don't have to be located downtown).  I would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Spacious Comfortable Rooms,"This hotel has spacious, comfortable, clean rooms. I had one facing the mountain, so the view was pretty nice. The hotel is quiet too. They were very kind and gave me early access to my room. It's convenient for Cherry Creek area, but a bit further out for down town. Bed was comfortable, but pillows were hard (for my personal taste). I don't recommend the food from the 24hr menu - was all frozen stuff, not my favourite thing. Reception staff also cook food (microwave I suspect) and serve in the bar in the evening.",3

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Type of Room Matters,"Don't get a handicapped room unless you're handicapped.  There is no tub and the shower leaks.  What we liked about this hotel is that we were new to Denver and it's adjacent to a high rise tower that has HYATT PLACE in fluorescent lights; very easy to spot from the freeway!  What we didn't like was our room, no pool.  Great breakfast in the morning.",5

You are a credit to Hyatt Place!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Perfect for a short stay,"My husband and I needed a room for a long weekend so we could see a concert at Red Rocks. This Hyatt was perfect for us. It was outside of the Denver congestion, but also close to the Cherry Creek area that has amazing restaurants and shops. It was also a 30 min ride to Red Rocks and a great location if you're seeing a concert there. The room had a great view of the mountains, and it was clean and updated. Spacious and comfortable and I loved the sofa by the window! The hotel staff was terrific - - friendly, knowledgeable and always eager to help. Breakfast was surprisingly good for a ""free breakfast"" hotel. There was more than enough to choose from and the Starbucks coffee in the lobby was a real plus. You should know that the hotel is not in the town of Cherry Creek, despite it's name, which means that the Cherry Creek area is a short drive away. The immediate area surrounding the hotel is ""just okay"". There aren't any restaurants that you can walk too except quick fast food. The bike paths and mall are a short distance. If you are looking to stay in the heart of Cherry Creek then this is not the hotel for you. Overall this was a great stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great price, location, and doughnuts","The location was convenient, especially if you have a car, and the price was more than reasonable.

And the staff was very friendly!We were able to get to most places in a short 10-20 minute drive, and there are restaurants nearby. Only recommendation to the hotel is to fill the gap at the bottom of the door. It lets in noise and light at night.",4

The bar staff were super & the food was great! Our room was very nice. Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying any where in the Cherry Creek area!!,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Will stay again,"We just finished a 5 night stay at Hyatt Place.  From the time we entered and were greeted warmly by Skye we knew we had chosen our Denver hotel wisely.The room was spacious and king bed extremely comfortable.Housekeeping was did a great job each day. We wish the bathroom door was more than a sliding glass door. It closed with a bang each and every time.Breakfast was just what we wanted. Great oatmeal with toppings for me and eggs, toast and sausage for my husband..We hope to book there again next year.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,cherry creek hyatt,"I really liked the property.  Great location, close to malls, restaurants, and grocery stores.  Not that far from downtown and the airport.  I would definitely recommend it to others and the free breakfast was the best I have had in a long time.  Very impressed overall.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Old, dangerous building",We stayed here and had to move rooms two times over a three night stay. The second day we were there the headboard detached from the wall and fell on top of both double beds. We were moved to another suite and woke up at 1am that night because of what smelled like an electrical fire. We immediately called the front desk and were moved to a non-suite room which was not what we originally booked. This was one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. Do not stay at this hotel.,1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great place to stay near the University of Denver,"This is my favorite hotel when visiting my son at the University of Denver. The hotel is very comfortable and centrally located. Renting a car is necessary, but almost every store you can think of is within 10 minutes.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Everything find except...,"...Inconsiderate and noisy neighbors caused me a sleepless night. Hyatt staff was sympathetic but these ""guests"" were intent on party party party thru night.  I chose this hotel because it was less expensive than others on Colorado Blvd. I regret that decision.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great location, great breakfast","Conveniently located with easy interstate access, really great hot breakfast with lots of options, friendly staff. Rooms are ample but not as spacious as other Hyatt Places I've stayed in.  Design elements of bathroom are less than functional  (no fault of this location, but a corporate decision that should be given consideration. )  Bathroom door is a large piece of frosted glass on a slider rail. Door doesn't hang plumb so doesn't close all the way, sticks if you close it too much needing someone from the outside, screeches when moved...doesn't offer much privacy.  Shower doors have a shallow ring to open/close making it difficult to close the heavy glass doors with wet hands. Sink faucet is mounted so that water streams out about an inch from the back of the sink, making it impossible to wash hands without flooding the countertop. All elements that look good on a design plan,  but not practical in application.  All in all, a good place to stay - but the bathroom design is an overall fail.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A great stay!,"The hotel was modern, clean and very welcoming.  The staff were friendly and the room was great.  The breakfast is extensive and makes for a great start to the day.  I would definitely recommend staying here.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Moonsruck14,"If you're looking for a comfortable accommodating hotel in the Denver area, Cherry Creek Hyatt is a terrific choice. Great stay at a reasonable price in a location that's good for light jogging with Infinity Park near by and Cherry Creen",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Prepare for a noisy building,"Perhaps the noise of this creaky building will decrease when the windows are replaced, but currently this hotel is quite noisy.  We changed rooms because of a persistent scratching noise, and although the second room was quieter, there were numerous and frequent groans from the building.  Breakfast was not remarkable and staff were friendly.  For a room that cost $200 a night, I expect much better.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great place,"Love the location, very convenient close to downtown, restaurants, etc. THE BEST breakfast in all the hotels that I have stayed before that includes it and I mean it, the best. IT DOES HAVE POOL, the gym is well equipped.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great room with 2 queen beds and sofa-bed,"Free parking, breakfast included and big room with 2 queen beds and sofa-bed for a trip with friends, walking in Mount Evans, Denver.   This hotel is 15 minutes by car from downtown, historical district in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very clean. Friendly staff,"Close to shopping.  In a nice area of town.  Great breakfast, very clean.  Hotel staff was more then accommodating regarding our requests.  We asked for a higher floor, they gave us the end room on the 9th floor which was quiet and private.  Asked for an extra comforter, they brought us that and an extra blanket just in case.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Family Fun,"The front desk staff were extremely kind and attentive, while we were checking in they got my kids cookies and milk and set the trip off right. The in hotel restaurant was spot on with our order and everything tasted great.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Breakfast Great, No Pool or Microwave, Great Location",This hotel offers free parking and free breakfast - both great!  The location is easy to get to and you can walk to 7-11 and several restaurants.  The Chinese restaurant across the street is great!  The room is hot at night.  They have a LARGE light that blocks the air flow.  There is no pool or hot tub which was a huge disappointment. Most of their staff are helpful and nice at the desk but there are a few that are a bit rude.  Also a refrigerator is provide but no microwave - makes heating food difficult.  Would I stay again - No.  There are so many in this area that I would select another.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Top notch HP,"First time at this HP, but it will not be my last. I will be traveling to Denver more for business, and this HP is what I need. First, location, centrally located in the Cherry Creek area, very nice, clean, with lots of other stuff around you. My entire 3 night experience was top notch, from the staff, room, food, etc. You also have ample FREE parking, with easy access to Hwy 25 to your south and Hwy 70 a little farther to your north. Depending on the time of day, you can be in downtown in 20 minutes or less and DIA in 40 minutes.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Overpriced,"The only negative things I have to say is that this place should never charge more than $150 for a room. They aren't worth it.  The staff were a little unattached and robotic, but helped me happily when I needed.  The breakfast was nice, parking was free, the room was clean (definitely not a suite as advertised), and the location was prime.  I don't think I would stay again considering the other options that are close.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place Cherry Creek,"Yet another fantastic stay at the Hyatt Place Cherry Creek in Denver. The staff could not be more polite and friendly and the breakfast cannot be matched! This location works wonderful for us for a couple reasons, it is very close to our 2 children living in the Cherry Creek area, and extremely easy access to the interstate to get us quickly wherever we want to go.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Clean and comfy,"Nice room - clean, comfortable. We were on the 11th floor with a great view of the sun setting over the Rockies. There's a 24-HR cafe and a free parking lot outside the hotel, which isn't always what you get in big cities.  Our room was a simple king room with a sofa bed that slept two more. The room had a fridge, too. It wasn't a huge room, but was roomy enough for the four of us.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Cherry Creek Denver Weekend,The Hyatt is a great place to spend a weekend close to shopping and dining. We were greeted each morning and evening by friendly and professional staff. Super morning breakfasts and free wi-fi + ample parking with easy in and out. A definite add to the list (and the chocolate lava cake is super yummy!),4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent,"Excellent. Our stay here was very very good. We found the staff to be extremely courteous, the rooms were clean and we had no problem with anything in our 10 day stay. The breakfast was better than that any hotel  where we stayed.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Above and beyond,This was for business primarily as I travel often to Denver and normally stay at Hyatt place downtown Denver but decided to bring my son along with me this time as he is attending camp this summer and wanted to check our Cherry creek . I had to pack and label a bunch of his clothes and items to bring along with him and forgot my labels back home in NY. I called the desk asking for a sharpie and label and I was so pleased with the level of service . Katherine offered to make me labels! I know for sure that is not part of her job to make labels for guests and as an HR manager I was totally impressed . I'm so grateful because it was late and didn't want to take my son out to buy . She really helped us when we needed it and thank you! I know where to stay when I come back !,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent Cherry Creek / Glendale Hotel,"Very pleasantly surprised at the renovation and change from the former Loews Giorgia hotel to a Hyatt Place. Has anyone not stayed at  Hyatt Place by this point? They are the Starbucks of hotel chains and I mean that in the best possible sense. You know exactly what you are going to get no matter where in the US you are, down to the artwork on the walls. In fact, that could be the only thing they could maybe change up from city to city (local artwork or photos perhaps?) They are an excellent mid-range choice for business or pleasure. Though I especially recommend them and stay at Hyatt Place's when traveling for work. They have just the right amount of space to spread out to work and you can get a meal or a glass of wine if you're working late. I'm always happy staying at a Hyatt Place.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"If you need internet, skip this hotel","Nice place, similar to many other Hyatt Place hotels.  However, not only could I not get on line in the business center, but I was told that they had their IT people in the entire week before trying to get the internet back on line.  They are clearly using the wrong IT provider so if you need to do any business, skip this hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wish I could have stayed longer!!!!!!!,"Upon arriving in unlikely circumstances, I was at ease from professionalism of staff, breakfast and room was impeccable. It was quiet with blackout curtains and AC was great.  Really hot in Denver and I live at 11,000 ft. so I was in HEAVEN staying here with my King size bed and wonderful linens.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice Stay,In town for a wedding.  Chose this place because it was close to the venue.  The staff were pleasant and helpful.  Room was very clean and comfortable.  Only pet peeve was that the bathroom faucet was too close to the edge of the sink.  Plenty of free parking.  Would stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great staff, noisey for sleep and no local shuttle",Staff very welcoming and accommodating. elevator service is excellent. Stayed on 10th floor of 11-floor hotel. Room decor is contemporary and in great shape. Air conditioning is not in the wall and works well but still heard noises from it and from hall throughout night. Worst noise was from doors slamming shut. TV has many channels and internet was great. Shower large with good controls on temp and pressure. Parking is outdoors but not too far from entrance. Included breakfast was excellent. Hotel has no shuttle service even though Cherry Creek Mall is only 2 miles away. Bill was correct and checkout was quick. Staff again really thanked us for our business.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wonderful Staff,"Not the greatest location if you don't have a car but the entire staff was amazing, the room was big and very comfortable, the free breakfast was much better than most I've experienced, overall an excellent place, I would definitely recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great place to stay,We have stayed in several different hotels in Cherry Creek in the past 3 years. This was the best! The staff was great. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was fresh and tasty every morning. And they have a bar! We will be staying there on our next visit to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Breakfast,"We stayed for 3 nights during my business trip to the area.  The staff were friendly, accommodating and helpful.  The daily breakfast buffet was diverse and tasty.  My only concern is the paper thin walls where you can hear other guests in the next room.  I would stay here again, but ask for an end room.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wonderful stay: A newly remodeled hotel in a great area!,"Having stayed at many Hyatt Place hotels, this location ranks among the best. The hotel appears to have gone through a relatively-recent, full remodel; rooms, common areas, etc.). Nice new furniture, a comfy bed, and a sparklingly clean bathroom. The lobby was large with a huge dining area and check-in was a breeze. Staff were friendly and breakfast was decent with eggs, sausages, grab and go ham and egg sandwiches, and a variety of fruits, pastries, breads, yogurts, and drinks. The oatmeal was well prepared with lots of fruit and nut toppings (hate when it's runny) and staff were visible restocking the buffet and cleaning tables during breakfast. The Cherry Creek area is fantastic, with many restaurants and easy access to museums and public transit to get downtown without the hassles/costs of parking. I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Weekend in Denver,"We recently visited family in Denver and stayed at the Hyatt Place/Cherry Creek.  We loved the location, easy access and close to shopping.  The hotel has been recently remodeled, the staff very friendly, nice free buffet breakfast, and delicious peanut butter cookies that can be purchased at the desk. Also, there is free parking. The only complaint that my husband and I both agreed about were the flat, uncomfortable pillows on our king size bed.  They really could use an update.  We would definitely stay there again though.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Stay in Glendale, Denver",I thought overall it was a great experience at this hotel. This field is confusing. I already indicated that this hotel was exceptional and I would recommend it and stay here again.  You  just need to  fix the volume on the TV so that anyone an adjust it.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice Hotel at a very nice location,Typical US chain hotelRoom was very spacious and cleanStaff very friendly and helpfulFree parking and wifiGood typical american breakfastClose to the main shopping centers of Cherty Creek and main highways to visit Colorado,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,too noisy in room,"If I pay this much for a hotel room I expect the soundproofing between rooms to be much better. No room service, though there was 24 hour food and drink available to be picked up in lobby. Decor is cold, blinds do not block light out enough, no curtains. I wished for a bathtub instead of just a shower. Staff was nice until I asked to be moved to a quieter room, after which they ignored me.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Absolutely a value with OUTSTANDING Service,"For a high quality ""value"" stay - this is the place to stay in this area. Rooms are great (not smelly like the Hilton Garden Inn down the street) -And I cannot say enough great things about the service.  Every staff member so far (6 total as if this moment) have been super friendly and service oriented. Makes a huge difference in the stay!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Good Rooms, terrible service","Nobody helped us with our luggage, we had to carry everything by ourselves. Only one person checking in guests, that was the only staff member we ever found.  We asked for a crib. Can't even explain the disaster. It had a matress that didn't even cover the entire crib, the sheets were not clean. Terrible service experience.  Definitely not what I expected for that price.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel,"Loved hotel! Great staff, great room, good food and drink.  Would have liked a more private outdoor sitting area; the sitting area was shared with other businesses in the building.   Not greatest location if you're on foot or using public transportation.  Bus ride to anywhere was always an adventure, but not in a good way.  Not a lot of mid- to high-end shopping or dining in immediate vicinity.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Customer-oriented,"I've stayed at Hyatt Place before, and this one was great! Service was friendly, respectful and helpful.  The room was clean, spacious and beautifully decorated and appointed.  Breakfast had many options and the public spaces were beautiful. Dinner (the cafe menu) wasn't all that great - but we were grateful for it!  We were super disappointed to find out that when we paid by credit card, there was nowhere to write in a tip for bar/restaurant service.  Luckily we had cash - but it was a shame that the hardworking employees do not have the opportunity to make tips like others providing the same service in other bars & restaurants.  Ample parking, easy to find, safe area.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"As expected, great","Kinda new hotel. Spacious room. Location is not really in Cherry Creek but very near. Breakfast - skillet was great, all selection of warm meals, cereals, and juices. Staffs were very friendly and helpful. Overall will stay here again when going to Denver!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place,"Staff made a big deal about checking out and then checking back in simply to extend my 5 night stay to 6 nights.  This was a huge inconvenience and a enormous waste of time.  We had to pack up, put our baggage in storage and then check back in to the exact same room type.  This was after the staff said that the room type was not available.  Also, after we returned from our family outing, they had lost the ""new"" reservation.  Generally very unprofessional and inconvenient.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good Stay!,"They were ""Pet Friendly"", BUT they wanted someone to stay in the room the entire time with the dogs.... How are you supposed to visit the City?  Thank you, Denver for being soooo ""pet friendly"".  It was a very nice room and it was clean, BUT the bathroom door did not have an inside handle or a lock......",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Hotel next to University of Denver,You will be happy you stayed here. We stayed while looking at the University of Denver for my daughter.  The Breakfast was very good. The Coffee Bar was awesome and was always promptly stocked.  There is parking next to the Hotel with easy access and security was present.,5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Hotel,The nicest Hyatt Place hotel that I've stayed in.  Friendly and attentive front desk staff.  Free breakfast was good and the Seattle's Best coffee was great. Had an issue with outlet in bathroom which was taken care of by the time I returned to hotel.  Nice comfortable room and very quiet even though I was relatively close to the elevator. A 5 star stay for me.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Fairly priced hotel for Denver,"I stayed here for a night while on business. The hotels in downtown were quite a bit more so I chose to stay here. The hotel staff was friendly and the hotel was fairly quiet. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. There was free wifi and free parking as well as a free breakfast. The location is fairly close to downtown if you have a car or use Uber/Lyft (there were lots of Lyft  cars nearby). The breakfast was a typical free breakfast - the coffee was ok but the eggs and sausage were not very good. Also, there was a Starbucks very close as well as a McDonalds but although I did walk to another average restaurant for dinner, there weren't any good restaurants within walking distance, and the area isn't great at night. All said, I would stay here again if the rates downtown were again over $100 per night more...",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very nice!!,"I came to spend to my Birthday weekend here and I have to say that is was a great hotel,it was clean,it smelled good and was close to downtown . There is a light rail station very close,that you can take to downtown if you don't want to drive.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Comfortable, clean,very nice staff.","We stayed at this Hyatt Place for three days and enjoyed our stay very much, with a couple of exceptions~~the tv is adjusted so as not to go over ""30"" (one third the volume) and the charge for a margarita at the hotel's bar was exorbitant ($13).   The room was very comfortable, bed comfy, roomy environment, big windows, great a/c,great breakfast variety, extremely courteous and helpful staff.  However, the low volume of the tv was annoying, and the surprising price of a margarita was disappointing.  Overall, we were happy with our stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Acceptable last minute choice,"Had to scramble to find room when previous room at another chain was not serviceable. Clerk very helpful in assisting us with our dilemma. Hotel easy to find, had ample parking, close to restaurants & shopping, reasonably priced, close to downtown. Hotel very busy even at 10pm on Sat night. Room was spacious, modern & clean with all amenities, plenty of outlets for our electronics and a very comfortable bed. Breakfast included in room rate but we did not partake. Would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Gem in a sea of ordinary,"I travel a lot and stay in  a lot of mediocre hotels.  The Hyatt Place in Cherry Creek is not one of those hotels.  The entire staff I encountered was just very motivated and friendly.  I had 3 interactions with the front desk with 5 or 6 different people and they all were outstanding!  The hotel itself is nicely decorated, looks very clean and new, and the rooms follow that same theme.  Breakfast was also outstanding as the chef somehow made buffet scrambled eggs taste really good!  If you're in the area do yourself a favor and choose THIS hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Denver Hyatt Cherry Creek is tops!,"This is a wonderful hotel and a great value!  The staff is super accommodating, and the hotel is close to everything in Denver, and has clean rooms and a nice breakfast!

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Beautiful Room, Good Service, Tasty Food","Our 11th floor room faced east with a beautiful view of the city.

Lots of variety at breakfast--good fruit, yogurt, eggs, sausage",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not a typical Hyatt Place,"Condition of room not good. Carpet frayed, lamps too large & not great taste, as well as furniture, difficult to adjust temperature. Even though a new renovation for this hotel chain, not well done at all, or in the taste of other Hyatt Place hotels.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Enjoyable Stay,"This hotel is a ways off the freeway, and is not in the best location for walking to nearby restaurants.  However, the actual facility is really very nice, and worth the challenges of the neighborhood.  This appears to be a recently renovated hotel previously operated by another chain.  I found he public areas large and very spacious in relation to a typical Hyatt Place.  Breakfast offerings and the eating area were great - among the best I've experienced at Hyatt Place.  The room was a decent size, and I really appreciated the large closet, compared to the often very small usual Hyatt Place closet space.  Overall, the facility appeared very well maintained and clean.  There was plenty of free parking.  Staff were all very pleasant to deal with.  I'd return to the location again when in the area.",4

Free, convenient parking. Nice rooms. It has a frig but no freezer section and no microwave.  It has some food available but the pre made items don't really meet my needs. I liked the breakfast choices. I stayed on the second floor and my room had a lovely view and was very quiet.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent Hotel/Helpful Staff,"I was at an academic conference, and the local university put me up here.  It was great.  The sunrise wakes me up around 6:00 a.m., the breakfast is very good.  The front staff was helpful and problem solving, even though I didn't have any major problems.I was in a king bed room, with very nice amenities, comfortable bed, very clean.The surrounding neighborhood is so-so, with a strip mall across, and a close by thoroughfare with fast foods.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great fire drills!,"I was in Denver for my sister's funeral, but the first morning we were there, someone burned their hair with a curling iron and set off the fire alarm.  I can tell you, it works! I walked down 5 flights of stairs and stood in the parking lot for about 15 minutes until they gave us the all-clear.  It was handled professionally, and very quickly, which is a comforting thing to know if it should ever happen to you!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great find,Great location near I-25 and Cherry Creek. 24hr fitness center and the bar is open til midnight. Clean and comfortable rooms with a very good staff. Great shopping and dinning experiences close at hand.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Pleasant Stay,"We had a relaxing stay at the Hyatt Place. Our room was very clean, beds were very comfortable, and the bathrooms were modern and sleek.  Best of all, this had to be the quietest hotel I've ever stayed in! Plan to return in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great find  Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great hotel; located a couple of miles from Cherry Creek; easy access to Denver and Cherry Creek, a mile and half to Wash Park; awesome view of the mountains! Many choices for breakfast and a relaxed atmosphere!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,2 nights in Denver,"The hotel is in a relatively quiet area, no bars or nice restaurants in walking distance, but with a short uber ride you are just about anywhere you need to be.The service is very good, all the receptionists are young, motivated and really friendly to everyone!The rooms are spacious and modern. The wifi is free of charge which is great!The breakfast is pretty complete as well and I love the fact that there is still coffee all morning long.Something has to be done with the over-perfumed (air freshener) smell in the lobby...it gives a headache and is waaaay to strong. The rest was great and the value for money is definitely worthwhile after paying 40% more for a terrible experience in LA. Would come here again! Denver is great!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Greatly exceeded all expectations... even during a Blizzard-caused power outage.,"I booked this hotel for a three night stay in late March, during a week-long spring break trip to Santa Fe and then to Denver.  We arrived the evening of March 23, which was the day a historic blizzard hit the area.  We had drove the 1000 miles from back home in Arkansas, so it was definitely an experience driving through the foothills southwest of Denver from Santa Fe, up US Hwy 285.  The drive was fine, and beautiful the entire way, going through the heart of the Colorado Rockies.  Roads were clear until about 30 miles from the city, around Conifer.  Had a couple of very very close calls while driving on the hilly, snowpacked highway....even skidding into a deep snowbank in the highway median.  Somehow, I managed to put the pedal to the metal and got out of there without needing assistance, but it was a scary experience for sure!!  Anyway we finally hobbled into the city with a broken windshield wiper, and made it to the hotel around 6:30 in the evening.  When I arrived to check in, the hotel had been without power for several hours, and was running on generator.  Their computers were down, but they had my reservation, and even had me on the 11th floor facing the mountains, which was exactly what I requested when I called the hotel a week before.  The elevator was super slow during the power outage, and only one was working, so there was a line to get on, and then our key did not work when we got to the room.... but I called the front desk from the phone in front of the elevator bank, and a gallery host brought us two keys pretty quickly...I think he hiked up the eleven flights of stairs to do so, which was impressive. The room was amazing, as per usual when it comes to Hyatt Place.  Everything worked in the room, even the TV worked while on generator power... the front desk said it wouldn't..so I was happy because Survivor was on that evening and I didn't want to miss it :-)  The view from the room was amazing...snowcapped mountains of the Front Range, plus a view of Denver skyline...what else could one ask for?  The power came back on during the evening, but I didn't notice.  The only thing that indicated to me that the hotel was on generator was that the bathroom light was a bit dim, and ice machine was turned off plus the light in the ice machine room wouldn't come on.  I'm so relieved they have a generator!  When I called ahead of time that afternoon to make sure my room wouldn't be given away in case they had a flood of locals come check in for a room due to the big power outage, I was assured they'd have my room ready, but that they were without power and didn't know when it'd be back.  I wasn't aware they had a generator so I was worried I was going to be checking into a dark hotel haha.  I guess because I grew up in a small town, and none of the hotels in my hometown have generators.... they're dark like the rest of the town if the power is out... it didn't even occur to me that this hotel would have a generator.  I guess most hotels in metro areas do have them, which is a nice thing to know.  Beds were great, TV had all local channels in HD... plus a few basic cable channels in HD, as well....which is great, as long as the hotel I'm at has the local network affiliates in HD, I'm fine.  We stayed March 23-27... was only suppose to stay three nights, but another snowstorm hit southern Colorado, areas south of Denver on that Saturday, so we stayed another night.  I hated to leave.  I fell in love with the city of Denver while there.... have planned a month long trip exploring the western US and various national parks in July, and already have a six night reservation booked at this hotel again for 7/2-7/8.  Can't wait to return and explore the city and the surrounding area.  Hopefully this hotel stays a hidden gem...lol.  Definitely better than staying downtown.... I almost always choose Hyatt hotels if there's one in the area I'm staying in, if the price is affordable.  It's either Hyatt or Hilton hotel brands for me.  In my opinion, one can rarely go wrong with those two fine hotel brands.  It's easy to earn points towards free nights with Hilton and Hyatt, too.... especially when they're running summer promotions like now.  I do a lot of traveling, and if you're like me, those points can add up quickly.  Here's a tip...most on here likely already know this.... but always register for the hotel's frequent guest/rewards program...and book your stay directly with the hotel's website.  That way, you get points for your stay, which will add up quickly to get free nights....plus you're usually given a more favorable room location if you're a Hyatt Gold Passport or Hilton Honors member (when staying at Hilton properties). I've never booked a hotel through a third party site, and have NEVER used a name-your-price site like priceline..... hotels usually save the worst rooms for those guests that book through those options.  They almost always save the better rooms for guests that book directly through the hotel website.  Same goes for other hotel brands like Marriott, Starwood, Choice Hotels, etc.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Bit out of the way but great hotel.,"I would recommend renting a car if you are going to be traveling back and forth from downtown to Cherry Creek. It's a little of a walk to the train station and the bus schedule isn't exactly convenient. But the hotel was amazing. Don't skip out on the free breakfast buffet. The modern décor and spacious rooms give it a real ""getaway"" feel. I was pleasantly pleased.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent!,"The reason for our visit was to go for a tour at the University of Denver.   Luckily, the young woman at the desk was able to tell us a better way to get there  as we realized we would hit morning rush hour.  This Hyatt is in a busy area, but that meant we were close to Whole Foods, World Market, and other shops which was very convenient. We had a great experience here and would have loved to stay more than one night.  The employees were all helpful, smiling and hard-working, and the breakfast was great.  Additionally, we found the room with two queen beds to be a good size for a family of four, the beds were very comfortable, and we did not hear any loud noises.  In total, we had a great night's sleep!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Completely happy...,My husband  was in the hospital for double knee replacement. The staff was wonderful in helping me as I brought my husband back to the hotel to join me after he was released from the hospital and we could not go home  because of the  snowstorm and the pass was  closed. Hyatt Place went out of there way to help with handicap situations...Thank you!,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Fanastically run hotel,"I stayed here two weeks when my son had knee surgery. This is a fantastic hotel. They didn't miss a beat, even helped find a free box to ship some things back home. The housekeeping was amazing. We were camped out and had stuff all over and they still managed to make the room look ""tidy"". The breakfast is a step up from the usual stale buffets and the 3 computers in the lobby with printer were very handy for my son to use for his homework.",5

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Luxury in Cherry Creek,"We stayed here for  5 nights as a couple's working vacation (romantic, no?). The Hyatt is well located in near numerous good restaurants, shopping centers, yoga studios, and centrally located for getting around the city. Getting in and out was easy, parking free, a wonderful complimentary breakfast each morning, and other nice amenities you don't find at other hotels. The hotel was very clean, quiet, and pleasant to stay in. Our room had a large bathroom, king bed, mini fridge, coffee maker, desk, couch, and an amazing view of the Front Range. The staff was very friendly and our stay was very enjoyable. Getting to downtown (work) was easy from here and we could easily get to I-25 when needed.",5

I will definitely stay there again on my upcoming trip later in April.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great Location, Bad sinks.","After two stays in 8 months, my observations:--Fantastic location near the Denver Zoo, Museums, and Cherry Creek shops, high end car wash, restaurants (including the very excellent John Elway's Steak House) and malls.  A quick 10-15 min drive to downtown Denver.--Former Loews Giorgio property with very large lobby, dining, and kitchen serving areas. Small business center.--Walking distance to many chain restaurants, Target store, and recreational marijuana dispensaries (21+) in safe business district.--Rooms are not typical Hyatt Place rooms.  There are no partial room dividers or pull out sofas.  Rooms are comparable to Hilton Garden Inn rooms.  Corner rooms are large, but still look nothing like usual Hyatt Place rooms.--Generous hot breakfast selections; better than most free breakfasts. Plentiful seating.--Pets are allowed, even very very large dogs.  Outside, unenclosed dog park area is close and grass covered.--Basins in bathrooms are terrible.  Faucets (see photos) do not extend far enough to wash your hands without flooding the counter top and items on it.  This was true in both rooms we stayed in.--Not a criticism of this property, but the Canvas wine Hyatt hotels serve (only choice available) is awful...really awful.  Please add another label.  I'll gladly pay more.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place Cherry Creek,"Everything was excellent, we just wish they had a pool so when we travel with our grandkids we could stay there to. But when grandkids are along - a pool is a must. Otherwise everything was excellent for my wife and I.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent!,"Very pleased with my recent stay the Hyatt Place in Denver/Cherry Creek.  I can't remember the last time I stayed in such a clean and comfortable a hotel room.  I assume they have a top-notch housekeeping team here, because our room was spotless.  It was spacious and bright, the mattress/pillows were very comfortable, and it was peacefully quiet - hardly any noise from the hallways or outside.  The front desk staff were very professional, courteous, and attentive, and I also received friendly greetings from the housekeeping staff I passed in the hallways each day.  The breakfast was very good with an assortment of food and beverage and ample room for sitting in the spacious dining area.  Far better than the average chain hotel continental breakfast.I didn't utilize any of the other amenities, but I saw that they have a decent-sized fitness room and a business center.  The hotel is pet-friendly and has a small, grassy park area in the back for dog-walking.  The location is also convenient - we came in on I-25 and had no trouble finding the hotel.  The room rates were very reasonable as well.I initially prepaid for a 3-night stay here, but we were stuck in a snowstorm en route and missed the first night.  I thought I'd be out money, but the hotel instead gave me a credit for the missed night. This scored big points with me.I chose this hotel because it is close to family living in the area.  I will definitely stay here again on my next visit, and I am recommending it to other family members who may be traveling in to visit as well.",5

Breakfast was the standard Hyatt Place breakfast so you can predict that you'll have some good choices and plenty of coffee for those early meetings.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice Hotel,"I stayed here for one night, nice Hotel, but could use some upgrading in most common areas and rooms.I asked for a room toward the back of the Hotel (east side) and found the room to be comfortable and quiet.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,3+ days of great service,"We recently spent 2-20-2016 to the morning of 2-23-2016 at this hotel in the 2 Queen Bed Suite on the 11th floor, corner room. It was such an enjoyable stay. Managers Jordan and George, and the young ladies we visited with were kind, considerate, and brimming with tips on where to go and what to see. We thoroughly enjoyed the rooms' cleanliness, and I'm a trust but verify consumer when it comes to this. I bring my own sanitizing wipes and do a thorough once over just to be safe (after all mistakes happen) and the wipes came away clean for the entire room-- remote controls and toilets, too! So bravo to the cleaning staff.... not a speck of grime to be found! We also appreciated the responsiveness of the staff when we needed anything, the food (try the humus tray!), and the overall experience at the hotel. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and fresh. The bar had a small but good selection of wine and it was appreciated that they ID'd me each night, even if they knew me. The décor is up to date and tasteful. The hotel itself is located half an hour from the airport, and close to many things like the downtown district, the Outlet Mall in Castle Rock, the Botanic Gardens, and more. I can definitely recommend this hotel, its staff, and the location to any traveler. We've also stayed at the Inverness in Englewood last year and this hotel is much better.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Disappointed,Room was nicely recently decorated. TV and stations were good. We arrived late for a prepaid room but were informed our room type was no longer available. Telling them we were Hyatt gold members brought a so what. Bedding was at best average. Breakfast room is very nicely layed out but food quality is average at best. No ice on our floor. Gave us a handicap room without even asking if that was alright. Didn't seem like they cared about our business.,3

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent stay,Traveling for business locally.  Stayed in hotel with last minute reservations.

I am used to HGVC Luxury club stays in Vegas and this is on par with them.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not for business travelers,"While Hyatt Place is clean with comfortable beds, it really is not meant for business travelers based on my mid-week stay.   When I checked in the lobby was filled with people returning from festive events rather than from a day of meetings and it was difficult to get someone to check me in.  When I tried to go to sleep, there were revelers in the hallway until the early hours of the morning.  And at 7 am I am doing e-mail in my room to the wails of a screaming child down the hall.I have traveled a lot for both work and for pleasure so I know which type of hotels support the needs of those very different types of travelers.  I will know better next time that this hotel is better suited for leisure travelers but I am sharing this so other business travelers may know this in advance of booking a stay here.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Worst hotel I've ever stayed at. ,"We spent a lot of money at this hotel and were treated like complete garbage. They over charged my credit card by hundreds of dollars and when I called to get it fixed they basically told me to screw off. They lied to me and said the manager would be back shortly but then told me ""oh he's off for the weekend.""  We're at the Marriott Residence Inn now and are having a much better experience here and everyone is so kind. The rooms are CHEAPER, BIGGER and the beds are way more comfortable.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Rude and unfriendly staff - DON'T STAY HERE!,"I travel often for business with this hotel brand and others. This property by far was the most unfriendly, unkind and unwilling to honor any request. There was an open bar of soap with hair on it in the bathroom, the room smelled of fast food and the front desk could careless. I suggest the Hilton Garden Inn down the road, as that is where I switched to.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Surprisingly decent,"Had to be in this part of town for business.An older property but in good shape. In spite of being known by locals as the ""Darth Vader Hotel"" (look at a picture), it does brisk business - especially when the Broncos are playing.Rate was good and included better than typical buffet breakfast and free wi-fi and parking.Good staffing.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very nice,"The hotel is beautiful with great location.  Lots of places nearby and things to do in the area.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful.  (lost my phone and they went out to parking lot to check for it.)  Breakfast is top notch (eggs and oatmeal need some work), rooms are big and beds vy comfortable.  We had a beautiful view of the mountains!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Courteous, Comfortable & Clean",Comfortable Bed - Clean Room. Courteous Staff  Food decent and clean spaces. Room darkening shade was broken- which I noticed immediately. Staff promptly repaired when I reported it.   I've stayed here repeatedly.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellant hotel,"The people there are great, really friendly. The hotel is spick and span clean. The breakfast  covers a wide varity of food so anyone should find something of their liking. When I got home I discovered I left my phone charger there. I called them up and in 5 minutes they had it and put it in the mail.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Exceptionally personal service,"Each interaction with Hyatt Place staff (front desk, housekeeping, management, food) was genuinely personal.  Each person answered our questions or provided guidance that exceeded our expectations.  The facility was also very nice, clean, comfortable.  And the gym has more equipment than most (6-8 cardio machines -- bikes, elliptical, treadmills; dumbbells up to 100 pounds, benches, etc.)",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very nice rooms and location,The rooms were very nice and the L-shaped sofa in the room makes it more comfortable than the average hotel room. The location is excellent providing easy access to everywhere you want to go in Denver. Only possible drawback for those with pets is the steep pet fee - $75 whether you stay 1 night or 6 so short term stays are pretty pricy if you're bringing a pet.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,home away from home,"i walked in and was greeted with a smile. really enjoyed this location. lots of food choices and stores nearby. good breakfast choices along with coffee, juices and tea. bar had great food choices and cocktails.  the rooms were clean and modern. at checkout the young lady was very professional and accommodating.  really enjoyed my stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Convenient Place to Stay,I was looking forward to my return since my last stay was flawless. This was not the case. I was billed twice; once through Egencia and then the front desk presented me with a 2nd one. They did fix but I didn't get a credit that showed it yet. The breakfast buffet is good and they do offer SB coffee. The gym is also nice. The rooms are comfy and warm.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,So pleasant!,"I have stayed here in the past and always find it clean and comfortable.  Breakfast is quite nice! There is always and egg dish, great coffee, nice tea selection, and fresh fruit & yogurt. Staff is very pleasant and go out of their way to say hello.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Cherry Creek,"Overall the hotel is what Hyatt is all about. A little out of the way, and no ""Real restaurant"" on site. The location is close to local transportation. I found the price was very good, they only had one elevator working the entire time I stayed. I think for the Denver area this was a bargain.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Interesting Stay,"As a gold passport member I always look to book a Hyatt property when traveling. Overall, this is another great Hyatt Place porperty. Although the building doesnt quite look like the traditional Hyatt PLace building, the inside is every bit what you expect when you book with Hyatt. Rooms are awesome, staff is great, and you cant go wrong with the free breakfast. My only issue with our stay is that we were initially checked into a room that WAS NOT cleaned. I'm not sure if there was a staff miscommunication or what happened but when we walked into our room there was half full water bottles on the desk, half used soar throat spray on the counter, bed was half made and there was an instructions page to something thrown onto the bed, used soap in the shower AND another used soap bar next to the bathroom sink, along with other left cosmetics from previous guests in the room.Like I said, it appeared there could just have been a miscommunication between the staff but it was just horrible walking into that room after a long day of travel. We considered changing hotels but we decided to give the front desk a call to see how they would resolve this and we were given a new room right away. After hesitantly walking into the new room it did seem as everything was fine in this room and the rest of our stay went well although it was tough to get over that first room. Like I said, I am a loyal gold passport member and look to book with Hyatt with all my travels, but just thought I would share my experience at this hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great breakfast,"We got a good rate on this hotel through a booking site.  It was away from downtown Denver but close to shopping, restaurants, and the interstate.  Some fast food restaurants were within walking distance.The staff was multicultural to accommodate most guests.The rooms were tastefully decorated and the beds were comfortable.  The bathroom was very spacious.  A pool would have been nice.  The included breakfast was very good.  There was a variety of hot and cold items and each day there was a different main hot entree.  Parking was also free.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Unbelievable,"I used to stay in Hyatt before and always enjoyed it. 1. Bathroom was absolutely horrible. At first it looked nice, until we discovered that Shower Gel and Shampoo bottles were empty. They were used prior us and were just placed on a shelf like it is new. This is unacceptable for hotel, which is named as one of the best ones. 2. Towels had a lot of hair on it. A LOT! Black long hair, which were stuck on towels in multiple places. It is disgusting. I couldn't user any of their towels. I never saw anything like that in any hotel before. Even in Motel 6.3. There is absolutely no soundproof. I could hear people walking, snoring, talking in every room around us. 4. Lack of soundproof could be forgivable, but lack of security is not. There were couple of people in the room next to us. At 1.30 am we woke up because of someone slamming the walls in corridor and screaming. if I were with kids, I would definitely call 911 since amount of swear words and aggression was unbelievable. I though that there should be a seniority in the building and they would monitor any suspicious activity in hotel and corridors. But no. Screams were continuing until 3.00 am. I was so tired so I couldn't get up and call to the lobby. I just wanted to enjoy at least few hours of sleep. Also I was so scared, since there was a locked door between my room and those screaming people, it seems that a man could just break this door and harm me. Finally at 3:30 am someone knocked to their room and I thought this is over. But security didn't do anything (I even doubt it was a security at all, probably some of the guest who was disturbed). I finally had 2 or 3 hours of sleep. Thanks Hyatt and their staff, cleaning service and security. This is something I will never forget and will never ever advise to anyone to stay there. This is the first bad review I ever wrote. This is the most horrible and scary stay in my life, and sadly I paid for it.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Ok Stay But Not The Greatest,"The hotel served it's purpose for a place to crash, however my 1st day not a place till shower for a few hours due to an outage. Plus being a Passport member I should have had a little more recognition. Also, was not even left with a receipt under my door, and housekeeping service left me a note to be able to request at a time comfortable to me, but when I did so, I was told could not be fulfilled. Would been nice to have a bellhop to assist with bags as well.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Super friendly, read review","Hyatt Place is an inexpensively built but well kept and well staffed hotel.  It is not luxurious at all, so don't be fooled by the name.  It is well run, however.  The rooms are space optimized (read small) but adequate for one night's stay.  The location is fairly convenient for restaurants.  Free wifi, which is good.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice hotel - lousy breakfast,"Hotel and room was very nice.  Breakfast buffet - which was 'complimentary' and a heavy part of sales literature, was not up to par.  There was not enough staff, not enough food and the area was not well maintained.  Hotel was only 60% full - staff appeared completely unprepared for anyone to want breakfast.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Vacation ,My husband and I stayed here on our trip to Denver. We got in very early on the morning we flew in and were able to check in several hours early. We really appreciated that. The hot breakfast every morning was awesome. All of the staff and management were very friendly and helpful. Room was very clean and had a great view of the mountains. We would definitely recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice Place,"Great customer service, clean rooms, comfortable beds and beautiful mountain view (additional)! Free breakfast every morning, nice little hang out place in the back of the hotel. Centralized, close to airport, city, downtown and many attractions.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,great find,Walked in without a reservation and the staff took great care of us. Got a top floor mountain view room for a very fair price. The breakfast is wonderful. I have already made a reservation for the next time I have to be in town.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent Mid-Range Denver Hotel,"I've stayed here twice now, and will definitely stay again. I like the Central Denver location, and it's close to both I-25 and I-225. It isn't the fancy Cherry Creek area you might envision, but a highly commercial area with lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. There is a small restaurant/bar in the lobby that serves very limited but good food. They have an issue getting the food hot enough, but it tastes good! The bar is also limited, I would like to see more options. And they card absolutely everyone every time, which is really annoying. There is free breakfast in the morning with a hot egg dish, yogurt, breads, fruit, cereal, etc. Very good! My only complaint about the breakfast is that every TV (4 or 5 of them) is tuned to CNN. They should tune every one in to a different channel. ESPN, Weather, etc. The rooms are a good size and have a corner sofa unit with pull out bed. Unfortunately there is no table near the sofa, so it's difficult to sit there and enjoy a drink or a meal. They need to add an end table. There is a desk with good chair and plugs for your electronics.The bed and linens are comfortable, and the bathroom is decent sized. It has a vanity, not a pedestal sink (women get this), and I think all rooms have showers not bath tubs. The rooms on the West side of the hotel face the Rocky Mountains and the view is really nice, worth the extra $ if you'll be in your room at all. There are 3 PC computers in the lobby for guest use, which is helpful. And lots of seating and private areas to read or work in the lobby as well. The staff is always friendly and helpful.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Best Stay Ever!,"The Hyatt Place - Cherry Creek in Denver is the most tranquil, relaxing, cleanest place I've ever stayed. The staff is very friendly and highly professional. Whenever I travel to Denver, which is quite often, this is my hotel of choice!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great quality and service,"In town on business.  Flawless service, clean, well-kept hotel.  Quiet.  Recommend highly if you are looking for a moderately priced hotel well suited to business trips.  Staff really seemed to go out of their way to take care of guests needs.  Will stay there again when in town",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Conveniently located with kickass views!,"Great views and the rooms are simply decorated but in good shape. The price point is reasonable (I booked through Hotels.com).  Easy to check in and the lobby is set up well. The bar area & eating area are RIGHT there so it feels a little pushed together. Showers were large (could fit 2 people but I didnt) :) Beds were comfy and I also like the sitting area. I stayed there twice and both times the rooms faced Colorado Blvd/west and had great views. Speaking of Colorado Blvd - that area is jam packed with restaurants, stores, shops. etc. It's a fairly busy street so it's necessarily pleasant to walk down but you can certainly get to whatever destination you like fairly quickly.Tons of parking too - open lots that are not covered & also a covered garage (not sure if it's a pay garage though)Overall, a great place & friendly staff",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great service!,The staff was welcoming and pleasant.  Parking was easy and it was nice to grab breakfast in the hotel.  We found the location made it easy to get to different parts of Denver. Close to a Starbucks and several restaurants.  We would definitely stay here again!,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Reasonable Hotel,We stated for several nights at the Hyatt Place in Cherry Creek.  The room was comfortable with plenty of space.  The breakfast was fresher than some some competitors' offerings and the breakfast room was quite spacious.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Decent for the price,"What I liked: nice people work here, free parking, Good location to Cherry Creek area for shopping, bars, restaurants, food available 24 hours & coffee. Decent breakfast. If you are gluten free, they have eggs, sausage, fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese. Open lobby area where you eat- good friendly space. What I didn't like: could use a mattress pad with a little Cush. Kind of hard mattresses but pillows feather and soft. Faucet not long enough for the sinks, water ran all over the counter. No water cups, just coffee. Good blackout draperies but needed a blackout for door, light shunned off tile floor like a beacon! Thin walls and floor, could hear neighbor open draperies and upstairs neighbor drop shoes. All in all pretty good. Liked the people staying there as well- nice good people, friendly vibe.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Rooms are not well soundproffed,"We could hear the neighbors on one side of us when they were talking at an apparently normal volume.  When the baby in the room on the other side of us was crying, it sounded like it was in our room.  They need to seriously improve the soundproofing between rooms.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Pleasant hotel in good location,"We chose this Hyatt for its location close to family, and because they accept large dogs. (Many ""pet-friendly"" hotels have weight limits that our guy greatly exceeds.) It worked out really well. While it's not the Ritz, it was clean, pleasant, and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was well above average, with Starbucks coffee.  The price was in line with the amenities.  We would definitely stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very Nice Hotel-Great Value,"The hotel is relatively new and is well maintained and very clean.  The rooms are very nice.  Our daughter goes to DU, so this hotel is close to her and the campus, and it provides a discount if your stay is associated with the university.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Better than Home,"We had such a good time at this hotel. It was perfect as a location. It was very comfortable; good food. I sept like a baby in that room. And best of all, the staff was amazing. It was better than home. Thanks. see you again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,The Perfect Room,"My adult daughter, her husband and two children shared a two room suite with my husband and I over the Thanksgiving holiday.  We stayed for 3 nights.  The room worked well with the family of four in the bedroom and my husband and I on the Hide-a-bed in the sitting room. Everyone enjoyed the bountiful breakfasts.  We used the eating area near the lobby to have two dinners that we ordered in. The room was clean and comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Thanksgiving week stay,"The Hotel was really nice for a holiday stay:  Great Breakfast, Very Nice Staff, and the room was large and beds were comfy.  They have a bar, food and Starbucks onsite also so it was really convenient.  We truly enjoyed our stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice clean modern hotel,"It is outside of downtown near the Cherry creek center so you need a car to get around but parking is free. View of ugly apartment houses out the window. Mountains in the distance but the air needs to be clear to see them. Hotel is clean and modernized but they took the fireplace out of the lobby when it changed to a Hyatt. Our room had a nice big shower with adjustable spray but no tub  or hand held spray. Finally a room with enough electrical outlets to  charge and plug in all my stuff YEAY! Extra blanket and pillow in the closet. nice working desk but no coffee table just a big hassock. Nice couch. Great breakfast:Soft fluffy eggs, sausage biscuits with white sausage gravy, toast mini bagels, English muffins cut up mixed fruit and grapefruit sections and strawberry yogurt plus all the beverages and cereals. Friendly attentive staff and a little bar and 24 hour cold food service in the lobby. All and a good hotel at a reasonable cost.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,cherry creek hyatt place,very nice resturant- loved the cleanliness and restful rooms- i would advize you to stay here when you visit colorado. The workout room and the location in the denver metro area is spectacular. would recommend to any and all,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel with great views!,"I stayed at the Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek for work, and I really liked it. I was lucky enough to get a mountain view room, and the view was breathtaking. The room was very nice, and the seating area was great and relaxing. The common area in the lobby was great and was a nice spot to have a  work meeting. The breakfast was really good too - I would have wished for more egg options, but the spread was impressive. The staff were all very nice and helpful, and I'm planning to go back the next time I'm in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Quick, easy and quite nice","Big room with sofa/lounge area and great work station. Great, large gym as well--well stocked and functional.Nice full breakfast provided each morning, with nice selections or healthy food choices--I like fruit and yogurt and they had both.Staff was friendly and accommodating.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great central location w/ free parking,"Great location access to shopping, downtown and freeways. If you have a rental car and don't like to pay for parking this is a great option for your trip. Parking is easy and right next to the building with easy access to the freeway system. In-house gym has a good selection of equipment plus there are running trails nearby.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good place to stay,"The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The mountains are in the distance. And there is a Whole Foods and a bunch of good restaurants (we loved the vegan one) just down the hill. But you need to have a car and drive everywhere from here, it's not a great place to walk around but you could if you wanted to.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Location/Accomodations/Price,"We stayed on the 9th floor--beautiful view of Denver.  Room was large with great windows.  In addition to a king-sized bed, a long comfortable L-shaped sofa was in front of the window.  Nice flat-screen TV with lots of channels.  Breakfast was large and varied-fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, an egg dish, meat available every day we were there (4 nights).  Really enjoyed the large common space in lobby--""cubby holes"" where I could be by myself early in the morning.  Staff welcoming and hospitable--greeted us every time we left and came back.  Bar conveniently located in lobby, open 24-7 (I think).  Well situated to go in any direction in the metro area.  And the price was so good for a city hotel (which we had booked blind), we decided to book it again for a week over Christmas.  Free parking.  No down side to this accommodation.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Denver Dream Destination!!,"Great people.  Clean.  Great experience.  Perfect location to all of Denver Metro!  Very helpful staff and 24 hour room service,  It doesn.t get any better than this!  George at the front desk is the best!!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Place To Stay - Very Satisfied,"Our stay at Hyatt Place/Cherry Creek was extremely enjoyable.  The employees at the front desk were very helpful and friendly.  Check-in was quick and they explained many details of the hotel and things to do in the area. We were there for five nights and the free breakfast every morning was convenient for us.  There was a different option each morning and they were all very good.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  We received a great price on our rooms, which made the experience even better.  I would definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,GBP Game,Very nice accommodations for a nice price! Good breakfast with the menu changing slightly every day. which is included in the price. Free parking & nice people in the lobby. They could use more help as the same person checked us in & served our drinks.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Good Location, Good Property","Recently stay at the HP Cherry Creek on a road trip across the country for one night and had a very pleasant stay.  The hotel is in a very busy business park area near university and was quite full during the week.  Traffic around the area was very heavy at rush hour and that was the only negative for my stay.  The room was clean and spacious, the bathroom was large with good water pressure, and the bed was very comfortable.  Standard breakfast as at all HP's in the morning and it was quite crowded around 6:30 am.  I went to a Rockies game and it was a very quick 5 mile drive to the stadium from here.  Good location for navigating around the city, would stay here again without reservation.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"If had full services, would be a 4-star","This used to be the best hotel in Denver when I moved here in 1989.  It was the Loew's, and it is still very nice and comfortable.  If it had a restaurant and other first class services, it would be a 4-* property.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Comfortable, well-located hotel with reasonable prices","I was only there for one night, but my experience was positive in all ways. My room was spacious and very clean and comfortable. The breakfast (included in price) was far better than the usual Fruit Loops and cold bagels you find in most hotels. As I was leaving, I happened to meet up with the manager in the lobby, and I told him the room was perfect, but the pillows were too hard. He told me that many people prefer them that way, and that he regularly gets comments that the pillows are too hard-- or too soft! Or just right. It's kind of a Goldilocks thing.(my comment, not his.)I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Good location, nice rooms, easy parking, decent free breakfast","I've never stayed at any Hyatt hotel before. I chose this hotel because I found a discount online ($130 after tax). The rooms were nice. The location was excellent, being only about 15 minutes to downtown with morning traffic (and no need to jump on the highway). There are plenty of places to get something to eat nearby. The hotel has plenty of convenient parking. The free breakfast is not fancy (I've seen some reviews actually complaining about its quality), but as far as free breakfasts go, this is the best I have seen at any hotel. I probably would not stay again at full price, but I will definitely return if I find a similar discount.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Best bang for your buck in denver,"Well trained gracious staff, this place is clean from the parking lot to the toilets (tons of free parking by the way) price and location simply can not be beat. As for the rooms and beds, top notch! I have not tried the breakfast yet but it sounds delecious, and free with room! Free is good right? Even the maids seem to be willing to make you feel at home very nice, and always give you the right of way, weather you want or not. First time I've stayed here won't be the last!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good place to stay,"Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek was clean, comfortable, reasonably priced, and convenient to downtown and to the interstate.  The rooms are spacious.  The breakfast buffet was very good with hot food, fruit, yogurt, etc.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Reaching Higher in Denver -- A Peak Performance,"GM Jaime has forged a team of praiseworthy contributors who truly turned in a mile-high performance delivering personalized service to my wife and me. From the moment they engaged us at the front desk, to the lobby ambassadorship that proactively engaged us every time we crossed paths or had a question, every interaction was authentically guest centric. They looked for and seized every opportunity to add value. It definitely is our home when we visit CO in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very pleased with this hotel!,"Great hotel with spacious rooms that are are quiet and very clean. Breakfast buffet has something for everyone with both hot and cold selections.We ordered food at the bar to take up to our room late in the evening and it was pretty lousy, but overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone! Free parking is a plus.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very Nice stay,Really enjoyed our recent stay here the motel is very central to both the Rockies and Broncos stadiums. Rooms were very comfortable and very clean and staff was very friendly. Only draw back was no pool but rest was very good. Breakfast in the mornings was nothing exceptional but acceptable Overall was a very pleasant stay and one of the better values in the area.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good location and size of rooms.,The location is great for a over night stay and a few days in Denver when taking a break from the mountains. Being near to some of the popular malls in Colorado & great restaurants.The rooms are a good size big enough for 3 people to share if need be when travelling with family; while still being comfortable. Bathrooms are small but managable and the breakfast is decent for the amount paid. Overall I have stayed here several times and would stay again for over night travel.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place,The guest service was very good.  I requested a room on a higher floor with a mountain view and that's what I received.  They replied to my request very quickly and courteously.  One of the few places I would definitely return to because of the exceptional guest service.  The room was clean and the hotel was quiet at night.  Breakfast was good with a decent variety.  Always a friendly acknowledgment/greeting by Hotel front staff when entering or exiting the hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great place to stay!,"We stayed here when in Denver to shop at the Cherry Creek Mall and found it to be the perfect place to stay.  The room was quiet, clean and very comfortable.  While it didn't have a traditional restaurant, food was available 24/7 and it had a great complimentary breakfast.  I did think it was a little high priced however since it was not in a neighborhood immediately adjacent to the Mall.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Internet Service,"I've stayed at this hotel numerous times over the past two years.  It is centrally located off of Colorado Blvd. and close to dining, downtown Denver, and I-25.  Internet service has been a problem during every stay.  Once service was out for almost a week and during this last visit, it was slow enough that I was able to download files easily which I need for my work.  Somehow the hotel needs to get this problem fixed before I stay there again.  Otherwise, it is a nice place and rooms are great.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Everything perfect but the location.,"We ended up getting a room here as a promo for the Great American Beer Fest.  Rate was much better than anything else.  The location is in Cherry Creek, which has a lot going on if you like your activities leaning toward the corporate.The hotel itself was great.  Rooms were big and well appointed, the beds comfortable, everything you need in a hotel was just right.  Even the free breakfast was exceptional.  If you don''t mind driving to get wherever in Denver you're going, this is a good place to base.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,DON'T GET ROOM FACING THE MORNING SUN!,"Stayed here for two nights to catch a Rockies game. The staff was very nice though extremely un-knowledgeable about the surrounding area and the light-rail. In fact, they had no clue as to whether the light rail ran north/south or east/west, where the closest station was, how much it cost, when it ran, etc. One would think that the front desk of a large hotel would at least know the basics of the city's premier transportation system. Breakfast wasn't bad, though the selection was rather limited for a Hyatt Place. The room was nice and quiet for the most part. HOWEVER, make sure to get a room that DOES NOT FACE THE MORNING SUN. When the sun comes up, the black frames on the outside windows will heat up and there will be a large bang around 630 in the morning, then continuous pops and cracks (loud) that will not allow you to sleep anymore. The staff knows of this but says that the Hyatt won't fix the problem. They should tell you of the problem if they are aware of it and offer those with reservations the choice of a room facing the morning sun or not facing it. That would be simple. common courtesy rather than stating after the fact that they are aware of it and so sorry.  Made for a rather sleepless trip..... Disappointing.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,The Place to Stay In Denver,"Our rooms overlooked the mountains, they were spacious and very comfortable.. The hotel is in walking distance of some very good eating places, it is also 3 min drive to Gaylord Street.  The food was good at the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Smelly room kinda ruined it all.,"Hotel staff is really nice. Hot breakfast (eggs and sausage) isn't that great, but as expected for a large hotel with free breakfast. Location is convenient but surrounded by sprawl, so scenic it is not, despite the mountains in the far far distance. Room was clean overall. The worst part, and what pretty much ruined our stay, is that our room smelled like stale smoke. I'm not sure someone smoked there, but a heavy smoker definitely stayed there. By the third morning my throat was scratchy and I was coughing all morning. A room should be a nice relaxing place to hang out and sleep, but every time I entered I sighed and got bummed out for being back in the room. Perhaps I should have said something to the front desk, but I'm sure the next room could have been just as bad. It's unfortunate.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place in Cherry Creek,"Great hotel to stay short of long.  Great location with lots of shops.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place- Nice cStay,"A nice place to stay centrally located in the Cherry Creek area. Hotel was clean, staff friendly and included breakfast good to start the day. I'd stay here again and came in for conference. Room was nice and bed fantastic",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Perfect Pet friendly near University,"I could not ask for a better hotel experience. The location is excellent especially if you are visiting the university. My room was huge and included a sectional sofa and large flat screen TV with plug in capabilities. The bathroom is modern, large and spotless. All the staff are stellar and the massive free breakfast is awesome. There is an excellent area outside for pets too!!!  I will definitely be back is super co venue to.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Room infested with Bed Bugs,"At 2AM after being severely bitten and dazed,  I went to the front desk to request a new room, and was informed that the hotel was sold out. The staff told me they had no formal training on what to do and they could not reach anyone in management.  After some prodding,  they began a hotel by hotel search and within 30 mins I had a new hotel 30 mins away by car.  The Hyatt did compensate my room for one night,  but I had to throwaway my Tumi luggage  at substantial personal cost.  The hotel never attempted to contact me which I find astonishing given I'm a loyalty member who frequents Hyatts.  I will never again step foot in this Hyatt property.  Buyer beware.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Super clean,"My room was pleasantly appointed and super clean. Staff was polite and helpful even when they were occasionally short handed. Breakfast was above average-scrambled eggs and sausage were great. There was also french toast and banana compote. Exhausted from my day, I ordered an appetizer and soup from the cafe and enjoyed a generous quesadilla appetizer and mushroom brie soup (not salty-yeah!)in my room. The lobby offered many seating/gathering options.  My room was next to the elevator but I didn't notice additional noise. The only complaint was the gap at the bottom of my door let in a large amount of light from the hall. I used a towel to block it.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good hotel for the location and I guess price.....,"Not super clean, but moderately clean.  I will give it an A+ for the workout room which was important to me.  Beds comfortable.  A regular sized hair dryer was provided, but it does overheat quickly and turns off - I learned this when I thought it was broken and the same thing happened with the replacement.  Decent sample amenities for showering, etc.  I did not think it was especially inexpensive, but probably was so for Denver (I say this even after a corporate discount - and I needed to be in Cedar Creek locale wise).  Nice breakfast which was included for free.  I would not pay extra for a mountain view.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Solid hotel chain,"Checked in on September 11th after going to Mt. Evans in the late morning. Having visited other Hyatt Place hotels,I knew what I was getting and this property was no exception .

Now when I go to another city, I always look for Hyatt Place because I have not been disappointed yet. Attached photo is from my hotel room.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Pleasant stay ,"I really like Hyatt hotels. They are always nice, tidy and very comfortable! At that location I could relax and enjoy my night.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel for the locatoin,"The hotel is off of South Colorado so is a bit less noisy and secluded than the ones right on South Colorado.  Clean rooms, friendly staff. The breakfast is good and the hotel has a small bar so you can have a glass of wine or a cocktail to relax.  Free parking which is a plus.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Friendly,"My husband and I stayed here midweek and arrived late on a Tuesday night. The front desk agent was very welcoming and was of great assistance.  We stayed in a king room on the 8th floor right next to the elevator.  You would have never known that you were next to the elevator.  The room and bathroom were terrific. The only negative for us which is minor was the light coming from under the door, we had to use a bath towel to block it out. The breakfast in the morning had lots of options and was delicious.  We would definitely come back and stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Five Star Quality at a Great Price,"This property is beautifully appointed, provides excellent service at a very reasonable price.

Couldn't drown out the sound with TV or Fan. It was too loud!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Good hotel, mediocre location, slowwww wifi","This hotel is nicely kept up and has friendly staff at the front desk. Amenities seem to be lacking and food is extremely average. Would recommend if you just need a place to stay. Not really in Cherry Creek as the name would imply. Mountain view (west side) is way better than parking lot view (east side). Flatbread was ok, breakfast was fine since it was free. Wifi might as well be dial up.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Average,"This hotel is fine..just fine. The staff is friendly and the a.m. breakfast was good with plenty of choices.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Stay!,"The room was wonderful, the breakfast bar was excellent, and it was close to many sites that my family wanted to see. The mountain view was gorgeous and it was definitely worth the price we paid. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice Hotel!,"This is  not a luxury Hyatt hotel.So, don't go if that's what you are expecting. Hotel is clean.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.. Bathrooms were clean, bedding was good.   Hot buffet breakfast is included in the price. Lots of choices which included scrambled eggs (needs improvement) , sausage, cereal, breads, yogurt, fruit etc., I usually stay away from the oatmeal at the hotels but the oatmeal here was very good. Also, a big plus......parking is free!  WiFi is free!Not far from Cherry Creek Mall and excellent restaurants. About 5 min drive.  We were on the 9th floor overlooking the mountains. I could not hear other guests which was a plus. However, as someone else mentioned, occasionally sounds like birds hitting the windows at night, or something else going on.  Management need to look into this. Yes, I would go back again.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,If bedding matters...move on.,Hotel feels tired upon arrival. Lobby wanting. Staff was very kind and courteous although young and not very knowledgeable. One exception: Jordan. They upgraded me to a suite due to the fact that regular rooms have no bathtub. Suite was very nice but bedding is the worst I've experienced in a long time. Mattress and pillows both. I literally got no sleep after trying both beds and the sofa. Checked out in the morning exhausted. Was supposed to stay 4 nights.,2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,AMAZING HOTEL ALL AROUND,"My boyfriend & I stayed here for 5 days & we have nothing but positive things to stay.LOCATION:Fist off the location is great. It was about 10-15 minutes from Denver, close to MULTIPLE food places, 1 minute from target or sports authority. There is lots of shopping around and the highway is right by. Super convenient!! ABOUT THE HOTEL:The hotel staff is super helpful and friendly. Always welcoming and ready to help. We needed directions to Maroon Bells because our GPS was giving us problems and the front desk folk looked it uo and printed off directions for us, so nice! The gym is on floor 2 right when you get off the elevator. It is kind of small, there is about 4 treadmills, a couple bikes and a couple elliptical machines. There is no weight machines but there are free weights and a few benches. So if you are looking to pump you have to be creative with your training.-There is free wifi available in your room and lobby! High Speed!! -There is also a mini store right by the front desk where you can get different pops, and baked goods there is also a pretty fancy bar right up by the front desk too! -There is also free parking which was a must when we chose a place as some places were charging up to $35 a day!!!!-The hotel was also super clean!!!! -There is also continental breakfast 6-10am.. it wasn't bad actually had cereal, bagels, bread, english muffins, jam, yogurt, fruit, eggs, sausage, breakfast sandwiches, cereal, juice, milk etc.. the staff is actually amazing! There are always tables free because they are constantly cleaning and clearing tables to make them available for others!! AMAZING! Overall was a 5/5 stay!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent service & accomodations,"Hyatts are always  wonderful hotels but, the staff was particularly friendly & helpful.  That's all I got.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,LIKE FAKE GOLD!!,"I stayed at this location due to its proximity to the places I needed to be. The front desk crew is friendly, but they are kind clueless. They charged my credit card THREE TIMES for incidentals after they did it upon check in. There isn't a pool at this location, and the breakfast smelled of burn pastries and was avoided by myself. Ok so that's not so bad.. Let's talk about the absolute disgrace of this hotel, the rooms!The room- I booked a standard king, don't need a mountain view, I know what they look like. It was clean, but the room itself was more along the lines of a comfort inn than what one would expect from Hyatt in terms of very plain decor, hard dark carpets, and pillows with feathers that will poke you throughout the night.  The worst part of the room is the quiet factor. There isn't one. I could hear the people's iPhone chime in the room next door!!!! The toilet flushes like its hooked to a jet pack, and is startling. I was skeptical in reading other reviews about it the building creaking and moaning. It does, and loudly. I am an early riser, on both mornings I went down to the lobby and outside and back in around 5 am and did not see a desk clerk, even looked around for one. They were there clicking away on their cell phones once breakfast started, not even looking ashamed at using them while on the job. Didn't even get a good bye as I placed my key card in the box as they were too enthralled in their phones. Yes, I said they, there was more than one clerk at the desk when they were there otherwise it was deserted.So, like fake gold, this place looks good on the surface but don't look close or you will be disappointed.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Black Glass Building Cools at Night,I had to rate this average because my 1st night was miserable. I was kept awake all night by a knocking noise which I learned the next morning was due to the building being made of black glass and cooling quickly in the CO night air which made it contract. My second night was perfect. WARNING: Be sure not to get a room on the East side of the building.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Room not as advertised,"I'm a Platinum member and have stayed at numerous Hyatt properties, including Hyatt Places. I specifically booked a room in this Hyatt Place for me and my cousin so we could have the extra space of ""the separate sleeping and living areas, including our Cozy Corner with sofa sleeper, perfect to sit back and relax."" Our room had no ""cozy corner"" or separate living area. It was just a standard hotel room with a bed pushed against one wall and a desk against the other, and a small loveseat and chair at the end of the room under the window. I've never stayed at a Hyatt Place configured like this -- I'm used to what they show in the pictures. It's very odd that reality doesn't match up with what they advertise.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Awesome with one exception,"Great value. Clean, friendly and professional staff, spacious and comfortable rooms. Breakfast was great if you stayed away from the French toast and waffles. They were stale, cold, dried out and so hard a knife had trouble cutting through. But, rest of breakfast items were wonderful!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Stay,"I found this hotel from a Google search, and the location and price were great.  I was pleasantly surprised at how modern, clean, spacious, and beautiful my room was.  (I've stayed there twice now.)  The value for the money was incredible, especially considering the generous and wonderful free breakfast.  One morning, I missed the free one, so I purchased one.  The food was incredibly worth it.  I also got a late night dinner there, and again - completely delicious food.  The staff was gracious, friendly and helpful, and I've already recommended this hotel to many others who might be visiting Denver.   Oh yes - and quiet!  A quiet, restful room is important to me, and this hotel is so wonderful for a great night's sleep.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,a week in hell,Horrible experience--start to finish..I quit Hyatt as a customer after 30 years. Good bye...I'll take Marriot or Ritz. The management was difficult to deal with and seemed afraid they weren't going to get paid for the stay even though we gave them our credit card and platinum passport and called the Hyatt CEO office during the stay. Stay away from Hyatt...too inconsistent from franchise to corporate locations.,1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Solid stay,"This location is close to Washington Park and other cool parts of Denver. I really liked this Hyatt Place as it was on the nicer end of these types of properties. They offer a good breakfast had a good menu for lunch and dinner, very friendly staff, clean rooms, modern feel, updated furniture. I will definitely stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Ask questions before you stay,"While this is a nice hotel in furnishings, and they provide a great breakfast, the advertised free internet connectivity was close to dial-up speed from our hotel room. This is not an establishment, like some hotels, who offer such very basic/slow connectivity for free and charge for higher speeds; theirs was just not working as advertised. They were aware of the issue and were anticipating a repair (timeline unknown). The building itself it not terribly quiet. In addition to some adjacent room and hallway noise, the building seems to 'creak' as it warms and cools during the morning and evening. There are some 'fit and finish' details that are wanting, too: shower head (either spray everywhere, or very concentrated), sink faucet (spout barely reaches over edge of sink), and the sliding glass door to the bathroom seemed to close dangerously fast. These made our stay disappointing for the dollar value.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Stay,"We stayed here with our two kids (6 & 7).  The room was fine, there was a pull out couch for the kids to sleep on which was great!  Breakfast the first day (Friday) was great.  A huge selection of pastries, breads and hot items.  We're an early to rise family so having it at 6:30 was great for us.  The second day (Saturday) was a different story.  We went down at 7:00 and they didn't have anything out yet.  But they were working on it.  A pool would have been a plus, but not a deal breaker!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Cherry Creek - Denver,"Convenient location, well priced and fairly good amenities, but the hotel has a noise problem that is a nightmare!  For some reason, the building ""settles"" at night as the temperature changes and it sounds like birds are hitting the windows.  I've asked for higher floors, lower floors, mountain side, non-mountain - nothing helps.  They need to do something.  Yes, I'm a light sleeper, but I can't possibly be the only one.  Big disappointment because I'm in Denver a lot and I like to always stay in a Hyatt whenever possible.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"For its price, it should be nice. ","I booked a different hotel for our stay in Denver. I didnt bother to check but after I read the reviews I changed my mind. I found Hyatt Place in Denver Cherry Creek. What are the plus points? Location - close to a lot of shopping, night life and nice area. Its a little pricey but you cant complain. Our room was big with a living room separated from the sleeping area,  2 televisions, white crisp linens & clean. I liked the glass door to the toilet and bath. They have a nice fitness center. 👍👍👍👍",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,hotel review,"hotel too expensive for the type of accommodations.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice hotel,"Great Hyatt experience as usual. Clean rooms, friendly staff, good location, reasonable prices for in-room dining. Only issue is that the building and surroundings seemed rather old. I would stay again and recommend it.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place - Cherry Creek,Very nice location and hotel. Very close to Cherry Creek shopping center and nearby parks. Short drive to downtown Denver.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Place,"We have stayed at several hotels in this area while visiting family. This is , by far, the best. Clean, comfortable, and quiet. . Very helpful staff. It was easy to get in and out of. The breakfast was great and would have cost quite a bit at other places. The room was impeccably clean. We were grateful to be on a floor with an ice machine. Some floors do not have them.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Service difference,"I travel for work a LOT and I've been in Denver for a while. I have stayed in quiet a few hotels in a different cities and/or countries for job or pleasure (including budget choices). This hotel is good brand, pretty looking and convenient location for me for work. They have a few very helpful and nice staff but service in general is not good. If there is a problem some staff will instruct you how to resolve your issue with the attitude ""it's not my fault so get over it"" Then.... after the third time staying here I got to checked in at a floor where people is too LOUD and I didn't get the mountain view that I booked. So I in general I'd say This hotel is pretty looking and convenient but... Quiet a bit disappointed!!!!",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice hotel,"Great accommodations for the price. Hotel is modern and clean. Breakfast in the morning provides quite a variety with healthy options.

Not as walkable as we had thought initially, but there is a Whole Foods just down the street!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Overpriced, but nice","The hotel was very nice and had everything we needed, except a pool.  The room had a couch and arm chair with a swivel TV. There was also a refrigerator, but no microwave or room safe. Plenty of plugs and TV had hookups. Breakfast was nicely presented, but was the same food I would find at a hotel for $100 less.  The bathroom had a glass (frosted door) that was difficult to close and lock in the middle of the night without waking others. We rented a movie which turned out to be $17.99, which is more than you pay at the theater.  The staff was very nice and accommodating.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,No to shaby for work,"Better than average for work, working a trade show. When your doing a trade show its nice to have a good place to kick your shoes off. PF Changs is within walking dist as well as other great restaurant. you wont be disappointed.",4

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Friendly and Concerned Staff,"Front desk personnel very easy to communicate with by telephone.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Perfect Place to Enhance Your Colorado Vacation,"My husband and I have enjoyed this hotel for 2 years in a row. We travel frequently, and rarely stay in the same place twice. Hyatt Cherry Creek offers the following: magnificent view of the mountains; courteous and helpful staff; wide variety at the daily buffet breakfast - rivals most breakfast restaurants; spacious, clean rooms with a huge bathroom - internet never went down from our room and we have always been in the upper stories. The breakfast and room comfort make this hotel cost friendly. We would highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,No Experience Hotel Check-In Counter Staff,"It's common practice that hotel will ask your contact information, like phone, email and address, but they will just use them for their email promotion.  They won't use that as a communication tool for any special situation happened at the hotel, like problems with their pumping, they will not use phone, text or email to contact the guest in advance, to make sure they aware of the situation and will move the guest to other hotel.  They just wait till the guest arrived at the hotel, wasting their travel time, then informed that guest needed to move to other hotel which required to drive another 15 mins away.  If they could use phone, text or email to inform earlier, guest would have gone to the other hotel directly.Secondly, the check-in staff didn't confirm the reservation with the other hotel in front of the guest, just asked the guest if she would like to stay there for 1 night or 2 nights.  The guest preferred to stay at the same hotel for 2 nights without moving, but then when guest arrived at the other hotel and found out that they are full on the 2nd night.  Then the guest has to stay 1 night in each hotel causing tons of troubles.All the above could be avoided if they could wisely make use of PHONE, TEXT, or EMAIL to communicate with the guest, I am sure guest would feel more comfortable with their care using nowadays technology.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Wow, not really good.","Let's start of with the really bad:  their smoking section is directly in front of the front door.  We had to walk through nine people smoking like it was 1947 before we could check in.  That is not a joke.  Who in the world wants to smell like cigarette smoke, other than smokers?  Absolutely nasty.  Move the damn smoking section.We stayed on an upper floor, and the window of the room rattled all night and early morning long.  We called the front desk, and basically we were told to ""deal with it.""   ""How does a guest deal with rattling windows?"", l asked.  The response was nothing but silence.Check-in was quick and easy. The front desk agent  thay checked us in was very friendly.  The location of the hotel is nice, and easy to get to.  The bed was comfortable.The free breakfast was rather good.  The selection of food - stuffs was nice as well.We definitely will NOT stay at this hotel again.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,great for family travel and business trips,"I love the convenient setup of the lobby. There's a cafeteria (free BF) and a bar on one side, and a computer room and lunge area on the other. All of it very well lit and comfortable.Staff is super friendly. My only gripe was the hardness of the pillows (they offer two kinds on the bed) and the mattress, though it's not enough of an issue that I would not stay here again. I definitely recommend this place.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Meh,"I used points to stay here so it's hard to judge value but I'm guessing one night here is close to a couple hundred bones. Just cause it's in Cherry Creek doesn't make it 5 star. The room was clean (with the exception of some kind of palm print on the bathroom door glass panel). Comfortable bed. Noise from the hallway was a small negative. Complimentary breakfast was disappointing. French toast was cold and leathery. Eggs looked like they took the powdered stuff, add water in a pan and stuck it in the steamer. The girls running things in the back were too busy on their phones to replenish things that were consumed like cream for the coffee. Service was friendly. Wifi was incredibly slow and I lost connectivity frequently.No pool.  Pet friendly but pricey deposit of $75. Would go elsewhere if had other options that would take pets.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good business hotel!  No pool for kids.,Nice enough hotel.  It was clean and close to Cherry Creek shopping center.  We enjoyed our stay.  We really liked that it was close to several decent restaurants and in an easy part of town.  No pool tho.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Fine business hotel,"This was recommended as half-way between the airport and the meeting site.  It felt like it was in the middle of sprawling nowhere.*Comfortable rooms and lobby, with a good breakfast included, there was a surprising amount of sound transfer from other rooms and the corridor -- doors slamming, people talking -- which would have been worse if not covered by the HVAC. There is no room service.  The evening staff forgot my order until I asked for an update after waiting 40 minutes for a bowl of soup.Check-in and check-out were easy and straightforward.Room wifi was terrible: all but impossible to get any work done.  After a second night of it I called the front desk to see if it was a system problem.  The response was the hotel was full.  Huh?  It was full, therefore a lot of people were using it.  Not good thing for a business hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good hotel - not great location,We booked this hotel understanding it to be close to Cherry Creek Shopping Centre (Mall). It's conveniently close by car - not at all walkable (luckily we had a car.) Cherry Creek is a nice area is you want to stay outside down town Denver. We did have an unfortunate incident in that the smoke alarm went off at 6am and the hotel was evacuated - for us that meant 8 flights. The hotel staff weren't great about keeping their customers informed about the situation. Other than that - which was largely beyond the control of the staff - it was a good hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,As nice as on the pictures,"This hotel was really nice, from the rooms, to service or the lobby. The rooms were in my opinion as nice as on the photos, I have very rarely experienced that in a hotel. The staff was really friendly. Everything was really clean and nice. My parents are going to Denver in the fall and I will deficiently book them in this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Ok place to stay,"Positives:  Mostly friendly staff.  Room décor was nice.  Bedding clean.  Having a sofa was great for family sitting instead of the usual one to two chairs.  View of the mountains was nice.  Convenient free parking was a big plus.  Breakfast was fine.  Not far from places to eat and the freeway.Negatives:  Building makes noises late into the night from cooling down.  Rooms are noisy, we heard the people on both sides of us, their conversations and snoring.  Can hear other rooms use their bathrooms.   Floor in the room was dirty and wasn't vacuumed at all during our 5 night stay.  Bathroom was moderately clean, really needs attention to detail like the backsplash, Kleenex holder and flip lid on the trash can were filthy.  poor lighting in the bathroom for makeup application and the frosted glass door lets too much light in the room for others that are sleeping. Breakfast area tables need to be cleaned off, I realize lots of people are in and out for breakfast but we sat at dirty tables and chairs all week.  Asked both housekeeping and the front desk one day for a couple extra wash cloths and never received them.Upon check out my bill had a charge on for wine that we did not order.  I suggest you check that the room number someone gives to charge something to is verified.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Almos everything we had hoped for,"The hotel was clean, free breakfast and parking was a bonus, unfortunately the first person we had to interact with was HORRIBLE. The weekend gentleman that worked at the front desk in the morning was rude and arrogant.  His customer service skills left little to be desired. If you took him out of the equation the hotel was actually very nice.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,In a few words,"The hotel location is next to most hotels in the area and the hotel Hyatt place Denver facilities are one of the average in the region.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great Hotel, unfortunately worthless internet","I liked everything about this hotel, except the internet connection.   We had a nice, comfortable room, the hotel is recently renovated and is clean and well furnished.  The breakfast is good (by hotel continental breakfast standards).  Unfortunately the internet in the hotel was worthless.  Not just a little slow - but completely unusable much of the time.   I was not able to get email, or connect to even simple websites much of my stay.  When I asked at the front desk, I was told that when the hotel is full, the internet doesn't work well.  A full hotel should be the minimum design criteria!  Unfortunately, as much as I liked every other aspect of the hotel, internet access is critical to me for my work, so I would not stay at this particular location again.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Business meeting,"This property is recently updated and is clean but minimal. There is no safe in the rooms. The free breakfast is adequate and convenient, not bad for the typical included hotel breakfast buffet. This property is not conveniently located. There are several lower end restaurants with in walking distance but no shopping or entertainment. It is okay for business meetings.  A quick taxi ride gets you to the Cherry Creek mall.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not quite 5 star but close...,"Our recent stay in Denver brought us to Hyatt Place in Cherry Creek. We were only in for 2 night but we enjoyed them both. The hotel has a good location in south Denver in a safe neighborhood. The onsite free parking was a plus as well. The gym was small with a few treadmills, a couple recumbents, an elliptical, and a stationary bike, along with some Dumbbells. It was adequate for my needs however. The complimentary breakfast was decent. It varied between both mornings slightly. The staff there were very polite and helpful.   The only 2 big negatives were involving the bathroom. It has no fan to keep mirrors from steaming and the door was a frosted glass sliding door that let light into the room which could disrupt a sleeping partner. Otherwise it was a very clean hotel in a good location out of the downtown area.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Clean, comfortable, and convenient","Very pleasant stay in this hotel that's convenient to Cherry Creek Mall, lots of good restaurants, etc.  Staff was helpful at check-in.  Breakfast was okay, but nothing special. Snack area in lobby was convenient.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Views / Great Rooms / Great Staff,"We were in Denver for our son's wedding and essentially made the HP Cherry Creek our 'headquarters'-hotel. With an impeccable staff (Umir, Jon, Oksana and the impeccable GM James Brown) we experienced a great stay.  2 rooms for a week, consistently great service, housekeeping quality and above all, a greatly caring staff.  Hotel has a great location on one of the major (South to North) Colorado Avenue, if you (want to) avoid the crowded freeways.  Free parking, free gorgeous views of the Rockies, all plusses. Fast elevators, good soundproofing, the great standards of Hyatt amenities and linens all contribute to a quality hotel.One slight regret is that no swimming pool was present in the hotel as we thought that was as standard at all Hyatt Places?  The fitness center was adequate and sufficient.The entire team of Galley Hosts could not have been more helpful and I want to especially recognize them for their tireless work accommodating large groups of breakfast guests.We enjoyed the hotel so much and will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great location, free breakfast and nice area of town","This was a really great hotel in just about every way...except the internet speed. During busy times it goes nowhere.  If it weren't for that it would be a five. Room is nice and cool, pull out couch bed perfect for me and two kids to each have our own bed plus perfect area for building a pillow fort for the kids! About 15 mins away from Elitch Gardens, museums, aquarium, etc. Tons of great restaurants nearby.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Just what you expect, a convenient location on S. Colorado","I have stayed at several of the Hyatt Place hotels and have not been disappointed, this location is no exception. Clean, updated finish and furnishings throughout. The breakfast service is busy, but there was always enough food and space to sit comfortably. No complaints. The room was clean and well-appointed divided into separate sleeping and living spaces which is ideal for getting the kids to nap or bed. My family has 2 small kids and stayed here for a weekend getaway to go to the Zoo and the Natural Science Museum. Both were easy to get to from the hotel and there is lots of other activities to be considered with the Cherry Creek shopping district also within a short drive. Signage for the hotel is visible on a neighboring tower which serves as an easy landmark for an out-of-town visitor. Parking is on an open lot with enough room and clearance to handle a lifted vehicle, trailer, etc., but there isn't a secure garage.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Provided surprisingly excellent accomodations,"First time staying at a Hyatt Place.  Check-in was smooth, room very clean and well appointed, and the breakfast  buffet provided traditional options with above average quality.  Fresh cut fruit in addition to the eggs (two choices), sausage, waffles, etc.  Great breakfast area for eating and reading the paper.  A number of options to walk to for eating.  This location is nice, although, you would need to drive to the Cherry Creek district for shopping and eating/drinking at the Cherry Creek establishments.  We did not drink at the bar, but they do have a small one in the lobby which is a nice touch.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great location,"I stayed at this hotel during my son's lacrosse tournament at DU.  This hotel was cheaper than the hotel where my son and the team were staying but was close by.  The central location of the Hyatt allowed easy driving access to DU, parks, Botanic Gardens, Nature and Science Museum, downtown Denver, the mall, and restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Location Location Location,Second Stay at this hotel. Cherry Creek Mall is very close with hana for sushi nearby. Free parking is nice. Discovered Gaylord St near hotel off Mississippi. Ate in a different place each night. Agave taco bar is gr8. Even tried the cactus tacos- not bad.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,What a view,"We stayed in this hotel October 2014 and it was very nice.Great part of colorado, easy to get everywhere, the stadium, downtown, etc....The stay included breakfast and it was worth the inclusion.Our room had a spectacular view of the mountains, wow. Loved it.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Amazing for a weekend getaway,After a five hr drive to Denver it is nice to have a great hotel room with awesome staff. We were having some credit card issues and they were very patient with us. The room is very clean you can tell that the housekeepers want to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  They even have a regular blow dryers for anyone sick of hauling their own around. We will stay here on our next vacation and I would suggest it to anyone who is heading to Denver. The view is incredible,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,?,"You have very firm bed that I enjoy and give me a good night sleep specially traveling.  Enjoyed your breakfast service and verity choices of the food.  Room were clean but the toilet seat cover is broken; I have to put it a side of the floor (?).  As woman I have to put make up on in the morning;but how I do it unless go to the window where I can  have enough light to see what I am doing?  May I  suggest A LIGHTED MIRROR ON THE WALL(Adjustable ) So that other woman can also put eye makeup on  Note: It is easy to installed as my house's bathroom has been installed.    Thank you,",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good choice,"Hotel is clean, quiet, and breakfast is very good with many options including healthy choices. Outside of hotel facing West makes noise in late afternoon and evening when it cools down making for a continual noise late into the night. Hotel is conviently located to many restaurants and I-25.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Cherry Creek Hotel in Denver,"With our daughter living very close by, this was a great place to stay - comfortable, well maintained, great breakfast. The location was convenient to many sites within the city and to the freeway system for traveling to surrounding areas.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place Colorado Blvd,Recently redone. Rooms are very clean and quite. Have stayed at the Hotel several times and the quality is consistently strong. The breakfast was disappointing on this stay but that was a first. Free parking is a plus over downtown,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Location! Location! Location!,"Hyatt Place Cherry Creek couldn't be better situated in a very trendy modern area of Denver.  In addition, the atmosphere within the hotel as well as the room itself were very inviting.  I wish we could have stayed longer.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,The Hyatt with a lot of potential,"This is a fantastic little Hyatt nestled in the heart of Denver's University mecca.   The hotel is bustling with sports teams from all around the country.  And the staff is equally young and energetic and super-friendly.   They are anything but intrusive, like some stuffier Hyatt's can be.    But don't be fooled by the chillaxed atmosphere of the lobby.   The rooms are spectacular. I stayed in a suite fit for a king, priced for a pauper.  The cleanliness was to be admired.    They even serve a free breakfast that could have rivalled the Tea Room at the Plaza Hotel in New York.  The only thing missing was the champagne.    The downside?  The restaurant, or food menu, as they call it, left a lot to be desired.    But why stay indoors in a hotel when you're in such an outdoorsy city?    We were there for a wedding, but there was plenty to do beside attend rehearsal dinners and receptions.   Nearby Colorado Avenue was bustling with students and lots of great eateries and hangouts and Floyd's famous hair salon if you wanted a cut by some cool stylists for $9.  It was a very affordable area.    You could seriously save some major bucks by hanging nearby when visiting your son or daughter in college.  The youthful energy was contagious.     There's a real buzz in the air that you could measure on a yardstick, in the area.    Besides serving the free breakfast every single morning, fit for King's, the best part of the hotel was that it's far enough off the beaten path - by just a few hundred feet - to garner peace and tranquility- day or night.    The beds were ultra-comfortable.  The pillows were filled with goose-down feathers.  And I had two huge flat screen television sets with the latest movies to choose from, if I just wanted to relax.   Plus free HBO.    If you're traveling with family, the fridge in the room was large enough for soda and sandwiches or bottled water and organic trail mixes.    There was a powerful free wi-fi connection and a young and exuberant staff to meet your every whim.     But, like I said, this part of Denver is all about being outdoors.   At the end of the day, it's good to know that you picked one of the most splendid and affordable places to crash to sleep.     And your friends or sons and daughter's are just a couple of hundred feet away.     Renting a car is a must, if you want to leave the neighborhood and visit nearby areas, drive to ski or visit the beautiful town of Breckenridge to go horseback riding in the mountains.   Groupon had great offers for things like that at 1/4 of the price.     The short of it is that you'll be really happy you chose this hotel.  Especially if you're visiting the kids at school.  Or came down to surprise them for a big game.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very good for long term stays,"I stayed there on work for 5 weeks and it was a very pleasant stay.Breakfast (free) was quite sufficient with decent variety, they had free parking and the staff was very accomodating. They even got me a microwave from the kitcheck when I explained that for the duration of my stay, it would be a useful thing to have.Location is also central, safe and has a lot of restaurants and places to hangout near by.Overall I would recommend this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,very nice hotel in a nice neighbourhood,"I stayed at the Cherry creek Hyatt for 5 nights during a conference. I loved everything during my stay. My only complaint was the noise that came from the conference rooms in my floor. The rooms were clean and spacious. I had my dog with me and there was a fee for this, which was reasonable for 5 days. There was a good selection of free breakfast everyday which I enjoyed. There's also a bar and an espresso machine serving starbucks for extra charge. The staff were friendly. For those of you who has not been to this neighbourhood: There is a walgreens, VCA at walking distance. There are plenty of restaurants on the street in walking distance.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good For a Few Nights,"This is not the Ritz or the Four Seasons...its a Hyatt PLACE which is a tier down from a regular Hyatt which means if your looking for white glove service you will not find it here. However, that being said, what you will find here are modern, large, comfortable rooms, a great breakfast buffet which is normally included with the room, and a convenient location. A step above a Hampton Inn or a Holiday Inn Express. If your looking for top notch personalized service, stay in Downtown Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very Comfortable Hotel,"I stayed at Hyatt Place for one night of a business trip.  The area is rather mixed with some apartments, commercial and office buildings.  The hotel itself was a great surprise.  The room was very large and comfortable with a king bed and couch.  The bathroom had a stall shower and was spacious.  I had plenty of room on the counter for all of my makeup, etc.  It was very quiet and I slept well.  I used the work-out room which was well equipped and clean.  Another nice aspect of this hotel is the complimentary breakfast.  There were several hot options as well as cereal, fresh fruit, bread items and numerous drink choices.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs to be in the Cherry Creek area.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Lovely hotel ,"This is a nice hotel. Very comfortable room and nice to have the sofa to sit on instead of just the bed. My only complaint was we ordered some food and it was suppose to be ready in 10 minutes, but if they called, it never went through, so it was cold by the time we got it. Also, there was a family next door with a very colicky baby and it would have been better, if they were booked in a room further away from other guests ( there were a number of rooms available). But, besides these two glitches, we had a lovely stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 5 days recently. I really enjoyed my stay and thought I made the right pick. The hotel is quite small, the restaurant and front desk staff are pretty much the same. The room I got was spacious, clean, well appointed. My only gripe about it is the lack of black out curtains because the lights from the street bothered me at night. There was a decent free breakfast with the usual continental fare. They have no restaurant but there is a ""gallery kitchen"" that's essentially 24 hr self serve bar(you call for your order then you pick it up at the bar. No room service). I liked my monte cristo sandwich. The bar is open until midnight, guests usually hang out downstairs, their staff is very friendly and accommodating. There is free parking which is great for me. This is probably one hotel where you would need your own vehicle. There are no ""walkable"" restaurants. The convention center and downtown are at least 5 miles away.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great breakfast,"I've stayed here twice in the past year. In October 2014 for a tennis tournament that I took some high school boys to and again this past weekend (May 2015) to visit a friend who was staying there from out of town on a work trip. Check in process is very easy. Depending on what you are in Denver for this is a good location. The main road it's off, Colorado, has everything you can ever need. The Cherry Creek mall is just a few miles away.  It is a bit of a jaunt to downtown, but taking back roads during rush hour you can get there in 20 minutes so that's not too bad. Also very close to the zoo and some museums.The hotel was quiet and the beds are very comfortable. The rooms are spacious with a couch area for watching TV which is nice. Toiletries they provide include shampoo, conditioner, lotion and bar soap.The best part of this hotel though is their breakfast. On the weekends it's not as good though. I'd been there a Friday morning in October and they have GREAT breakfast sandwiches along with a variety of fruit, yogurt, breads and bagels, donuts, eggs, meat, French toast and cereals. But on the weekend they don't have the breakfast sandwiches which was disappointing on this last stay. Everything else was the same and they had scrambled eggs and sausage still for hot breakfast along with French toast.There is also a bakery and bar there where you can purchase additional treats and drinks.I would recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Enjoyed our stay,"The reviews that led to our staying here were accurate.  This place is new-ish and is clean and the staff is nice.   The beds were comfortable and we did not have to wait for elevators to get to our room.   Having a clean place is very important, and it was also quiet.   They have a place you can buy snacks and small food items in the lobby and I recommend the chocolate chunk cookies.   I would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Little Pricey for a weekend,"A former Lowe's Hotel that didn't ""make it."" In its rebirth the room we had was spacious and comfortable. The bed was so sleep able and the floor was quiet. Our particular stay seemed pricey when compared to the Hyatt's downtown and at the Tech Center.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Recent Stay,"Clean, quiet, and had all the amenities I wanted in a hotel. Recently stayed for a weekend in Denver. The location of the hotel was convenient to major roadways to get where I wanted to go. The staff were friendly and accommodating, both during check-in and during the stay. Parking is abundant and no problem finding a spot close to the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,weekend,"Nice accomodations, pretty good free breakfast.  The hotel is near Cherry creek shopping.  Free parking was appreciated. We had a modern, updated room with a great mountain view.  Since we were just there for a weekend night, we didn't use the other facilities or services offered.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Loved it,We arrived in denver for my husbands bday weekend I surprised him with tickets to the bronco/49 er game. Loved the hotel the customer service was excellent the breakfast was excellent!!! We loved how convince the hotel was by everything. When we go back we will definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Clean hotel with good breakfast..,"Clean hotel with acceptable room size. It has sleeping sofa in the room, which I enjoyed for relaxing and watching tv... Window can be noisy due to wind blowing that causes like knocking sound on the window, very annoying!!! Not be able to receive the final invoices when check out, did get it 1 day after check out... Probably the hotel being so paranoid for having the room being broken down or something stolen... Others than these issues, everything else are fine and great...",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Centrally locatedd and they had a room,Hyatt Place Cherry Creek is centrally located and they had a room when I needed it.  I had booked a room across town but without knowing the area or the hotel.  So Hyatt saved me from sleeping in a very seedy joint.  I generally like Hyatt for their comfortable rooms and great customer service. Exactly what I got here at Cherry Creek.  The wifi room internet is slow like many other travel hotels.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Customer service needs improvement,"We actually enjoyed the room, the beds were comfortable too. Wasn't as noisy as others have complained about but I assume we just lucked out. When we arrived 2 girls at the desk brought us back to high school with their behavior. One has received complaints in other reviews, you'll spot her right away.  If you're a male she'll treat you decent. Could have been a perfect stay if the nice manager would have a welcoming staff at the desk.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Denver Stay,"very load and could everyone in the floor above you,  kids running through the halls to a point the copes were called to see what was going.  it might not be the hotels fault due the 420 conference that was conducted that weekend,",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice hotel outside city center,"Stayed here for a week for business and was overall satisfied.   The staff at the Hyatt was EXTREMELY nice and helpful, the rooms were immaculately clean, the beds were very comfy and there were plenty of towels, including larger bath towels. I had a rental car and there was plenty of free parking, and you didn't have to go through the trouble of getting a parking pass when you checked in, which was nice.   While I was mostly happy and there were a lot of pros, there are some odd things that were cons.  No room service, and when you order food from the 24-hour-gallery you have to pick it up at reception, which is kind of weird.   (That said, the food was pretty good, especially for how cheap it was).  The bathroom was oddly designed overall -- as if people didn't really pay attention to how you would USE things, only how they would look --though it was functional.  Lastly, the location is not inside Denver, but outside the city about a half hour from the airport.   So I wouldn't recommend this if you want to be in the middle of it all.   But it is not in the middle of nowhere -- there are plenty of eating options and stores very close by.Overall, it was a good stay.  I would stay again if traveling there for work.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Space and ambiance,"Rooms are large for the price and the breakfast is free and really good. One of the few places I have stayed where I didn't feel like having to clean the bathroom myself upon check-in. If you don't like the smell of marijuana, cover your nose in the public spaces.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Best stay in Cherry Creek Denver area!,"Wow. I enjoyed my brief, overnite stay at this Hyatt while on a business trip in Denver. The decor is modern and clean. The staff welcomed me right away and quickly checked me in my room. I really appreciated such friendly service after a long and demanding work day. The room had a great view overlooking the city. I LOVED the bathroom the most. The multi level shower head was awsome! It was stocked with plenty of towels and toiletries and plenty of vanity space. The bed SO comfy. The pillows were better than other hotels but I think they could still do better. They have plenty of free parking  and near a bus stop if using public transit. The hotel is in a great location. Just 1 block up is Colorado Blvd (easy walkable) which has many options for all budgets and tastes for eating. Another bonus--this Hyatt knows how to host a breakfast spread. Definately worth getting up a lil' earlier for.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice,"The decor is modern which I REALLY like.  Frosted glass sliding barn door style bathroom door.  Heavy glass shower door.

Price is a little higher than we normally like to spend",4

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel!,"Stayed here for a work trip. Very clean, staff is very friendly and knowledgeable,  and complimentary breakfast was a plus! Not in an area where you can walk to much, but everything is a short cab ride away. The front desk even arranged for a private car to take me to the airport,  as it was less expensive than a taxi. Very pleasant experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent experience alla round,"Spent two nights on a business trip in late March and other than a late arrival of a booked cab, all was excellent. Very comfortable bed. Spacious and modern bath. Wonderful shower. Perfect breakfast, with both selection and quality. Casual, informal but attentive staff. Hyatt Place has been, in general, a very good value ""one step below"" the mother Hyatt chain.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,The Staff makes all the difference!,I knew this hotel when it was a Loews and stayed there many times. This was the first time I stayed since turning to a Hyatt. Over-all very nice and I really enjoyed the staff members as well and the breakfast offer each morning. My only complaint was housekeeping. My room had old soap in the shower from a past guest and a lot of hair on the bathroom vanity when I checked in. I didn't say anything at the time because I was rushed and had to get to an appointment. I like the concept of the hotel and it was very nice for the business traveler. The amenities such as complimentary Wi-Fi is just the best! I would return and hope that the Housekeeping issue was a one-off,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Mile High Stay,The Hyatt Place is a nice place to stay for one night or several while in Denver.  It is in excellant condition and conveniently located.  It is near a lot of shopping and convenient to the highway for traveling down town.  Easy check in and out and friendly staff.  There is a lobby bar and snack couter as well as 24hr. room service menu.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,GOOD HOTEL & GREAT FREE BREAKFAST,"This was my first stay at this hotel.  Booked thru Hotels.com for $110.  the hotel is clean and modern.  The room was more that acceptable.  The bed was confortable and had a fridge to store munchies.  Cherry Hill is a nice part of town with lots of restaurants.  For me, the biggest surprise was the free breakfast.  Two different types of cooked eggs, french toast and all the usual other suspects.  Great breakfast and great value.  I would defintely stay again.",4

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A Mediocre Night,"If you are looking for just a hotel to stay in for the night, this is the hotel for you. This hotel is in great location to nearby restaurants. While the staff was, in general, helpful, they did not provide an exceptional nor memorable service. You feel like just another guest rather than anyone exciting or special. The room was somewhat clean besides finding a few stray hairs in the bed and couch. The rooms are in a nice modern style that look are esthetically appealling. Breakfast was nothing extraordinary but fulfills your hunger needs. Overall, this hotel was perfect for a one night stay. It's wonderful if you do not plan spending too much time in the hotel it is a great place to sleep for the night.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great Value, Great Location","Our daughter attends DU.  We enjoy staying in a hotel near Cherry Creek to be close to the university, restaurants, and shopping.  College students always need something when parents visit.  Right?  The room was comfortable and clean and of average size and offered FREE WIFI!  The front desk is managed by two young men from Turkey who were attentive and eager to assist.  This hotel does not have a concierge, so you'll be taking up your own bags, but they do have a luggage cart.  There is plenty of free parking.  I was snowing and there was a covered parking that we didn't seem to have access to.  All of the guests were forced to park in the open lot in the snow.  Breakfast was included each morning.  It was adequate -- scrambled eggs, bacon/sausage, oatmeal, bagels, toast, fruit . . . They also had drip and specialty coffee.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"bad internet, mediocre service","Very disappointing experience, stayed in this hotel 3 nights, very weak internet, and arrogant approach from hotel personnel.Was not able to work on my computer.Nothing I have seen that I would like to stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,PLEASANT SURPRISE!!,"What a terrific find. I was there for a family emergency, with my 80 year old Mother, not a pleasure trip. Needless to say, I was not looking forward to our stay. The staff could not have been more helpful & pleasant. The room was great- large, clean & totally updated. Karmen at the front desk suggested we eat at Elways one night & we ended up with lots of leftovers. The next day Umet (at the front desk) set up a microwave for us & left out dishes, silverware & napkins. We had the entire dining room to ourselves- lovely lunch overlooking a park. We used all their services, including laundry & the fabulous restaurant. The flatbread with pepperoni & the cheese platter were delicious! The Manager, James Brown (yes, that's his name!) was visible, on-site & extremely concerned with service. I was SO happy that I chose this Hotel. They really turned our trip around & I can't say enough about the lovely staff & rooms.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Bare bones hotel with bare bones service,"If your looking for an inexpensive hotel with minimal ammenities, this is your place. Rooms are ok and modern/ minimalesc. Service is amenable, but very limited on what they offer. Gym is crap. Fortunately, it is close to anything you would need to eat, buy or do.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not bad for the convinence,"Had a bit of trouble checking in at the hotel on the first day. Hotel says they couldn't find my reservation from Hotels.com so we had to go around and around for about 1 hour with all parties to finally figure out what to do. The hotel does not staff night managers so made it even more difficult to resolve issues. After that issue, we were given a room with a view and our stay was pleasant.The rooms were nicely appointed. The room we had the sofa area was an extension of the room rather than the pictured rooms with a separator wall. I would think that layout would make the room feel larger. Kudos on all the plugs in the room. There's an outlet plug all corners of the room. The bathroom had 2 bad designs that I was annoyed with. One was the faucet was way to far from the sink. Second the toilet paper is way too far from the toilet. Love the large window with the black out curtain. It's central AC so very quiet in the room. Breakfast was fantastic. They had a good combination of hot and cold breakfast items. Parking is free however it's open air parking. Can't imagine what an out-of-towner would do if they are from CA and there were snow on their rental car?  Location was decent. Convenient to the freeway but the neighborhood wasn't all that great. Would have liked it better if it was closer to the nicer Cherry Creek area. It's a pricey hotel considering the neighborhood but the free wifi, breakfast and parking makes up for it.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Convenient,Stayed for two nights. Very good location for our purpose. Neighborhood basic suburbia.easy parking. We did not feel unsafe. Room was clean w lots of towels.Breakfast ample. Front staff helpful.Mountain view room a must. Would stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very pleasant stay,"I selected this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews. We had a good experience.  It is modern, clean, and very quiet, in spite of the busy street 1/2 mile west.  Staff were very attentive.  Quick and efficient check-in. Breakfast was much better than most at hotels offering included breakfast. The room was not the conventional lay-out, but a more friendly one (I asked for a mountain view). My only complaint was the nearly non-existent wifi signal in the room - which the desk clerk said he would have checked on.  (But I was not traveling on business, and the signal was strong in the breakfast area, so not to worry on this trip.)",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Welcoming Staff,"Spotless and sunny common areas, with a nice bar and dining area.  Very easy to entertain clients and friends in the bar and common lounge area.   Rooms are spacious and spotless. We were here for 3 nights with our two little dogs while undergoing a move, and we will stay here again when back in town visiting friends and family.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Trending Up...or Down?,"Mature properties have a tough time with this one.  The hotel's common areas are clean and well executed, and the rooms are hanging in there.  Nonetheless, this area just off of Cherry Creek is showing some age and the parking lot doesn't give you a good feeling.  The staff here is first rate and Hyatt good!  Shower only in our room, which was fine with us.  Free Wi-Fi struggles quite a bit - we ended relying upon our 4G hot spot.  The bed - not quite ""Hyatt great"".  If the rate looks better than more perfect locations - you are good to go!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice & Comfortable,Nice place.  Location was ok.  7-11 across street with other restaurants close.  Beds and pillows were comfortable.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very Disappointing..Much Better Options,"I am a loyal Hyatt member (Diamond). Hyatt is always my first choice..will pay extra for a Hyatt (as opposed to Marriott in the same area). I had a two night reservation but I left a night early because this property is a huge disappointment. The property is situated such that it is dark...attached  to a tall office building.  The room was very disappointing. The thermostat was located behind a sofa and the only way to get to it was to climb over the sofa.  The room was average at best on this category.  Overall location was not  the best..commercial area.Staff provided me with a handicap accessible room and I had to change rooms - I am 6'4""",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good location and facilities ,"We stayed here for two nights while visiting friends. The location has easy access to the interstates as well as downtown. The rooms are clean, the parking lot is safe (we saw police using it as a turn around place) the breakfast is decent. I would recommend staying here. But as you will see on booking sites, the mountain/sowntown view rooms are a few dollars more. We didn't opt for that and the other side of the hotel is a flat view of the suburbs. Nothing bad just nothing to see.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A pleasant surprise.,I booked 3 rooms for 4 nights for our Denver Stay with family. The rooms were all very clean and decor was pleasing and fresh. The hotel was extremely neat and tidy and the staff were all very friendly. The breakfast was also extensive with hot and cold items. It ran from about 6:30-till almost 10am each day-which was good for all the various rising times of guests. I had worried about this Xmas in a hotel stay before we left(first time spending Xmas in such away) but I found it was better then I had hoped and actually kind of relaxing. (no dishes to wash and not beds to change) haha,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Awesome stay ,"We live less than a mile from here but needed a quick place to crash while too much family had overtaken our house for the holidays. The rooms were spotless and amazing. I have an unnatural fear of hotel carpet but our room was really clean. The bed was comfy, the bathroom very modern, and the room was huge. We didn't eat the breakfast but I did take a peek and it was as good as some of the other Hyatt Places I've stayed in. Took a quick banana and coffee to go. The hotel is nice and quiet and in a great location. I'd recommend as it's a top Hyatt Place, in my opinion. Can't say enough!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good for business,"I stayed three nights at the hotel and it was a good experience. Rooms are big and clean, breakfast (included in the tariff) was good, not plenty of choices, but the offer was good in taste and quality. It is located in the Cherry Creek area not far away from the CC mall, it was a short taxi ride. In-room wifi included in the tariff with good signal and quality. Fitness center small, but OK  for a short-stay. Bad weather made difficult to visit the area around the hotel. Front desk staff very helpful and always ready to help.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Nice enough place, good parking and breakfast","We spent 4 nights at this hotel. The room was nicely appointed. Several desk/table top outlets for device charging. Good sized flat panel TV. Good lighting. We were on the top floor which provided quite a nice view on the east side. Exercise equipment was in good shape. Staff was very pleasant. We hit the breakfast room at a peak period one day and I was impressed at how they were hustling to keep everything stocked. Breakfast items included donuts, very small danish, cut up fruit, yogurt, scrambled eggs or breakfast sandwiches, sausage, waffles or french toast, hot and cold cereal, juices, etc.  The elevators were very fast (though the hotel didn't seem very full). The only complaint I might have is that there was no heater in the bathroom. Still, they are very close to my son's house and we would be happy to stay there again",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Nice hotel, comfortable beds, amazing breakfast, pet friendly","My husband and I were visiting his brother's family in Denver over the Thanksgiving holidays and needed a dog-friendly hotel. Hyatt Place Cherry Creek was the perfect choice! The rooms are modern, clean and spacious with comfortable beds and big bathrooms. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and welcomed our 70 lb. full-of-love boxer Tucker with open arms. One girl from the front-desk morning staff even remembered his name and would always pet him on our way out! But the best part, the breakfast...it is definitely not your typical ""continental"" breakfast. They have the usual pastries/bagels/fruit/coffee/juice that you would expect, but every morning there was a different feature. One morning it was french toast and a farmhouse egg scramble, next it was fresh breakfast sandwiches and waffles...so good!! You could tell it was all ""real"" ingredients, just made it that much better. Free wifi and parking are also definite perks. We will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek Is THE Place To Stay,"My husband and I stayed here for four nights during Thanksgiving and it was terrific!  The rooms are spacious and clean, the breakfast was great, and there was free Wi-Fi and free parking.  The hotel is close to many shops and restaurants in the Cherry Creek area.  I will definitely return!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Happy with my choice,"I had to go to Denver on company business and usually stay downtown at the Sheraton.  Unfortunately, all downtown hotels were booked solid for the timeframe I needed, so I ended up at the Hyatt Place Cherry Creek.  I have never stayed at a Hyatt before so I was not sure what to expect although I did check reviews on TripAdvisor and it seemed good.  I was very surprised at the level of accommodation this hotel provides!  First, my room was enormous.  King size bed, sofa sectional, desk and other furniture and still lots of room.  The bathroom was spacious with a shower (no tub) and counter space for all my stuff.  It looked recently updated, all the fixtures were shiny new and the shower tiles and door were spotless.The hotel provides free breakfast and it was really great.  Not the usual stale pastries or boxed cereals, but really nice fresh fruit, 2 types of breakfast sandwich, cereals, yogurt, oatmeal, juice and coffee.  All freshly made and kept stocked and the area clean.I had a couple very minor issues with my stay.  First, when I checked in I specified a room away from the elevator.  This was also noted in my reservation but I always reiterate when I check in.  I am a very light sleeper so I prefer a room as far away from the main traffic as possible.  The front desk person assured me it was.  So I go to the 6th floor, get off the elevator, and my room is right there, across from the elevator.  So I had to go back down and have that changed...again very minor but still an annoyance.  Also, when we had dinner and drinks back at the hotel one evening after our company meetings, I never received a receipt for the food.  The staff was no where to be found and the charges  appeared on my bill when I checked out.  I never signed anything authorizing the charges to my room.  I could've given any room number and had it charged to someone else or disputed them as unauthorized charges if I were  that kind of person!  This is really something they need to fix because I had to call the hotel after I got back and request an itemized copy of the dinner bill for my company to reimburse.  In any event, the hotel is really great, comfortable and newly remodeled to a pretty high standard for the price.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent Value,"I was worried that this hotel would be sub-standard after reading some negative reviews on Tripadvisor but the hotel was very good. My partner was attending a conference so the rate was only $99 per night. Plus, there's free parking, breakfast and wifi. The room, including the bathroom, was quite large with a lovely large window. The biggest negative for me was the location but I guess this is one of the reasons why the price is good.Since this is Denver, the air is very dry. Upon request, staff kindly brought a humidifier to my room (although it was very loud).",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Top of the line,Extremely nice place to stay. It is in a very quiet neighborhood with low traffic. This hotel is not in the Cherry Creek are that is a current traffic nightmare. It is actually in Glendale. Very easy access either via interstate or surface streets. Close to downtown Denver (10 mins). Great mountain views.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great place,"Very nice rooms, nice sitting area with comfy couch and large window overlooking a park in room.Trip to cherry Creek mall today ,easy drive even in snowy weather. Plenty of shops and restaurants close by.Nice staff.Breakfast  had lots of choices and very good!Just off busy  street but convenient and quiet. Ample free parking.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Business Hotel,"Great business hotel.  I stayed on the weekend so it was inexpensive.  Key points; central location (for me), free parking, comfortable and clean room, real breakfast included.  By real I mean it wasn't all packaged food.  The hotel is close to the Cherry Creek path system so if you are a runner or walker its convenient.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Go-To in the Denver area,"Stayed here for two nights on a trip to Denver.  Location is a nice launch-off point especially if also going out of the area.  Although not in the downtown area, it is only a short drive.  Although just off busy street, it was surprisingly quiet and peaceful.  Rooms were updated.  It was slightly different from the usual hyatt place but this was a very welcome change.  Breakfast was a little better here than comparable hotels.  Staff was very friendly and responsive.  Very reasonable price for the quality and location you get.  Definitely one to consider when visiting the Denver and surrounding area unless you have to be smack in the middle of downtown.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good Hotel,"Very Neat rooms, Free Parking, Great staff members. I had a problem with a window blind which broke with I was dragging it down, and they addressed it within minutes. I got to work with Anna, Elite and Steve, who were very serving, welcoming and addressed any issues I had very promptly. The Gym is very clean and smells good (no machine smell). Great breakfast and good location for food and view. It was a great stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel 6 miles from downtown,"I stayed here for work and it had all I needed.  Very comfortable room, full breakfast and free internet. The staff was helpful, lobby bar and large parking lot. Location is close to a main street with tons of restaurants and other shops.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great Hotel ... Convenient Location,"Do not let the dated exterior fool you, this moderately-priced hotel is teeming with the quality and extras that make Hyatt a premier hotel brand.  The hotel is located about a 1/2 block off of Colorado Blvd., in amongst a cluster of fast-food restaurants, gas stations and convenience stores.  The hotel looks as if it may have been an office building.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked inside.  However, once inside, I knew I'd found a gem of a hotel.  The lobby is clean, bright and efficient.  Outfitted with the latest in technology and dining to suit the on-the-go needs of the business and leisure traveler.  Check in was quick and easy.  The staff is pleasant, efficient and eager to accommodate.  My room was spacious ... exceptional in size.  The room had a king-sized…",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wonderful,"We stayed one night, a Friday. The location was easy to find and there was plenty of parking. The room was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and we had a beautiful view from our room of the front range of the Rockies. Although it faced a very busy street, Colorado Boulevard, the room was completely quiet. No problems whatsoever!   The included breakfast was great. Lots of selections, staff kept it well-stocked and there were plenty of places to sit. I would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great stay,Overall a great hotel. The free breakfast was surprisingly good.  The only thing that would have made the stay better was the room stayed a bit warm.  I had the AC on as high as it would go and it was still warmer than I would have liked.,4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Two Nights,"Spent two nights here while visiting our son. Hotel was clean, bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. The staff was friendly and took care of any questions or needs we had. Would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A Pleasant Stay,"I stayed only one night while conducting business at the University of Denver.  Hotel staff was friendly, and the room was spacious and comfortable with a nice mountain view.  The breakfast selection was good.  The location is very convenent to the interstate and several decent restaurants.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice location,"Stayed 4 nights.  Hotel was very clean, breakfast offerings were good and the location was very convenient to local Cherry Creek restaurants and shopping.  The room was spacious but the bed and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable.  Walls were paper thin so if someone was next door you could hear talking.  The people at the front desk were nice but could barely speak any English and couldn't answer any questions which was frustrating.  The front desk person is your first impression of the hotel and this was not good.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Spotless and a great staff,Stayed only one night. A mix-up in the reservation during check-in but corrected quickly by the Manager. Very clean and comfy rooms with the separate living area. A nice small bar in the lounge area. From the bar tender to the manager everyone seemed very friendly and helpful.  Not sure about the location but it appeared to be a nice area. We were only in town a few days for a wedding.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel! Car helpful for sightseeing.,"I stayed for 5 nights. It was great for me. Loved my room and view of the mountains. The room was contemporary and clean. I didn't notice noise in the hallways. The breakfast was very good offering French toast or waffles, sausage links, eggs, fruit, etc. Plenty of seating for breakfast. Free paper if you like. The evening staff seemed to be more comfortable making recommendations for places to eat, sightsee, or directions than the morning staff were. Ample parking. You can easily walk to some quick food places within a couple of blocks. I walked to Old Chicago, which was a Sports bar/pizza type place and good. I saw a Smashburger and some other places nearby too. There's a 7-11 across the street and a Walgreen's within a block. If you don't have a car, it's probably not the easiest place for you if you're planning to sightsee. Oddly, there was a conference of some kind in town and one morning the hotel had a sign up saying that due to it being so busy they couldn't call cabs for you (you'd have to). In other words, they don't have cabs just waiting around the corner. However, if you have a car, it's convenient to Cherry Creek, and relatively easy to freeways, etc. It was only about 30 minutes from Denver Airport. Overall, I liked the Hyatt Place and would stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Review of Hyatt Place - Denver - Cherry Creek,"Excellent hotel to stay at; everything is high quality from the little things to the most important:- Rooms are spacious- Beds are very comfortable- Blinds and shades are high tech and block out all of the light- Hotel is very clean- Very nice continental breakfast- Easy access to Red Rocks amphitheater- Easy access to Cherry Creek shopping and dining- If your in the mood for a good burger, you can walk around the corner to the original Smash Burger- Nice size TV- Even the luggage carts are the highest quality I have ever seen and have large tires which make them easy to push- Door have the touch-less card entry- Plenty of towels- Nice view of the mountains",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,It is rare to find a good manager like Ryan. Most managers don't care anymore,"Yes, it is true that the windows crack and I had troubles with the water pressure. Ryan was amazing at switching me rooms even offering to help me with my move. Through the people at the front desk who were from Turkey were really sweet, I found it difficult for them to understand any special requests or issues. Again, Ryan was amazing at handling all of this. He also continued to be patient, and understanding with a smile. It is rare anymore to get a good manager at a property who really cares. I believe Ryan is one of a kind.. I would return here for sure.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Sleepless Night!,"The Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek was absolutely terrible! We had no running water in the shower and had to leave in the morning without taking a shower. In addition, there are loud crackling noises that keep you awake, particularly when the sun hits the building. We were very disappointed with this property. We travel to Denver quite often and do not recommend this hotel. The manager, Brenda, was very nice and understood our complaints,  indicating that she understood the problem.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great, but out of Town","This Hotel is located a few miles from Downtown (about $25 taxi ride). Quite expensive at $200 per night, but we booked via an Expedia deal with 25% off. The check in staff were very pleasant and helpful. We got a top floor (11th) room, double queen with mountain views - marvellous. Lovely, clean room. Comfortable bed with nice linen. Seating area with a convertible settee. Decent decor. Spacious bathroom. Large modern TV. extensive breakfast buffet menu, which was great on the first morning (Saturday) when it was very busy, but less good Sunday when it was quiet. We ate one night at the small Thai Pan Restaurant opposite, which was cheap and good food. There is also a liquor store nearby. The wifi in our room was a little slow and unstable.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"You've got to be kidding, is this the ""New"" Hyatt standard?","I checked n and checked out in about 10 minutes..the lighting in the rooms is cold white fluorescent CFL's -yuck--I get the need to save energy but for very little more investment they could get warm white cfl bulbs, but the bathroom lighting is ridiculous, there is a LED light bar at the bottom of the mirror and one small light over the shower, the top of the mirror has a funky redish glow. I asked if there was something wrong with the light and was told that is a designer touch, if you like shaving (or your wife likes putting makeup on) basically in the dark this is the place for you.  Décor is not to everyone's taste, very COLD SEVERE contemporary, which if that's your taste is fine, but not for all.  I asked the desk if the lighting was now standard for all Hyatts and they said it was the standard for hotels that were new or had been remodeled, guess I'll take Hyatt off my list of possible places to stay.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,disappointed,"This property physically met the usual high standards of Hyatt hotels. But it is not geared for folks without cars. I had come to Denver for a one-day meeting and, due to the high car rental cost at DIA took public transportation, a van service, to the hotel. $17 vs. $85 for a cab! My meerings were at a hotel some 8 blocks away and at the University of Denver. The hotel does not have any limo service and knew nothing about the public transportation available. Nor did they have a local map. I walked one block to Colorado Blvd. where there is significant bus service which I used.  Had I driven to this property, I would have given it very high ratings.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Loved everything except the thin walls and building noise,"Staff - Excellent,welcoming, friendly and extremely helpful.  They pull so many duties at the front desk including bar tender and chefs.  Crazy but they pull it off.  I had an urgent need to change rooms and they were sold out but the manager helped me.  Just wonderful.Bar - pretty good.  Not a wide selection of libations but it'll do.  Prices ok.  Beer was cold and glasses chilled.Hotel is fresh, clean and very stylish.  Decor is very nice and I loved the art and photographs.  Fitness room is an adequate size.  Towels provided.  Cold water.  Nice, new equipment.  Business center - great big monitors, free printing, nice lighting.  I could have worked there for days.  Free Wifi throughout.  Really, the hotel ticks all the boxes for an adult trip or business trip (family - maybe).  The one issue is the noise.  The walls are horribly thin.  We had to listen to a new couple next door get 'familiar'.  Maybe it was because we had connecting doors?  The building also makes POP noises throughout the night.  Expanding and contracting maybe?  The red alarm was the hotel (nicely) provides ear plugs on the bedside table.  Maybe that's normal for a Hyatt Place?  Overall I'd not hesitate to book this hotel again.  I was in town for a family emergency and this hotel was a welcome sanctuary each night and morning.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great stay!,"Stayed for two nights in July. Room was very big and nicely done. Staff very welcoming, even when we arrived late at night. Gym was excellent - water and towels provided. Breakfast was good - seating area a little small for the number of people. Can order Pizza from pizza hut across the street to be delivered. Best hotel I stayed in during a three week trip to the states.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Interesting location, good deal","I was here for an overnight business trip.  This is just off of Colorado Avenue ( I believe) which is a very busy street.  It is set off just a little bit from the street and parking is ample.  The desk staff was attentive, but there just seemed to be too many of them just hanging around.  This may have been because there was a golf tournament (BMW Championship?) in town, so they may have expected huge crowds.  The room was clean and up to date. The shower had really nice glass doors and the tiling was done well.  This is a newly renovated hotel and it shows.  I would have two suggestions:  brighter lighting in the bathroom and better pillows.  What is the deal with hotel pillows?!  One is too soft and two are just too much.  Besides that, the location is a good one. Lots of stuff around it and Cherry Creek is a great area.  Be prepared for traffic and lots of construction (as of September 2014).  Also be prepared for a nice stay  :)",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great one night stay,"My stay was very short but I was very satisfied! The bed was super comfy. The room was super clean. The free wifi worked. The water was hot. The breakfast was generous, lots of fresh fruit. I was at Denver Botanic Garden and this was a close hotel option at a reasonable price compared to other Cherry Creek area hotels. Extra nice exercise room. Refrigerator in room which I need. Could hear noise from other rooms but did not disturb me at all.  Heard no noise from outside.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Pretty good stay,"Stayed for over a week in August.  Fairly centrally located hotel.  There is lots to see in the area, but the traffic is very heavy all day.  There's a great local pizza place around the corner and Super Target and Whole Foods are close by.  I had a great room (402) facing the foothills.  I enjoyed watching the sun set over the Rockies.  My room was very quiet, at the end of the hall.  They had a great, hot breakfast with wonderful fruit and toast, oatmeal, eggs, waffles, orange juice, etc.  The staff constantly refilled the food to make sure it was fresh.  There was food for purchase during the day that was good, though pricey.  The room was large with a sofa and the bed was comfortable, although I didn't care for the feather pillows, which is a personal preference.  There was lots of free parking and overall the staff was helpful.  My only complaints were that when I tried to send a document to the printer, there was a problem with the interface so I had to email it to them so they could print it on their other printer, which was not very good quality.  It took extra time, but I had allowed for that.  Since I stayed a long time, I didn't ask for housekeeping every day.  When they did come, they took the empty toilet paper roll, but didn't leave any new.  I had to go down and get a roll and carry it back to my room which was a little awkward as the elevator was full.  Not a huge deal, but they didn't clean the floor during my visit either.  I would stay again and recommend, though I would be more vocal about the housekeeping.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,vrey good 1 night stay,"good and clean hotel , perfect for our 1 night stay , rooms and bedding are good , breakfast was good , bathroom ok also , nothing negative to say about our stay , would come back here if our trip takes us here",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Clean, comfortable and great service.  Perfect trifecta of hotel stay!!","New-looking hotel, cleanest Hyatt Place I've ever stayed in and my family was upgraded to a suite without even asking.  Couldn't get better than Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek.  Our family of five was extremely comfortable and he the best sleep ever - so much so that we slept through breakfast! Location is decent: close to Starbucks, Wahoo's and Safeway (among other eateries/groceries) and about 15 minutes from downtown Denver.   We will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,quick overnight stay,"Room was very clean, the front desk staff were very professional and personal, I checked in quite late but they still had a sense of humor! My only complaint is how ridiculously high the shower head and towel racks were. I am short, but still, I couldn't reach to adjust the shower head and needed to go up on my tip toes to get towels, not so safe on a wet shower floor!",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Apparently new--needs some kinks worked out,"The biggest problem we found was that the wi-fi did not work in the room (as advertised). One needed to go to the lobby to check one's email and get on the internet (even with one's own computer).This absolutely needs to be fixed. The toilet paper roll holder is located too far from the toilet to be convenient for someone 5'3"" with short arms. The mirror in the bathroom is lit both from the top and the bottom. Because it is lit from the bottom, it was hard for me to put in my contact lenses (due to the glare). The (single-cup) coffee maker spritzed water and leaked a little onto the base. The door to the room sometimes stuck--one had to push it just right to get it open. However, on the plus side, the room was large with two queen beds, a sofa, and an easy chair. It also had a fridge, 3 drawer chest, desk, wardrobe, a platform (rather than a  nightstand) between the 2 beds, and 2 queen beds. We tried their limited gallery menu for food one night when it was raining (soup and salad). We ordered from the room and they called back when it was ready in plastic containers. It turns out we could have ordered from the lobby and eaten on plates (in the breakfast area). The breakfast (included) was plentiful--hot food, juices, fruit, pastry, bagels, toast, cereal, yogurt, etc.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Disappointing,"I typically enjoy a Hyatt Place hotels, but this property was a disappointment.The check-in process was horrible.  The three individuals at the desk appeared to think I was their ""bro"" and not their guest; their behavior was unprofessional (continuing their immature jokes and conversations with each other during check-in) and, most annoyingly, incompetent.  I had two rooms on my reservation; the person who was checking me in claimed there was only one room.  This required me to go to the car and get the confirmation; when I came back in, the clerk's excuse was ""I am the cook, so I don't really know how the system works.""  I resisted the temptation to ask why the cook was working at check-in and why the two other guys near him (both standing there and talking sports) couldn't check me in.  My Hyatt Diamond status was not recognized by the clerk; when I told him I wanted the bonus points (as a Diamond member, you choose your on-property benefit), he looked at me like I had ten heads and called his 'manager'/bro over to ask how it was done.  Said manager told him how without so much as looking at me or welcoming me to the property.  Check-out was no more competent; we re-lived problem with the two rooms when the check-out clerk struggled to present me a bill for both of the rooms occupied.I am accustomed, when staying at a Hyatt Place, to a spacious room with a separate living area and sleeping area.  This is a old hotel (previously with another chain) with regular rooms.  While they contained some of the typical furniture of a Hyatt Place, it wasn't the same experience.  The conversion was also spotty - there were spots in my room where the renovation looked half-complete:  counters from the old property that were half-caulked to the wall, old closet fixtures, sloppy paint around vents in the bathroom, etc.  The exterior of the building is also horribly ugly - a big black box.Service needs a major upgrade, overall.  Accommodations were fine, but nothing special and different than the established brand standard.  Location was suitable.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"A Good Value, Limited Services","I stayed three nights at this Hyatt. I had room 520, which was a reasonably quiet room at the end of the hallway, with a great view of the mountains and skyline of Denver.I found the staff to be very friendly and the maid service faultless. I needed the hotel staff to fax me a tax-exempt statement in advance of my stay, and they were very accommodating about providing this. The check-in was smooth, and the front desk staff were friendly. My room was clean upon arrival. (it would be nice if the window glass were cleaner, but I do know from personal experience that dusty splotches accumulate very quickly on window exteriors in Colorado.) Each day I received clean glasses, and the towels, which I didn't have replaced, were straightened.The room has a comfortable seating area, although, as others have mentioned, it is not a separate area. There are two blinds: a sheer blind that allows some visibility and light, and a room-darkening shade. I love the latter, as it extends into grooves on either side of the window frame. This did a great job of blocking external light. However, it is true that the door has at least a half-inch gap at the bottom, meaning both noise and light can be a problem. My biggest complaint about the room is that the lighting in the bathroom is very dim. Since that's the design of the lighting, a make-up mirror with lights would be greatly appreciated. And I agree with another reviewer that the mattress is too hard. I mattress pad would help this.I actually had good internet speed and was even able to stream a movie. The times the internet speed slowed, restarting my computer seemed to take care of it.The breakfast is not on par with a five-star hotel, but the price is much lower than hotels with truly spectacular buffets. I found it perfectly adequate for three breakfasts. The fruit was good: fresh pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew. The oatmeal and oatmeal toppings were also good. The eggs and waffles/french toast were prepared in advance, and therefore didn't taste fresh.I'm puzzled at the reviewer from Birmingham who didn't feel safe. New construction, many businesses, and reasonably nice apartments surround the hotel. However, it isn't really an area designed for walking. Rather, it's a very convenient location for driving to many places within Denver. Parking is free in the large, convenient lot. True, the hotel is technically in Glendale, but it is extremely close to Cherry Creek, and other businesses in the area also have that designation.If you want a hotel with spa services, room service, full restaurant and bar, etc., you should look elsewhere. However, if you want a clean hotel with friendly staff and convenient location for driving to Denver destinations, then this is a great value.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel - great value - great for dogs - would go back!,"My husband and I were traveling from Ohio with our dog and stayed at the Hyatt Place for 4 nights.  It was a great room - very large and comfortable and plenty of room for us to set up the dog's crate.  The breakfast was very good with scrambled eggs, sausage, yogurt, cereals, juices, coffee/tea, bread/bagels, etc.  There is a business center with computers & printers as well as an ATM in the lobby.  For running, Washington Park is less than 2 miles away and is a great place to take a dog.  Would definitely return to this hotel!!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Good:Location,decor,breakfast/coffee - Bad: Noise level","My husband and I stayed for 5 nights and loved:-The convenience of the location. It has easy access to 25, shopping in Cherry Creek, and a quick drive to downtown. -We ate breakfast a few times downstairs and the selection was great (breakfast sandwiches, fruit, oatmeal, sweet baked goods, cereal, etc.) and there is plenty of seating.-The decor was simple and modern-Parking was always easy and it is well lit. The big downside was the noise level. -The first couple of nights we kept hearing loud noises (it sounded like they were renovating the rooms upstairs and somebody was banging on our window). At first we let it go - but by the next night/morning it was keeping us up and along with all the noise from the rooms next to us in the hallway it just seemed like too much. -We contacted the front desk and they explained to us that because of the temperature change of the heat in the day and cooler temperature at night the windows/building made noise and that they would bring up a white noise machine and notify us as soon as another room on the interior opened up. Unfortunately, the machine and the call never came and when we talked to the front desk again they seemed to not be aware of our previous call/issue.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great value,"Had to get an ADA-equipped room for my elderly mother along with my sister & myself.  Manager was very helpful and the room was excellent; lots of outlets for multiple IT devices, very modern and very clean.  Complimentary full breakfast buffet was outstanding.  Free wireless was a tad slow and the Hyatt general reservations person was not well-informed but everyone at the hotel itself was terrific.  Great access to/fr airport and to the city.  Lots of free parking.  Highly recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Good hotel,  rooms a bit noisy","This hotel,  overall, is nicely appointed. The rooms have a nice sitting couch, god light, are clean and very comfortable. The breakfast bar has great selection (though things like waffles get cold, as they are set in a buffet dish - would be better to offer as a waffle bar or make your own, so they are hot).  Out biggest watch out would be the room noise level. We were lucky in that we got a room away from the elevators and at the end of a hallway,  but sound carried into our room in the mornings and evenings. Luckily we didn't have noisy neighbors, but we could hear almost every move - radio, alarm, etc.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great hotel!! Would go back!,The location is awesome. Close to so much. The price was great! The rooms were clean and nice. Seemed like a newer hotel. The staff was super. The fitness center was great. The breakfast Buffett was better than any other hotel I have stayed. Highly recommend.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wonderful stay,I originally was going to book this room through a 3rd party website since I had found a great price; instead I called the reservation desk to see if they could match the price and was given a song and dance about how they couldn’t.  I called the motel directly and was told YES we can match that price.  The gentleman (Ryan) who checked me in at the hotel was wonderful.  He was quite informative and helped me completely.  The room was quite clean and the bed was really nice.  I would definitely stay here again. I have a 4-door long box truck and there was plenty of parking that I could fit my truck into without any problems. This was great.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Nice New Hotel near Cherry Creek,"We had to spend a night in Denver, I found a great deal on Hotels.com for this Hyatt, and we were not disappointed.  Check in was smooth, the hotel is very modern with nice black out shades, good beds, a sitting/reading area, and a huge complimentary breakfast buffet.  It is close to Cherry Creek Shopping district, and although just off of busy Colorado Blvd, there are nice areas to walk.  We will definitely stay there again when the occasion arises.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very poor performance - Grade F,"1. I turned in some dry cleaning items for ""same day"" service. I got back to the room at 8:00 PM and looked for my dry cleaning. The front desk informed me that the laundry did not go out because ""there were a lot of new trainees"". I have traveled for over 35 years and never experienced missing my laundry.2. Last night I visited the ""bar"" and tried to order a glass of wine. After a few minutes of waiting to be served I had to go around to the front desk (15' away) and see if one of 4 young men could serve me.3. I also observed that a party of 8 people, after ordering light snacks, had to also go out to the front desk to have their service continued. None of the 4 seemed concerned.4. This is mind-blowing. The following morning I observed that no one had picked up my wine glass from the night before.I would give this hotel a  ""F"" grade. However, please note that the housekeeping staff were very thorough and competent.Trust me--- do not stay at this one!",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Good facility, but service is lacking.","This former Loews is quite a ways from downtown, but has great connections to most places in town.  It feels like it is located in a business park where there is ample parking, lots of chain restaurants nearby, and two bus-stops and a 7-11 within a block.My room was quite satisfactory, spacious, with a large King bed, flat-screen TV, couch and lots of drawer space.   The work desk is small and the internet can sometimes slow down (presumably with heavy use).   The bathroom is large enough, but the water pressure was cutting in and out on three of my mornings.   The fan in the bathroom is permanently on, quite noisy but the bathroom door muffles most of the sound.   The overhead light was out and never replaced.The breakfast area is quite large, with a variety of seating options. While the free hot breakfast doesn't start until 6.30am on the weekdays, the fruit/cereal/toast/juice/coffee is available beforehand.  I felt the breakfasts were good, but they hardly change from day to day.But, where this hotel falls down is in the service.  It started badly for me when I checked-in with both of the staff sitting on top of the front desk, chatting.   They then informed me I was just staying overnight when I had a full week stay booked.  They acknowledged I was a 'member', but not that I was top-tier with Hyatt and not thanking me for my business.   Nor was I offered the usual welcome amenity.    Most mornings and evenings I was not greeted as I entered or left the hotel.Housekeeping was spotty.   I was skipped all together one day, missed getting my daily paper on Tuesday, didn't have dirty glasses cleaned one day, and they kept changing my towels even though I hung them up for re-use.   The smudges and fingerprints on the window were never cleaned.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Incompetent,Booked through hotels.com the Hyatt had an issue where they over charged my card on file for incidentals when the rooms had been pre paid. I now have charges on my card for the value of the room that should not be there. I have called the hotel along with my business associates several times to get our cards cleared and they have given no explanation as well as shown no inkling of motivation to return our funds. The message is clearly not being passed along between shifts because when we call its like starting over again when they try to say the charges totaling 300+ dollars are for incidentals. Avoid this hotel.,2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Great location, very clean and pleasant","My husband and I stayed here for a week and had a very nice stay.  Room was very clean with a desk, sitting area, king bed, and bathroom with large walk-in shower.  Had computers for guest use with printers.  Nice breakfast every morning.  Coffee and tea in room.  Our room did not have an adjoining room and noise was not a problem.  As with all hotels with interior hallways, you do hear guests in halls when passing your door (Hint: Keep voices down when walking and talking in halls as to be considerate of other guests in all hotels).  Limited but good selection of foods available 24/7 at hotel.  Location was very convenient to Downtown Denver and highways.  Close to Aquarium, Coors Field, Botanical Gardens, Zoo, Capital, Denver Art Museum, Cherry Creek Mall, and much more.  We will return in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Unlike a hyatt,"I stayed in this hotel because of the location, and I don't know if its because its ""new"" but its terribly understaffed. I asked for a crib and had to go down and get it after 40 min. Of waiting, there is no bell boy and the people that are there are not very well trained. (Except for the manager who was ok).The rooms are nice, I hope they get better fast!",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Clean and nice,Stayed here several times recently. Very friendly staff. Good accommodations and clean. Very centrally located in Denver. Lots of good restaurants nearby. Wish they had a parking garage but there is a large lot adjacent.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,BEWARE. Internet is really bad and the building creaks!,"Trying to use their Internet is near impossible other than for some basic emails. This was despite myself and others complaining about it. A real no-no in today's connected world. Then you have the building creaking all day and night and if that isn't enough the walls are so paper thin you can hear everyone in the other rooms or when people are talking in the passageway. Rather a pity as the neighbourhood is good and in easy walking distance to food, shops etc. also the staff are great!  With non existent Internet you really are not a good destination I am afraid.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Average--at best,"We recently stayed at the Hyatt Place in (outer) Cherry Creek, having previously stayed in Hyatt places in the Atlanta area that we really liked. This place was just okay, bordering on subpar.The facility looks tired--outside, in the public spaces, and in the room itself. The internet service was free, but you get what you pay for. The complimentary breakfast was also free, and, yes, you get what you pay for. I thought the latter was borderline inedible (I am admittedly picky)--a little bit dirty in and around the dining area, fresh fruit was not so fresh, coffee grounds in the coffee, etc. One of the elevators was out of service for upgrades and another elevator was broken by service people loading 6000 lb washing machines in it on the evening of our stay. The staff handled this near calamity with grace by escorting guests into the service elevator.I was expecting more and got less. I would not stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Safe neighborhood, clean facility, friendly staff.","We stayed here one night while we stayed over in Denver on our way to Colorado Springs -- I found a great deal on Expedia for a pre-booked stay and went into the hotel not really knowing what to expect. First and foremost, it's in a good neighborhood -- Sam's No. 3 is nearby, along with a King Sooper. Our room had a mini-fridge, so you can easily stop at King Sooper and grab any snacks or drinks for your room. The staff was very friendly. Our room was clean and I was quite surprised at its quality -- for less than $100 a night, I didn't expect it to be so sharp looking. Our room was very comfortable and the free breakfast was quite tasty, too -- fresh fruit, eggs, sausage, choice of bagels/toast/english muffins, cereal, and assortments of juice. Loved the free wi-fi AND the free parking. Parking wasn't a problem at all. During our stay, they were remodeling the elevators, so one elevator was out of use. However, we barely had to wait. The staff was right on top of everything -- they noticed that someone had dripped water all the way to the elevator and I heard them immediately comment about it while we walked away from checking in. When we came back down to get our bags not 10 minutes later, the water was cleaned up. My boyfriend and I were quite impressed and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not bad at all,"The bad first: awkward entry drive, the rooms are not like the photos...I've stayed in half a dozen Hyatt Places and this is the first one that didn't have a larger room with a divider separating the sitting area from where the bed is...the rooms shown in the professional photos, that's not what the one we stayed in looked like at all...it was a hotel room with a couch, more like a Hyatt room with a Hyatt Place lobby...and no room service. Elevator was broken. The service was not the best...it seemed like the bartender was more concerned with getting a lady a discount on her room than making my drinks...also, that same lady was sitting at the bar drinking a beer out of an open twelve pack she brought in herself. It was little things like that.The good: Clean, new rooms...breakfast was just what I expected and very good. One thing I've noticed over the past couple of years is that they serve Starbucks at the bar but not at breakfast...just something I've noticed. Large parking lot. There is a drug store across the street and a Whole Foods about a block away. I read an earlier review that said they didn't feel safe...I did not experience that feeling in the least...it's on a busy road, in a busy part of town...but I never felt unsafe...the hotel was filled with families and kids. The Mall is a few minute drive, the Zoo is right up the street...the Botanical Center is a 10-15 minute drive. Downtown is a good 20 minutes...but and easy drive.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,A wonderful place to stay,"We stayed on a busy weekend in Denver, the rooms were clean and modern.  As you enter the hotel you get a light smell in the lobby and you can smell it a little bit stronger in the elevator!  It was not over powering, it was pleasant and soft!  we asked the attendant what smell it was and he said it was not sure, but it was something like mountain mist.  He commented that a lot of people like it.   The breakfast room was large and served many delightful items that were pleasing to look at and very good to eat.   The whole experience was  wonderful and will stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Spacious rooms,"The room are clean, spacious for their price. I love the bathroom it's big with shower. I like the room interior which is modern with clean design, looks like recently updated. There's free breakfast in the lobby, but too bad there's no room service. But this hotel is in Glendale area, which is very close to Colorado blvd, there's many 24hrs chain restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Safety concerns-look elsewhere,"Upon arrival we had safety concerns due to the neighborhood and lack of secure access.  This property has Cherry Creek in its name, but it is located in Glendale which seemed much less safe.  I would not walk around this area after dark.  One of the two elevators was broken our entire stay.  The room was reasonably clean and the beds comfortable but the sheets had large holes.  The last straw for us was when we attempted to leave the hotel and were told both elevators were broken and we would need to take the stairs from our tenth floor room.  At ground level doors were propped open to an alley which was an additional security concern.  We have since moved to the Hyatt House in Denver which is under significantly better management.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent,"I was very pleased with the whole experience.  The staff was wonderful, and  when I come back to Denver, I will absolutely stay there again.  Kirby Fussell, President/Owner Fusco Energy, LLC Wow, tough croud !!! LOL",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Beautiful and Great Service!,"This is a beautiful hotel with quality design and finishes. Huge shower with great shower head! Nice sectional sofa for a very cozy feel. The front desk staff was very friendly and efficient. Great breakfast, far superior in variety and quality that we normally encounter. This will be our first choice when returning to Denver. Next time I will ask for a room on the side with ""mountain views"". Internet was a tad slow but I didn't come to Denver to sit on my computer. :-)Just a wonderful stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Nice rooms, poor service",Great location with terrific rooms. My only complaint is the staff is new and needs more training.  One day our room wasn't made up and often times the front desk was no empty.  The breakfast is good and the price is right.  With proper attention to detail this hotel has lots of potential.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very Very Nice,"My daughter and I stayed here for 4 days while visiting University of Denver. Everything about the hotel was top notch. I was surprised since we opted for an affordable choice.  The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. (Kudos to Ryan for keeping his cool while dealing with some very obnoxious travellers checking in before us) The breakfasts were real breakfasts with fresh fruit, eggs, sausage, as well as typical free breakfast fare. There is a small bar that offers food late into the night. And surprisingly, it was pretty good!The room was clean and spacious. Parking was convenient and the location was right for exploring the area. The only things that I wish were better: I do agree with another reviewer that the pillows were a too firm and I did easily hear the people in the hallway at night.All in all, I'd highly recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"If you actually want to sleep at night, stay elsewhere","this old revamped hotel is clean, staff is friendly. I'm sure the dogs they allow to stay overnight are sweet as well, but barking dogs all night long is a horrible problem. Also, the AC was mediocre and the big pillows are very hard. So no sleep last night and we are checking out and going elsewhere,  If you want a cheap hotel, this is it, and now I know why.  I knew there was going to be a problem when we walked in the room and the hotel had provided ""free"" earplugs with a remarkable spin provided...""keep it quiet, get the most out or your bed with our free noise-reducing earplugs"".  I will accomplish that by spending my money elsewhere.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Wonderful Hotel!!,This is one of the nicest hotels me and my family have stayed at in quite a while. The hotel is very clean and they did $10M in renovations that surely shows. The lobby has a friendly staff to accommodate all of your needs. They have an upscale bar that you can grab a quick bite to eat or have a drink. The rooms are really big compared to other hotels. The beds are really comfortable and the view from the room is simply breathtaking! I will defiantly stay at this hotel again when I am in the Denver area.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Urban feel and great look,"I think this in one of the best hotel I have been in for a while when it comes down to the cleanliness and furniture and design. I like mostly everything about this place accept the breakfast. I think it deserves a upgrade in quality. But other than that, this is one of the best hotels I've been in for a while. Front desk agents can smile a little more though. ;=)",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Mixed bag.,"This was formerly a Loew's property and became a Hyatt Place in October 2013. They've done a lovely job of remodeling the rooms - comfortable and attractive, with good housekeeping. Lobby spaces are also nicely done, and front desk staff was friendly. On the other hand...Internet access is the WORST I've experienced in a decent hotel. Just trying to connect to wireless is frustrating (especially from iOS devices). Speed of connection is terrible - less than old-fashioned dial-up connection. If you're hoping to actually do any business from a computer in your room, forget it. (I spent four days at the hotel and it was resolutely awful the whole time.)The structure of the hotel creaks and pops constantly. Maybe it's because it was unseasonably hot during my visit, causing expansion and contraction, but it never stopped making noises - loud enough to make sleeping problematic. Similarly, any noise in the hallways sounds like it's in your room, probably the result of a 1.5"" gap at the bottom of the room door.If you approach the hotel from the north on Colorado Blvd., you'll see a sign saying ""Hyatt Place"" on the top of an attractive, modern 20-story building. That's not the hotel! The hotel is actually behind that tower, an uninspired lower black-glass cube. The whole property is surrounded by a parking lot and several ugly, low-brow strip malls. Not the upscale environment I associate with Cherry Creek. And traffic on Colorado Blvd. (the only access route to the hotel) is terrible at nearly every hour of the day.Would I stay here again? Probably not. There are too many other options, both nearby and across Denver. Definitely my least favorite Hyatt property among quite a few, including others in the Denver area.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Fresh Flowers in Room!,"Pleasant surprise to find fresh cut flowers on the desk when we checked into the room!  Very clean hotel with friendly, accommodating staff.  The hotel was completely sold out but the front desk people were able to get us 2 rooms next to each other.  Great breakfast, spacious areas for lounging.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good value for the price that we paid,"The physical form of the hotel from outside is not very impressive, however the convenient parking and convenient access to Cherry Creek (driving distance not walking) and freeway made up for the aesthetics. In general, the interior designer and staff are doing their best with a number of odd design choices. I think it was originally supposed to be contemporary but it is hard to know as I never saw it when it was Loews. The hotel lobby has a somewhat odd layout but it works. There are all of the typical facilities- computers, gym, good neighborhood for walk, and something increasingly rare in Denver core free parking.The room was fine, nice bathroom with odd sliding glass door. Comfortable bed and efficient layout to get Jr Suite features in a modest sized room. We were on the top floor and had very nice views.The morning breakfast was also fine- eggs, toast, cereal, waffles, juice, sausage, coffee, and good Tazo tea selection.Staff was excellent, the best feature to me. Everyone was prompt, helpful, and seemed interested in guests. We had a good price from Expedia and it was a nice room for the sub $100 nt. category.I would stay here again as we have family in the area and it was a very convenient location yet not next to a freeway. The staff made me willing to stay there again, short of that I would be ambivalent.They have lots of info about sharing items that one might have forgotten and I finally had a chance to use the service as I forgot my razor. Much appreciated.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great everything,This hotel was fantastic. It was easy to access from the freeway and parking was free and easy. The room was very clean and modern and it would be pleasant to actually spend time there enjoying the view. I would definitely consider Hyatt Place at the top of my list in any city based off this experience.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Comfortable and Well located,"Hotel was well-kept and room was clean.  Sparely furnished but certainly adequate. Location is not very close to Cherry Creek Mall or downtown Denver but it is easy to get everywhere and there are many franchise restaurants and grocery stores close by as well as Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, etc. Breakfast bar had a good number of choices and was regularly replenished. Lighting in rooms is too florescent and kind of ugly - should replace with the softer, more incandescent type of CFLs.  Only one phone by the desk, no phone next to bed, but it is cordless so can be moved by the bed for your wake-up call. Seemed to be very pet-friendly (although we did not have a dog with us.) Nice amount of seating in the lobby and computer area.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,It's 50/50,"So, while I was impressed with the lobby area refurbish they clearly did recently, the very modern feel had a somewhat confusing layout. The Lobby desk was very cluttered underneath, which you can see from many angles, and the work station does not seem to be laid out to make it easy for the staff to do their job comfortably and efficiently. I appreciated the very large breakfast each morning, but when ordering food in the evening at the hotel, it is NOT room service. You must go all the way down to the lobby and pick it up yourself, which is the last thing I want to do after a long day. I was not impressed with this. The room was sufficient, however, it was sufficient for the reduced price I was able to get. I would not feel it worth the regular rate at all as the room already had a very worn look to it. Some small things were annoying (I found a pack of cigarettes on the shelf in my closet 'hidden' under the extra blanket I pulled out to use; there was no lotion in the room my first night/day), but overall the amenities were good. I used the medium sized workout 'center' daily. I did appreciate the disposable headphones (not comfortable to use, but nice that they were offered) and cleanliness there. I never rant into a problem of it being too busy that there wasn't something open to use. The front desk staff always seemed helpful, but there were times when it took them a minute or two before they interrupted their own conversation to assist me with coffee or a question.So, hence the title, it was 50/50 for me. I am glad I paid a discounted rate. I was grateful for the breakfast daily, and the workouts in the morning. I did not love the feeling of the neighborhood and parking lot, especially at night, but it was close proximity to shopping, restaurants, and the highway. I would stay again, but only at the same rate or below what I paid. Not the rate listed on the site.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Hotel Stay,"Free Breakfast GreatBar at night was very slow. No excitement.No pool.Misleading as it is Not in Cherry Creek, but close.Noisy in the hallways to bad they couldn't get that much noise in the bar. No music in bar. Boring.No smoking not even weed.Very clean.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Average,I am a hospitably student from the University of Denver. For my class a group of students and  I were required to review a hotel. This hotel was average. The front desk agent made no effort to make us feel welcome as we entered the hotel. Once we entered our room we found a large stain on one of the queen size pillows. When we ordered towels for our room it took over an hour before they came.  However the breakfast was great as always and the staff took pride in keeping the buffet clean.  Over all the stay was average if not a little below.,3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Eh,"I recently stayed at the Hyatt Place for the weekend.  Overall, it isn't bad, however, it isn't exactly spectacular either.  The front desk agent was fairly lackluster in greeting and there was a large stain on my pillow.  As well, when I asked for extra towels, it took an hour and a half to get to my room.  However, most of the staff was fairly friendly and the breakfast was absolutely wonderful and everything was pretty efficient, besides the towel situation.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Very comfortable, but not very friendly.","I am a hospitality student at the University of Denver, and recently did a service evaluation report at this property. Overall the room and hotel was very cleanly and comfortable, but the front dest agents were not as friendly as they should have been. Upon entering the hotel I was not greeted by the GSA, but rather had to greet them myself. I was locked out of my room without my ID at one point, and went to the front desk to get keys reissued, and was only asked my name and room number in order to get my keys reissued, this is an extreme danger and liability for the hotel. The highlight of this hotel is the breakfast, and comfort of the rooms.",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Not your typical Hyatt Place,"Almost all of my Hyatt Place experiences have been at the 5- or 6-story hotels in suburban or airport locations. This hotel used to be a Loews, and is a bit different. First, it is a high-rise. Second, the rooms don't have the usual Hyatt Place footprint. There is no room divider, but my room had a nice seating area with a good view. Like the typical Hyatt Place, there is the bar/bistro area as well as the breakfast buffet. As others have mentioned, you can hear a lot from other rooms. Bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper, and you will be OK.Overall, this is a very good hotel, especially if you need to be in the Cherry Creek/Glendale/University area.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Great stay!,"We stayed here last minute, after driving from SLC for Rockies games.rooms were very spacious pictures are accurate. Very comfortable beds, lots of pillows, nice sitting area, bathrooms clean. Really enjoyed the stay and the area felt safe comfortable. Only complaint as one other review pointed out and we have to agree, thin walls. You can hear EVERYTHING through the walls. Crying baby one night and early to rise business conference calls the other. I don't mean just muffled sound, but rather full on conversations can wake you. They did wake us both several times. Also have to agree with another review that the free breakfast was very plentiful and much better than any we have ever had. Very impressive. Was a bit disappointed at how dusty the room was on arrival. We opted for no cleaning during our stay and did not cash in the $3 drink credit. Have to agree w/previous post that seems almost insulting to those willing to work these service industry jobs. A nice cleaned room is worth more than $3, however I think this is reference to the in between services such as trash removal & making beds.  May we suggest using those saved wages on lower costs or more time spent between guests with more thorough cleaning? Would be great to see the new improvements we enjoyed, be well maintained for future visitors. Would return here and possible ask for a room without adjoining room access. ;)",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Highly recommend!,"This is a great place to stay in the Denver area if you have a car and need free parking.  It is easy to get into Downtown by public transportation or by car.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly for several reasons:  The hotel has been recently updated.  My room and bathroom were very clean.  The bed is comfortable.  The free breakfast is great.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  I did not hear any noise from outside the building.  I could hear some people in the hallway when I was inside my room, but that seems to be an issue in every hotel these days.  Because of its location in a suburban commercial area, it's not really conducive to walking around (Read: You would not be strolling through some quaint village shopping district.), but as a base for either going into Downtown or taking off for day trips to other areas, it is great.  There are some decent places to eat in the area (Check out Yelp reviews.) It is convenient to access major highways.  While it is not near the airport (because nothing is near the Denver Airport), it is an easy drive to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Perfect in every way,"We booked this hotel because it was close to where our son lived in Denver.   The front desk people were vey efficient and nice.  Our room was very spacious with a nice sectional couch, desk, dresser, big closet, coffee pot and refrigerator.  We were tired from traveling so went down to the lobby in search of food.  They have a bar there were you can get a nice beer, glass of wine or drink and some food.  We ordered the tomato soup and a small pizza, it was very good and the service was excellent.  The breakfast area is very big so there are plenty of tables for guests to sit without being crowded.  We travel a lot and I have to say I was very impressed with the complimentary breakfast, it had more selections than any other hotel I have ever stayed in.  There was something for everyone, eggs, sausage, french toast, plenty of fruit, cottage cheese, oatmeal, cereal etc.  they have a nice sitting area in the lobby and a business center also off the lobby.   There is free wi-fi in the rooms and the hotel is close to everything.  We were supposed to stay in another hotel outside of town for two days to do some hiking but we liked this hotel so much that we stayed for four days.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Very nice,"This place is off Colorado a couple blocks, so it is a little hidden.  It is south of the rest of the Glendale / Cherry creek hotel area.  However, there is a significant amount of restaurants around this hotel.  The hotel is clean modern.  The rooms are spacious, well appointed and super clean.  The room I was in had a fantastic view of the mountains.  There is a couch and sectional type sofa in the regular level rooms.  As it appears a car dealer uses this lot for overflow parking, the parking is limited but free outside.  It also has garage parking adjacent.  WIFI was very fast.  Really, it is a good place to stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Nice facility, good bed - so so neighborhood","Front desk staff was friendly.  Able to check in without delay.  Nice view of city from room big window.  Ask for high floors.  Bed was comfortable, flat screen tv, sectional sofa with sofa bed, Sitting area and bed there was no separation which is needed.   Had small refrigerator and needed microwave.  Good free Wi Fi.  Bathroom had shower and the clean towels were in the shower area.  Window make constant crackling noises maybe due to the snow at this time of year.  One\ cup coffee maker in room.   Room as decent size as was bathroom.    Breakfast area was nice and roomy.   Offerings were good but difficult for those with gluten free needs.

"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,we could not have been happier!,"I can't for the life of me figure out how people can complain about this hotel.  The rooms are spacious and immaculate.  The staff was very courteous and helpful.  The area is about a 15 minute drive to downtown, but we stayed in the cherry creek area and found lots to do.  When we return to the Denver area this is where we will stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Best in this area of Denver,We really liked the cleanliness of the room and the convenience of the location. The breakfast was complete and delicious. We have tried other hotels in this area of Denver and were never quite happy.  We will be back!,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Mixed feelings,"We've recently started staying at Hyatt Place as much as possible when we travel for business and/or vacations, so we have some experiences to use as comparison.  The facility and the rooms were beautiful.  We appreciated the larger-than-most Hyatt Place bathroom.  The lobby was spacious, with adequate room for the free breakfast.  We also appreciated the pristine workout room with excellent equipment.  We were very disappointed though that on our last full day of a 3-night stay, our room was not cleaned, in spite of asking the front desk (twice) and the housekeeping supervisor we saw in the hallway.  When we returned to the room after 5:30 PM and it was still not cleaned, I called the lobby and was able to speak with the manager on duty.  At first, she offered to come up with…",3
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Terrible Service and Infrastructure,"We stayed here for four nights and had an unpleasant stay. The worst part of the hotel is that the walls do not have any insulation. We could hear the couple staying next to our room and their TV as if they were sharing the same bedroom with us - it's terrible. We could also hear people in the corridor, again, just like there is no wall in between the room and the corridor. I couldn't sleep in the morning since the couple next to my room were talking on the phone (conference meeting from abroad?) at 7am, and the call lasted for an hour. That happened two mornings in a row. We asked to change the room to the end of the hallway but it only helped very little - we could still hear our neighbors, people talking on the hallway etc. The hotel service was also terrible. We asked to have some tea bags refilled and was told that we would need to wait for at least one hour because ""we are not a full service hotel."" ""But it's a 4 stars hotel?"" I thought to myself. Our dirty towels were taken but were not replaced. ""Why not?"" The tea cup still has marks of red lipsticks. They were not wash thoroughly. We ordered some soups at the restaurant. The waiter told us that it would take ""a couple of minutes"". We waited for 30 minutes and had to asked about our food before it was brought out.All in all, we will never stay here again.",1
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Brand new hotel. Cozy rooms and fantastic breakfast,"Very Nice hotel located just outside Denver Downtown in the pleasant Cherry Creek district.I read that it was opened just a year before and I could really tell that cause the room I had was brand new. Cozy and roomy, large moder bathroom and big flat screen tv. All the hotel interiors were super nice. Staff at the front desk friendly and helpful. I also had the chance to use the gym facility at the second floor. It features top of the range treadmills and freeweights, everything you need for a basic workout.Breakfast in the morning was something outstanding, I've never seen such a variety of hot food, cereals, pastry and fresh fruits. Absolutely loved my stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Amazing customer service,"The hotel is beautiful and pristine; breakfast (free) was amazing and like my mom would serve when I stay over; well beyond my expectations for a Hotel of any brand priced under $100 per night!But, the amazing and most notable aspect was the customer service.  The 4 staff at the front desk went above and beyond to assist me as the airline failed to deliver a delayed bag overnight.  They were 100% on top of the tracking and actually appeared to know more than the airline.  They immediately supplied me with tooth brush/paste and deodorant so I could get on with the day!I would strongly recommend to anyone Hyatt Place!",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Good Value,"The room was incredibly spacious with a sitting area with an L shaped couch and a TV that swiveled from the couch area or to the bed area. There was also a little kitchen area with enough space to put the pack and play. The bathroom was also very large and had been recently been re-done. I think we were in a handicap room, which is why it was so large. The hotel includes free breakfast and wifi. The breakfast is about what you can expect for free. But it is nice to be able to grab a banana or another snack for later in the day.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Enjoyed our stay,"In Denver to visit our son in Capitol Hill. Hyatt Place is easy to get to from the airport and from downtown. Had great mountain views.

Front desk and dining room personnel were very helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Redo the Old,"This is definitely a renovated property, but not from the Hyatt portfolio. It works. Friendly staff, great views, as in distance, from higher floors. Breakfast is so so. Parking is ample, and despite location, was easy to major roads and downtown; though, some areas are MAJORLY congested at PM rush hour, yet interestingly not AM.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Excellent,What a great location and property.  Very clean and convenient to shopping as well as a short cruise to downtown via Speer Blvd.  The rooms were clean and quiet and the staff was cheerful.  Free breakfast was above average.,5
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,Room ok. Breakfast sucks.,"The room was good except that that night the internet was not working at all, but breakfast totally ruined my stay.  If you're not going to replace or renew any of the items an hour before breakfast is to end, don't say you have breakfast until that hour!  We came a half hour before breakfast was to end and everything was picked bare.  There were some eggs the tops of which had gone hard sitting out all morning, disgusting, and some waffle bricks.  I took one before knowing it was a brick.  I saw that they removed them after I took it.  I thought they were going to be replaced and waited, but they never came.  I get it, that your staff is lazy, but you need to compensate and tell guests breakfast ends an hour earlier than you say it does, because it does.  Furthermore, even hotels which are supposedly on a lower tier have waffles irons so you can make yourself a fresh waffle and don't serve bricks.  It was a disappointing experience and I would not go back.  But anyway if you stay here and they tell you breakfast ends at 10:00, in reality it ends at 9:00.",2
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,New Hyatt Place is interesting and different,"Hyatt has taken the old Loews Denver and reimagined it to new concept level.  The checkin counter is directly inside the front door, and extends to a lobby bar and eventually to an eating area where light food may be ordered from a small kitchen. The front office staff is cross-trained to serve in all capacities.  It's an interesting concept that works on an informal level very well.  I had no noise problems, and my room was attractively decorated.  The breakfast is phenomenal with many choices including french toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal  I would describe the overall effect as smart and minimal.  Staff is extremely friendly and helpful.",4
"Denver, CO",Hyatt Place Denver/Cherry Creek,"Nice place, great breakfast","This hotel is very nice, clean, and updated. The beds were very comfy. The fitness facility had new equipment.

Flight landed at 8:30 pm and I call to get the shuttle (I swear I read somewhere to let them know when I arrived).....Find out it runs every HOUR on the half hour. What?? You have weary travelers, you’re located near the airport for a reason, and your shuttle only shows up hourly?!So, here I sit for another twenty minutes waiting for the shuttle because I don’t want to pay $25 for an Uber.The worst of it?? Occupying my time by Googling “Microtel shuttle” and stumbling upon this where it seems what is waiting for me could be either very pleasant or a dumpster fire.Lesson learned.Should’ve known better.Shame on me.But shame on Wyndham even more.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Great location,Very nice place to stay. Was very reasonable for the price. In a very good location not too far from the airport. Airport Shuttle runs from hotel every hour. And you can even leave your car parked there while you travel for a very reasonable fee than what you would be paying at the airport.,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Heaven sent,My son got off the plane and was stranded. His funds had not cleared the bank. He was flat broke. You allowed his parent to pay.

The desk staff was polite and knowledgeable. They exhibited a ton of patience as we observed them dealing with more than one ""needy"" customer.   The room was comfortable, though the bed could use a couple more pillows. The room was also very clean - their cleaning crew must be amazing.   Our room had visible holes where screws obviously used to be. There were also places where the old paint was very obviously showing. The front of the heater/AC unit was falling off and the curtain was very faded by the sun. The room needs an update. Nothing fancy needed, just basic care.   It's very easy to hear neighbors, including those above and below and those in the hall.  In a pinch,…",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,On the Road Again,"We spent the day at Rocky Mountain National Park to end our vacation, so we arrived at the motel later at night.  I'm not sure I could have ever found the place with using Waze app.  I chose the hotel because it was part of the Wyndham family and its close proximity to the airport.  I was a touch disappointed in the overall quality for a Wyndham hotel, although it was a 1st time staying at a Microtel.",3

I’ve been staying at this location for Over a month due to my job has brought me to Denver. During the past month they have double charged my card equaling to over $900.00 in additional charges. I went to the manager today to express my concerns and that’s when he became extremely aggravated and rude. He was unable to explain the charges. I will also be reporting this Hotel for price gouging and FRAUD during a NATIONAL EMERGENCY!!,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,It was just fine for a night before an early flight,I only slept there a few hours before an early flight.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good hotel for airport layover,I stayed at this hotel overnight with an airport overnight layover both on my way to California and on my way back. The shuttle is complementary and arrived at the airport to pick me up in good time. The weather wasn’t the best so it was nice to have the shuttle I also had an early flight in the morning and the shuttle was on time. The breakfast buffet is very adequate perfect for a preflight meal. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Adequate for quick stays,"The rooms are small, more like the stereotype applied to Japanese hotels, but comfortable. Stayed with wife and child in single King size bed room. Only one other seat, the desk chair, in the room. Sheets on the second night had something baked onto them. Don’t want to know what. Breakfast was disappointing: underripe oranges, overmicrowaved cheese freezer omelettes and similarly cardboard flavored biscuits with a pepper sauce that was far more pepper than sauce. Someone there even complained that the syrup was out for the waffles and that was early morning. But, for the price it was adequate, having not found cheaper in the same area.",3

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Great service just needs tweaking,"The staff was very accommodating to my needs, also went above and beyond! Though, there were just minor things that prevented me from giving an excellent review.  1.The continental breakfast is your normal choices but the pastries, muffins, bagels, and bread were very stale. The positive side they offered a cheese omelet which was very good, fresh waffles, oatmeal, or cereal. 2. I was told there was no fitness room which it advertised. 3. Housekeeping kept knocking on the door even with the DO NOT DISTURB sign hanging. Positive side they were very efficient and provided anything I need when I needed it. There are things that if provided could draw more clientele, like a shuttle to bus, train, or somewhere close downtown. Also, a fitness center. One last thing is there are no…",4

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Lacking Microtel Features & Quality,"Not impressed on my first Wyndham Rewards stay there!  :-(   This is the only Microtel we've ever stayed in without a microwave & mini fridge, there was no iron & ironing board, & the hair dryer did not work.    Also, they left only ONE packet for the coffee maker for 2 people!  The breakfast was okay - typical Microtel.  But the room had damaged furniture & cushion at the window seat was torn & had many burn holes - both in many places (it was a throw away item still in use), also holes in the walls where pictures once hung, & tatty linens on the bed.    Not very nice.  Seems like they cut corners there.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Ok so so comfy,Arrived late at night and waited 40min at the airport at the shuttle. Called the motel several times and the front desk women kept saying the shuttle is on it's way and for us to keep waiting. The shuttle never arrived.  I would have just wanted for her to tell us the truth so we could have made other arrangements.,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not a good experience,"We should have known it would not be a great experience when we pulled in after dark and both of their exterior signs were mostly burned out. We had reserved a queen room; the room (138) had a double bed and was ADA accessible. No big deal - we were tired and just wanted to crash. But this room is next to a mechanical room that apparently contains an air compressor or some other heavy equipment that ran for about 30-45 minutes at a time throughout the night. Ugh! The next morning we were taking the 4:10 shuttle to DIA so we went down to grab a little bit of the complimentary breakfast that starts at 4:00. But the clerk refused to put out anything hot until after the shuttle left. (Although she finally brought out fresh apples at 4:15). We also asked her to break a $20 Bill so we could tip the shuttle driver, and she refused. On the plus side, the shuttle driver was awesome, although he was 15 minutes late.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Shut it down,"This was the worst experience with Wyndam. The hotel is severely outdated. The linen hasn't been updated since the 90s. There were holes in the room walls. There was no smoke detectors.  The desk was also used as a table as it held a old, discolored microwave. It needs to be shut down.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Gross!!! Poor service.,Stained sheets. Dirty bathroom. Hallways lined with wet cardboard. Desk clerk on cell phone when I tried to get help with shuttle that was an hour late. Checked out the same day!!! Awful!! Dining area not cleaned and staff was not at all helpful.,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good and bad,"Chose this hotel because it offered a park and fly option.  The good is the location is great and you are able to leave your car at the hotel and catch a ride to the airport. The bad, At check in we were told that there would be breakfast at 4 AM our ride to the airport did not leave till 415. Nothing was put out no options for a quick coffee or a muffin before we left. Upon arrival back to Denver we spent 30 minutes trying to get a hold of the hotel to arrange for a ride back to our car. The phone continue to ring but no one picked up. Finally decided to call corporate and they got us in contact. It seems like there should be a better system.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Ok,"Stuck in Denver. Stayed for one night. No pool. Breakfast was sad. If I get refunded from United, it’s a good free hotel. If I don’t, it’s definitely not worth $170 per night. It’s fine for a bed for a night, but I would not pay that much if it wasn’t my only option and I was getting refunded. The staff was very nice and friendly however!",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not the usual Microtel Experience,Property was dated.  Friendly check-in.  Below average room.  Air Conditioner was very noisy so I had to use the fan setting on cool.  No coffee at checkin or check out.  Was not able to get room receipt at checkout.  Breakfast buffet was below average.,3

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,In a pinch,"I hope this hotels because of its proximity to the Denver Airport, and because it was under the Wyndham brand. I knew it wouldn't be exactly like me Wyndham hotel, but figured certainly it would have some of Wyndham's fine points. Check in was fine, but on our way to our room of door to the supply area was wide open and continue to be open the whole day. Very unattractive to see laundry, cleaning supplies etc etc. The hall rug was very spotted. We had a room with two queens however if we only use one of the beds. Bad choice! I felt like I was falling out of bed because of the side I was on was totally broken down.

Note: there is a diner a short walk away. Better luck there?",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Old and Tired,Broken elevator so I had to lug my heavy suitcase up to the third floor.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Minimal effort,"We had just a short night stay before an early flight and chose this hotel since they had airport shuttle service. They didn't always answer their local phone when we called for our airport pickup. Then their 10 minute wait turned into a 40 minute wait. Once we got our room, we were disappointed with just a trickle of tap water in the bathroom. Plus the toilet gave us hourly loud noises as the tank refilled. We could hear echoes from the room next door...annoying.   Our requested 3am wake up call did not happen. Then their one inexperienced front desk staff didn't know how to ensure the airport shuttle would stop, so it took 3 tries and 45 minutes to get her to call the shuttle service and get one to stop. She was overwhelmed and prioritized getting breakfast prepped that…",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Weekend at the Microtel,Rooms are pleasant and location is good but don't count on having breakfast there.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Shuttled took forever,I waited for the shuttle for almost an hour and watched other hotels do multiple laps.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Outdated,"We booked this hotel for a short night due to a late arriving flight. Although it was a little less expensive than some of the others, I would've preferred to pay more for a better hotel. Extremely outdated, old, unkempt. I hardly slept all night with all the noise outside the room. Beds were uncomfortable, air conditioning was noisy, everything seemed dirty. Breakfast was very simple and limited, based on processed carbs only. Will not return.",1

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not family friendly,"Choice hotels overbook themselves in order to ensure they never have an empty room. We were transferred to this hotel because our other one (Sleep Inn) was overbooked. This one was definitely a downgrade and didn't have a fridge for my baby's milk and food. The only playpen they had available was broken and couldn't lock into place. We unfortunately had a late flight into Denver so by the time we were settled into our room it was about 1:30a:m. The staff members at both locations that helped us that night were very nice and apologetic and said this happens all the time. The hotel itself is very outdated, the breakfast was crap and the shuttle took a very long time to pick us up to take us to the airport. Luckily we had plenty of time before our flight.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Micro,The room was exactly that!!  Much smaller than your usual motel room.  The carpet needed a steam clean and the window seat had stains on cushions.  The website lead me to believe that parking was free for motel guests when you left your car to fly out of DIA.  There is a charge so keep that in mind.,2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Close to DIA... reasonable proce,"I spend 200+ days a year in hotels. This hotel had us on limited budget. It is less than 10min from the airport. Rooms are “simple”, no frills... continental breakfast is average... hard to beat all you can eat. I’d stay here again, as all I need is a place for my head and a hot shower in the morning.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,adequate for a five hour stay,The Microtel was adequate for a 5 hour stay.  The price was reasonable and we did arrive at the airport in plenty of time for our flight.  Our return was delayed due to the shuttle not arriving. We called numerous times and were picked up over an hour late...90 minutes later. ,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not up to the competition,"Should have figured that the property was going to be a couple of notches below the surrounding hotels given its rate. However, have had good experiences in other Wyndham properties so figured why not. Located in the strip of relatively new hotels at Denver’s airport i found its design and room set up very dated. Amenities in the room were poor to none existent.  Definitely recommend spend $10-15 more per night for nicer place",2

I booked this hotel through my Wyndham rewards app using rewards points for a free stay. I had a vey early flight out of DIA and this hotel offered a free 24hour shuttle to the airport (which happens to be the only positive experience I had at this hotel).

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Cheap stay near DIA,"All of the hotels near DIA are priced higher than they are worth due to demand, especially during peak travel times.  There was not adequate parking for park and stay guests.  The parking lot was dark without adequate lighting.  Night staff working the front desk were yawning, not helpful, and were difficult to understand their English.  ",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Run down!,Do not be fooled by the website pictures.  This hotel is extremely run down and in desperate need of upgrades.  I will say the room was clean and the bed was comfortable but there were water stains on the ceiling and peeling wallpaper.  In the hall there was a bucket to catch dripping ceiling water and we were on the 2nd floor!  The person who checked us in was rude and didn't record our request for late checkout.  My advice - FIND ANOTHER HOTEL!,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Okay, wish it was a little bit nicer",I wish we had an working elevator and wish there was a bit more to breakfast. We slept fine (even though there wasn’t much of a blanket on the bed and no spare blanket) and the airport shuttle was great! Room was small and shabby. They allowed us to check in during our late flight and provided a shuttle to and from without additional cost. ,2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Less than expected,"Desk person was not friendly, welcoming.  Breakfast was less than expected.  The room we stayed in had an odor.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Couldn’t be much worse!,"Looked for a reasonable Hotel near the Denver airport. Microtel popped up as a fair choice. Boy was I wrong with the place. It is run down with what appears to be very little upkeep and maintenance.  your feet stuck to the carpet in the guest rooms, and the rooms are itty bitty. The first room they assigned us had water running continuously from under the bathroom sink on to the floor. For all of the afternoon and evening there seemed to only be one employee on t premises w long lines at check in.  There were only a few good things re this place: a good king bed and a decent hot and cold breakfast. it also had good a/c and was close to airport.  But it is a poor choice for my money.  Wont happen again.  ",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,The worse hotel experience!,No shuttle available from airport to hotel. When I arrived after I took an Uber there was no one at the desk for over 20 minutes. One staff member arrived she was extremely rude. She really did not care about her position.

The airport shuttle was full 2x @ 2am. Driver informed us that he was not taking us to Microtel. We were taken 2 subpar hotel not equal2 our reservation. The floor was so filthy we would not allow our kids 2walkon. NO MATTRESS PAD on bed. We immediately called Microtel& requested a full refund & call frm mgr, Levi. He never called so we called him. The call disconnected. We called back. Levi said, ""give me your number & I will call you right back."" He never called. Submitted a complaint thru the website. Boilerplate response said we'd get response w/in 7 days. Still waiting. DMs to Wyndham Twitter pointless. Agents didn't understand the issue. Requests to have a supervisor call us went unanswered. As UNLV's College of Hotel Admin alumna, I get walking a client when oversold. That generally does not happen to a Wyndham Rewards member direct booking two months ahead. The hotel has a DUTY to provide the same or better accommodations. This is fraud and bait&switch.Greg Giordano, VP Brand Operations & John Henderson, VP Operations should be horrified that the initial walk to another property was so badly botched, subsequent custserv dismal, & resolution non-existent.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Great rooms, but poor airport pick up","These rooms are great because you get two Queen beds.  They are clean and a comfortable size.  We paid $7 a day to leave our car, so that was a fair price.  Morning shuttle to airport was great.  However, returning to hotel after our vacation was a disaster!  We called probably 4 times to be told the shuttle just left, it will be there soon etc... we waited an HOUR (thank goodness it was summer not winter).  We ended up take the shuttle for the hotel next door and walking across the parking lot back to our car.  Only one desk clerk and one driver so they are very understaffed. ",3

After waiting for almost two hours and the third shuttle came and left without us because so many people rushed in before us, we took a taxi costing $50.

No coffee prepared for early morning departures.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Basic and Comfortable ,The rooms are pretty small for a family of five. There's not many options but the room served the purpose. Disappointed there was no mini fridge or microwave. When you're traveling with a family you have snacks and drinks that need to stay refrigerated. I had gone down to the desk for a garbage bag for my laundry and no one could find one. Last time we were in Denver we stayed at the Ramada. I'd prefer to stay there over this Microtel.,3

I called Microtel and Desirea on the phone replied to me promptly and gave me all informations i was asking for and mentioned that we could simply walk in and a room will be ready for us.  Choice was made simply on her efficiency on the phone compare to the others I have called in the area!   When we arrived at the hotel, Power outage!😱🤯 A big part of the city had no more power.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Overall horrible experience,"Booked a double bed room in advance, arrived late(early AM) only to find they had given away our room. Was given a single bed room ( for a family of 4)and spent an uncomfortable night sleeping in a small window seat. We were told we would be given a discount but was only price adjusted from double to single room rate. When I complained they offered an additional $10 discount(not even close to adequately correcting the problem) and then when final price was adjusted the $10 wasn't actually applied. Desk clerk seemed both unconcerned and unwilling to rectify the situation. Would highly recommend others to seek lodging elsewhere",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good option for Denver stay,"Booked room on a very busy week in Denver.  Room was good. Average in appearance,  but met our needs.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,CLEAN and comfortable,My room was extremely clean and comfortable. The refrigerator was cold and the air conditioner worked great.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Poor Quality,"The staff was pleasant enough when addressed and the room still showed dated features, but was updated enough for a one-night stay before a flight. For the price point, though, the exterior grounds, the lobby and the breakfast area area were unkept, unpresentable and rather shabby. Overall, this property and its staff need an update in appearance. I wouldn't stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Comfortable, clean; breakfast and desk staff were lacking; not sure I'd go back","I know this is an older budget hotel, and I believe my expectations were accordingly low. The beds were comfortable, the room was clean, and the rate was within my budget. The mini-fridge was unplugged when we checked in. It worked (froze $5 worth of strawberries solid overnight) so I don't know why it was unplugged or why cleaning staff didn't plug it in. Breakfast included Belgian waffle maker, which is always nice, plus a few cereals, toast, yogurt, etc. The BIG problem was there was no juice at all at 7:00 am. Breakfast started at 4:30 am. Desk clerk said the machine was broken and were waiting for housekeeping to fix it when they came on at 7:00 and she didn't really seem to care. It was not fixed by 7:30 am when I left. Simple solution is to have a jug of OJ and apple juice for patrons to pour until the machine is fixed. We had a rental car so did not try to use the airport shuttle. If I went again, I would probably shell out the extra $20 and stay some place else, but it wasn't horrible.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Airport parking and shuttle,"Do not use this hotel for parking, the shuttle service is a joke, we had to pay another shuttle service to return us to the hotel and our vehicle on our arrival back home.

We tried numerous times to reach the manager Levi Willis, finally today I reached him, he was not willing to offer a full refund and in fact his customer service is deplorable, he should not be in charge of anything  and should be replaced",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Great deal for the price,"I have to say I am a little shocked at some of the reviews.  This isn't a six star resort and in case some don't realize stuff happens at those resorts also.Stayed March 12, 2019, before our flight.  Yes, the rooms are not expansive (hence ""micro"" in the name) but it is all you need at the beginning or end of your trip.  The shuttle we needed to take was full so guess what...we took the earlier shuttle no problem.  Wait at the hotel or wait at the airport.  The ladies working the desk.  I cannot tell you just how wonderful they were.  They smiled, we laughed (I had a one shot card to our room so they had to keep keying it).  Could I have been upset that I had to go and get it done, yes I could have but you know what...I was leaving for Mexico the next day (the day the closed the airport down for the storm).  I enjoyed going up and saying ""guess what"" If you are a person who needs pampered...check in down the street.  If you need a comfortable room, comfortable bed, pleasant staff, coffee and a small breakfast that doesn't break the bank this is your spot!",4

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Shuttle Drivers made the trip!!!,As a supervisor at a Huge Hotel in New Orleans I take customer service extremely serious. When I exited the airport I was greeted by the shuttle driver Tim. Tim had the brightest smile and even waited 2 minutes until my husband  ran from the restroom. As a 1st time guest in Denver we had a ton of questions. Tim answered them all and even recommended a few places. He’s what I call Excellent customer service!!! We arrived a little early for check in so we had to wait a few hours but we still managed to get in a little early. The 2 men at the front desk were nice. The Shuttle driver Ashley was very nice as well. I really appreciated the hospitality that your shuttle drivers showed. The hotel was nice and the perks were a plus. Overall great stay!,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Shuttle Stinks,Waited for over an hour and we're told 4 different doors to go to!  Finally had to pay a taxi.  Rooms are super small and not worth it at all!  Staff was rude and unhelpful.  Just skip this hotel at all costs.,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Wonderful Stay for an unexpected layover,"Microtel was the perfect answer for an unexpected layover at DIA.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,NP Grandma, Very poor communication with the front desk as far as shuddle pick up.  Waiting for one and a half hours was a bit much. The breakfast they have pretty much your typical continental breakfast. It would’ve been nice to have more choices.,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Absolutely HORRIBLE,Let’s start off with the fact that my boyfriend and having to wait 45 minutes for the shuttle to arrive at the Denver Airport. Then we finally get to the front desk and the front desk clerk looks at us as if we were interrupting his game of solitaire or something then looks at us with a blank stare. We say we’re checking in and then he gave us another funny looks as if we were speaking a foreign language. He hands my boyfriend the invoice to sign (with no amount) and my boyfriend asks if he can get documentation with the price that we paid on it and he responds “Not that I know of.” I asked if he can provide us with a reciept and he said that we would have to call the person who we paid with if we paid online. The hotel should still be able to provide a receipt to the customer.…,1

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not reliable,"Don’t rely on the airport shuttle. They tell you it will be there to pick you up in 20 minutes, stood around for 45minutes, picked us up and then turned around half way there to go BACK to the airport to pick more people up so all and all we didn’t get to the hotel until 1:30 minutes later.

I called and brought it to their attention and they told me I never checked out... I told them I did and I even signed their papers, and then she said the best she could do was leave a note for someone. I called corporate who says I shouldnt have even been charged that fee. Now theres an open case and I should hear from someone in a week. Awful customer service.UPDATE 12/02: I've been playing phone tag between corporate and the hotel, they both claim it's the others responsibility to take care of this. it's been a month and I still havent received my deposit, and have been told multiple times by the hotel manager that he doesn't have time for me.",1

Even though there had no any sign to point out where to wait for the shuttle at the airport. I had a call to find the place, EXIT 505(east of Jeppesen Terminal) ISLAND 3. I waited for the shuttle over half of the hour and there were many passengers who were also confused about the shuttle station. It took about 20 mins from DEN to the hotel. And I also took the shuttle to DEN the next day. The hotel is basically equipped. No refrigerator in the room and the furnishing is old. However, it's clean and spacious. But it's still a little overpriced for me.飯店接駁車還算方便，但須在機場找到等待月台，記得提前與飯店前台預約。房間寬敞，但部分裝潢老舊，房內無冰箱。",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Old Worn Out Frazzled,"This was a stop over after our international flight from Munich.  The only good thing about the hotel was the airport shuttle that we waited on 20 minutes to pick us up.  We asked for a nonsmoking room and even signed a $250 cleaning fee if we smoked.  The room reeked of deodorizer masking smoke.  We were too tired to ask for a different room and put up with it.  I’ve included pictures of some of the poorly maintained items in the dreary, worn out and depressing room.  There was someelses hair all over the room.  Stay somewhere else!",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,No one wants to wait 50 minutes for a shuttle,"When I arrived to the airport I didn't expect to wait for our shuttle for 50 minutes (the estimate had been 20-30) nor did I expect to watch 5 shuttles for the other hotels go by in that time. While the hotel was clean (even if it was run down--the railing in the elevator was broken and hanging, and there was lots of scuffing and damage from use throughout) and the staff very pleasant, when I have a late overnight layover I want to get promptly into bed and crash. Simply because of the very long and somewhat disorganized shuttle wait (we called twice and were told it would be there in 10 minutes both times), I would not stay here again.I wish we had called an uber, looking back on it, but isn't a free shuttle part of the reason you book one hotel over another? Anyway, too bad because I'm not too picky but this experience was disappointing and made for a long travel day and short sleep.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Close to Airport and Rental Car Returns,"We had an early morning flight out of Denver and thought of nearby lodging to airport and rental car return. We don't have experience with Microtel units, but the site looked good from outside. We were checked in by Levi who greeted us very cordially. Our room was clean and comfortable and met our needs. We were pleasantly surprised to know that they have breakfast (no hot items) starting at 4:00am. We were to leave at 5:00; so, that fit our needs. Cost verses Value - for us, it was a bit over priced, but for convenience to airport/rental car returns, sure that entered into pricing. We judge lodging locations by asking the question - would we stay there again. In this case, our answer would be only if we needed to be close to airport and rental car return.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Old, Rundown, Slow Shuttle Service","The price was less, compared to the Westin, of course. But you get less than you pay for, really.

It’s fine for a quick sleep; provided you don’t have loud neighbors PARTYING HARD until 2 or 3 am.To add to the “ya get what ya pay for” adage, we waited for over 45 minutes for the shuttle, even though they claim they run every half hour.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Fine but overpriced,"This hotel was OK - especially since I was just spending a quick night in transit, but quite a bit overpriced.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,DO NOT PARK YOUR CAR AT THIS MOTEL!,"Although the room was adequate and served our needs because of late and early DIA flights, we left our car parked here for a couple days for which the hotel charged $7 per day.

I stayed 15 minutes staring in dismay. Then i left at stayed down the road. I would have rather let in my car. This was the worst hotel I've ever encountered. ",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Decent budget hotel ,"Standard budget hotel. Spacious and comfortable room. We got two queen beds for two adults and two kids which was perfect. They offer an airport shuttle which was super convenient and free breakfast as early as 4:30. Wifi worked well also if you're traveling for business & need to stay connected. There are coffee shops, restaurants and liquor stores  nearby. Iris, at the front desk was pleasant to me & my family. The only negatives were the room wasn't as clean as it should've been & the breakfast was full of carbs. We didn't complain because we got a great last minute deal.  ",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Fine place but watch out for $25 pet fee,"While ""pet friendly,"" Microtel charges $25 one-time fee if you have a pet. For a single night's stay, this is high, but  a deal compared to other place's fees of $10 or $15 PER NIGHT. This fee structure isn't disclosed if you book through booking.com.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,What A Nightmare,"I arrived at the Denver airport around 6 pm and waited out in the hotel shuttle area for over an hour. The other hotel shuttles made several rounds while I was sitting there. The shuttle drivers recognised me after a few rounds and shook their heads in sympathy and dismay. They said Microtel has their own shuttle and they were very sorry they couldn't help me. Meanwhile, I called the hotel to find out when the shuttle might arrive. Every time I called, the receptionist brusquely told me to hold, then, after a few minutes, disconnected me. So it went for about an hour. I called Wyndham reservations, and the lovely young lady also called for nearly twenty minutes, while I was on hold, with the same result. Eventually, I was transferred to customer service- which kept me on hold for 35 minutes before I hung up. By this time I was hot and tired of breathing diesel fumes, so I went inside to the air conditioning. I was really torqued and did not want to stay with Microtel anymore. However, it was past the 4pm cancellation deadline and I would be damned if I was going to be charged. I called Expedia, through whom I had booked the room, and asked them to help me avoid the charge. A wonderful lady at Expedia spent THREE HOURS on the phone with me to resolve the charge problem. I sat in the lounge, on hold, and had a couple of beers while she worked on the matter. It was then about 10:30 pm. I had to be back at the airport by 3 am. I was angry and a little tipsy.  I didn't feel like spending $250 to sleep four hours in a hotel, so in a fit of indignant pigheadedness, I decided to sleep of the floor at my departing gate. Which I did. If you could call it sleep. Lol. It was a surreal adventure the likes of which I thought I had left behind decades ago. But, I'm intrepid and tough, and I can lie on a cold, hard floor with the best of them in a stubborn fit of pique. I did not get so much as an apology from Wyndham. I vow to sleep on any airport floor anywhere before I ever stay with Wyndham again.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Ticked the box - but shuttle bus could be better,"We stayed in this hotel before our early flight the next morning.The room was fine and contained everything you would expect from an airport hotel.The bed was really comfy.Our only criticism is of the free airport transfer, initially we wanted a transfer at around 0430, we were offered 0440 or 0310 (despite there being two buses an hour). It appeared that the transfer is shared between several hotels and they only have a handful of spaces they can each use. After quering this we managed to get rebooked onto the 0410 (which ended up having 9 spare seats!)Be persistent and book early and you should get what you want - but I think this is an area the hotel can improve on.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not worth the money spent,"There was some glitch at check in and I had to wait for them to figure it out. Fine, it wasn't anyone's fault and the night clerk was courteous and kept apologizing. It was midnight and I was very tired. The room was small and out dated. The bed not very comfortable, very hard and the light didn't work when I entered the room. The night person was very rude when my husband was trying to break a $100 bill for pizza. The breakfast area was dirty and nasty. Stained chairs, just very unkempt. The morning desk clerk was very nice tho. It was shift change and the same night staff let me use their computer to print my boarding passes.  I WILL NOT SPEND GOOD MONEY TO STAY HERE AGAIN. Better off at the Hampton that was in front of Microtel. VERY DISSAPPOINTING FOR A WYNDAM.",2

Breakfast lacked adequate protein; however,  the Moonlight Diner across the field was excellent.  The room was extremely noisy, as if no sound proofing  materials were used in construction.

There is a property in between under construction and it not lighted and it is muddy.   The front desk staff, while friendly, was incompetent.  While it says there is free WiFi, there is not.  The room seemed clean enough but the whole hotel had an odor.

The room was not very large but it was fine for our needs. We did stay here the night before we left for an early flight out of Denver. That room was much larger and more than adequate as well.

Which is odd since there is a plaque downstairs that claims that it’s a non smoking hotel. One packet of caffeinated coffee in the room when everyone knows there should be two when you are a couple. The breakfast is okay I suppose however it would be nice if there were healthier choices like yoghurt that doesn’t contain neuro toxins like Nutrasweet. peeling wallpaper in the bathroom and no TP holder.

In addition, the breakfast, while pretty average for the ""free continental"", was available at 4:00 AM for folks acting early flights.  This was a real plus for us, since otherwise we would need to purchase something expensive and way more calories at the airport.  The desk staff were friendly and helpful, took care of making sure we were on the list for the free airport shuttle and to top it off, the rooms facing the front of the building had a spectacular view of Denver and the Rockies beyond.",4

On 4/2 at 4am, our plane landed and then we received a text message that my credit card had just been charged for that day’s stay.  Perfect, no problem.  We caught the airport shuttle to Microtel, checked in at 5:30am with Ken, and requested a shuttle back to the airport for 5pm. 1st red flag:  Ken said he knew nothing about the shuttles (even though we just arrived on one), couldn’t tell us how often they ran, and that we’d have to speak with the PM staff as that is their job.…",1

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Okay for quick short stay,The rooms are comfortable but not overwhelming great.  The TV is better than most in the price range.  It is tucked in at the back of a parking lot.  There is a soda/water available but nothing to eat except for the breakfast buffet.  So if arriving late make sure you have something to eat (no candy or other food is sold in the hotel).,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,price mix-up,"When booking two rooms for 1 night we selected the Microtel and was quoted $80 dollars per room as an AARP cardholder, the clerk on duty confirmed I would receive this discount. After arriving home and balancing my checkbook, I double checked my receipts only to find out I had been charged $89 per room. Pillows were very uncomfortable, and continental breakfast was mediocre at best, waffle maker did not work.      Sincerely Disappointed",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Unathorized charge,"I stayed at this hotel on Feb. 19th and on Feb. 24th, they charged my debit $50.00, for what I don't know (and neither do they). I had already paid for the room in full through Expedia. I have contacted the hotel 3 times & was told they were crediting my account back the $50.00. As of today, March 5th, no credit has been received. I called again today & the person that I talked to was very rude & said they had credited my card on Feb. 20th, which is a lie, since the charge didn't hit until Feb. 24th. I will be filing a dispute.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Needs attention!!!!,The hotel is okay if you just want a bed.  The entire building is in disrepair and the carpet has not seen a vacuum cleaner for a while.  The cleanliness could be cleared up quickly and should be!,2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,OK stay,The room was clean but in bad need of renovation.  I stayed at a Microtel in Omaha and it was really nice.  I was on the first floor next to a door that led outside and was awake all night to the slamming of the door.,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,lots of disrepair,"I have stayed at this Microtel Inn a few times before and it keeps getting worse each time. This time stayed in room 307. Upholstery torn upholstery peeling wallpaper, broken sink stopper just to name a few items. Won't be staying here again at any price.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Was Just OK,The heat wasn't working correctly and after telling the front desk of the issue and them having all day to look at it my wife came back to the room 14 hours later to exaxtly the same issue with the heater,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Decent place to stay,"Nice little place to stay if you're just stopping in for a day or two. The bed was nice and big but the room itself was really small. The bathroom was really clean neat. A few corners of the wall were damaged, nothing too big but noticeable.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Payment,"Wasn’t able to process my payment, even though we tried 5 different cards. Blamed it on us being out of state. Even though we used the card everywhere else just fine with no problems. Lucky we had cash, was going to charge us an extra 200.00 since we were using cash. Since when is it more expensive to use cold hard earned cash!!!! ",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Heater wasn't on...,"Booked this room to stay the night before flying out early the next morning. It was in the negative degrees outside and snowing. Got to the room and the heater wasn't on at all. Took several hours to warm up the room.   I don't have too high of standards for last minute reservations at fairly inexpensive hotels, but it would be nice to have the heater on at least a little in the middle of winter when it's blizzarding outside.   Outside of this, the room satisfied the needs I had for this trip.",2

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Comfortable stay,Staff was super friendly and accommodating! Great location next to diner and not far from the airport or Denver. Room was clean and comfortable. Great rates too! I would most definitely recommend this to friends and I’ll stay here again next time I’m in town. ,5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Business trip,We picked this hotel for price and proximity to the Denver Airport.  We were very pleased with both!,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Below average,There is a strange smell in the hall way and a strong smell of perfume (probably to cover smells of odor) in the room. Toilet was partially clogged. Not impressive with this hotel.,2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Worth it!,"I went to Microtel for an overnight layover. The hotel was super good for the price. +: free shuttle on time, Dianele at the front desk was really helpful,  computer + printer, spacious room, fitness center and free breakfast- : stains on one bedsheet I recommend this hotel even though there was a stain on one bed because the rest of the room was super clean.

Not a lot of food that we were interested in close by.  We were only there for one night and left early in the morning, so no comment on the breakfast.",4

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Look elsewhere,Will not recommend this hotel at all. The room was nasty. Wallpaper in the bathroom was coming off the walls. Mold all throughout the bathroom and shower would not turn on. Overall room had a roach motel feel to it.,2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good stay," The hotel is a little rundown. For the continental breakfast there was some moldy bread, and breakfast was not set up by the time we had to leave for the airport. Overall price is good, and the location is good. The shuttle to the airport was fast and comfortable. We have stayed here for years and seen it in better condition and in worst condition. We would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,It was great for what I needed it for,"The internet went out a few times, but it was otherwise a great location to transition to taking back the rental and shuttling to the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Nice rooms,The hotel was very close to the airport yet very quiet and roomy with a comfortable bed and a nice shower.,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Information was incomplete from the employee at Microtel regarding the shuttle,"I arrived into Denver Int'l Airport around 10pm and called Microtel (as directed) for a shuttle ... I was told someone would be there and was directed to the appropriate island at the airport ... After almost an hour (outside in the cold) I called again and was told someone would be there shortly ... I keep watching for a Mircrotel shuttle ... The third time I called the same employee answered and I asked what I should be looking for ... At this point, the employee told me the shuttle DID NOT say Microtel on it but rather was a leased vehicle that picked up for several hotels ... That should have been disclosed the first call and if not then, certainly the second time I called looking for the shuttle ... I finally got to my room around 12:30pm ... I did mention this to the…",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Microtel near Denver Airport,"We needed a clean place to stay before flying out the next day. For mayb years we had been staying at the Hampton next door and maybe became spoiled, But their 30 to 40% price increase caused us to look elsewhere,  The place was clean and the bed comfortable. The heat temperature did not regulate properly and the room overheated when we left for dinner. This is wood framed building so we  heard footsteps/ thuds throughout the night from the guest above us.   The breakfast was basic and had the obligatory waffle machine but lacked non-stick spray, The hot water was not hot but the microwave solved this issue.  Minor complaints when considers the price point which I really liked. I would stay here again. ",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Just Fine,We needed a place for a short overnight layover. When we walked in there was a large youth group so we were worried about noise but it was fine on the upper floor. Lobby is dated and so are rooms. Bed was surprisingly super comfy! This is a clean basic place and served our needs and was fair value for the price.,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Helpful staff,"The staff here is courteous. They're kind and helpful and try to suit your needs as best as possible. Our room was cozy and well kept. Only minor lighting issues, but other than that it's nice. The sound barrier is slightly bad. Definitely hear heavy footed people above, and you need to keep your voice at low levels.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Average,Was originally offered free parking and shuttle to airport.  Get there no longer offer free parking when flying out.  Was charged 7 per day to park at location.  No toilet paper holders just leaves on the sink.  Not really impressed with the facility.,2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Ok but not great.,Its clean and decent but the walls are very easy to hear thru and every car that drives by can be heard inside the room.  We stayed on the 2nd floor and it was loud most of the night.  We could hear a lot of conversations in the next room without trying.  ,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,you get what you pay for,"I had a terrible experience at this hotel. The only pros about the Microtel is the fact you can take a free shuttle from the airport, and the bed was clean. But the customer service is terrible. Every single concierge employee I talked to was extremely rude, unhelpful and clearly didn't want to be there. I would highly advise against staying here.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good Stay in Snowy Weather,"We were stranded at the Denver airport during the most recent snowstorm.  Knowing that the airlines had already cancelled the next leg of our flight, we had our daughter search for a room for us while we were in the air.  The Microtel was reasonably priced, and came with a decent breakfast.  The desk folk were quite friendly and very accomodating.  We'd stay here again if circumstances required.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Dirty Room,"I woke to find brown stained sheets. The grossest experience I have had in a hotel and I have traveled a lot.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,OUR NIGHT AT THE MOLDY INN,"On our way to Alaska for a short trip. Overnighted in Denver before we flew out again. Went with Microtel because of it's location to the airport, and the price. There is a ""Hotel Neighborhood"" just a couple of miles from Denver International Airport, with many hotels to chose from to accommodate their travelers. There is a Shuttle that comes through to pick up for multiple hotels at the airport. We were lucky to get on, as the shuttle for these hotel is always late, and we rode away in a full shuttle leaving weary travelers behind in the frigid Denver air (15F). Check in was standard for any facility, and we we on our way to the second floor to our room shortly. There was this overbearing scent in the hallway of the second floor. My girl said it smelled like pickles. Like a 10gallon pickle jar was freed of it's contents in the hallway. To the room: The bed was made and room put together, as expected. Table lamps? Gone. Comfortable ambient lighting of any sort? Non existent. Bright, uncomfortable, sterile hospital room lighting? Absolutely! One super bright florescent light was available for the main room. Oh: It was a single King Suite size room BTW. A secondary light was available over the second bed/cot over-the-AC/Heater setup. But it provided a chatter, buzz, and occasional blinking that colors the perfect undertone for a horror movie. So the overall lighting was definitely uncomfortable. But then we turned on the light for the  bathroom. Oh My...  Wallpaper. Wallpaper has no place in a bathroom because the humidity, over time, will release the paper from the wall. It will curl up and then begin to set up the perfect party for mold. So, can you guess what comes next on this review? You guessed it!! MOLD. MOLD in the bathroom on the plaster under the wallpaper, and on the backside of the wallpaper just above the shower. The heat lamp was replaced with a CFL style bulb, so the bathroom was freezing. My girl wanted to take a bath. I was summoned to assist with the tub for some problem with spout. Imagine that! The FAUCET/SHOWER pin on the water spout was permanently affixed in the SHOWER position. So a bath was now out of the question. There was no fridge or microwave in the room. The bed itself was decent, and there was not a lot of noise in the motel. Breakfast was terrible, coffee tasted like ten year tap water, waffle maker about only choice. Had a proper meal when we got to the airport. TIP!! The shuttle service is slow. Leave Early, VERY EARLY!!!!!",1

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,dissappointed,Website misleading - parking not free for those using shuttle to airport.  Clerk at 3:00 a.m. was incredibly rude when I inquired about when parking fee was to be paid.  I would not recommend to anyone.,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Okay but needs improvement.,The building is in need of renovation throughout. The breakfast was better than some but still lacking. The service staff were very accommodating and friendly. Our room was adequate but no fridge or microwave. Did have Wi-Fi and TV. Close to the Airport.,3

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Very clean and comfortable.,"We only stayed one night but were very happy with our accommodations.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Adequate Accomodations,"The hotel condition feels and looks older and a bit of wear & tear. It feels like a couple of steps up from a Motel 6. You can easily hear conversations in the next room. Our room had a musty smell that seemed to emanate from the bathroom. However, the king-size bed was good and comfortable and the place was swept and clean.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Don't waste your money,Got bit by either a spider or bed bugs I would not recommend this hotel. Not to mention when I went to go have breakfast there was a moldy Bagel sitting right on top of all of the bagels.,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,WE WERE STOLEN FROM BY STAFF!!!!!!,"DO NOT stay in this hotel. We were STOLEN from by staff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We went to Denver, CO to visit my daughter for an after Christmas celebration. Our plane got in late and we got to the hotel at about 1:30 am. We were very tired from travelling all day and just wanted to sleep. The night desk clerk took our credit card info and gave us our room key. We went up to our room. In the morning, I noticed that my purse was missing. I re-traced my steps and concluded that I must have left it in the lobby while checking in. I went downstairs to ask for it. No one had seen it. They called the night desk clerk that checked us in. She said that it was behind the counter. I checked the purse and noticed that $500 in cash was missing. ( That money was meant for my daughter as a Christmas gift). I spoke to the morning desk clerk and she called the manager and the night desk clerk that checked us in. The night desk clerk made up a story about the purse being taken by someone and then returned back to the desk. Staff was not very helpful or sympathetic in this matter at all. I called the police and they are doing an investigation at this time. Luckily, the hotel has surveillance cameras so hopefully some light can be shed on this. Throughout all of this, I never got a phonecall from the hotel manager to at least apologize and maybe offer us a refund for our night’s stay. Very bad customer service.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Mirror, mirror on the wall","The room had mirrors on the wall above the beds, just a bit unsettling. I don't mean one mirror, I mean the whole wall was mirrored.  Smokey mirrors.",2

Good take-out information from front desk.",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Wonderful Experience!,"Booked online, reservation was ready and accurate when we arrived. Staff was friendly and helpful both checking in and out. The room was clean and very comfortable. Breakfast was adequately stocked and there was something for everyone. Extremely convenient location for flying out of Denver International. There is a gas station a minute away from the hotel, so the rental car could be filled before return. All the major rental car returns are a couple of minutes away. Very quiet hotel also. Will definitely stay here again when flying out of Denver International.",5

This one was dirty, as if the staff didn't care about the common area.  Morning juice machine was broken and there was no alternative offered--just water and coffee.  That is not a continental breakfast.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Needs a remodel,"The reception agents were helpful, although oddly, they didn’t know where the restaurants were located that they suggested to guests.  The property really needs a thorough upgrade of decor and lighting.  The rooms were a bit shabby.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,It was the worst,There were hair of ALL kinds of BODY parts on the bed and what looked like animal hair and the sofa in the room I got itchy bumps reported it and I was told management was going to call me back it's been 7 days and still nothing,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,convenient overnight stay,"Quick informative check-in, bell cart availability, easy checkout. Our room didn't have wall art just the hold where they would hold them.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not impressed...,Nice clean room. However the smoke detector  was hanging loose out of the ceiling and there was no telephone in the room. We reported this and they were very surprised and would take care of the problem...but phone was never provided. Good thing we had our own alarm to set since we had to get up at 4:15 AM. We are amazed this is a Wyndham property. Will probably look elsewhere next time...there are many choices in the area.,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Needs cleaning and repair. Shame on you Wyndham,My door you could see around the edges of it to the hallway. It made me feel unsafe.  My floor was not vacuumed. The chair had a stain on it that was gross and wet. The window cushion has burns in it and stains. The light over the window seat popped when you turned it on. The heater unit in my room would not cycle so I either had to cook or freeze. The bathroom had rust on the floor. The wallpaper in the batbroom was peeling. I expected more from wyndham. I will never stay at a microtel again. The food for breakfast was displayed horribly and cold. The entrance was dirty.,2

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Unhappy,After a long day of driving I get to the Microtel room I booked and I found hairs on the sheets. The entire room was so cramped with furniture that there was hardly any room to walk. The room needed to be deep cleaned.,2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good for a one night stay,"We stayed here with family to catch a early morning flight out of Denver. It is ok for a night stay. Rooms need to be upgraded looks very jaded. Breakfast at 4 am leave a lot to be desired, the coffee pot was empty and when asked lukewarm coffee was filled up, looked like a half hearted effort.",3

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Great price, big room",I stayed there before flying out and I found the room to be large and clean.  The pillows are real nice however I didn't find the bed that comfortable.  The shuttle was right on time and for $70 this close to the airport you can't go wrong.,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Mediocrity at it's finest?,"Wasn't really blown away with either the service provided by the front counter or the hotel itself. I had gone on a 4,000 mile road trip crossing eight states and staying at a multitude of hotels and being a young mid 20's adult I was treated very professionally at every hotel except this one. I'm not sure what changed, but by being treated like an adolecent when I have more life experience then the guy behind the counter was definitely an annoyance. i understand the risk of renting a hotel room to a young group of people, yet there was a lack of professionalism and trust that made me want to walk out of that place.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,A great Airport hotel,Rooms are clean and comfortable.  Friendly staff.  Breakfast starts at 4am for those with early flights.  Our go to location when flying out of Denver.,5

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,one night stay,"Friendly and professional desk clerk.  The shuttle to the airport was on time as stated and only took us 10 minutes to get to the airport. Variety of breakfast available at 4:00 a.m.  Quiet room, clean.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,One night only.,Generally the accommodations were commensurate with the price and my only criticism is with the  bedding. It is winter in Colorado and I found that the absence of a reasonably warm blanket between the bedspread and sheet (or the availability of a spare blanket in a drawer) caused me to be uncomfortably warm from the blasting dry air flowing from the heating/cooling unit. I found myself opting for a heatless room whereby I needed to put towels from the bathroom on top of my bedding to be comfortable.,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,It served it's purpose,"The rating was a 7 when I was looking for a Hotel to stay overnight at. It appeared to be an okay hotel, fairly close to the airport. When we drove up, the Hotel's Name was half burned out, so we had a micro but no tel. Upon entry the attendant didn't look too awake or a bit slow. While I was checking in a lady stopped by the desk and asked how they could get a wake up call if there wasn't a phone. He looked at her perplexed and sais there is no phone is your room. He finished checking us in and we left to go to our room. Passing the vending machines and ice maker, the panel to the ice maker compressor compartment was missing and it was laden with dust and dirt. The ice maker had lime marked trickling down along the sides and the dispenser had rust and a pool of water under it's leg that seemed to have been setting there a long time. Didn't make getting a snack or ice look like a healthy choice. Upon entering it was tad musty and cramped but being small wasn't an issue. As we prepared for bed, there was a lot of hallway noise which came right through the door, eventually quieting down. Our initial thought was this is a little flea bag hotel with who knows what goes on here. I wasn't expecting the Ritz, but have the place done up right. Oh by the way, no phone in the room anywhere. In the morning we had to get up early to get to airport and went for breakfast. Styrofoam bowls, cups, dishes, plastic forks, no hard boiled eggs, a jug of milk looked couple of days old, waffles were good, but not much else to chose from. Off to the airport. Most likely won't stay there again, but now we know and so do you.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Close to the Airport is the only thing this hotel has going for it.,"Tiny Room, Not very clean, Continental breakfast was inedible.  The only thing good about this hotel is price and close to the airport for early morning flights. Wifi was sketchy too. There were good places to eat close by.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Best deal for forced layover at DIA,"Good shuttle access to and from hotel but give yourself an extra half hour.  Clean and friendly staff.  Good WIFI.  Continental breakfast was about average for this type of hotel.  There are a couple of good restaurants within walking distance, otherwise somewhat Isolated.",4

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,One of the Worst Ever,"Having previously worked for Wyndham Hotels, I figured I could count on a certain level of value and quality even at an economy hotel. So not the case. First room clearly smelled llike someone had been smoking weed in it (This is a non-smoking hotel). When we moved to the second room, another guest repeatedly tried to enter my room. Fortunately, I had the security lock on.  A few minutes later the front desk called and wanted to know what my name was as she had no record of me being in the room even though she had just checked me in and given me the key some 15 minutes earlier. The room was horribly dated and noisy. The refrigerator buzzed (i unplugged it.) and there was no reading light. Only light was a huge fluorescent light over the bed which could not be used if someone in other bed wished to sleep.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Do not stay here,"I did not mind knowing the size was small. It was the DIRTIEST hotel I have ever stayed in...in my life.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"its ok for a quick stay, staff is friendly and helpful but the rooms... yikes!","The bed was so used that it had like deep pockets where sleepers normally lay down, I noticed first but wanted to keep it to myself, then my husband complaint of the same thing in the morning, they should really get better or newer mattresses. The room is tiny, but who cares.",2

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Would choose another in the area,"I booked three reservations for a family trip. They found two and could not locate the third. I was given a third room but then my third reservation was charged to my card as a ""no show."" Trying to get a refund or someone to call me back has been difficult. The property itself is okay. It's not the most up to date but for the free shuttle to the airport and complimentary breakfast, it does the job. The reservation trouble is what has me frustrated. We even had the print out confirmations. Next time we'll book somewhere else. There are too many competitive hotels in the area to settle. The rooms were decent for the price. We left too early for breakfast but it looked like the typical hotel breakfast food. The gal at the front desk could have tried a little harder to confirm the reservations because I didn't even think about the no show charge.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Quick vacation,"We flew in from OC California at midnight November 2,2017. We arrived at 1:30am. Great quick service. The room was wonderful.

There were some stains on the bed shirts, but it is a cheap hotel. The walls are pretty thin as well. Overall I would stay there again as a one night sort of thing where you don't need or want to pay for a nice hotel. It's about what you'd expect for the price. ",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Worst customer service my company has ever encountered,My company sent a few of us to Denver to complete a job and we were booked to stay here. So many problems with the workers at the front desk and no help from any kinds of management. As many properties as we've visited as being contracted out to different states to do work this is by far the worst we've at,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,My husband and I were on an extended vacation and stayed at...,"My husband and I were on an extended vacation and stayed at a number of hotels.  We therefore had many to compare.  This hotel was the least impressive.  Little attention was paid to cleanliness and upkeep of the facility.  There were leaves and other items spread across the lobby floor that had blown in.   Parts of the wall/molding was falling off.  No one bothered to pick up the pieces or broken grout laying on the carpet.  The breakfast bar was extremely bad!  The serving area was not clean and food was not fresh.  I attempted to cut a muffin (that was individually wrapped), but it was so stale I couldn't cut it.  Lastly we were placed on 1st floor by an exit door.  There were no hydraulics on the door so we continuously heard the door slam shut thru 2a.m.  This was our first stay at a Microtel and I don't think we will stay at one again.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Flight Layover,We had a 10 hour layover from Denver to Minneapolis. We decided it would be nice to get a few hours of sleep instead of trying to sleep at the airport. The shuttle from the airport to the hotel was key and the price was right.,3

Airport shuttle needs better signage...difficult to know which shuttle to take.Shuttle was over capacity and 3 people (including my husband) were standing inside the van without seats or seat belts...on the freeway. I thought this was quite dangerous. But the shuttle came in about 20 minutes. Internet signal was quite weak and we had difficulty making and keeping wifi  connections.

Walls are a little thin, and breakfast is limited, but adequate. Breakfast opens extremely early in case people have to catch an early flight. The woman at the front desk who checked us in was extremely efficient while also being welcoming. There's definitely no need to pay more for a night at the Denver Intl airport.",4

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Extremely Disappointed,"This Motel/Hotel/Inn (call it what you like) at 18600 E 63rd in Denver was NOT a pleasant place to stay. I will say up front that the help at the front desk was pleasant and helpful.  However, the walls have virtually NO insulation. As travelers and not party animals, we wanted to get some sleep and rest before our flight the next morning. Every time one of the ""guests"" returned to the motel during the hours from 10 pm until 3 am their every move was out there for everyone.  The running of their water while brushing or washing and the numerous flushes of the ole commode just awoke us over and over.  Our toilet would run about every  7 minuted because of poor maintenance and there wasn't a shut off valve on the water inlet line.  The only saving grace was that it was monetarily reasonable in a world that is not and provided an acceptable little breakfast type of affair in the early am starting around 4 in the morning.  I will NEVER stay here again and I would caution anyone else who is in need of rest about the choice they might be about to make.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Dirty and skanky,"We checked into the hotel for one night before our flight home the next morning.  After check-in, we dropped our bags in the room and then took our rental car back.  Upon our return an hour later, our keys to the room wouldn't work.  We went back down and got new keys.  After entering our room, we noticed someone else had been in our room because of an old to go coffee cup and a blow up head rest that were left on the dresser.  We went back down and the desk clerk said 'well that's probably why your room keys didn't work initially'.  No 'sorry', no explanation of how that happened, just an OK!  Completely unacceptable service regarding security of the rooms.  And to add insult to injury, the rooms were awful- dirty, run down, and gross.  I was afraid to walk on the carpet or use the shower.  It was a quick exit the next morning!",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good quality accommodation at a reasonable price,"We stayed at the Microtel Inn in Denver for one night prior to flying out of Denver airport. The location was great and the accommodation was very nice - we had a large double bed (super king I believe), a sofa, a microwave and a fridge in our room. The bathroom included a bath and shower. The continental breakfast included in the rate was an added bonus and allowed us to have a good breakfast before our flight. Overall, a very pleasant stay.",5

I called the hotel from the car rental drop off and they provided clear directions on where to take their shuttle at the airport. We waited less than 5 minutes. Check in was efficient and professional. The girl at the desk directed us to a cute diner located nearby ( ~ 3 minutes walk) which had great food. She signed us up for a shuttle ride to the airport on Sat am which was on time. Great efficient service, clean rooms, very pleasant helpful staff. It was also great value for money - $125.

The front desk phone rang endlessly while we waited. Our first room--despite having a nonsmoking sign--reeked of smoke and mold. Fortunately the employee was still at the desk and gave us a different room, though he did not apologize and did not even speak to us during this second interaction except to say our new room number. The second room smelled fine, though was smaller than an average hotel room and had a long hair in the bed (both my husband and I have short hair).",2

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Sensible budget choice,"My first impressions of this place were not good. Its rather difficult to find. If going S on Tower Rd, go through the main hotel district and then turn left at the Ramada sign and go to the end of the road.When I arrived, the door to the room I was given could be opened from the outside without using the key. It took me a while to notice this problem, but as not being able to lock the door of your room seems like quite a serious issue (to put it mildly), I asked to be moved to another room.I chose this place because it was a budget choice near to the airport (it is literally half the price of some other chain hotels near DIA), but it was actually a much better place than I expected. A nice touch was that the room had a full length window seat so one can recline and watch the sunset over the fields. As you might expect at an airport hotel there is a public computer with printer so that boarding passes etc. can be printed out. There was also free WiFi was perfect, never dropped out. The room was very clean and had a bathtub with a powerful shower.At most hotels, if you have an early flight you miss the free hotel breakfast. Not here! Breakfast is served from 4am. I was not up quite that early, but there was still a good supply of food - nothing cooked but a good variety of cereals, waffles, pastries etc.I was able to get a late checkout at no extra cost.There is a diner just across the car park that does decent food to eat in or to go.The hotel offers an airport shuttle service but I did not use it.All in all, for those needing something near the airport on a budget, this seems a sound choice.",4

We were traveling to Estes Park, CO for the week but needed to stay in Denver for a night. When I first arrived, there was two LARGE unknown liquid jugs sitting out in front of the door holding the doors open. That was a red flag. I got up to the counter and looked around and what a mess I saw. We got our cards and went to the room. We asked for a crib but one wasn't provided so I had to go back down and ask. Our room was TINY to say the least. Lots of marks on the walls. Needs an uplift for sure. Some of you may like a mirror going from side to side of the room but not me. The breakfast left a lot to be desired for. They kept running out of the basics. If one thing was good, the bed was actually comfortable. There's a reason why…",2

I think the price and quality were on par with each other. I do wish I had spent just a little more for a slightly nicer hotel with a little more features. Even though I didn't have any real issues, that is what I would suggest to a friend and it is what I will do next time because based on the great reviews, I expected something just a little nicer.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Old, needs repairs and updates","This hotel is very basic. It needs updating.

The Front Desk Staff then made photo copies of my identification and credit card. The next morning I then asked the staff what they do with my copies information? The answer was it's for our records.  Who really knows? Who has access to these sensitive documents. The Staff then refused to hand over my copies of my information.

We stayed one night at the Microtel Inn & Suites to catch a morning flight out of DIA.  We were very happy with the check-in/check-out staff and the room.  The hotel was quiet and fairly up-to-date.  We d/n partake of the complimentary breakfast as we had an early AM flight.  The convenience of allowing us to park our vehicle on the property (for an extra $7 p/day charge) was very convenient.  The bedroom & bathroom were very clean and the mattress & pillows were very comfortable to us.  The driver/shuttle to the airport was on-time & got us to DIA in plenty of time.

Here I asked and they not only had the rooms together but they were adjoining so I didn't have to go out into the hallway in the middle of the night to help my client or just stay in his room to be close enough if he needed something. I will definitely be booking here next time I need an overnight before catching an early flight!!",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Close to airport but there are closer hotels with better value,"Close but ""no cigar"".  The key issue with this hotel is that it poor construction (i.e., very thin walls) and poor maintenance is showing.  The staff is a mixed bag from really nice and helpful to uninterested and wishing not to be bothered.  For example, the evening staff person was nice and helpful with various problems associated with the room door handle installed upside down and toilet backed up.  While the morning staff person said I couldn't get my points because of a made up excuse that I know for a fact was incorrect (... I use to work for the company she said does not provide points if they use the a third party..plus, I had just received the points from a previous Microtel stay).  If you have a choice - pick another hotel.  But, if you are in a difficult situation this place will do nicely... just, lower your standards and expect a mixed results for your stay.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,A place to lay your bags for a while,"This was an okay experience. My bed smelled like something had died on it so I slept over top of the covers. The metal plate on the inside of the door was loose so I couldn't use the dead bolt. They kindly let me extend my checkout time but then a shuttle back to the airport didn't arrive for nearly two hours. Fortunately I wasn't pressed for time but I wouldn't call the shuttle reliable, particularly around midday.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Typical Low Cost Inn,"What do you expect for $100? Well... apparently not much. The exterior and interior of this hotel is really dumpy with ripped screens on the windows, damage to the walls inside and out, and questionable window seat covers. The bedding itself was fresh and a crisp white which was much more comforting to me after my initial scan of the room which seemed to have been cleaned in hurry judging by the stir stick on the floor in the bathroom and the hastily stuffed tissue in the box of kleenex. The walls behind the beds were an interesting smoky mirror... all the way across... with another mirror directly in front of bed, so if you like looking at yourself, this is the place for you. There was a fridge in the room and the tv worked. Apparently there was free wi-fi without the need for a password, but every ""microtel"" I tried to connect to did not actually work. The bed was super uncomfortable, but honestly my pre-flight anxiety could have been preventing me from sleeping too. Breakfast in the A.M was standard continental and started at 4 A.M, perfect for those early morning travelers like me. The courtesy shuttle to the airport was also key, beginning at 3 A.M and running every 40 minutes. Be prepared for a wild ride though, those shuttle drivers are confident in their driving abilities to say the least. The front desk clerk was pleasant, though when I called to confirm details of the shuttle before booking a room, I asked to proceed with a reservation and was told it would just be easier to do that online. Okay? Isn't that a big part of your job though? Oh well. This hotel got the job done, but in hindsight I would gladly pay an extra $20 to stay at a nicer place.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Clean - no frills,"Came just for the night. Room is dated and worn and the bed was a little springy but after less than 2 hrs of sleep the previous night from traveling I didn't care. Hallway noise and noise from the room next to me (them moving around, using the bathroom etc) was an issue until I fell asleep about an hour after getting to my room. Very smooth check in and friendly staff. The breakfast was waffles and pastries, neither of which I eat so didn't sample the breakfast. Coffee was decent. Shower pressure in the room was really good.  Given similar circumstances I'd stay here again next time I'm in the area. It's no frills so don't expect anything except the basics. But it was a good spot to crash for the night which is what I needed.",4

When I attempted to print my boarding pass for my return trip home, the printer did not respond. When I told the receptionist she quickly and pleasantly printed me a copy on her computer at the front desk and apologized for the printer in the lobby for not working. Later at night, I went down to the front desk and asked if there was a place where I could purchase a bic razor. The same young woman gave me not only a razor but shaving cream as well. A short time later I had a problem at the vending machine when the selection I wanted did not fall into the tray, but was hanging. The young woman quickly gave me a dollar and I tired it again and got two selections. I like the fact that the hotel was so close to Denver Airport and I quickly returned my car rental. The hotel has a shuttle to take guests to the airport as well. The internet in the room was wonderful and required no password. The bed was very comfortable, the hotel was either new or recently remoded, the hallway rugs were in excellent condition and there was absolutely no musty smell, the bathroom in my room was large and towels were plentiful.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Small, but comfy room","I left behind in our room a notebook with our entire two week Colorado vacation itinerary. I called the hotel THREE separate  times including within two hours of leaving. Each time I received the same answer.. "" No, we don't have it"". Upon checking back in for our final night in Colorado I asked a new clerk to check in the Lost and Found  for me... Yep, my book was there, wrapped in a bag from when housekeeping found it two weeks prior!",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Disappointed,"My husband and I stayed here for one night with family as we wanted to be close to the airport. For $100, we thought it would have been better. The room we initially got smelled like cigarettes and really strong chemical smell from cleaning products. Then we had some maintenance guys that had to come work in our room running cables when we were trying to get settled in. We had to get another room as the smell was making our heads hurt, and we were ticked off that our room was being held hostage. We requested a room change and after calling twice and being told they were checking into it with housekeeping, after over an hour, we went down to the front desk. Apparently there had been a shift change and our request was never communicated to the new person on duty. She at least helped us right away and the second room didn't have the smell, but it was dumpy. See pics. Stains, cigarette burn marks, torn wallpaper and screws sticking out of the wall, the deadbolt lock didn't work and the next morning there was a mix up with the shuttle as they didn't write down the correct number of people in our party. We should have paid more to stay somewhere else. We'll never go back!",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,A good stay,"I stayed hre for two nights in early August. The only problem I had was with the printer on th shared computer, I couldn't get it to print.. The young woman at the desk immediately came to my aid, made the my printing job was routed to the proper printer, and I printed with no problem. This was the only thing close to a problem I had on my two-night stay. It's a lttile remote and there's only one place to eat nearby, a retro diner. The food is good, the servers are friendly, but the service is a big slow...just be prepared for this.",5

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Dirty carpet, smelly room, scheduled shuttle bus never came","Even though this hotel is non-smoking, upon checking in our room smelled of cigarette smoke and we couldn't open the window to let in fresh air. The carpet had a large patch of something sticky next to the bed, like something was spilled there and never cleaned. The room with king bed is fairly small (only big enough to fit the bed, window seat, small closet, narrow desk, and about 2 feet of space between the sides of the bed and the wall). For just over $100 per night this was not a very good value. To top it off, the shuttle bus never showed up. The bus to the airport runs every hour and you have to reserve your spot on it the night before. We reserved spots on the 9:10 am bus and never saw a bus come. The front desk clerk did not know how to call the driver (or did not want to) and would not help make arrangements or pay for a taxi or shared ride. At 9:55 am, we requested and took an Uber with another couple to the airport. One star for the decent continental breakfast that included a waffle maker. Wifi worked in lobby and the room but sometimes switched between networks.",1

The lobby trash cans were dirty and smelled horrible at 6:00am. The sheets were stained. The ice machine had mold, rust and mildew from top to the floor. The air returns were filthy and at 6:00 am the back door was only hanging on by the door closure. The breakfast bar had coffe spills and stains from days before.S",1

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Just ok,"The location was clos to the airport and the shuttle was nice. Breakfast was average continental breakfast and the rooms were clean and unless the housekeeping was busy chatting up a storm and talking, it was quiet. Would have been better to find a hotel in Denver and just take the A line in retrospect. There is literally nothing to do there, but the diner close by was pretty good.

We were out front for the shuttle 15 minutes early. The shuttle arrived and people were getting on and the driver said there were 2 seats left. My daughter and I were the next 2 to get on. We already had our bags in the back and a lady ran out of the hotel with her son and got on in our seats. The driver was extremely rude to us and let the lady stay in our seats and we ended up having to drive to the airport and park there. That was part of the reason we chose this hotel was because of the shuttle but never again!,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not bad for the price,"I booked that day-of and most everything around was full so I paid more than I would've liked to, but it was fine and very convenient to the airport. Only strange thing was the wall to wall mirrors above the headboards.",3

It's very run down, I had a bite on my leg when I woke up. I looked for under the mattress for bed bugs but didn't see the typical signs.

As a rewards member, I'm greatly disappointed.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Unprofessional manager,"Upon arrival in our room, we found the carpet wet apparently due to an issue with the a/c.  We went back out to the desk and the young man that checked us in did find us another room, however, he was lacking in social skills.  He made us feel as if we were the ones causing the issue, he never said he was sorry for our inconvenience. We were given new key cards and told to hurry up to get our luggage out of the old room because he had to lock it down. He did not know how to do one process in the computer and had to ask the gentleman beside him how to do it.  Our room was very nice - In the morning, we went to breakfast around 8:30 to find that there was nothing available - they were very slow in replenishing the continental fare. This is an airport hotel where people are typically in a hurry to get to the airport and the service was very slow.  When checking out - I asked to speak to a manager.  He was not in, and would not be in until later that afternoon - I subsequently called after I had returned home.  The manager was the young man that had handled our check in - during our conversation he said that he did not feel that he treated us with any disrespect.  I asked if he had someone over him and he said he did not.  Courtesy seems to be a lost art at this location.  We were not asking for any discounts or and special treatment, only a kind word after a long day.  I do not recommend this location.  I have stayed in other Microtel's that were far better.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Business overnight,"I am a fan of Microtel Inns and have stayed in them all across the country. This particular inn has clean rooms and great beds. I was disappointed with the cleanliness in the halls, the elevator, and the lobby.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Photos are a bit deceiving,Beds were almost new and slept pretty well.

Mentioned to the front desk and they made some minor effort at cleaning it up.   Rooms were showing their age.   Bed linens and towels were fine.   The bed was comfortable.  TV channels did not match the pamphlet.   Overpriced and noisy,  rooms could have been cleaner.   Breakfast was marginal.   In hindsight,  I should have looked elsewhere.  Disappointed",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Near the Airport!,Great place to stay when you want to be next to the Denver Airport. We stayed here on our last night in Denver since we had a very early flight out the next morning.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not a happy customer-noisy-overpriced,"We chose Microtel  for it's easy location near to the airport, shuttle service and for the ability to secure a spot for our car on their lot.  The motel rate was a bit on the high side but we bit the bullet to take advantage of the conveniences.  Our first night was so noisy, late in to the night, despite several calls to the front desk. The walls are very thin to begin with so a ""quiet"" time is paramount. We booked this hotel for our return trip since we were getting in at midnight and had a 3 hour ride home. (We used their onsite parking)  We felt bamboozled by Microtell when they charged us $60 more than our first stay.  There are many motels near the Denver airport to choose from.  We wont be choosing this one again. I'm giving them a ""poor"" for service and sleep quality…",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good price,"If you are looking for a hotel off the beating path but close to airport select this one.

Went down for the morning breakfast offered by hotel...nope. Coffee was not ready @6:05am. There was only a select few of pastries available. Cereal was decent. They had a waffle maker the guests who were eating next to me enjoyed the waffles. Fruit looked old. Parking was good. Just needs some dedicated people at front desk and it could Be a prime competitor with the area hotels. ",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Terrible experience,"This hotel more resembles a dorm room than a hotel.  Extremely small.  There was a spot on the back of our door of which I'm not sure of the source, but it was gross.  The ""breakfast"" in the morning was terrible.  The bread was dry, there was very little choice.  We ended up buying breakfast at the airport.  If it had cost about $65, it might have been worth that, but $120.00 is absolutely ridiculous!!  The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything, including toilet flushes in the room next door!  Also, there isn't even a pool.  It was terrible and I will never stay there again!",1

I read all of the reviews that basically stated to 'go away', 'do not stay here' and 'the service is very bad' (to name a few) cannot be father from our experience.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  There breakfast was typical.  The work out equipment was working and the room was clean.  Also you cannot beat the price.  For those of you that stated to stay away I would suggest for you to try this place again.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,I'm sure you can find better,"Stayed here with a group and can't comment on the cost since I don't know what we paid. The room I had was very large with two beds, which made it strange there was only one chair and no fridge or microwave (I stayed in 7 hotels on my trip and this was the only one missing those two items). Other rooms did have them, according to others in my group so you should ask if they are important to you. They do have free ice. Channel lineup on TV did not match what was actually on the TV and of course the guide button didn't work. Bed was comfortable. My room was on the 3rd floor and an elevator was available. Breakfast was adequate and about what you would expect for this hotel. This would be an ok choice if the price charged were low.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not Great,"I chose this hotel because it was close to the airport and less expensive than the others nearby, although not cheap. Late arrival was handled quickly, but had to park on the street since the parking lot was full. Room was small and dated but had a huge wall-mounted TV. The bathroom was in bad shape. No drain plug in the sink, toilet had trouble flushing, wall paper was peeling and the water that did come out of the shower head went everywhere. Breakfast consisted of all breads and cereals. There were no protein choices available. I will not return and do not recommend this place.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Can't beat the price and convenience,"I stayed here for the second time and again, I have no complaints. It is a very simple hotel with all of the basics that I needed for a quick overnight stay before heading to the airport early the next day.

I stayed in touch with the front desk to let them know my luggage was coming in on a later plane and I phoned as soon as the luggage came in which was 1:30 am.  I did not get picked up until 2:15am.  It sounded like communication with the shuttle driver and hotel was not very good.  Breakfast as okay if you like weak coffee and lots of white flour carbohydrates.  A typical hotel breakfast but with a popular waffle cooker of some sort.  No fruit, no whole grain breads or muffins.   I had to request having both juice servers filled since they were completely empty.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,No sleeping at this hotel!,The hotel itself was nice and clean. The patrons in the room nextdoor to us were loud and talked and laughed until 3:00am. My alarm went off at 3:15 so I got no sleep whatsoever! ,3

There is a waffle maker, some muffins and bagels along with a few drinks to include coffee and juice if I remember right. The rooms need work too but the sheets and bedding were clean. Overall the hotel is just outdated and needs some work but this hotel will work on a short term basis- to catch a flight the next morning.

Toilet ran constantly but I fixed it myself. Very thin walls (or very noisy neighbors). Had to call front desk about them. Heard a loud crash and my wall was moving from their bed. Breakfast room looked like a bomb was dropped on it. Dirtiest trash can I ever saw. Messy. The price of the hotel should be no more than $60 but they're by the airport and can name the price.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,colorado,Did not like that there was an additional charge for late check out. Property is primarily there for airport traffic and our flight was not until the evening. We were given until 1:00pm to check out with no additional charge but were told anything over that would be $20.00 per hour. Just think being an airport sensitive property late check outs could be better accommodated. Otherwise it's a nice property and the front desk clerk was very pleasant and took great care of us.,5

Room was clean.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,A night at the Microtel Inn & Suites,"We booked two rooms for a night-stay to catch an early flight to Las Vegas as a part of our mini Vacation in 2017.  The Front Desk staff (a young gentleman) was very nice and professional.  We arrived a little bit early and were told that our rooms were not ready until after 3:00 PM.  We went to grab a bite and returned shortly.  Our rooms were decent and clean.  We have read many reviews prior to our bookings.  We figured saving a few bucks for our Vegas trip would not be so bad, and after all it would be a one-night stay.  For a night, our stay at this Microtel Inn and Suites met our expectations.  Breakfast items were ready at 4:00 AM, so we were able to grab small bites and juices before our departure.  Thanks.",4

Some one had changed the clock in my room......maids should check.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Several improvements could be made,"The staff and appearance of the hotel were excellent.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not impressed,"The breakfast was not very well maintained. The front staff were not very friendly or accommodating, breakfast they let the food run out, dead mouse left on the front of the hotel for days and not picked up, non-smoking hotel yet smell of marijuana was overpowering and the hotel staff did nothing when alerted to the fact. They came to our room and were very rude in saying it sounded like loud music coming from the room (we met them at the door as we were returning and there was NO music but the television was on at a reasonable tone). I would never even consider using this hotel again EVER.",1

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Hotel near Denver airport,I needed a hotel late Saturday night and since I'm a Wyndham member I looked on they app and found this hotel near the Denver airport. First night I was right next to elevator and it was quite noisy all night. Toilet ran all the time had to close door and put a towel under the door so I could sleep the next night I got room across from elevator and it was much better. The breKfast was very minimum and the coffee maker was broken all weekend. So you couldn't have hot cereals.  The price for the same room was more the second night.,3

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Cheap is as Cheap does!,If you only want a quick overnighter before flying in or out of DEN airport... you may consider this because it is cheap.  but not a great stay for sure! Breakfast one morning was non existent and no real effort to resupply even with a listed hour and a half to go.  Second morning non working coffee and hot water in breakfast area. ( Another guest said this was their 2nd day on no coffee in breakfast area.)  There was a sign posted.  Morning desk clerk both morning pretty absent. We chose this hotel because we only needed a place to sleep for airport connections.  I'd never book there again!,2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not worth your time or money,"I was very disappointed in my 2-night stay.  Carpets are badly in need of shampooing, bathroom sinks are cracked, all lights in room were all on one switch, no phone in room, and when inquired at front desk was told it was broken with no offer to replace, no iron or ironing board, had to ask front desk for it.  Also, the breakfast was very disappointing.  The coffee urn had very weak and lukewarm coffee, the refrigerator for butter, yogurt, and cream cheese was empty except for one yogurt, I had to request plasticware as the bins weren't filled.  Oh, yes, and the mattresses slanted to the edge so you were constantly in fear of falling out of bed.  And the wifi kept shutting on and off.  Overall, will not stay there again.",2

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Convenient to Denver Internatinal Airport,Located in Hotel Row about 10 miles from DIA. Near restaurants and a gas station.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Great Stay,"We slept here for 4 hours. We were expecting ""a bed"" for the price we paid. It was way better than expected. On a few side notes to help other travelers. If you have a party larger than 4, do not plan on ANY hotel shuttle connecting you with DIA. They are really made for the ""couple"". You will not fit. And you will then miss your flight while you realize your mistake. The shuttles can carry something like 10 people, which is a problem when you are the last hotel that the shuttle stops at. You heard that right....the shuttle services more than one hotel.2nd, park at USAirways Parking. They are minutes down the road and are hands down, the best place in DIA to Park. Their customer service and timing is literally 4 times better than the Pikes Peak lot. You will beat the hotel shuttle by 30 minutes going there and by over 90 minutes coming back. The hotel shuttle pick up on the return is a lot of fun after waiting 45 minutes in the freezing cold wondering how much a cab is while your family scowls at you for ""doing the cheap thing"". Skip that show.3rd, If you are flying Frontier and you are reading this, you are in a world of trouble. Frontier employs 2 (like TWO) employees to bag check hundreds (like HUNDREDS) of people at 5:30 am. We arrived 3 hours early and barely made our flight. This happened last July and again, last week (May 2017)  If you are going to book with Frontier, DON""T. If you  have, don't bag check. If you have to bag check, get there 3 1/2 hours early or you will likely miss your flight.",5

Front desk wonderful, never heard any traffic, rare plane, very convenient to airport and traveling around town. Clean, comfortable room. Only complaint was breakfast, hence 4 stars.  Weekdays were ok - but not consistently replenished.   Weekend mornings were awful-at 6:30, 7:45 and 9:00 ran out of everything, area messy and young man taking care of it acted like it was an imposition to ask him to replenish things.",4

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Ok for a quick night stay,"The good: Night Manager Britney was quick to resolve problems and quickly gave a free upgrade to a room with working showers when the shower didn't work. Clean. Free airport shuttle.The bad: changed rooms twice. Couldn't enter for one room, shower wasn't working in the second. The airport shuttle isn't labelled with Microtel logo, so you may miss it if you don't know what you are looking for. The buffet didn't have much food for a while.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Pretty good place for the price and convenience,Nice place. Used it while travelling to Europe. Shuttle service to and from the airport was a nice plus.The only true fault was no bedside lamps. Only fluorescent overheads. Great diner within a few minutes walk. Would recommend to others.,4

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,A little costly for the room!,"Not a bad motel a bit pricy for the room , day clerk  he was very lazy. he sat in the back of front desk room on his phone. A lot of us had to keep asking him for supplies, coffee empty, no napkins. It seemed like we were bothering him by asking for supplies, it was 7;00 am  stocking supplies should have been taking care of when he first got there. He was just to busy on his phone instead of working.   ",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Tolerable,"It's not a 5 star resort and the price was low.  However, the check in process was long and the front desk clerk was not very friendly and wasn't very knowledgeable.  A bit unorganized when it came to scheduling our airport shuttle for the morning.   The room was sub-par, beds uncomfortable but if it's only for one night, it's a decent place to crash and shower.  I would not stay here any longer than that.  Breakfast in the morning was free but they ran out of coffee cups and told us to use foam cereal bowls instead.  There were ants all over the counter and frankly the entire ""buffet"" area was an utter disaster. ",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Average Room,"Decided on this place due to location proximity to Interstate 70 as we were heading across the country back to FL.  The hotel sat behind another hotel and the parking lot crowded and narrow.  The grounds as another person noted were unsightly.  A huge gaping pothole as you turned into the lane would give any traveler a flat tire.  I brought this to the attention of one of the hotel staff- wasn't really sure if they took me serious.  The young woman checking us in was polite, but we found the access key/lock to our room inconsistent.  The room was micro but I guess that's the point of these no frill hotels.   Beds were decent.  Ventilation was poor in the room.  Breakfast was totally uninviting by my standards, area was not clean and no-one was wiping tables and restocking as far…",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Really disappointed.,"The bed was comfortable, however the stay was ruined by not getting our wake up call that we requested, at 3AM. We had to catch the 4:10am shuttle, but because of the failed wake up call we didn't wake up on our own until 3:25am. Luckily, the shuttle driver waited for us. The floor was filthy. My socks were black just walking in the room for 15 minutes. The room was so small. There was a king size bed, 2 night stands, a desk and a chair. You had to move the chair out from the desk and push it against the wall to walk in between the desk and bed. I stayed in room #102. Breakfast started at 4am, however there was no food out, and the carafe of coffee was only luke warm, probably from the previous night. I would not go back there, nor recommend this hotel.",2

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Dirty, dark and dreary and definitely in need of renovation!","Condition of hotel was eery, exercise room was a closet-sized room, jammed withequipment and without ventilation.  Was good a window could be opened, however,screen was hanging loose in one corner. Breakfast area was off lobby, and at 8:30 amwas dirty, chairs and tables in all directions and not much for healthy choices.  Onlygood thing about hotel, was front desk employee, Brittany, who went out of her wayto be helpful along with her expertise and compentency.  Requested room with fridge and microwave, as I travel with healthy food, some of which goes on airplane tripwith me. All was frozen solid by morning - totally unacceptable and disgusting.Outdoor landscaping has been neglected, needs tree trimming, grass mowing andweed removal.  Am not certain why Hotel commands rates it does, as within walking distance is a Ramada Inn and Hampton Inn.  Ramada was same price, was muchmore inviting and in better shape.  Didn't get to price out Hampton Inn which was thebest of the three.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Don't stay here. ,"This place was so gross. We are on a month-long roadtrip and have stayed at many hotels. Some nice, some not so nice. This was by far the worst.  The hotel is infested with ants. The first time they came after our cat food the hotel staff changed our room. The second time was our last night so we just packed all of our things in our truck and put the cat's food away. I put his food out again the next morning so he could eat before we left and within an hour there were ants on his food again. There is no fridge, microwave, or space for your clothes. There is no onsite laundry. The wifi is terrible. You have to select a wifi connection then wait about 5 minutes for the landing page to load. There is not enough parking for the hotel. People were parking along a nearby road. I'm usually not the type to complain but I'd hate for anyone else to get stuck in this place just to save a few bucks. It's not worth it.",1

Took over an hour to get the shuttle when we arrived in DIA.  This hotel shares a shuttle service with 5 other hotels in the area, so service is SLOW.  When we checked in, tried to reserve shuttle in the morning to get back to airport in time.  Was told shuttle was full.  POOR and misleading.  If you book this hotel for the shuttle, make sure you call way ahead of time to make sure you get a spot on shuttle.  Other than that a very basic place to overnight it.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Adequate but not amazing.,"I stayed here because I had a 12 hour layover in Denver and decided to get a room instead of camping out at the airport.  The room was fine, clean and comfortable.  I was not overly impressed with the breakfast (broken waffle batter dispenser, bread items in plastic wrap bordering on stale) and ended up eating overpriced food at the airport.  My biggest complaint is that it does not state that the shuttle stops at multiple (5 or so) hotels so both directions we had many stops and people standing in the van because there were too many.  The shuttle driver was great though, even though he had lost his voice and could barely speak!",3

Nothing warm or welcoming about the property or the staff. It was fine and workable for a night. Once I got in the elevator in this non-smoking hotel...I was greeted there and in the hall ways with the strong smell of marijuana. I just wanted to get to my room and get some rest.

Never, NEVER stay there! Avoid that place at all costs. What happened to me is just beyond belief. I am still in state of shock. My belongings disappeared from my room while I was away and the staff seemed not to care at all, no one tried to find out what happened, and no one bothered to get upstairs and inspect my room for the missing items. Moreover, they went as far as to threaten to get me, the victim, removed from the property for ""causing a disturbance""!!! How nice is that?! I never, NEVER learned what actually happened to my stuff, if it was stolen or disposed of by mistake! And it took me hours - literally, HOURS of verbal confrontation with them and their threats and silent treatments of me, to at least get a refund for my stay. I can clearly see discrimination in that - they chose to treat me like that because I am from a foreign country and English is not my first language, so I am more vulnerable because I don't know what to say and what to do in such situations, and I am easier to intimidate and less likely to complain, so they felt they could treat me like dirt and get away with that! I can't see any other explanation. I can't adequately describe how terrible I feel about that - because they did actually get away with what they had done to me. All that I can do is just write a negative review and tell everyone to never, NEVER stay there. I am also going to file a complaint letter with their management but, judging by how their employees treat people, I doubt if they care at all what their customers think. Terrible experience. No one should be treated like that.",1

Did like that continental breakfast started at 4 a.m. Saving a few bucks was definitely not worth it.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,not enough bang for my money,"This place was overpriced. we had a very difficult time  finding a parking spot. we finally had to squeeze into a tiny spot hoping we could open our car door. ""continental breakfast was yuck""",2

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Other reviews 100% accurate! Stay and park!,I stayed here to leave vehicle for a week while I visited home. It cost me $25 for 6 days. I stayed the night before I left and upon my return caught the shuttle from airport and picked it up. Did not stay the night on my return trip. It was not a problem at all. Room was clean. Staff was on cell phones the whole time I was checking out. Very shocked they got me in with no delay. This led me to think hey did this often.  All in all I will def return. It's very convenient and easy. ,4

Older bedding but surprisingly got a decent nights rest.  Had a very early flight and stayed here due to early morning shuttle service.  Shuttle on time and reliable.  Breakfast starts at 4am also.   Hotel served its purpose for the night.  Would stay again due to the price and airport shuttle. ,4

The parking fee is quite reasonable, the location is convenient to the airport, shuttle service is good and the rooms are nice.   Brittany is a wonderful desk clerk for the evening shift during the busy times.  She maintains a welcoming, calm demeanor in person and on the phone as she manages several needs at once.  When she is not busy, she engages in friendly conversations with guests.   Another nice feature of this property is that the breakfast begins at 4:30 a.m. so those folks with early morning flights can have something to eat before they leave.   We will continue to stay here when we fly out of DIA.   I always appreciate the ""window seat"" in Microtel rooms as a convenient place for…",5

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Terrible Experience,"This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at any hotel or resort. We called it the day of because we had a late flight that was bringing us in and we wanted to confirm our room and reservation. The woman who answered was very helpful and let us know that everything was ready to go for that night when we would arrive and told us where to catch the shuttle.  When we got off of the shuttle very late that evening it took about five minutes for somebody to address us standing at the front. After that the receptionist took roughly 10 minutes to get us checked in and give us our keys we went upstairs in the elevator and went to the room assigned and the keys did not work. This was very no big dea so we went back downstairs to try and get the keys to work properly.  When we told the receptionist that I keys did not work she assigned us to a different room and shoot us off back up the elevator. We got up to the new room and discovered that it was 2 queen size beds  when we had specifically requested and reserved a single king size bed. This is the end to a very special vacation so we wanted to ensure that we got the room request it. When we went back down to explain this to her she told us that we could either take what they had or cancel our reservation. I explained to her that this was a special vacation and she intern told us ""you should be grateful I'm doing you a favor because the double queen is actually more expensive then the King."" It was after midnight so we took the room and went to the room feeling dejected. The comforter on both beds had stains on the underside of them, the towels were discolored, and the shower faucet needed to be re-caulked. The receptionist was extremely rude and unhelpful during the entire 6 hours we actually stayed there.  On our 5 AM bus back to the airport we actually overheard another couple who had been staying in the initial room we had been given the keys to. They were telling other companions that when they got to the hotel they had requested to change their room from a queen size to a king size. So this means that because we arrive so late, even though we had called to confirm, our room had been given away. Very disappointed, we will not be returning.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Met my needs,"Had a late flight arrival, so just needed a place to sleep for one night before heading into the mountains.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,great pillows-breakfast not so much,"While the pillows were surprisingly upscale for a low cost alternative motel, the breakfast was equally poor.  The variety of breakfast options was outstanding, but little infrastructure planning had been considered.  The toaster and microwave oven could not be used at the same time because an electrical breaker tripped each time, so the toast you thought you had  cooking might not be when you checked on it..  The HVAC system within the breakfast area was not functioning; perhaps it was wired to the same circuit as the toaster/microwave.  Similarly, there was not sufficient waffle iron spray available causing everyone's waffles to have to be scraped off the iron.

Amenities were average, all the basic requirements one would expect during a typical stay. Nothing really exceeded my expectations. However, there was one major problem, the adjacent rooms quests continually slammed the door throughout the entire night, causing my family, with younger children, an extremely restless night. Another quest hollered at the noise makers and the slamming eventually ceased, but not before the damage was done. My husband mentioned it when we checked out at 230am, there was nothing offered for compensation. ",3

The chemical smell of the cleaning products was overwhelming in the lobby and the rooms.  It makes one wonder what smells they are covering up that it needs to be that intense.  The breakfast was nasty.  No one was attending the area - the receptionist just sat reading on her cellphone with trash, crumbs, food all over the place.  The waffle maker was covered in old crusty waffle and was unusable.  I was happy the food was wrapped in plastic so there was some comfort that I could at least have a piece of bread for breakfast.  No coffee when I checked out - pots were empty.  Like I said, I dont expect much from a budget hotel, but in hindsight, I should have paid the extra $30…",2

Breakfast was slim and thin, not stocked, had to ask for silverware. There was a plunger in the elevator that made it's way to the lobby over the course of an evening.

I give it 5 stars certainly not because it's a 5 star hotel but because for $80 a night and super last minute booking this is exactly what I needed and expected. A room, with a bed, pillow, tv, toilet. period! I was traveling alone and didn't need any of the extras that hotels charge an arm and leg for. When I travel with my kids we're staying at a much nicer place but when it's just me I can deal with it. People shouldn't pay $100 for a hotel just 10 minutes from an airport and expect the Hyatt. It's cheap for a reason. If you're a realistic and easy traveler this is the place for you.",5

The front desk girl (with a cold) said this was usually the case and that staff would be cleaning up at the close of breakfast.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good port if caught in storm,"We stayed here after our flight was cancelled due to high winds.  Excellent price for airport proximity and they have a shuttle to the airport.  Rooms were clean and modern, staff friendly.  Walls are thin, so ask for earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Also, you have to register for the shuttle to the airport, so make sure you do that with check in.  When we boarded, someone hadn't registered and there was a bit of a ruckus.",4

After the shuttle arrived, I waited another 15 minutes at the front desk for check in. I went up to the room and saw cigarette burns in the furniture. Instead of a confronter on the beds they had cheap old blankets.The hotel is non smoking. The toilet would not flush. I asked a house keeper who was cleaning the room across the hotel for assistance. She said she would send someone. An hour later no one came. I went back down to the desk and waited another 10 minutes for help. I was told they didn't have maintenance staff on and they'd have to move me to a different room. I switched rooms and the next room smelt like an ash tray and the AC would not stay on for longer than a minute. The pictures of the hotel are very deceiving. The hotel is very old and outdated.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Cheap and close to the airport, but severely lacking.","Our stay at the Microtel Denver was for only 12 hours as we awaited our flight in the morning. We arrived at around 2:20pm and after waiting for about 20 minutes we were allowed to check in 20 minutes early. We stayed in a room on the bottom floor, and while we didn't have issues with noise as some other reviewers did, we did experience some of the other complaints. The customer service representatives during the day did not seem like she really wanted to be there, and didn't make us feel entirely welcome. This was completely opposite to the service of the woman who was working the counter at night (around 11 on 3/3/17). She made us copies of the local restaurants, was very friendly, etc. After checking in, the bathroom had a lot of rust, the room had a looming odor and overall didn't feel entirely clean.  Our desk chair was broken, and nobody in our party was able to access the wifi via their laptops (however phones seemed to work fine). This would have been okay except the computer out in the lobby was out of order. Checking out, our airport shuttle was rude to the people getting on, reluctantly helping us with our bags stating, ""It's your luggage, not mine.""  We did not utilize the breakfast service or the gym. Our pros for this hotel: Cheap, Near the Airport, Large Comfy Bed, Free Airport Shuttle. Cons: Cleanliness, Wifi, Availability of Amenities, Customer Service, and Cleanliness (Yes, it's worth stating it twice.)We will not stay here in the future.

The breakfast was all carbs, not much variety. There was a waffle maker though which was pretty cool. The room had no microwave or fridge which I found weird as I've always stayed in rooms that had both.

The whole hotel smells pretty weird. One woman at the front desk (Deb, I think)  assigned my key to a room that was already occupied. I had to walk downstairs to the lobby twice because of her messing up an all she could say was ""oops"". It was at least almost 30 minutes before I could actually get into my room and put my stuff away. The toilet in the bathroom would not work. You would think there are blankets on the bed, but it's just two REALLY thin sheets. The staff seemed very ill informed about the hotel in general. A lady that worked there could not even tell me where the stairs were. Overall, if you plan to spend a significant amount of time within the walls of a hotel when visiting Denver, this isn't the one for you. The only good thing is the heater kept me pretty warm throughout the night.",2

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,A bit rundown,"This Microtel seems to have seen better days. From the dying plant in the lobby to the room in need of a fresh coat of paint, it really needs some TLC. My flight was delayed, and this was the hotel closest to DIA that had the most affordable price. I had to wait to check in, as the front desk clerk was assisting someone elsewhere. The room was clean, but really needed a fresh coat of paint. A couple of lights in the room did not work. There appeared to be a piece of artwork missing--there was hardware on the wall where something was supposed to be, anyway. Breakfast was ok, though the hot water for tea was no longer hit by the time I got there. The Wyndham crew can probably afford to put the work into this place that it needs to get back on track.",3

Instead of having an answering service so that customer service isn't sacrificed, most customers grew frustrated as the lady went back and forth from check-in registration and answering calls (most were about where to catch the airport hotel shuttle).  After 25 minutes of waiting in line, my family decided to leave and grab dinner.  An hour late, the check-in line was same size as more guests arrived, and one lady up front.

We were fortunate that a new set of friends were going to the airport with their car and offered us a ride or we would have missed our flight.  The room heater could not be calibrated.

The rooms are simple but clean and comfortable and the staff is always courteous and helpful.  They have a park and fly option that allows you to leave your car at the hotel and use their free shuttle to the airport.  The shuttle begins at 4:15 a.m. and the hotel even has a breakfast (muffins, cereal, juice) set up by 4 a.m.!  This is so much easier than dealing with airport parking, fees, and shuttles.

The front desk clerk was reaching out to management to get approval but nothing was resolved.   After 1.5 hours of negotiations at the hotel and front desk and Hotwire (where I booked the room) Hotwire approved to get 1 more room at the hotel with 1 bed - we had to pay for it and will be requesting reimbursement from Hotwire.

Going down to the front desk, the line had grown to at least 7 families and I couldn't even purchase the 4 bottles of water we needed.  Took them, but paid in the morning with the new receptionist.

The breakfast has many choices and served at a very early hour which most motel/hotels don't do.  They start at 4:30 AM for early flights and most start at 6:00 AM.  If we are ever flying out of Denver again I will stay at the Microtel Inn & Suites again.",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,DIA Microtel Inn,"As a previous poster said, “This is an airport hotel”.  That’s what it is and it’s the least expensive that I could find in the group of hotels on Tower Road that are the closest to the airport.  The rooms are small but clean.  The beds are not the most comfortable I’ve slept on but they weren’t terrible.  If you want an inexpensive hotel to “sleep and fly” this will work.  If your staying for a prolonged period of time and plan on spending a lot of time in the room the this hotel may not be for you.  When I look at reviews and read people bashing how disappointed they were in some of these less expensive hotels I just have to chuckle.  For Pete’s sake….. If you pay $70 for a hotel and you expect a $150 or $200 hotel you’re a fool………",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not Good.,"I've stayed at many Microtels and all so far all have been good, so I was very surprised at the experience at this one - not good.  The first room I got didn't have a microwave and fridge like I thought it was supposed to, so I switched to a room that did.  This room had a missing smoke detector (it was broken, so it was taken off the ceiling), a tissue plugging a hole in a wall plate (or cable outet?), stains on the ceiling, a very dirty floor, light fixture hanging down, and a missing bar lock on the door.  Mostly because of the missing door lock and smoke detector, I asked to switch rooms again.  I walked to the third room with all of my luggage only to discover that I couldn't open the door.  I walked back to the front desk and found out that the handle is broken, so you…",1

When I checked in, the clerk advertised a 4 am breakfast, perfect to grab something before catching a 6 am flight.  I checked out at 4, and found nothing prepared, without even any lights on in the breakfast area.  When I asked about it the clerk said simply ""My bad"", and gave me a receipt for the room.

The room was adequate but nothing special and the breakfast provided was the worst I encountered, just cereal waffles and oranges. The dining room was messy and no attendant was present.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"An ""economy"" hotel that needs attention. Luxury isn't expected, but upkeep is important.","This was our second stay at a Microtel Hotel and will probably be our last. We needed a hotel near the Denver airport and didn't want to spend a lot since we were flying out the next morning. We decided to give Microtel a second chance since we are Wyndham Rewards members. First, the good things: The young lady who checked us in was very nice and accommodating. The bed was comfortable and the TV worked fine.  Now the bad things: When we got to our room we heard the toilet running and my husband discovered that the toilet handle was broken. We called downstairs and told the young lady that we wanted a different room, which she kindly provided. While my husband went down to get the new room key I looked around the room and saw that there was no stopper in the sink and there were a lot of cigarette stains on the counter top. The whole hotel is non-smoking but people obviously do smoke. Also, the draperies were partially off their hook. Not a big deal, but just an indication of a lack of attention.  In our second room we got settled and then I went to use the bathroom. There was a rusty-looking stain coming from the bottom of the toilet tank and all over the floor behind the toilet. The toilet worked fine but the stain was unpleasant to look at. The security chain on the door was broken off so...non-existent. These issues are the sort of thing that the cleaning staff should report to maintenance immediately and maintenance should take care of before the room is rented again. Otherwise, it brings down the reputation of the hotel for repeat guests. Overall, the decor of the rooms is basic, which is fine, and the bed was comfortable. For that reason (a brief overnight stay) it was adequate. The next morning we went down to breakfast. It was basic with some muffins, yogurt, oatmeal and waffle machine. The dining area had no staff to oversee it and the couple of empty tables were dirty. I emptied the thermal coffee pot so I looked around for someone to refill the carafe. I went to the counter and saw two women sitting in a room behind the check-in area talking. I called out to get their attention and a woman came out and took away the empty carafe. When she brought out the new one she did not glance at the tables or make any effort to clear or wipe anything down or check to see if anything else was needed. She just disappeared again. A few minutes later another man needed help at the counter and he gave up and walked away. Then when my husband wanted to check out there was nobody there and he finally called out to get someone to come. He said he saw three women in the back room and two of them were sitting at a table talking.  So my lack of enthusiasm for the Microtel hotels is unchanged. I feel that Wyndham has expanded so aggressively that it cannot keep up with the challenges of maintaining the physical facilities or training the staff.  Another maintenance/housekeeping issue was that outside the lobby there was a trash can. It is obviously never wiped down because it was very dirty and covered with bird droppings. Maintenance should notice such things and hose it down. Also be aware that the hotel doors do not automatically open so that if you're hauling heavy luggage and don't have free hands, it's very awkward to enter or exit the lobby because you have to open two sets of heavy doors.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good hotel for the price...,"We enjoyed our stay... clean, comfortable and good people at the front desk... only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because some of the wall paper was pulling away from the wall in the bathroom.  And it would have been nice to have a lamp that we could have used to read without having to have all the lights on. ",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Rooms are decent but bring breakfast,"We had two nights, one for the inbound one for outbound.  Breakfast was horrible both times.  No one servicing the area, it is crowded, if you don't eat flour then forget it.  There is no excuse for running out of water, juice, butter, milk, by 8:00 both times.  The rooms are clean and fine, so I brought breakfast the second night.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Lack of communication,"I stayed at this hotel mostly so I could park and fly. When I called and asked about the shuttle and parking, they told me both were available.  What they didn't say was that both needed to booked in advance. I take to take a 3:20 a.m. shuttle for a 7 a.m. flight. The 4:20 was full and 5:20 was too late. There was room on the lot to keep my car there, but there may have not been. When I told the attendant this, she apologized and told me that it is usually explained during booking. I think that since I asked, she should've told me that advance booking was required - especially for the shuttle. Breakfast was minimal - nothing hot except oatmeal and waffles.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Who is in charge here?,"We arrived early due to flight. NO ONE was at front desk for over 20 minutes. Finally a maid came in and told us we could not check in till 3 and they would call us. That never happened. They did put our bags in a non-secure room while we went into Denver.   The A?C  was not strong when we came in. At 9 pm it stopped. We called desk. They never answered first call. The next time they told me to unplug unit. I did & it started. But sounded like a truck with only 2 cylinders .A bus could have been in the room with us.  The desk could not give us another room due to hotel being sold out.  I asked for a wake up call - in case the noise drown out my alarm. I did not get one.   The next morning i wait for front desk and it was a maid again-- who "" just took the keys"" and could not…",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Serviceable,"The Wyndham was a good choice to catch an early flight but check-in was protracted, shuttle information not accurate, and the hotel was noisy late into the night.  The elevator was especially dirty leaving a bad impression on check-in.  The room was better.  The bed was comfortable.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not over expecting...,"It was convenient to the airport but room was very sparse comparative to other places we stayed in Colorado, Utah an Wyoming so it had an unfair disadvantage. That said - it was a nice touch to be a ""valued customer"" and receive a little tote bag with water and some snacks - a nice tough other more embellished hotels did not offer. There was no pool or amenities which, with the rate not being that low, was surprising - but, again, I saw it as a commuter hotel. Lastly, the noise stomping above us until 2am was not addressed after a few calls to the front desk. They may have feared contacting that room with the very transient nature of the clientele.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good value choice for an airport hotel,"We stayed at Microtel at the end of a trip to be close to the airport for an early flight. The lobby and hallways have a slightly dark and dated feel, but our room was very pleasant and comfortable; a window seat and closet made it particularly attractive. The front desk staff when we checked in were very friendly and helpful.The hotel offers a 24-hour airport shuttle, but it only leaves hourly in the a.m., so be prepared for the possibility of having to leave even earlier than necessary. Because of our early flight, we were pleased to learn that breakfast starts at 4 a.m., so that it seemed we would be able to grab a bite and still catch the 4:10 shuttle. Unfortunately, it turned out that breakfast did NOT actually start at 4 a.m. but rather the staff STARTS setting up at 4, so despite the assurance of the desk clerk from the evening before, all that was available before the shuttle left was coffee and watery day-old orange juice.We paid just over $100 through a third-party site, which is pretty reasonable for the area; Denver has a ""compound"" of airport hotels covering a few square blocks, and all are a bit overpriced. Microtel was the most affordable of the bunch the day we were there. Interestingly, we had stayed at a different Wyndham property just blocks away only a short time earlier, for which we paid $40 more, and it had EXACTLY the same room set-up and amenities. This certainly makes Microtel a better value.Any of these airport hotels would be a very similar experience, so I suggest letting price be the decider, but Microtel is certainly a good basic airport accommodation if you can get a good rate.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Accomodations good - contacting them needs improvement,"Price was very reasonable and the room very comfortable.  Morning free breakfast was OK but for the number of guests, one toaster was insufficient.  Only have 2 complaints.  There is a free shuttle between the Denver airport and Microtel but learning how to find it at the airport was a big challenge.  Tried calling the hotel on 3 occasions at different times of the day but the phone just rang and rang.  Tried email but got no reply.   It was at 12:30  AM when we arrived at the airport and doing major searching and asking other shuttle drivers about the shuttle that we wanted (with no helpful answer given) that someone finally answered the phone at the hotel to tell us to go to the ""Hotel"" section in the airport pickup islands (actually ended up being the 3rd island) outside baggage claim and  look for a van that has ""Western"" on its side.  It does shuttling for several hotels, Microtel being one of them.  After that and waiting until about 1:40 AM, we finally got a shuttle.  The shuttle itself was fine and the driver very courteous.  Upon arriving at the hotel desk, we saw a note on the desk explaining how to get the shuttle at the airport.  How disappointing!",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good Place to stay near Denver Airport,"We needed a place to stay near the Denver airport for one night. This place really worked out great. It was very clean and the employees were friendly and helpful. The rooms are small, but were all that we needed for an overnight stay. And they start serving breakfast around 4:30 to accommodate those taking early flights! They also have a shuttle to the airport which we didn't need as we had to return our rental car. But the shuttle is a real convenience when needed.If you need a place to stay near the airport, this is the place.",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Comfortable room by Denver airport, free wifi, shuttle and breakfast","After driving across Missouri, Kansas and eastern Colorado all I wanted was a beer.  So I picked up some Corona at a Walmart after exiting the highway.  Ten minutes later I was in my hotel room with a 12-pack of beer and no bottle opener.  Can you believe it!!!  The hotel did not provide a bottle opener!!!  I had to use the strike plate for the bathroom door to wedge off the bottle cap every time I wanted to drink another beer.  One star.  Also, there was no bacon at the breakfast bar the next day.  Just waffles, bagels, cereal, etc.On the positive side, the room was clean, it had two comfortable beds, and free wi-fi.  But for a $101/night I expect a bottle opener and bacon.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Just average,"We stayed here on the beginning and end of our travels in CO. It was a very convenient location, and the price was right. As far as the continental breakfast goes.... it has also ""average"" standards: fruit, cereal, toast, waffles, etc. The coffee was terrible, so we had to go elsewhere and their toaster was broken partly, so there was quite a line if you wanted to have your bagel toasted before you left for the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Parts were excellent parts were not,The staff and customer service was excellent. The parking feature for shuttle service also excellent. My room was clean but the air conditioner was not working properly.  Had the thermostat set on 58 and the room was still very warm almost hot all night.  The air conditioner would come on for about 5 minutes and then kick off.The hallways and carpet in the hallways were disgusting.  Could most certainly use an update of new paint and carpet in the hallways.  Or at least a deep cleaning.,2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,value for money,"nice hotel about 15 mins drive from the airport. There is absolutely nothing to see in the area, but if you only need a good hotel for a stop over it is fine, it is clean and plenty of room",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Dave's view,Good value for the price. Close to air port. Staff were good. Breakfast was good but very crowded and running out by 9:00. Room was old but but clean and tidy. Staff recommended the diner about 200 metres away and that was a great meal and experience,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,OK but not great,This room was very overpriced.Very small in size.  I would expect more selection at breakfst for the price.,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Overnite stop,"The hotel was clean and comfortable.  The only problem we incured was the shuttle from the airport to the hotel.  After an hour and half wait we were finally picked up.   This was no fault directly of the hotel, they were trying another shuttle service, and as you can tell was not that great.  But for just needing a place to stay for a night it was what we expected.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Location was the goal, but had some issues....","First thing hitting us when we checked in about 2am was the overpowering cigarette smoke smell at the lobby, unsure if it was from the overnight worker or not. The other issue was the attached picture of some kind of stain behind our toilet. It wasn't noticed until after already showered and ready to get in bed close to 3am.   Considering we were checking out hours later, I wasn't going to stay awake if they'd offered to send someone to clean it, or dress and re-pack even if they had offered another room at that point. ",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,old and smells like mold,"I stayed here due to a 6 am flight. The room was at the end of the hallway on the 3rd floor. It smelled like mold, the exterior has windows that open but no screen. The bedspread was so filthy that I slept on a towel. This supposed to be a non smoking hotel but the room reeked of tobacco, There were no rooms left as t it was close to 9 pm and they were sold out. I asked to be moved to another room, they did, but it was in sad condition as well.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not worth the money,"Rooms are very dated Holes in the wall, funky smell, toilet leaked, shower dripped, the art had been ripped off the walls, the lobby had chairs and tables stacked in the corner that they used for the breakfast This hotel just needs gutted.  Not worth the money we paid for this room. Very expensive for a dated hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Two stars due to nightmare shuttle service,"The room was fine and clean, but the shuttle service was a complete nightmare. The air conditioning was broken on a 95 degree day and there was not enough room for everybody as the shuttle was servicing at least six hotels. I had to sit on the shuttle as it went to these six hotels for 45 minutes, as I thought I would die of heat stroke. I also had to wait an additional 40 minutes for the shuttle at the airport, and was barely lucky enough to get a seat. Unacceptable. The main reason I chose the hotel was for the shuttle. ",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,A good overnight stay near DIA,"Our family of four needed to fly at 6 AM, and rather than leave Colorado Springs at 3 AM, we decided to stay overnight near DIA for convenience.  The hotel offers a shuttle to DIA, and I think you might be able to leave your car for a short term if necessary, but I'd call the desk to confirm that.  There is ample parking otherwise.  The front desk staff was helpful, and professional, the rooms were very clean and comfortable, I could stay here for a few days easily.  breakfast is included and starts at 4 AM.  We walked across the parking lot to the Moonlight Diner, which was very good, and there are numerous other restaurants within a mile on Tower Road. The shuttles leave every 20-30 minutes, but you must reserve a seat at the front desk.  The shuttles took us to our departure and check area.  A good night's sleep at a good price.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,No Blankets??!!,"The room was nice enough, large by Microtel standards I thought, though given the import of making a good first impression, I would think someone might have taken a minute to either replace or at least flip over the ripped cover on the window seat cover!Unfortunately, our experience went downhill as our stay went on.I have never seen nor heard of any hotel/motel not having a single blanket on the beds, or least on hand in the room somewhere!  As we prefer to sleep in a cool room overnight, it was impossible to sleep well, a sheet and a bedspread did not cut it to keep us warm. The breakfast food was ok, but the area was disgusting.  No one had obviously made any effort to sweep through the eating area since the service had begun at 4:30 am.  By the time we hit it around 7:30, the trash was overflowing, and there were crumbs and food trappings over all of the tables and floor.  Yuck!Also, when we checked in around dinnertime, we were told there was really only one option available -the restaurant across the parking lot.  Well, maybe if you only consider restaurants within 500 yards.  As we knew the area, we knew that there were actually 3-4 restaurants all within a mile.  though the restaurant was ok, I felt as if the front desk ataff had been intentionally misleading.  They must get some sort of kickback.  Maybe if the diner had offered a hotel guest discount, I wouldn't have minded as much.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Microtel at DIA,"The room was fine, it was clean and in good shape.  We asked for a 3 am wake up call and got the call at 2:30 am.  The shuttle to airport we were told would leave at 3:20am showed up at 3:30am. We used the stay and park for the airport.  The return shuttle we had to wait almost an hour to be picked up.  there was no A/C in the shuttle and it was over 90 in Denver.  The shuttle drive didn't offer to help load or unload the luggage.  Would have to think really hard if I would stay there again.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Where's breakfast?,"Was promised 3 things:1) Breakfast at 4- didn't happen.2) Wake up call at 330 am- didn't happen3) Shuttle to airport. It happened, but if one more person needed a ride they'd have been out of luck.",2

They copied my friend's ID without asking or explaining first (we've been warned for identity fraud a lot) and were really confused when she got a bit angry because of this. Although the breakfast foods were ok the breakfast was a mess! There was no more milk, and when we went asking for it it was very hard to get someone's attention at the reception. The staff seemed to not really care about the state of the breakfast at all. The tables were gross, they weren't cleaned after people finished so we had to eat at tables covered in crumbs.  Location is a bit strange. Fairly close to the airport but in the middle of desolate fields (seems like they still need to build residential areas…",3

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,In town for Rockies/Phillies games,"We got two rooms thru Trip Advisor for $67 each. Rooms were great.  Clean, comfortable beds, big, clean bathrooms with great shower. Temps outside were 100 degrees. A/C worked beautifully. Avoid room #219, which does have a bit of hum noise from elevator, but I slept fine. If you want a fully-foofy $200 room go somewhere else.  But the Microtel was priced right, quiet, clean, and a nice place to stay",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Overpriced,"I have stayed at this Microtel a few times over the last couple of years when I have flown out of or picked up family at DIA. It is has become extemely overpriced for what you get; which is a room and a below average continental breakfast. This stay set me back $137 for a night. I didn't know, however, that the price of the room included free dirty panties and a shirt! What a treat to find those items hanging on the back of the bathroom door! Left me wondering if the sheets had been changed or washed. Now I'm not too picky about my hotels; I have happily stayed in dives when the price is right. What irks me is the price for this hotel is out of line with what you get. Some places in Aspen cost this much. This will be my last stay at this hotel.",3

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good clean property with limited amenities,"I should have looked for a hotel with a refrigerator and pool but made the erroneous assumption that all new facilities had these amenities. This one had neither of those.That said, the room was clean, in excellent repair, and comfortable. We had an issue with the AC and someone came within 2 minutes to work on it and it was resolved in about 15 minutes.The desk staff was not helpful in recommending a place to eat. The only place in walking distance was a diner which didn't suit our needs/interests. We ended up going to a Chinese place because the menu at the desk looked good. The food was so greasy that none of us finished our meals.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Smoky, cheap, Bad customer service","Smoky room, HBO didn't work, wall paper pealing, bathroom condiments lacking, housekeeping skipped cleaning 2 days (out of 7) / and lacked English ability to communicate. The towels are cheap, carpets stained, ""continental breakfast"" is a joke, and the front desk staff was less than helpful, not to mention twice we had to get new keys, as when we go up tot 3rd floor - both keys didn't work. We complained almost daily and I've never had such a bad experience with traveling 4-5 times a year. My daughters bra was taken (at least that was reimbursed), but the GM was less than nice and made us feel like it was our fault. This hotel need a major redo, otherwise I wouldn't suggest it be on Wyndham's page as you question if they are of the same quality as Wyndham.",1

This motel was terrible. From an A/C unit that I was told to unplug every so often to make it cool, to the smell of mold, which was visible in the bathroom and you could feel it in the carpet, to the lack of basic amenities such as a coffee maker or mini-fridge, we were there for a week and it was a stay to play tournament so no option to leave. I explained our issues to the front desk but all they could do was knock a bit off the nightly cost.  The outside was terrible and looked as though it had been in disrepair for months.  The day we arrived they had landscapers there trying to clean up the front but the back of the motel was still littered with 2' high…",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,What's my name again?,"My wife and I needed a place to stay between returning from the mountains and catching a early flight - this place felt like a no-brainer.

We started this process and she said ""Oh, you're Mr. and Mrs. ABC?"" - the same name we had just given her - ""Yea, we have your booking here"".  The rooms are bed shaped closets and while the bathroom is fine size-wise I thought my toilet would lift-off through the ceiling after flushing - good thing I didn't need the repairman.

When we got upstairs the room felt hot but the air conditioner was running, so I showered and when I felt the unit for cold air, it was blowing warm. I called the front desk and they offered us a third floor room. We ran into the same situation there, but it was a bit more bearable, 2am our time, and we just went to bed. The bed was comfy, the unexpected breakfast area well stocked, and quiet at 7 am, so we ate and headed out to Colorado Springs.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good for late arrivals,"The hotel is relatively close to DIA and is a good option if you are arriving late, as I was.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Stay Somewhere Else,I will never stay here again. The front desk staff was friendly and there were no issues checking in but things went downhill after that. We had two rooms reserved one room had a clogged toilet on arrival. Our party went to the front to complain and was handed a plunger. It was impossible to unclog and due to the late hour decided to forget trying and just go to sleep. It would have been nice to have been given another room or had a maintenance person fix it but apparently neither was an option. In the morning only some random items were still available at breakfast at 6:30. Two children had to share a muffin. There was no coffee left and no coffee maker in the rooms. The microwave was dirty and wouldn't even heat the oatmeal to a decent temperature. The waffle maker burned the outside and left the inside raw. We decided to just get out of there and eat later. The price is comparable to other hotels in the area and there are too many other nice places to stay versus here. When I ask the front desk for a partial refund due to the toilet issue I was told since I booked through Expedia they couldn't do anything and I would have to talk to Expedia!! Great customer service!! Never again!,1

My stay was booked in advance months ago. Luckily the manager, albeit somewhat begrudgingly, allowed me to keep my vehicle there for the entire time. My point is...more and more customers are being pushed to the side for special interests. Since I was pre-booked months in advance my stay requirements should not havtebeen questioned.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Excellent Front Desk Staff,"Booked this hotel online thru Booking.com several weeks in advance. Traveled nearly 20 hours to get here & upon checking in discovered that Booking.com completely lost or cancelled my booking! The front desk staff, specifically Patrick & Kesia, spent nearly 2 hours dealing with booking.com to resolve the issue & made my needs their #1 priority! Excellent customer service & friendly people! Also, hotel itself was clean & comfortable! Highly reccomend this hotel as a great place to stay! Ill definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Cheap but rooms are teeny tiny,"It's up the road from the large cluster of hotels right by Pena, maybe 1 mile. Front desk staff was very friendly. We didn't stay for breakfast, but we left for the airport at 5am and they already had breakfast foods out and ready. I did see a waffle maker, and their coffee was good. The rooms are so tiny, super tiny. But we just needed a place to stay the night and it did the job. The bed wasn't real comfortable, I did wake up with a sore back. Overall, it was a good price for what we got.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Needs Maintenance,"The room wasn't clean. The bed was, and the bath was, but just about everything else wasn't. The wall needed painting, the remote control was very sticky. I won't stay there again.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,A bed,"If you need to a place to stay this is okay.  Room was mostly clean, the pillows are too small but this is Wyndham's style.  It worked for a night wouldn't stay any longer or plan a trip to stay in a Microtel. ",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Only one problem,"Our overall stay was pleasant. The room was quiet, the bed was comfortable once i covered the sheets w/additional sheets. There were hairs on the bed sheets & pillow cases! As if someone had a hair cut & laid in the bed..After taking the pillow to front desk i was given clean sheets for me to remake the bed!!",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Clean and close to the airport,"We spent less than 12 hours total checked in and probably 5 hours in the room.  It was small, but that's why it's called Microtel!  Clean and comfortable and fit our need.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Clean and Simple,"I enjoyed a pleasant stay at this property.  The room was clean, the staff was especially helpful.  The free breakfast was a bit below average.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,It is what it is - not bad. ,"We booked a room here after a midnight flight to DIA. The shuttle service was polite. The room, bed linens and towels were clean; the coffee in the morning was good. I can't comment on the breakfast as I slept through it. This was a basic, comfortable one night roof over our heads. This hotel delivered on that, especially on the price we paid. This is not for travelers looking for a hotel 'experience' with special extras and amenities. The only complaint I had is that the young lady working the night desk spoke way too fast on the phone, to the point we could not understand where she was telling us to go for shuttle pick up, and we had to call back multiple times to verify where she told us to go.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,DON'T STAY THERE,"Broken chair, hairdryer didn't work, light out over window seat (when reported was told there was no maintenance person to fix it), no iron in the room. I requested an iron from the front desk, put water in it for steam, and the water poured out all over my shirt. There was a bug in the bathroom like a silverfish, but smaller. Maid tried to enter room without knocking (she had a key, and if I didn't have the safety latch in place she'd have walked in on me) as I was getting out of the shower.  I reported to front desk to train maids to knock before trying to enter guest rooms. Her response was ""I don't speak Spanish"". Waffle iron stuck, couldn't get waffle out in one piece (nor could other people, as I observed). I was shocked with the overall shabby appearance, as we'd had a delightful stay at the Microtel in Moorhead, MN.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Incompetent,"I made a reservation through booking.com. When we arrived, the hotel had no record of my reservation. Fortunately the hotel had one room left and we took it. I found out later from hotel staff that the manager was not processing emails from Booking.com. Those are the facts.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good place to stay,Nice place to stay. Could not get anyone to answer the phone when a called the front desk with a question.  When I checked out no one was at the front desk and the phone was ringing off the hook. When someone did appear to help me I told her the phone had been ringing and did not really care.,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Comfortable,"Clean, updated but showing its age. Noisey if your on the first floor and someone likes to stomp their feet.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Overnight stay,Very friendly staff.  Room was  clean and the beds were very comfortable.  There was a free shuttle to the airport which we weren't aware of before hand.  I would stay there again if flying out of Denver. ,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Rooms are small but clean,"The room was much smaller than any other hotel room I've ever been in. Having said that, it was clean and it worked for what we needed. The main frustration was that there was not enough parking at the hotel. We had a rental vehicle and had to park it on the street which I was not 100% comfortable with.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Terrible room,"I checked in late and had to get an early flight so not in mood for the terrible room I got.  When I went into room you could tell someone had already been in the room.  Beds were straightened not remade, toilet paper roll not refolded.  Key from prior tenant still in room. And then the kicker, the airconditioner sounded like a diesel engine running.  I shut off air, opend window, laid in bed and slept a few hours. Clerk at checkout could have cared less about me or for that the others waiting in the lobby. Not again at this hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not Welcoming,"The room not only had stains on the ceiling but the carpet was wet.    Twice I have left messages for the manager and the calls were not returned.  No matter the time that I call, the response is that the manager is gone and will be back tomorrow at 2:00.  I attempted to send an email using the address on the site and it bounced back.  The front desk staff is less than friendly, have more than a few examples.  Won't ever be staying there again no matter the price.  ",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Convenient to DIA,"Great location for those early AM flights out of DIA. Friendly staff. Clean, average little, short term stay when traveling in & out of Denver area. Stayed many times night before flying out.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Never again,"Horrible. The girl at front desk was not nice. She never spoke up, could not hear her. They gave our room away but never admitted it to us. We arrived around 2am, however, they knew this days ahead of time and noted it in our record. We slept on couch in lobby of hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Avoid this place!,"This hotel is horrendous. Closet sized room with no microwave or fridge. Three tissues in the box in the bathroom. Incredibly noisy. Walls are paper thin, making it possible to hear conversations in the next room. Ice machine was empty. I told the front desk. Nothing was done. The Continental Breakfast was a joke. Rubbery bagels. The 'fresh fruit' selection consisted of a couple of apples and one very green banana. We cut short our stay. Were fortunate enough to check in to the Ramada across the parking lot from the MIcrotel. Had a very well-appointed suite for less money.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Hotel stay,"From arrival to check out we found the service and cleanliness of the facility top notch. We were greeted by a courteous and friendly staff, the room was neat and clean and the hotel was quiet in the evening as well as the night. Breakfast was well stocked and delicious. I will seek out microtel when traveling from now on",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Review,"Only complaints - No irons in rooms, had to check them out at front desk.  Little ironing board.  Poor internet connction.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good 1 night stay prior to early morning flight,"Stayed 1 night before an early morning flight out of DIA.  Although hotel is a little on the older side, the room was clean and comfortable.  Had an issue with the room assigned at check in (1 king bed...needed 2 queens) and the front desk worker was very helpful in resolving issue with reservation.  We weren't able to take advantage of the breakfast in the morning as we had to leave for the airport prior to 4am when breakfast is available.  Liked that I was able to utilize computer in lobby to print off boarding passes.  Location close to the airport was great too!  Also found the list of area restuarants and delivery options helpful.  Only negative we had with our stay is that the walls are very thin!  We could hear the guests upstairs walking around, as well as, people out in the hall talking, doors slamming.  It did become very annoying later in the evening since we tried to go to sleep early because we had to get up early.  Otherwise, it was a good stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good for overnight stay,This hotel served our needs perfectly.  We needed a place to park our and shuttle us to the airport.  We stayed after our trip and although the room was small and walls thin it was fine for an overnight.  The shuttle was on time.  Breakfast was a little sketchy.  They ran out of coffee.  Overall the stay was pleasant.,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,EWWW,The staff was great however the rooms and fitness room were awful. My non-smoking room had cigarette burns everywhere and there was a large gross stain on the seat by the window. There a was used bar of soap in the shower and there were no extra blankets and the room was cold. The fitness room was very outdated and awful. There were water cups everywhere half filled but no other cups and no towels.,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Weekend Stay,"My husband and I came to Denver for a quick weekend stay.  This hotel is only a few miles away from the airport, but very quiet, very little, if any, airplane noise.  They offer wake up call, and free shuttle to and from the airport.  It is located just off of Pena Blvd, the mail road to/from the airport.  The surrounding area is currently being developed, some restaurants and shopping nearby.  Location is about 10 miles from downtown Denver, but it a quick 20 minute ride once you get to I-70.  Breakfast is standard continental breakfast fare...make it yourself waffles, juices, coffee, milk, toast, bagels, bananas, cereal.  I would stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good place.  Very nice and clean.   We missed our flight so...,Good place.  Very nice and clean.   We missed our flight so we were forced to stay overnight.    Microtel was close and had great shuttle service.  Thanks for saving us!,5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Great Customer Service, Outdated but clean rooms","I loved the receptionist customer service, I liked the check in process.The elevator was a little dirty, the facility interior and the room were clean.The room bathroom had outdated design, not that modern looking. The TV was huge, i believe 40 inch. The bed was great too.Overall good.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,New Hotel?,"When we checked in to this ""new"" hotel (a 30 min drive from anything in the city); We were first struck by the level of professionalism at the front desk. They talk to guest as if they were bothered that we disturbed them. This didn't give us the warm fuzzies. They told us 4 times not to smoke in the room. Insulting since neither of us smoke. The hallway smelled like fresh new carpet was laid. The room smelled like Pot on arrival. People upstairs kept us awake at 3am for 2 days. When we addressed the issue with the front desk, they never confronted the people creating the noise. Later, they were somewhat condescending when we addressed some legitimate issues with the very small room. We planned  5 or 6 nights and only stayed 2 or 3. I cant remember from lack of sleep. Never stay here. Spend the extra 20 bucks for a real hotel somewhere else. While this is a Wyndham hotel, I would add that we were saved by another Wyndham hotel in the area. I wouldn't hold it against Wyndham, just this one hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good motel.  Bad parking and pick-up.,"The Microtel was fine.  Good check in and room.  However, when I booked, I was told I could leave my car parked while on vacation and pick it upon return without additional fees.  When I checked in, I was told it would be an extra $60 to leave my car parked there.  Wow - the motel was not worth $140.  Upon return from my trip, it took over 50 minutes to finally get picked up at the airport and returned to my vehicle.  I will not stay there again due to these issues with leaving my car.  The motel and room were fine and if that was all that is needed, Microtel is a very good value.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Average stay at an average cost.,"The hotel good ok for a overnight stay to catch some sleep. My wife, child and I arrived at the hotel late at night and just wanted to get some sleep after a long day of traveling. When we went to the room we found that the room was full of mirrors in the sleep quarters. The room was small and the restroom had a broken sink. My wife and I just needed some sleep so we didn't contact front desk, we just went to bed. the walls are very thin so you can hear what your neighbors are talking about so it made it had to sleep. In the morning the front desk clerk did apologize and promptly checked us out and my family and I were on our way.",3

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Horrible Staff, brings down a nice hotel.......","The staff I encountered at check in and at breakfast are the worst.....Customer appreciation and respect does not exist with in  these individuals. At check out, no one was at the front desk and after 10 minutes, I dropped the keys and left. Breakfast was a joke and area was not kept clean or stocked. room was great, clean and smelled nice. Bed was great, window seat was nice. Bathroom was clean, water was powerful and hot. replace the staff and this would be 4 star! I won't return, should receive a refund of points and cash!!!!!!!!",1

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Disappointed in the Quality,"I have stayed in past Microtels and they have all have been a ""5star"" facility. However this chain was disappointing in various ways. The room WAS clean, which was appreciated but the front desk was not accommodating and seemed to hate being there.  The aircon was barely functional, made the room feel humid.  However, they helped us with parking. It was just a place to get a ""decent"" night's sleep. But this place didn't rank high compared to other Microtels.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Awesome Front Desk Staff,"The hotel is great and perfect for an overnight close to the airport.  But.... the front desk staff was AWESOME!!!  I can not say enough about the professionalism, knowledge and eagerness to help with a check in that I had made mistake in doing; quickly and efficiently solving my issue with kindness and courtesy ; a moment after a long exhausting  trip which could have been a nightmare, calming and my stay relaxing.  The young lady who helped me is the best!!!!  I am in the hospitality industry and the stay starts at the front desk.   Excellent job!",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Fair nights sleep.,This hotel was a place to lay your head before an early morning departure from Denver. Breakfast was awful. Food very poor. For the 100.00 price tag. I was really taken for a bad ride. Never ever again.,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Clise to Denver Airport,"King room was very small but clean and comfortable. The breakfast could have used some protein -  eggs, etc.  Help was friendly and shuttle was timely.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Just for sleep and breakfast,"We flew into Denver at about midnight and stayed our first night here just because of the closeness to the airport and the reasonable price. The room smelled kinda like smoke but I don't think I requested smoke free so no harm no foul. Otherwise it's a decent stay if you just need somewhere to sleep- everything worked well and the bed was fine. The breakfast consists of cereals hot and cold, breads, muffins, and bagels, yogurt, and a waffle maker- no hot foods or anything but it does the job.",3

Fridge was so loud we unplugged it for the night.I liked the padded bench by the window to sit and read while the sun came up.We arrived late - no parking spaces in the lot.,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Okay,"No major complaints. The front desk lady was polite and efficient. Breakfast was good with many options. The bed was pretty hard, but the room was clean. Free shuttle left once an hour and was on time. Overall okay stay for an okay price.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Nice place,"Nice location, just a couple miles from the airport. Rooms were clean and spacious. Had nice window seat, which was a different amenity than typical. Only complaint was the size of the lobby, which ordinarily wouldn't be a problem, but there was a blizzard the day that I left, and there were lots of people stuck in the lobby for quite some time. Limited seating. Everyone was very nice and helpful, even with being in a stressful situation with the blizzard.",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Great place for an airport layover....,"Finally....a clean room, clean towels, clean sheets, a floor I wasn't afraid to step on barefoot.  The place was busy due to a snowstorm, but we were immediately accommodated and got an internet discount (thank you!).  My only comment was the breakfast area needed a bit more attention due to the number of guests.  For the price, Microtel is the best - I've never been disappointed with the facilities and have always been satisfied.  Clean is important to me...they rate an A in that regard.",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,It was decent,"For the price of the room it was a good room, no serious complaints. The bed was comfy and rooms were clean.              ",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good value in a safe location.,This isn't a high dollar hotel but it's safe and clean. A good value for what I paid compared to other area hotels. Breakfast is filling but not gourmet by any standards. It's about five minutes from the airport rental car area and about 25 to 35 minutes from the center of downtown depending on the time of day when you travel. I would  stay there again.,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,WOW,The walls are so thin I got to listen to verbal fighting with very poor choice of words then make up sex then more fighting for the better part of the night.,2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good Deal,"When they say Micro, they aren't kidding.  It was a small room, but we just needed a place to sleep, close to the airport, so it wasn't an issue.  Everything else was as advertised.  The bed wasn't the most comfortable, and the shuttle to DIA ran only once an hour.  That could've been improved during busy times.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Convenient location for airport customers,"We had good service from the desk clerks, they even helped with boarding passes when the computer for guests was being difficult. Our room was nice, clean and comfortable and we got a good nights rest. The hotel is very convenient to the airport and is a nice place to stay at a reasonable price. We had a late departure and slept past breakfast hours, but did enjoy the coffee in the lobby/breakfast area. Our toilet was plugged on arrival, their solution was for me to come get a plunger and clean it myself...or they would move us. First time I have been invited to fix it myself. :-) Got it plunged and solved the problem.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Mediocre,"The stay was average to mediocre. I took advantage of the park and ride service and when I returned to DIA, I called the front desk for a shuttle. Had to wait 50 minutes. I could not understand the man on the phone because of his accent. He didn't seem to know the answers to my questions and he didn't seem to care about my situation. Sometimes he didn't answer the phone at all.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Where's the shuttle?,"My stay started out very good. Room clean, quiet, nice breakfast, got to the airport in plenty of time. However, the shuttle didn't show up on my return trip when I left my car at the motel. At check-in I was told that the shuttle ran every 15-20 minutes. After waiting 25 minutes I called and was told it ran every 1/2 hr.  After 45 minutes I called again. The nice driver from Marriott finally took me to my car!   Guess where I'm staying next time!!",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,No Choice,Stuck here for two days during blizzard. Both queen size beds had bright yellow urine stains. Front desk lady had to change sheets because she was the only staff member on the premises. When she brought the new sheets they were dirty and she had to find some clean ones. Breakfast was OK but we were trapped ( because of the blizzard) in the hotel for two days and the was no food available except breakfast. No one delivered food to hotel! Fully booked so there were one hundred people emptying the one snack machine to feed their families! The hotel had no contracted snow removal. Most could not leave the parking lot (even trucks and suvs) for two and a half days until a snow plow finally came. The hotel across from us kept their parking lot cleared.,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good facility/not so good shuttle,The front desk staff was excellent!! The property is basic but a great value. The shuttle service is not so good. Waited 45 minutes at the airport for the shuttle. You need to schedule the shuttle back to to airport and there are a limited number of spots. It runs once an hour.,4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Western Coach is a terrible shuttle service,"The Microtel is not a bad hotel but their shuttle service is terrible. There's not an issue going to the airport from the Microtel, but getting picked up FROM the airport is a nightmare. We waited OVER 2 hours in the cold on Island 3 with dozens of others who were waiting for the same van, only to find that the van that did finally arrive could not fit everyone in. Over 50 people were left in the cold to wait God knows how long to be picked up. People were on the verge or rioting and the many hotels serviced by this coach company were of no help at all.  We were told the van picks up every 30 minutes, and it took longer to get from DIA to this hotel that did for us to fly from San Francisco. The front desk clerk said she could not contact the driver to give us any idea of when…",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Unprofessional,The room was clean and receptionist was okay. Only problem was a housekeeper that gave me some attitude when i asked for some towels and ice. I think her name is silva because i asked another housekeeper what her name was.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Stay during March Blizzard,"Microtel is a better hotel in Canada. Need more staff for breakfast and at the desk, or different staff. I got put in a room with a handicapped shower. What would have happened if somebody needed the room. ",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Perfect,"This hotel was perfect for our needs, on the way to the early morning flight at DIA.  I wish I would have parked my car and took the shuttle. Next time for sure.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Average Hotel,"This hotel is definitely nothing fancy, but over all very clean! We needed a room before flying out of Denver and it was a cheap place to stay. We ended up getting stranded at DIA for 16 hours due to a massive blizzard and the staff at the hotel was so accommodating in doing everything they could to get us a room for one more night. I would recommend this place for short stays. The only downside is the walls between rooms are VERY thin so you could hear everything that would take place in the hallways and other rooms. ",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,No happy with hotel shuttle service,I stayed at this hotel ine night on Thursday 3/17/16.   I paid to leave my car in the parking area until I returns in Thursday 3/24/16.   I called the hotel repeatedly on my return 3/24 to get the hotel shuttle to come get me and take me back to the hotel for  my car.   The phone rang and rang with no answer.   Nor did the hotel ever come by at the airport at the agreed upon site.   I would up getting a taxi ($35) to take me the hotel :(,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Badly managed,"This on Tower Road and handy for DIA, but getting there is a nightmare.   There is a twice hourly airport shuttle but it is not operated by the hotel.   It is Western Coaches who serve several hotels in the area, but do not have any hotel names on their coaches.  The drivers do not help by looking for their passengers.    It took several calls to the hotel to get thin information and up to one hour standing out in the cold to get a transfer. The hotel rooms are basic, but perfectly adequate for an overnight stay.  The breakfast in the lobby was a shambles.    There was no staff member to clean tables or restock the buffet.  There was a selection of cereals but no milk to go with them.  The orange juice machine stopped working and the reception staff did not know how to fix it. …",1

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Always a good stay,"We have been staying at this location for years. Since Wyndham took over, it has been improved tremendously. It is clean, the beds comfortable, and the rates are great. I would recommend this hotel to everyone but I don't want it to be so full we could never book it.",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Small Convenience,"Microtel is close to DIA and has other competition all around. One would think that it would show. The rooms look old, our smoke detector was disassembled, the rooms was a box. The amenities were VERY limited. I was not happy with the quality, especially with the Wyndham name attached. It makes Wyndham look like a Super 8. I thought I went back in time to the 1970s with the decor. The wifi was Deepblue and as usual was of poor quality.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,No breakfast :(,"Everything was okay except there wasn't any breakfast ready. I guess the girl didn't show up for work. The receptionist gave us yogurt, which helped, but I reeeeeallly needed coffee since we were leaving so early. We paid to leave our car for 6 days....I guess the cost is on par with other hotels, but it seemed a little pricey. All in all, I like Microtels because they are clean and simple. This one was no different.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Price is right and the package is fine,"Only slightly further away from the airport than the big chains, and right by the excellent Moonlight Diner. Room interiors are the classic Microtel you have come to expect, but plenty of space and neat & clean as can be. Room noise above average, but everyone seemed to settle in by 11. Breakfast is basic, true, but ample and serviceable enough. Nice fitness room even!",4

When she did finally come out from the back office she was rude & condescending when I asked her to clarify charges. Same person, same attitude when I called to ask about the airport shuttle. Rather than providing all the information I needed, she was very short with her answers. I ended up having to call back to ask another question. Completely unhelpful, couldn't believe how rude she was. Not the kind of person who should work in hospitality.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,you get what you pay for,If you come late and leave early it is not bad. They advertise airport parking but then charge $5 per night which is deceptive.The hotel could use some repair. Bathroom toilet was running and it took more than an hour for someone to look at. They decided it couldn't be fixed and I was given another room. not impressed,3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Perfect for catching an early flight!,"The hotel is situated in a great location. It accommodates the airport, as well as any drive north/south without getting in Denver's traffic. We stayed here for one night and it was just ideal. Good night's sleep with comfortable beds, spacious room and clean bathroom. Would definitely stay again to catch an early flight. The shuttle starts at 3:15 and runs every hour.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Great place when traveling out of town,"My wife and I often stay here when traveling out of town.  We live in the Colorado mountains, so an early flight often requires we drive down to Denver and spend the night before our departure near the airport.  Microtel Inn fits the bill in so many ways.  We usually pay around $70 for the night.  Room is very small, but comfortable and clean.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.    One nice benny is that they will allow you to leave your car for $5 a day and they provide shuttle service to and from the airport.  It's about 15 minutes to the airport, but they have a schedule their shuttles keep.  Just coordinate all that with the front desk.  Last month we even stayed here when we returned because we had a late night flight arrival and we needed to sleep before driving back up…",4

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,In serious need of repair - but clean and quiet.,"We made an unexpected decision to stay here once we learned that our flight was delayed and not getting in to DEN until just after 3 in the morning. Booking was easy and done via mobile device before the plane took off.The building is definitely older and has some extensive wear and tear that needs to be addressed. Ex: there was clearly a hole that had been patched in the dry wall in the room, the ring base for the bathroom door handle was separated from the rest of the handle, the stopper in the sink was missing.....Staff wasn't very conversational upon our arrival at 3:30 am but then again, neither were we. We asked if there were any food options locally that would still be open - there weren't. The room was CLEAN and comfortable for our ""nap"" (I call it that because we checked out just a few short hours to get on with our plans). Checkout was a breeze, and the person at the front desk was very friendly. Breakfast was to be expected, and just what we needed. I felt the fruit was a notch above what hotel fruit typically is and took an extra, plump apple for the road.",3

Ask for the 3rd floor as it is a lot quieter than the other two.  This hotel caters to the early airplane travelers so the noise starts around 4am.  We always stay on the 3rd floor and have not had any noise problems as with the other two floors.,4

Is well displayed.  Bagels and English muffins wrapped in plastic wrap.  The cream cheese and milk products are in a small refrigerator on countertop. The coffee was hot and tasty.  The seating area is nice too. Shuttle service is shared with maybe 5 other hotels so could be long ride depending on time of arrival/departure",4

Nothing in walking distance either..not even a convenience store..so if you're overnighting for a flight at the nearby Denver airport...you're stuck there. Shuttle to airport is very infrequent.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Accountability Issues and Immature Workers By Wyndham and This Hotel,"While on my flight from Los Angeles California into Denver 12/18 & 19 I took time to read several reviews on hotels.  When I came across Microtel Inn by Wyndham Denver I noticed more positive than negative so I gave it a shot.  When I arived I was pleased with customer service and cleaness of the hotel also I noticed a waffel making machine which was not in the reviews prior.  From that point everything went to hell.  My room was super small, walls paper thin and water presure for showering sucked.  I had plans to only stay one night, however, the change in weather caused me to become ill so I stayed over one more day.  THE BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER. As  I was sleping throughout the day and night I was called by the front desk at 3am to say ""YOU NEED TO TURN DOWN YOUR TV YOU ARE DISTURBING OTHER GUEST"" I thought I was dreaming until I said excuse me what did you say and who is this.  She replied ""FRONT DESK AND YOUR BEING RUDE SO TURN DOWN THE TV NOW AND SHOW SOME RESPECT"" I calmly told this lady I was sleeping all day becasue I was ill and her disrespectful words would be reported, she hung up on me.  Shortly afterwards I received another call from someone suggesting the same thing  on 5 different occasions.  I went from being calm at 3am to being pissed at 413am when this concluded.  I was unable to go back to sleep and began writting exactly what happened so that I can address this with mgt in the am before check out.  I did just that and was given the Manger contact information Alissa to call.  When she and I spoke about what happend she apologhized and confirmed her worker did contact me without checking 1st if it was my room, come to find out it was not it was coming from upstairs. **Remember Paper Thin Walls** I booked the room with my Gold Member Points and she told me that a refund of those 3k points would be returned.  Long behold I am trying to use my 15k points for New Years when Wyndham informs me I am missing 3k and Denver never applied them.  I decided to wait a few days and call back to Microtel and discuss the issue, that is when I spoke with a Jerk name John who said he was ""Kind Of A  Manager"" He argued with me and told me it was Wyndham fault so take it up with them not the hotel.  I asked for a complet refund now becasue I lost the room I wanted to get and the hassel with disrespect from Microtel & Wyndham had made me physically sick.  1/5/16 I have no refund!",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Repeat Stay,Everytime I come here they are excellent!  The only way I go to another hotel is if this one is booked.   The rooms are always clean and the front desk lady was very understanding even though I booked the wrong room!,5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Clean but not comfortable,"They were the cheapest I found quickly while at the airport since I had to stay overnight, but I think Motel 6 would've been just as nice for cheaper price.  The bed was hard, the pillows were soft, and the room temperature control was out of whack.  We had it set to low heat at 70 but burned up most of the night until we turned on the AC .... on December 28 in frigid outside temps!!!  We waited over 45 minutes outside in 10 degree weather for a shuttle from the airport.  At least they gave a free one-use-only toothbrush and powder toothpaste.  For $90, could've been a little better.  It was the worse night ever for traveling and not being able to get sleep.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Very low quality hotel,"The desk clerk made me wait 5 minutes while she stood out front to finish smoking her cigarette. Afterwards she was anything but helpful when I asked general questions like what time was breakfast. She seemed annoyed at having to check me in. The shower was cold and didn't work very well. The room was very small and not what the picture online depicted. The breakfast was just pancakes and some muffins really.

The smell was so bad, we had to put towels under the door of the front door and bathroom door. If we could have left we would hav, that is how bad the room smeeled. We got some deodoring spray from the staff. When we got back to our rooms, there had not been any maid service, no fresh towels or the beds made.The next morning complained agian, they took $30.00 dollars off the room bill. I was told by staff that there was a concert in town and it brought in this type of crowd. To me sit seems that they new there would be issues, they should have been more diligent in who they rented rooms to. I definitely learned you get what you pay for, it was not worth saving a few dollars and staying here.",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,it's ok,"Not 1st time here. Rooms are small, hence the name. Ask for a room with 2 beds, its a little bigger. Stayed because of  corporate discount and proximity to DIA. Shuttle they have now shares with Western shuttle as opposed to microtel handling their own shuttle services. They're are now with western, they are bad, untimely. Had to put a hold on card for ""incidentals. "" Really? There is no room service,  restaurants to charge to hotel. Only bottled water and canned sodas. When I booked for this trip, I was told there would not be a deposit. Parking fee is only $5/night or $25/week.

The shuttle dropped us at ONE place at DIA --- my carrier was on the other side of the terminal. I had a bed and a bathroom; great. Both are necessary.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,A Pleasant Surprise,This was our first stay at a Microtel Inn and we were pleasantly surprised when we opened the door to our room.  The large room with two queen sized beds was immaculate and a sight for sore eyes arriving shortly after midnight.  The bathroom was clean and modern with plenty of towels.  The air conditioner was quiet and we got a great night's sleep.  The hotel also allowed us to park our car in their lot for $5 per day while we were gone which cost us less than half of what we would have paid at the airport.

While nothing was particularly bad, per se, I really don't think I got my money's worth out of it. However, here are some comments:  Pros: The room was clean and relatively up to date.  Cons: The lady at the front desk was not really thrilled to see me (it was almost 1AM, so I don't entirely fault her).  There was no iron in the hotel room, so I had to trudge down to the main desk to borrow one, and it worked...sort of.  There was no coffee or coffee pot in the room.

That's when Microtel came to our rescue, they offered us immediate check-in in the middle of the night and allied us late checkout by 2 pm. They had free shuttle to the airport which was a great help as we had already returned our rental car.  Ont only that, the staff was very understanding and Elizza (I an not sure I spelled it right) made sure that we had everything we needed. She also took off 10 bucks our room price.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Terrible Experience,"When my boyfriend and I arrived at the Denver International Airport we called the hotel to find out where to meet the driver. The receptionist Monica stated where to go and the driver would be there in 5 minutes. We waited 45 minutes along with a group of other waiting to get on the shuttle. The shuttle proceeded to take us to the hotels that no one was staying at that was on the shuttle. Overall it took an hour and half to get to the hotel. When we arrived there was no one at the front desk, we waited for a while until the shuttle driver yelled. Monica checked us in, she did not tell us she was not putting us in the type of room we had reserved. The key card machine did not work so she manually let us in our room. The room I reserved was a king size bed, we ended up with double queen. The room had a huge dent in the door, looking like someone had punched it. The walls had holes spread out through out the room. It looks like they tried making in it into a suite however the kitchen was not put together completely, there was random furniture in the room. The door to the outside was not meant for room, it had a window in it, and only a little door knob lock not even a bolted lock. I walked out and told Monica this is not what I reserved, she was like well there is nothing left that's all she had, and it was the same price as what I booked. I felt like I got shafted on what I booked, and she did not care one bit. I had called the hotel four times that day to let them know we were not going to be in until late. I've never been so frustrated, I do not plan to ever stay at any Wyndham hotels again.",1

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,$100/night?!?!?!,"Not at all what I expect from Wyndham.  Filthy conditions, unkept facilities, holes in the walls, marijuana smoke in the halls, a ""fitness room"" that had a broken door knob preventing entry and a treadmill that needed service, no normal amenities in the room (coffee pot), small room, worthless & uncaring staff (except for the deaf housekeeper - only person I felt like we communicated with).  The list goes on.  Oh, don't ask what we found under the bed.",1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not worthy of the Wyndham name,"First I may have been expecting more from Wynham given I have stated at Worldmark locations by Wyndham but geez this place scared me a bit. We drove passed a area of wonderfully maintained hotels and a bit further down the street we see a few more hotels.  We see that's our turn and the front two hotels look fine but then we see ours is in the back next to a large field. With the amount of weeds growing all around this hotel including in the cracks in the sidewalks and rain gutters I thought we were part of the field. The elevator has several broken pieces inside the cab which could cause serious cuts if you caught on them.  There has been something spilled on the floor in the elevator since we got here and the dirt has progressively built up on it. In general the facility is not maintained well. Several other things were broken including the door to exercise room and the equipment inside, the ice machines, door handles on stairwell and flooring in halls.  Our room was a little better but not by much. We had used shampoo in our bathroom, not enough toilet paper left on the roles to get thru the couple of days and no spares and last something sticky on the desk top.  The smell of someone smoking weed was overwhelming one of the mornings even though there is a no smoking policy. Thru out the day they leave all outside doors open to get air in the hotel ( I guess no air conditioning?) but then there are bugs and flies everywhere. Remember we are next to a large field. The afternoon check in gal had no personality and did not explain any of the amenities or even how to get to our room or where the place to park for our room.",1

It like one of those places where the owners just are not investing in the infrastructure and the staff is doing their best to keep customers satisfied.  SHAME on Wyndham.

However, when I arrived at the hotel there were absolutely no parking spots in their parking lot, which is what I paid for.

A very congenial overnight, with a prompt 4:15 a.m. shuttle to the airport the next day. (Cold items and fruit were already set out for breakfast for early travelers...) One note: the desk clerk did not know at what rate I made the reservation, so I had to show her my print out to clarify/verify. In summary, highly recommend.",4

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good,Stayed at this place during our visit to Denver.  It is the cheapest option that was available for our family So we booked it for two nights. The hotel is decent and house keeping service is good. The only issue one of our room had a really old AC which isn't working. Other than that it is a good place to stay for one or two nights,5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Nice place (minus the stoners),"This was a nice hotel, great value with breakfast, easy to find by the airport. When I stayed here though, unfortunately, I don't feel the front desk staff handled a situation well. Even though the hotel is supposedly ""100% Smoke Free,"" there were people on my floor smoking what seemed to be quite a large amount of pot. At 6 PM, I noticed it on my way out... upon returning to the hotel 5 hours later, they were still going at it, so much that my own room three doors down actually smelled a lot like pot smoke. I hate to sound like a prude, but I had a job interview coming up and really didn't want my suit to smell like pot smoke, even though it's legal in Colorado. When I explained to the front desk that this was definitely a problem and had been going on for hours, they offered to move me, but really -- why should I have to be the one to repack/unpack at 11 PM because someone else is breaking the rules?! Besides, the entire floor reeked so moving probably wouldn't have helped much. From what I could hear, the staff did nothing in terms of knocking on the door of the stoners and reminding them of the no-smoking policy. I was just disappointed as I've always had high expectations met when staying at Microtels. Part of why I chose this hotel is because it was supposedly smoke free, and clearly, it wasn't in Potville.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Small, clean rooms","For an overnight stay before an early DIA flight, it's perfect. Easy shuttle to the airport, cheap daily parking rates. Friendly and helpful staff, decent breakfast. Not much else you could ask for.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Microtel is the word..,"I was rather surprised by the inconvenient way the room was done...  No Coffee Maker, no mini fridge or microwave, obviously because there is no room for them...  A one night  stay would be fine, but it is lacking for me beyond that...  Room was clean and very quite.  Staff somewhat reserved...  Got locked out of our room for the 2nd night.. and was told because of keys being in our wallets...Really?...  Breakfast the typical continental .....",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Not what I was expectong,"Room was clean but the faucet in the bathroom sink was broken, just one bar of soap, no microwave or mini fridge and the breakfast was horrendous, waffle batter was gone by 8:30 and didn't put more, milk pitcher was empty and just bad, I will NEVER STAY IN THIS PPLACE EVER AGAIN!",3

My room was next to the stairwell and heard traffic but was expected due to location.  The young man who drove me to the airport was very nice and entertaining along the drive.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Poor choice and waste of points,"The only reason you should I get this property, is because they have a shuttle to the airport. Anyplace else you can stay would be better. Front desk lady could care less, breakfast was terrible, only ice machine working was on the third floor.

"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Better than most average hotels and priced lower,"Excellent accommodations, interior was spotless, appeared to be new construction.  Needed to be finished on the outside still. The parking lot still had only only the first coat of asphalt.  Service to the airport was excellent, departed right on time. Rooms were fairly large.  I'd definitely stay here again if only to see if they finished the parking lot.PS I travel a LOT",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Totally fine airport motel,"Not much to say about this one -- decent, value-priced, middle-of-the-road airport motel.  Wish I had some sizzle or trenchant observations to add, but I don't.  Breakfast on the leaner side, though adequate.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"Nice design, except the smoke","We had a quick overnight at Microtel; the room was compact and well-designed, making good use of small space. The bed was comfortable and linens quite nice. Our room was non-smoking, but apparently the room next door was not. No sooner had we tucked in, than our neighbor lit up, and the smoke found its way straight into our room. Late as it was, we weren't inclined to move, so we just fell asleep and left early the next morning.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Was ok ... but ...,"If you are not from the Denver area and have a very early morning flight, then this hotel is an ok option. But ... Room is very small but adequate for a quick night sleep. Was wakened often with the outside door slammimg each time it was used during the night. Bed was comfortable but fitted sheet kept coming off the bed. Breakfast is minimal, but if you need a gluten free or are a diabetic, etc., not a good choice to eat. I'm afraid to say that next time we will chose another hotel in the area. There are plenty to choose from ...",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,BAD,Manager said they was a noise complaint from my room. At the time i was asleep. Told me i had to leave the property.  Had a week paid in advance only used 2 days. Did not refund my money.,1
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Close to DIA on a budget,"We had an early morning flight, and with some iffy weather, decided to stay near the airport.  Very good value, no extras.  Efficient check in.  While small, the room was clean and quiet.  Got a good nights sleep without the usual high cost of other hotels in the area.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Great place for overnight stay before flight,"We had a flight departing very early in the morning and stayed at the Microtel the night before our departure.  The hotel offers a shuttle to the airport and a basic continental breakfast.  The room was very small, but clean and comfortable.  For an overnight stay, this hotel is a good choice.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good For What it Is,"This Microtel is a fine place to stay if you are not from Denver, or the surrounding area, and have an atrociously early flight to catch out of DIA. This is not a luxury hotel.  It is a clean, quiet place to get some down-time.  If you have a car, their are many franchise restaurants along Tower Rd.  If you are on foot, there is a small dinner a block to the west.  The early morning complimentary breakfast is...edible.  The shuttle to DIA is great. The staff at the motel are friendly.  I want to give a shout out to Ramon, who is the maintenance-guy/social philosopher.  Very good guy.  Tell him hello for me.  He's got 7 kids.  He is not easily upset by anything.",4
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Microtel DIA,"Our flight from Miami to Denver was delayed 3 times getting us there after 2 am.  I called the hotel about it to see if we could still get a shuttle and they were extremely kind and helpful.  They picked us up from DIA and checked in very quickly, which was very appreciated at the late hour.",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,"You Get More, and Less, Than You Pay For","So- bottom-line price motel of all the motels on the way to DIA.  In other words, don't expect a concierge. No smoking, and they are serious about that to the tune of $250.   Having said that, Jule was friendly and eager to please as he checked us in and, after some confusion with housekeeping (the room was supposed to be ready at 3, we got there after 4 and it wasn't), we went up.  The bed was clean and made, and turned down, but there was a bar of soap open in the bathroom, with a toothbrush. No seal on the toilet, although it was clean, and only one towel. Again, Jule at the front desk (sorry if I am spelling that wrong) was only too happy to grab an armload of towels and washcloths as soon as he was asked.  The first and second floor ice machines were out, and we were told…",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Perfect for flying out of DIA,"This hotel is just right for a one night stay and the price was significantly less than other nearby properties. The room had everything we needed, was clean and had a very comfortable bed. The breakfast had many options and was easy to access. Although we didn't use the airport shuttle there is one running every hour. Also, you can leave your car in the parking lot for $5/day. The large parking lots down the road charge $10/day.",5
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Good location and price but not much else to offer,"This may be the cheapest choice on the Tower Ave ""strip"" of hotels and restaurants which offers convenient location close to Denver airport, but for just a few dollars more there are other places here to choose from that will be much more pleasant experience. Brief synopsis of my disappointments with this property: - there's not enough parking and the lot is poorly lit - lobby area is tiny, was crowded with 5 or 6 people signing in - overhead room lighting is garishly bright and there were no table lamps or floor lamps to offer any alternative. - full mirrored wall behind bed was something more fitting for a cheap-sheet motel that would rent rooms by the hour - blanket/quilt was too short, didn't cover my shoulders - the 3 bath towels provided were all different makes and ages,…",2
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,Microtel Rating,"Room was quite acceptable for the price. However, coordinating the airport shuttle with the Front Desk was not acceptable. I had to make 3 phone calls from the airport to determine the status of the airport shuttle. The Front Desk promised to return my call with the information on the shuttle, but do to apparent understaffing, never called me back as promised. After 10-15 mins at the airport, I called back to the Front Desk who told me they were busy & unable to call me back.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,A good budget grade motel,"Facilities were clean and well kept. Location had excellent diner across the parking lot, no need to drive anywhere. Room was small but adequate and clean, though mattress had a deep sag in the middle. Surprisingly, clerk could not find any record of the reservation I made online the day before and had to create a new reservation (fortunately hotel was not full). Another agent was later able to locate my original, but not without a degree of effort and wasted time for all. Front desk staff were all polite and friendly. Breakfast was minimal, though offered hot waffles and 24 hr coffee. Would probably choose a higher grade property in the future.",3
"Denver, CO",Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver,No sleep for me!,"Walls are paper thin. I could easily hear the people talking next door, their TV and slamming doors until 3 AM.  I had to take the 4 AM shuttle so I felt like my money for a room was wasted.",3

Lady at front desk when I checked in was no help every question her answer was I don't know.  I asked about the knob for the fridge if she had one her answer I don't know.  Plus she was dressed like a well she was dressed not for business.,1
