"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Pick a Different Hotel,Room was clean but that’s about where the positives end.  Terribly understaffed and common areas need basic cleaning.  Parking lot full of trash.  Given the many other options nearby I’d go somewhere else.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Standard hotel at airport location,"I stayed at this hotel for a short trip to Denver. It was near the airport which was convenient for me. The hotel itself was fine. The room I got was clean and good size. The public areas were in need of some TLC and light cleaning. The price was great and made up for any fault, which were not many.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Outstanding - again,"I've stayed at this hotel twice now and it far exceeds expectations for a frequent business traveler- great front desk, clean rooms, great proximity to Denver Airport, and outstanding pricing.No hotel is perfect, but Baymont has a winner with this location.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good value and convenient,"Stayed here to be near the airport for our flight the the next morning.  The room was good sized, clean and comfortable.  Very convenient to many restaurants.   Lots of competition in the are for your hotel dollars in this area.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Don't stay here, pick another hotel instead!","Good things: Cheap prices and last minute reservations available, plus breakfast in the AM was a plus. Other than that, the room was VERY clearly not clean. There were stains on the bed, human hair on the floor and pillow cases, marks on the chairs and other furniture. I've never stayed at a Baymont before but Wyndham is typically reliable and clean so I'm assuming this was an individual hotel issue. I wish it wasn't so late when we checked in and could have switched to another hotel close by upon seeing the state of the room. My friend also left a personal item in the hotel and was lied to by the front desk staff that they couldn't find it only a short time later. We are confident it was stolen and the front desk attendant was not helpful. Overall, please stay elsewhere! there are so many other properties close by. But I guess you get what you pay for.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Toilet from hell,"My toilet was backed up smelled and only offered a plunger not a change of rooms.  Was there for family funeral not to get a job being a hotel plumber.  The property was fine.  Management was in hiding of sorts, thou had no problem with not responding to me or calls and able to make sure that the credit card was charged for a CRAP  room. ",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Go Somewhere Else,Common areas like lobby and fitness center were dirty.  Sofas in lobby were stained with food. Printer in the Business Center along with the juice machine and both washing machines did not work. Only one person worked the desk during my 3 day stay and half the time weren’t available to help guests as they were off in other parts of the building. Would not stay here again and won’t recommend.,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Just Average,"I suppose the room is suitable for a single business traveler.  As a couple, staying near the airport on the last night of a 10 day road trip we found this room to be lacking in comfort and amenities.  The bedding was uncomfortable, the closet was so tiny it held 3 items at most (inconvenient for repacking luggage for our morning flight), shampoo & conditioner enough only for one person, no mini fridge, a single desk but no table to eat the ""grab-n-go"" breakfast at, the ""key"" for the room's electric had to be reinserted twice (flipping everything off including the alarm clock), and the bathroom light automatically turning itself off was annoying.  The good things were the location, the friendly staff, and the breakfast bagels.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Standard,"Stayed here overnight for a flight out in the morning. Good location in proximity to the airport and right near a couple of restaurants. Simple, clean, no frills. Beds and pillows were comfortable, you had to reserve a pool time, which was actually nice to have it to yourself. Breakfast was grab and go. Good water pressure. Only weird thing, our room was missing a television remote and we had to go to the front desk to get one, we stayed on the 4th floor and it was probably the quietest hotel I've stayed at.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Emergency layover in Denver,"My plane was delayed and caused me to miss a connection and need a place to stay overnight in a Denver last minute. I booked because the Baymont was less expensive than alternatives and the website advertised a shuttle and breakfast. After booking the nonrefundable stay, I learned the shuttle was canceled due to covid (even though other area hotels had shuttles.) So,I had to pay and extra $30 in Uber fees to get to the hotel. Knowing that, I may have made a different hotel choice. The hotel room was clean, but had obviously not been updated in a while. For instance, clean yet frayed towels. Also, I couldn’t find the remote, but it was late so I watched a show on my phone and fell asleep. Come to find out, the remote was under the bed!  In the morning, I learned that the included…",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,thanks,"The hotel cancelled my reservation for free even though it was a no-refund deal after I emailed them that my meeting is cancelled. Thank you, definitely will stay next time. Great customer service....",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Comfortable stay by the airport ,Close to the airport . Nearly new hotel with ample car parking. A choice of restaurants locally. Great for a first trip to Denver. Our room on the 3rd flor was spacious with 2 double beds . Plenty of power points to charge our phones good wifi included. ,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont by DIA,"Average mid-quality hotel on a par with other lower priced hotels. It felt reasonably clean. The staff was nice ...the shuttle driver was friendly and helpful. I did hear noise above me until late...just sounded like a child jumping around.  The pillows did not smell very fresh. The location is great, especially for flying out of DIA.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great service and breakfast with basic room amenities,"We liked the price when we booked, but kind of missed some of the amenities that we've come to expect in hotel rooms. We booked a Superior Room, 1 King Bed, Non Smoking.  Front desk, breakfast, hotel location, cleanliness, quiet hotel, mattress feel - all great! There was so much space in the room but everything else was blah. The heating system was the old style venting system below the window with buttons on the unit. There was no fridge or microwave in the room.  We were given exactly two towels, two wash cloths and one hand towel.  So very minimal on the room extras. We would consider staying here again if the price was right.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice place to stay but check in was a disaster.,I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past six months and was always very happy with the stay. This past time was a bit different. While the room was nice as usual and very clean the check in process was a complete disaster. The line to check in was backed up to the dining room area and there was only one desk clerk on duty. It took way too long to get checked in our room.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Outstanding place to stay,"One of the Denver Airports best hotels there is. Staff is very helpful and informed, check in only took about 3 minutes. My family and I have stayed here 3 times now and will continue to stay here for the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont,Property and people great! I would go back. Western shuttle was full twice picking us up from airport so we ended up taking an uber. That was the only clutch in our stay there. Hotel was comfortable and clean,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good Value at the Airport,"Solid breakfast bar.  Very nice bed and quiet rooms.  Good shuttle service to the airport.  Exercise room is weak but has a treadmill and a bike,  Pool is small but clean.  Don't forget to ask how to work the HVAC...it requires your card key in the wall to activiate it.  I learned the hard way....but the bedding was warm!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Good rooms, friendly staff, offers park & ride, and restaurants withing walking distance!",It was a busy night due to weather so I was happy to get the room.  The staff was friendly and the rooms were good.Plenty of food/restaurants nearby and other hotels if you're in a group and fighting low vacancy.  You can even park there and take their shuttle to the airport.  Parking is only 5$/day!,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great hotel overall,"Very clean rooms, staff was great and helpful. The cleaning staff did a great job, bathroom was clean as well as overall of the building inside and out. Breakfast staff was great, they kept food stocked. Shuttle was always on time. Will definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Outstanding Management,"Required to stay 5 nights for family event.  Staff from the front office, courtesy desk, housekeeping, to the breakfast crew exceeded our expectations.  This truly reflects a management that aspires to provide customer satisfaction at the highest level.  Well done.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,As expected,"After a late arrival in Denver, the shuttle took a large group to the Baymont.  Check in was quick, room was very acceptable, although one wall lamp was not working, didn't matter, it was late.  Breakfast was adequate, we left via Uber to car rental facility, shuttle would have been good, but we would have first returned to the airport.  We would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good but staff could have been more helpful,Stay was good there. 2 main things were the icemacker was not working on 3rd floor during visit. Also when I landed at Denver airport I called hotel about shuttle. Person I talked to was not very friendly and told me to ask someone at the airport where the hotel pick up was. The hotel shuttle was the #1 reason I picked this hotel. I did find the airport shuttle pickup and it was a very nice service.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great experience,It was a very good experience!! The check in was quick & I was in my room in no time at all!! The room was clean & very quiet!! I got my wake up call on time & check out was just as easy!! It's a fantastic hotel & I would stay again in a heartbeat,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Cant't beat location to airport . . .,"A bit disappointed this time as we try to stay here every time we take a trip to be closer to the airport and love the free airport shuttle but our first room was not like our previous experience. Remote didn't work, heater did not work (there was a snowstorm outside). They did move us to a different room where everything worked thank goodness!  I can only think they had an off situation but did correct it. We really like this property and  we would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A Great Stay,"The people at Baymont were helpful and very friendly. The shuttle service to the airport was prompt, both going to the airport and being picked up. My vehicle was safe on their grounds while I was in another state. Would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,fine,"breakfast was over a bit too early, as I was not told of breakfast times at check-in, but overall the stay was well.  No other complaints.  The staff did well.  came in during a snow storm and besides waiting on the shuttle all went well, as when I arrived at shuttle area the shuttle was already full and had to wait over 40 min. for the shuttle to return.  Then it was full again and I practically had to sit on someone's lap.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Worst Experience,"After waiting almost 30 minutes for the airport shuttle, we get a room that stinks, the TV didn’t work, and the heated pool didn’t work. The furniture was dirty and lights and blinds were broken. The front desk staff were not pleasant and begrudgingly helped us when we complained.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Decent value,"The trip from airport to hotel was horrible. Too many hotels use the same small bus and not everyone could get on so had to wait outside in the snow another half hour and couldn't get on so we eventually took a taxi.  Everything else was okay. Cleanliness, breakfast, value for the money.  Even ride back to airport was okay because it was scheduled and we had a seat.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Trip,Sofa was very uncomfortable in 201. Staff was pleasant. Breakfast needs improvement. Location is good for airport. Would revisit again if in area. Shuttle is convenient to this hotel for airport. Area needs more restaurants but looks like they are working on that,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Beware of charges,"We stayed here the night before a flight out of DIA. In the morning we had to leave due to illness and cancelled our flight. We told the clerk at the front desk and Wyndham charged us $65 for parking for a week.  I've called several times and the front desk keeps telling me they'll refund it, but it's been two months and no refund. Not right at all. I won't stay there again.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Place,"Wonderful place! Clean and quiet, comfortable accommodations. I left my car at the hotel instead of parking at the airport, a much better option! The shuttle service is great and I will absolutely stay again when traveling.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Stay night stay before heading home,Stayed here the night before we flew back home!! GReat placeto stat location wise! very clean and comfortable! The man at the desk was very very rude! did not enjoy the check in process! Loved that there was an airport shuttle service for so early in the morning!,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Mattress was the worst ever!,"Hotel was very basic and clean. Staff was nice. But my entire body was sore from sleeping on the rock-hard mattress. I've never had this experience in any other hotel ever. We had two beds and both of us were uncomfortable, even my husband who can sleep almost anywhere. No refrigerator in room, and little counter space by sink, but for the price, that was okay.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Place to Stay,"I love this hotel, because it is convenient to the airport, close to many places to eat and to shop. I am VERY particular about the cleanliness of hotels, and this one has always been clean and well-kept. The hotel is always clean, the staff is always friendly, a check-in is a breeze.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Layover Stay,"Have a missed connection at DIA which resulted in a 12 hour overnight stay. Not wanting to stay in the airport all night I opted for a nearby hotel. This ended up being the cheapest one so I took it for economy purposes. I was very surprised. A nice, clean, and professionally run place. I would actually opt for this hotel on any future missed flights.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great hotel. Good location,This is a great airport hotel. The hotel and staff were great. Breakfast was good and there are plenty of restaurants nearby if you need to grab lunch or dinner. I would definitely stay here again. I was unable to use the airport shuttle as I had a rental. During breakfast though I heard the shuttle driver come in an announce he was there on two different occasions.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Terrible Airport pick up service.,I stayed at this hotel because of the proximity to the airport and the airport shuttle service.  Service was fine on the trip to the airport however there was only one shuttle running pickup at the airport upon our return. This was on a Monday afternoon at 4:30. After waiting for 30 minutes in sub-freezing temps (20 degrees) there was not room on the shuttle for us and others that were waiting similar lengths of time - and the shuttle driver told us he would return in another 30-40 minutes. Seeing as this was the only reason i chose this hotel - airport shuttle -I would not go back and would have appreciated knowing about this before I chose this facility.  (we ended up taking an expensive cab to avoid waiting over an hour for a shuttle),1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Dirty Hotel, water not draining in bath tub, no Refrigerator and oven","We booked the room here to get some rest before midnight flight, we arrived at late evening - first room allocated was dirty, not clean - towel is too dirty, request to get another room. We got the another room, we thought that this room is ok but not, two main light - corner and table lamp were not working, water not going in bath tub - we did not have energy to shift to third room. When we were living in midnight for airport - we gave card back to desk and request explain the situation to his manager, he just throw the card to his table and went inside without bothering. Our big mistake to book here.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wonderful restaurant.  Excellent service.,"We stopped in for dinner and had Tina B as our server.  She was engaging, fun, professional and very helpful.  She was open and honest with her recommendations and helped steer all 4 in our part to what turned out to be wonderful first and main courses.  Will definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Disappointing and let down by uncaring checkin staff,"Having spend most of a touring vacation using cheaper motels I was looking forward to a more up market stay at this hotel, and in some respects it was. The room we were given was big, had a great shower and exceptionally comfortable bed. It was clean and very quiet. Breakfast was ok but had poorer selection than many of the prior motels. However the stay was badly let down by check in staff.The lady’s  manner was very perfunctory (as though reading a scrip - very fast) and very unwelcoming. She showed no interest whatsoever in us or the people checking in before us. She handed me the room keys and by time I turned to ask question had already disappeared. We had requested quiet room on high floor but were allocated room at front on ground floor. No explanation, apology or care shown, just a shrug of the shoulders and once more disappeared into the back office. I asked about the airport shuttle and was told the schedule changed daily and no point enquiring now as impossible to say what would be happening when we needed it - turns out this was complete garbage.I am pleased to say subsequent desk staff, specially Juan, were much much better and way more helpful.As for the free WiFi - terrible. When it did connect (which wasn’t often) it kept dropping out every few minutes. The only way we could get it to work was to walk to reception/breakfast area and use there. Very poor.In summary. Could have been so much bettere airport shuttle and was told the schedule changed daily and no point enquiring now as impossible to say what would be happening when we needed it - turns out this was complete garbage.I am pleased to say subsequent desk staff, specially Juan, were much much better and way more helpful.As for the free WiFi - terrible. When it did connect (which wasn’t often) it kept dropping out every few minutes. The only way we could get it to work was to walk to reception/breakfast area and use there. Very poor.In summary. Could have been so much better",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Absolutely HORRIBLE,They “over sold” our room and gave us “whatever was left”. Which meant we got a room w/ 2 doubles instead of the king bed we paid for. Staff was VERY rude about it and the room had blood on the wall!!,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good for a stopover,"We’re here for the night with a very early departure flight from Denver International tomorrow. The hotel is fine. They serve a continental breakfast, offer free wi-fi and have a pool. The room is clean, functional and comfortable. The reception desk was friendly and efficient. We would stay here again for the same purpose. This hotel is located here for people like us.  We found nothing wrong or to complain about. However, there is nothing exceptional about this hotel. The rating reflects its purpose.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Location - Easy Access to DEN,"This was a great selection for our overnight layover in DEN.  Good value, great location, and wonderful staff and amenities!  With a short distance from the airport and a convenient free shuttle, this makes it a win for long-term or short-term travelers to Denver.  I most certainly will use them again for any future layovers in DEN!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Less than hoped for,The room itself was spacious and clean. The exterior and lobby of the hotel was clean and well kept. However we had a TERRIBLE night’s sleep due to extremely uncomfortable pillows and a hot room. The lights and AC work only when a key card is inserted in the slot by the door. Unfortunately this means the AC was not on prior to us entering the room. It made for a stale and hot room. It finally cooled off about the time we had to get up for our flight the next morning.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good,"Staff was friendly.  Check in easy. Rooms clean.  No complaints.  About as close as you can get to the airport without paying an outrageous amount.  I think our room with tax was about $134.00. Not extravagant, but far from worst.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,No frills,We stayed here recently on an overnight stay having landed at Denver airport . We dined out Rooms ok bed comfortable pillows awful . Toiletries adequate . Breakfast satisfactory . Nothing sensational It delivered what it said on the tin,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good hotel,"This hotel was just perfect after a transatlantic flight & car rental pick up. Very clean, good sized bedroom, but ask for a top floor room if you don’t like to hear footsteps above your ceiling.  The occupants above our room were very stompy.  However once they settled down it was really nice & quiet.Breakfast choices were ok & adequate for our tastes.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Colorado Trip,"Went to the mountains for a fly fishing trip from 12 - 18 Sep 2019.  Great trip, stayed at the Baymont near the Denver Airport the night before departure.  Very clean and within walking distance to a couple of decent restaurants.  This is a growing area with new hotels and restaurants going in so it will be very busy very soon.  Could use a bar in the hotel, other than that, it was great.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,best value,"Clean, modern rooms. Comfortable bed. Great price compared to competition. GREAT free breakfast (eggs are excellent). Only negatives--had to wait a long time for shuttle bus at airport. Front desk guy checking in was not very friendly. It was late, and we had not eaten anything, and had no car. Vending machine for drinks only took cash (small bills). When my husband went down to ask for change, he said they had none. Not only that, but he failed to tell my husband there were vending machines on the main floor for both drinks AND food, that took credit cards. Front desk guy that checked us out was friendly. We would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good place to stay when you have early flight- shuttle provided,"The place is clean, nicely appointed, very comfortable.  Neither cheap nor expensive.  You schedule your shuttle when you check in.  They have muffins, oranges, apples, coffee, cocoa (powder), tea in the lobby even early (4:00 am).  Nice touch.  Bed was comfortable.  Close to airport.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great hotel airport,"I had a 6:15AM flight so I was only hear part of a night really, but my experiance was good.  My room was clean, and I was able to set up to get a free airport shuttle as early as needed the next morning.  Since breakfast was not out leaving that early, they had muffins and fruit out for us to take.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Noisy and Expensive,"Although we asked for a room on the top floor which the efficient front desk attendant gave us, it was still noisy: we could hear the guest next door walking and other toilets.  Bathroom very small and old.  For what you get it was expensive.  The included breakfast was decent.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,No mini-fridge? Really?,"The room and service were generally fine, but there was no mini-fridge, which was a shock. Can’t remember the last time I stayed at a place with no fridge. The other issue was also minor, but annoying. The bathroom light was on an automatic timer that switched off after a few minutes. More than once, I or my girlfriend finished showering in total darkness. Dumb design!",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Disgusted,Where to begin? Firstly the customer service. I was greeted by a female who acted as if checking me in was an inconvenience on her day. I later returned to the same female asking how to adjust the air conditioning. I hoped to speak with her face to face but she didn't even walk out of the back office. I'm guessing she was enjoying a new episode of Empire?My wife later returned after discovering a black stain of unknown substance on her pillow. Again she had to pry the pathetic employee from her Empire episode. Along with the black unknown substance was multiple black hairs throughout our bathroom floor. The best part? Our green sitting chair in our room looked like it had mayonnaise stains all over it. If it wasn't mayo I'm sure you can use your best judgement as to what it was. When confronted for the 4th or 5th time Mrs Empire's only response was cancelling the reservation at 8pm or moving to another filthpen room. Safe to say we slept little with many articles of clothing on. Sleep elsewhere. Your backseat in your vehicle would be more accommodating.,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Rude and misinformed,Be sure to get the correct time for the free shuttle. The check in told us a later time for the shuttle and when we arrived the morning staff informed us the shuttle had left and we were told the wrong time.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice stay,"Nice location, approx 5 min from the airport. Staff was friendly and room was clean. Breakfast ran out of  some food mid morning. checkout was breeze. internet worked fine. it was only a single night stay, so hard to provide any more comments.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Shuttle service noon existent.,This is the second time in a week we stayed at this property.  Upon airport arrival we waited approximately an hour for the shuttle service to pick up.  The hotels shuttle never showed came.  We finally got a driver from another hotel to transport us.  Also upon arrival at the property no one was at the front desk.  We waited 10 minutes for someone to return to the front desk.  In my business first impressions are critical.  This location does nothing to help the Wyndham brand name.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great place to stay,"First time I have stayed here and it was an excellent experience.  The check in was very smooth with a quite friendly and efficient lady.  The room was large, very clean and super quiet.  The bed was really comfy.  Huge flat screen TV and a different but great in room coffee.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Close to Airport.,"We arrived very late at the hotel, but that wasn't a problem.  Reception staff were very helpful and pleasant.  We only stayed the one night as we were moving on the next morning but everything was clean and tidy and breakfast was included which is always good.Not on the doorstep of the Airport so not too noisy, but very easy to find and only took a short time to get there.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,An Englishman's take on this hotel ...,"It was convenient for us, as we flew into Denver Airport. · Reception staff were very helpful. Shuttle bus to and from the airport was very useful.  On day two we hired a car and parking was free at the hotel.Large room; lots of drawers but very small clothes' rail. Good breakfast, including scrambled eggs. We would stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good for the Price and Location,"This is a completely adequate place to stay if you're arriving very late or departing very early from Denver International. My experience was of a clean, maintained, and very vanilla property for the best price available in this area. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom small and weirdly set up but likewise clean. The AC was very cold and controllable from inside the room. There's a tiny coffee pot with supplies but [referencing the weird setup]  it's on the tiny counter around the sink, which is located outside the toilet/bath room. On the other hand, it was very clean and quiet and has a free airport shuttle, even at 4 am.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good Enough,"Staff was positive and helpful.  Room good enough, and quiet.  Bathroom ventilation minimal.  No towel bars at sink, which is outside bathroom.  You lay your towel on the counter.  I enjoyed the bathtub.  Trash cans totalled one, a small one in the bathroom.  It was all I needed.  Clock-radio by bed as gaudily illuminated as a tavern sign.   I hid it in the drawer and slept well.  Breakfast adequate.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Hotel,Good location if traveling to airport Shuttle to and from airport abit messy but it’s not run by hotel  eating places within walking distance Shuttle to airport and take train from there to city in 30 minuets,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good for one night,"We chose to stay here for one night after a long flight. Spacious, clean room. Small swimming pool, which is open from 6 am until 10 pm. Wifi works well. Friendly staff. Decent breakfast buffet. Free shuttle to Denver International Airport.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Will not stay in the Baymont Hotel at Denver Airport again,"I have never written a bad review about anything, but I have no problem in doing so with this overnight stay at The Baymont Hotel-Denver Airport. No fridge. Have to keep your key card inserted in the key card slot built into the light switch in order for the heat/a/c to work and after that, the thermostat control is tricky. You can’t leave the bathroom light on with the door cracked as a nightlight because of a motion sensor/auto shut off, and no night light provided, so you have to sleep in complete darkness or leave a main lamp or light on to see your way to the bathroom during the night. Stained comforter, so they put a white sheet on top of the comforter to hide the stains. The previous persons key card envelope was in the toilet. We should have paid the extra $14 for Holiday Inn next door. This would be expected if it were a $50 hotel. I paid $167, for this. Never again. Very disappointed.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Dirty room,"This hotel room was the most dirty I’ve ever seen. Sticky carpets, stained bedspreads, spatter on the walls around the toilet. Staff not terribly friendly, I felt we were an imposition. Would never have expected this!",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Ok stay,"This was an ok place to stay for a few hours to sleep.  We chose this because of convenience to the rental car return & airport.  It’s a basic hotel.  There was no fridge & we did not have enough towels for our family of four, but the staff was friendly.  There was also only 1 cup with the ice bucket & coffee maker, so that was inconvenient.  Checkout was fast & I noticed they do have shuttles to the airport very early.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Hotel,"We stayed here for 5 nights, our room was nice and clean and the bed was comortable, the air conditioning worked well. The cleaning staff was very friendly and were there early to clean the rooms.The front desk personnel were very friendly except for one night we felt that we were bothering the clerk as she had to come out of the back room to answer our question. There was a shuttle to and from the airport but make sure to stop at the desk to let them know you need a shuttle and be waiting in the lobby at least 10 minutes before the shuttle comes.  Also the shuttle stops at other hotels so make sure you give yourself enough time for that.  We used it often to go to the airport to pick up the train to take to downtown Denver.  There are a few restaurants around the area within walking distance but only breakfast at the hotel. Breakfast was a nice variety but was very busy and we sometimes had a hard time getting a table to eat at and they were out of some items on different days. I would stay here again I really enjoyed my stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,OY!,"Room was clean and when I interacted with people at the property they were nice and wanted to be helpful. For example, even though breakfast started at 6, they placed some easily transported items out for people to take along to the airport prior to that time. However, I waited 40 minutes for a shuttle from the airport and then was unable to obtain a receipt, required by my employer, in either a hard copy or via email upon checkout. A phone call later in the day also failed to produce the necessary receipt.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Unpleasant Experience,"Just staid one night as we traveled through. Hot, stuffy room that didn't cool down - AC not working. Old, uncomfortable, borderline dirty furniture. Dirty bath. Unfriendly, curt reception. Not recommended, especially since there were many alternatives.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Name hotel near Denver Airport,"We have stayed here 2X and paid for a room for 2 others in April.  Very close to the DIA and as we own a condo in Colorado Springs it enabled us to drive up and avoid getting up at 2am for an early flight back to Cleveland.  Hotel is easy to access off the interstate, clean and provides good service incl. a shuttle to DIA (we did not use it as we had a car rental).",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not happy!,These guys have charged my credit card for our room which was already paid for by our travel company. No proper email on website only a comments contact box. Have messaged twice but STILL NO ANSWER! I do not want to call them from the UK as it is so expensive ...  they have already cost me £8 transaction fee on my credit card.  So if anyone from Baymont Inn & Suites Denver Airport would like to send me  contact email address I would be happy to email you.Also had issues with the shuttle so ended up paying $34 for a cab.,2

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Close to airport.  Convenient shuttle.,"My children and I arrived at the airport very late at night so I chose a hotel with shuttle service.  They were quick to register us. The hotel was clean, the room was good and we had a great night’s sleep.  It was quieter than I expected (I assumed in the am I would hear lots of travelers in the hall) but I did not.  We slept in so we did not have breakfast.  I would stay again, especially if I had to be close to the airport for an early departure or arrival.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"A pretty basic accommodation, convenient to DIA","As noted by other reviewers, this was a basic room that did not offer a mini fridge nor microwave. By far had the largest Samsung flatscreen I have ever seen in a hotel.My opinion of this hotel was that it is set up for the convenience of travels coming and going through DEN, not a place where you'd want to basecamp on an extended stay.Check in was fast and easy. Bedding and towels were fresh, room acceptably clean. Early 3:30 a.m. shuttle to DIA was on time. My flight on Frontier was out of the east terminal and apparently this contractor only drops off at east side; requiring travelers using the west terminal to go up to level 6 and cross over to get to the ticket/bag drop counters. Some on my shuttle were very unhappy to learn about that. I've never seen a shuttle company do that before.Not sure if all of the rooms are equipped in this way, but while using my room key to operate the climate control, the (bright fluorescent) light above the sink remained on making it difficult to sleep. There is no separate control to turn off the light so in order to achieve a dark room I discovered I had to pull the card out of the slot. Not a great design unless the hotel does that to encourage guests not to use the temp control feature.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Black Water from Sink!,"Horrible stay. Young and rude staff (Zachary) told us that the and thick black water pouring out from the faucet was normal!. With an infant in our room, this was not safe as we could not brush our teeth, shower or make baby bottles. Property was understaffed during evening hours. This is not a 4-Star or even 3-Star property - Do not recommend this property. There are many properties in the area - pick another!",1

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Location, Location, Location!","We spent a night here before flying home from a vacation and were pleasantly surprised at the accommodations. I had read other reviews of this location and almost cancelled our reservation because of them, but we are so glad we didn't.  Check in was fast and easy with Tony behind the desk taking care of everything, including making reservations for our morning complimentary shuttle to the airport. Our room was on the third floor adjacent to the elevators but we never heard a peep, thanks to the quiet voice announcement in the cars instead of the usual mechanical bell sound.  Our room was a single king with all the usual toiletries and ample towels, along with a scenic view of the rooftop air conditioners. True to other comments, our room was not equipped with a refrigerator or microwave, which was a concern due to my reliance on refrigeration for eye drops. Thankfully, the desk was more than happy to label my medication and freezer gel-pack which were promptly returned to me the next morning when we checked out. The bed and pillows were clean and comfortable (although the pillows are admittedly a bit on the small side), and we were impressed by probably the largest television we've ever seen in a normal hotel room at way more than 40"".  Many other reviewers have made note of issues with the climate control/room key combination, but we had no problems. The room card is inserted in the slot just inside the door near the light switch, which activates the thermostat. The only negative is that a single traveler would be forced to remove the room key when they departed for a meal or errand, meaning the A/C is shut down the entire duration of their absence. We solved that by letting the room cool first, then shutting the room darkening drapes all the way, preventing the mid-July sun from reheating the room. Morning checkout was equally as fast as check-in, and our shuttle arrived exactly on time, delivering us to the drop off point outside of baggage claim at the nearby Denver airport. It was obvious to both my wife and I that this location (along with the other dozen or so in the concrete canyon of hotels on the same street) is squarely aimed at the business traveler or family who are spending the night before flying out the next day or who are only in town for a couple of days.  It was a good and relatively inexpensive choice for our brief stay, but I recommend looking for another option if you're needing a ""base camp"" for an extended visit.  I knocked a star off for the lack of appliances and the goofy climate control system, but the the modest price we paid for a one night stay, we feel we certainly got our money's worth.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Served our needs perfectly,"Would not hesitate to stay here again.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient to the airport,"We stayed one night at the Baymont by Wyndham before flying home the next day.  Our room was an average hotel room - clean, quiet with two comfortable queen beds.  There were no outlets next to the beds to charge a cell phone.  I had scrambled eggs and sausage for the complementary breakfast and they were good and hot.  The only issue we encountered was with the free hotel shuttle service to the airport.  It is run by the airport and not the hotel but arrangements are made by the hotels.  We had arranged with the front desk for shuttle pick-up to take us to the airport at 7:48 a.m. for a 10:10 a.m. flight.  The 7:28 shuttle didn't show and neither did the 7:48 shuttle.  Rumor had it that there was a bad accident somewhere.  The front desk staff were in contact with the shuttle service and keep telling us it would arrive in 10 or 15 minutes.  Amazingly, there were three empty hotel shuttle buses in the driveway out front and across the street.  We made our own arrangements with Uber at 8:20 a.m.  The Uber driver was coming from somewhere in the vicinity of I-70 and arrived in 9 minutes.  The Baymont staff should have suggested that we make our own arrangements sooner instead of letting us wait 35 minutes.",3

Despite a mix up in the booking, the hotel said they hadn’t had it, although they’d sent us an email to say we had a booking, all worked well in the end and they found us a room. Delightful and very helpful reception staff. Room was large and comfortable. Breakfast was usual hotel fare. Would recommend.",4

Baymont by Wyndham is the best. I would book hotel chain again on my next trip. From answering the phone inquiry to requesting more towels for pool swimming, the staff response and their service are prompt and courteous. If I would be extremely picky, I could have pointed out the water in the swimming pool is not afresh , or the continental breakfast room is small; or my room key cards lost their function due to their proximity with my cell phone. But these are minor issues comparing to my sleep, air conditioning inside the room, shower in the room, bed comfort, the cleanness of the room.  My trip is exhausting one. I’ve no time to mind small things. What I need is sleep well, eat well, feeling comfort inside room and cleanness around me. This is what it gives me.",4

The shuttle service  (which serves several hotels in the vicinity) did not take long to arrive. The check-in was fast. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, and I love the bath amenities. The only negative would be that there was dust on a lamp and the shower could use more pressure.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice to Catch a Flight,"BAYMONT INN AND SUITES AT DENVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTThe hallmark of a great hotel is cleanliness. Here they pay attention to that detail. The room was the perfect size with two queen beds, super clean and efficiently compact. What more do you need when you’re spending a quick night and catching an early flight. They provide a cheap daily parking ($5) per day as well as shuttle service to and from DIA. Coffee was provided even for late arrivals and, while we were departing too early to partake of the breakfast bar, the area looked clean with a potentially good spread. I hung out in the lovely, simple pool area by myself enjoying the quiet and free ambience at night. I really liked this hotel. It was clean, clean, clean. The staff were very polite and helpful. I will definitely return. Tip: when catching a flight and shuttle to DIA, leave earlier than want to. The shuttle service is shared between hotels and getting to the airport takes longer than I thought and one needs to take security into consideration.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Disappointment,"I didn’t expect it to be amazing.  The price was less than a few other hotels, and it offered a free shuttle to the airport.  We had an overnight layover- so all we needed was a place to sleep.  Turns out they share the shuttle service with a few other hotels and it comes to the airport twice during a 60 minute period. Of course we had just missed one, so we waited at least 20 minutes.  The front desk person was not friendly.  We reserved a shuttle time the next morning, and half of our party was waiting in the lobby, while the rest of us were coming down the elevator.  The front desk person, nor the shuttle driver asked if our party was ready to board the shuttle.  They just left. Had to pay for an Uber XL to get to the airport instead.  Should have paid more for a better hotel I guess.",2

My stay at the Baymont was very pleasant and comfortable.  I was flying my 85-year old mother into DIA so I used the shuttle service to take me to the airport to meet her and back again.  Her flight was delayed and didn't arrive until after 11 PM, but the shuttle service was great and the front desk was extremely helpful.  We didn't have to wait long at all for a return shuttle.  The beds were very comfortable and for being such a busy hotel was very quiet.  Even my mother commented on that.  My grandsons used the pool and had a great time.  I read a lot of reviews before booking and took the negative reviews with a ""grain of salt"".  I'd stay at the Baymont again.

Our king-bed room was spacious; the bed was comfortable.  The bathroom vanity and toilet/shower room were separated.  Heating was comfortable, quiet and efficient.  With all the pressures and inconvenience brought by the terrible blizzard outside, the Baymont staff remained courteous and helpful to guests, including those who were unable to get into this full Baymont as they suggested areas to search for rooms elsewhere.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Shuttle Issues,We chose this hotel beciause they have the airport shuttle.  We checked in late and requested the shuttle the times we needed were already booked because they share the shuttle with other hotels.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Bathroom smelled like urine,"We aren't disabled, but because of the weather conditions in Denver, were placed in a handicapped room.

The weather conditions shut down DIA, and lots of people were looking for a place to stay.  The problem we ran into was the bathroom reeked of urine.  It wasn't just a slight smell, it was awful.  In the hotel's defense, we didn't say anything at the time because the hotel employees were bombarded with people trying to find a place to stay.  Overall, the staff was great and the hotel, itself, was just what we expected considering the price, however, the bathroom smell was sub-par.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great value for affordable price,"Hotel was near the airport with free shuttle from denver airport.  We barely had to wait for the shuttle and when we arrived at the hotel, the check-in was easy (we had a reservation) and the desk clerk was friendly and helpful.  She recommended a nearby place to eat, but I wish she would have told us that she included discount cards for that eatery in the folder with our key.  I did not look at the enclosed materials until after we returned from the nearby Holiday Inn where there was a bar and grill.  We ate dinner there and would have used the discount card, had we known it was included with our check in stuff.  The room was quite nice, and was clean.  Breakfast was fine...had the usual waffle iron, toasters, cold cereal and scrambled eggs, coffee, fruit and juice.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Begining of a wonderful trip started at the Baymont,Everything went smoothly starting our vacation at the Baymont. Front desk staff were very helpful and the shuttle service for a handicapped guy was was some of the best I have had anywhere. Thanks guys and gals,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Avoid!,"Check in not the way it should have been, was charged on 2 different cards for room already paid for. Couldnt get to sleep till 2 am first night due to stomping upstairs even after called desk 3x also charged fee for incidentals for 4 days even though stay was only 3. My account was put into negative incurring extra charges by bank and leaving me in denver with 2 teens and no gas or food to get home. Employees, ie. ""Manager""Johnathan and girl that messed up charges as well as another employee (zachary) were very rude and showed absolutely no care or concern for the situation and acted like I had done something. I had not stayed at a Baymont since last summer when I had same experience as well as bed bugs at one near Detroit and I can promise you I never will again. And don't bother trying to resolve with GM they lie to hotels.com and Wyndham and take no responsibility for their mistakes nor do they offer any compensation for their screw ups inconveniencing you for 3 days. When staying 800+ miles from home this is NOT the place to stay if you want to feel at home away from home. Funny the other review was from same time frame as myself with same comments about employees, food for thought.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Location and Accomodations,"I thought the grounds, location, room and breakfast were all great.  I felt very comfortable staying there.  I will for sure be staying there again on my way back!  We enjoyed dinner at Ruby Tuesday which was within walking distance.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,This is a good place to stay,"Staff through out is top shelf. The rooms are really nice pillows are crap, over all very good.  At first I was a little thrown by the light and heat situation with the card, but once I got the hang of it I will say I love that what an effort at conservation.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Front Desk bad manners,"We got to the hotel after a late flight at 2 am with two little kids Even though we had paid for the room they were overbooked and said they were sending us to Econo Lodge I didn’t accept it and after a while arguing for a while a family was leaving and I am not sure how then she realized, oh yes she did have a room for us  Then after checking out, some glasses were on the counter and I ask the lady leaving, if they were hers. The one at the front desk told me in a very bad manner that they have been sitting there for a while and moved them back to were they were in a very unfriendly way.   I don’t understand how these people still have a job. It is unacceptable how they treat the customers",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Great Locale, Unhealthy Breakfast Choices."," Airport Transportation Great. Amber at front desk was incredibly good at checking in all by herself. Breakfast bar was standard carb loaded foods; but I couldn't eat the eggs from a carton & sausage patties. No non-wheat choices. Coffee barely drinkable. If you don't care about eating the standard foods, the location is great, near other restaurants & reliable airport transportation. Very friendly & helpful staff. ",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,I love Baymont Denver International Airport,"I have stayed here many times and have never been disappointed, Please bring back the bacon for breakfast or at least biscuits and gravy for us rednecks at heart   ;), One word of warning for everyone going to Los Angeles, stay away from the Baymont in Lawndale CA. you will be totally let down and disgusted.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Refuge in a Storm,I arrived in a snow storm with over 8 inches of accumulation in a few hours.  The staff were friendly and efficient with check-in.  Parking lot and all sidewalks were clear of snow by 5 am.  Well done!  I wish I could have stayed for the complimentary breakfast.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Nice airport spot, free shuttle is key","You’re not staying more than one night here but it’s a nice, clean, affordable little place about 15 minutes from DIA. They have a shuttle that runs from the airport (Terminal East, Door 505) every 20 minutes. Friendly staff, good breakfast, but the wi-fi wasn’t great. There is a dispensary about a 5 minute walk away called Natural Roots, if you’re into that sort of thing. They’re great, too.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Denver,"We were not able to use the bathtub, it had not plug to hold the water in, it was full of someone's hair. When we travel we like having a bath tub because I am afraid of falling in the shower. Your hotel did not provide a non slip mat to stand in the shower, that makes it unsafe. Small beds",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Newer building.  Great breakfast.  Clean Quiet Comfortable Room.,"This motel, for the money, provided an excellent experience.  Checkin and Checkout went quickly with a friendly smile.  The room seemed large, everything worked, and the bed provided a comfortable night's sleep.  Noise was very low and breakfast had a lot of good and healthy options.  This is my favorite airport motel in Denver now.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Pleasant Visit,"Clean, neat, friendly staff. Large TV with quite a few channels, many more than most other hotels. Beds were comfortable and clean and the heat wasn't one of those run all night making a lost of noise things. So, overall no complaints, was a pleasant stay!",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent for Overnight near the Airport,"Clean, easy to access, free shuttle to and from the airport, basic breakfast included, very good wifi, friendly and helpful front desk staff and competitive pricing. It is unlikely you can get much more at the places charging more.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean place to sleep near the airport,Stayed here when my flight got into Denver very late.  The room was clean and my reservation was processed smoothly.  We had a room with 2 double beds which was a bit cramped for 4 people but it was only a place to sleep and shower before getting on the road in the morning.  I would recommend for this type of stay.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Comfortable,"This hotel was good for the 2 nights we were there.  The front desk personnel were very nice and helpful. My sister and I shared a king size bed and anytime either of us moved or rolled over the mattress pad and fitted sheet would pop off at the top corners of the bed.  That was annoying and uncomfortable. The shuttle was prompt,  there when they said it would be there and the driver was very friendly and helpful.  I would stay again. There are no microwaves or fridges in the rooms. However,  we were able to use the microwave in the bfast area.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,average hotel,room size average. pool good sized. No spa. no USB plug ins to charge devices. No hot water on 2nd night of stay. Bathroom light not working either. Towels small and rough. Would stay again if no other options.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Hotel.. HUGE TV!!!,"We were only at Baymont one night, but the hotel was clean and close to the airport. There is a full breakfast in the morning, but it shuts down at 9. The hotel has a pool but we didn't get a chance to enjoy it. The room itself was a good size. The mattress was not horribly comfortable  though. My husband also swears it was only a full size bed in the room we had instead of two queens...he might have been right!The rooms sink was across from the actual bathroom, which may just be a personal pet peeve of mine... so, if you were brushing your teeth or washing yours hands you were essentially in the center of the room.The TV was HUGE, so my kids loved that! There is a shuttle that runs practically all day and night to and from the airport...which is really nice!Overall it's nice for a quick turn around trip, but might not check all the boxes if you were looking for other thrills!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Stay at hotel,"Location is very close to the airport. Room was clean. Service very good. Nice safe area of town. Breakfast is the usual items, not bad and good orange juice! For some reason in most hotels the orange juice is sour, theirs was not. Did run low on hot water but I was showering after peak time. Like the 12:00 check out time.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Horrific experience with Baymont Fly & Park service,"I returned to DIA today, anxious to pick up my vehicle at the Baymont Hotel and get on the road.  I called the Baymont desk at 9:52 a.m. to get the shuttle pick-up location.  I was told to look for a ""Western Shuttle"" on Island #3.  Check.  A Western Shuttle pulled up a few minutes after I got to Island 3.  The driver said she didn't go to the Baymont on her route, and that I should take the next shuttle after hers.  A second Western Shuttle pulled up about 30 minutes later.  This one said ""Baymont"" on the side.  The driver said that he didn't go to the Baymont on his route, even though the side of his shuttle said ""Baymont"".  He called the Western Shuttle dispatcher, who said that another shuttle would be along in 5 minutes.  At 10:42 a.m., after waiting about 20 minutes for the shuttle that was due 15 minutes earlier, I called the Baymont desk again to see if I could get help from them.  The clerk patched me through to the Western Shuttle dispatcher, who told me that he had a vehicle out of service, and that the shuttle I needed would arrive in about 10 minutes.  As I was objectively reviewing the dispatcher's job performance for him on the phone (no cursing, just direct feedback), another Western Shuttle pulled up.  The driver said that he didn't go to the Baymont on his route.  I asked the dispatcher to give the shuttle driver instructions to take me to the Baymont.  He refused.  I hung up and considered my options.  At 10:50 a.m., a Microtel shuttle pulled up.  As the Microtel shuttle pulled away, I hailed the driver and explained my need for a ride to the Baymont.  He obliged me and told me that he rescues people waiting for the Western Shuttle to the Baymont all the time.  I got to the Baymont at 11:00 a.m., one hour and 8 minutes after first calling to get the shuttle pick-up location.  A corner near the Baymont is a marshaling area for Western Shuttle vans.  There were at least 5 vans there when I got to the Baymont, calling into question the validity of the excuse that I was given by the Western Shuttle dispatcher.I stopped at the Baymont desk to provide details of my shuttle experience and to request a refund of the $25 I had been charged for Baymont Fly & Park.  The manager on duty, Angie, not being particularly interested in securing any of my future business, refused to refund more than $15.Never again.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very satisfied customer/owner,"I was returning home to the east coast with a layover in Denver.  My flight was a very late afternoon flight out and the hotel was gracious enough to allow a late checkout and noted what time I would need the shuttle back to the airport.  Very good service, quality and location.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,You get what you paid for.,"Sheets looked and felt dirty, no shampoo in the bathroom.  Customer service doesn’t honor promises.  We were promised a rollaway for my mother in law at the time of reservation.  When we got there they tried to tell us we didn’t talk to anyone and made our reservation online.  This was not true.  Because of their refusal to put rollaway we were forced to upgrade to suite, only then they put in rollaway.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Cold night in hell,We have stayed many times in a Wyndham property.  Quality is most always there.  Last night we got to our room and the tv remote would not work.  It was missing its back so the batteries would fall out.  No way to adjust the tv.  It was late so we went to sleep.  When we woke up on the middle of the night our room was freezing.  No heat!  It was zero outside.  We were leaving at 6 a/m so we just added more clothing. When we went to take a shower we only had one towel in our room!  I reported this as we checked out and all I got was a “ok I will let the manager know” Any one of these items alone would be acceptable to us but all three in the same night is unacceptable.  We had three rooms rented for our family. The bad room was number 235.  I would not recommend this hotel as other choices are within a block.,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,9 out of 10/Very Close to Airport,"Hotel was clean,  room was clean,  furnishings new. Great customer service at front desk, nice breakfast with hot foods, fruit, pastries,etc.  It's just 10 minutes to the airport.  I would give this hotel a 10...except there was a body hair on the bottom sheet, which made me question if the sheets had been laundered between guests.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great hotel and good price,This hotel was perfect. It was stylish and smart. The free breakfast was very good and the complimentary wine and snacks in the evening was a nice touch. The staff was kind and generous in their willingness to help. I really enjoyed my 3 night stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient for rental car drop off,"We picked this hotel for it being convenient for airport, on check in found the male receptionist not the most pleasant. Room and bathroom were clean, our main problem was the heating/air conditioning not working properly, although we turned it off when going to bed, it decided to come on in the middle of the night by itself!!! The internet was unreliable and slow when it did work. Standard hotel breakfast, with quite small room for size of hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great place,"After a long day on the road i checked into this hotel. The front desk was most courteous  and helpful. The checked me in early and gave me directions of places to see on my short stay. The room was clean and so comfortable. It was just what i needed. They had coffee, tea and cookies in the afternoon  and a hot breakfast the next morning.  The 24 hour shuttle  they run was a big bonus  for i had to leave early.  It was quiet to sleep well. Free wifi, nice tv and if you forget hygiene  items they help  with that. I will definitely  stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A Pleasant Good-bye to Vacation,"We stayed here the last night of our vacation before leaving Denver. We could not have ask for more pleasant staff and kindness’s.   We were able to return our car night before to save some sleep time, were shuttered back that evening, and back to the airport the next morning.  Very nice breakfast and very nice accommodations.Would recommend this for anyone’s beginning or up up and away. Give them a try 👍",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Shockingly Quiet,"This is a clean, really quiet hotel near the Denver Airport. They have a free hotel shuttle that you can make reservations for to make sure you can get from the hotel to the airport exactly when you want too (one time was full when we were there). The rooms are average size & clean with a good pool available.Tip: Extended Parking is $5/day so if you have a long trip with an early morning flight go stay at the hotel & leave your car there while gone!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Return Visit,"Last time we arrived at Denver 3 years ago we stayed here and were absolutely delighted and gave it 5 ""blobs"".  This year, we returned to Denver Airport and again stayed here for 1 night on arrival.  The room was equally good, clean and comfortable and we were happy with our one night stay and the breakfast,So why 4 instead of 5.  Well, we did feel that reception was a bit offhand on arrival and did not seriously try to meet a specific request; the breakfast staff were not smiling and welcoming but just ""doing their job"" (efficiently and effectively though I would add); and  regardless of exchange rate variations, we did not feel that the value for money, although reasonable, was as good as before.I would emphasise that all things are relative and we still felt we had a good hotel for a good night's stay.  Just very good, rather than excellent!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Unremarkable but perfectly okay,"This hotel is located a few miles from the airport, but there is a shuttle service.There is in fact a cluster of comparable hotels located near each other.The Baymont does not have a restaurant but there a two or three choices in adjacent hotels, for example the Holiday Inn.Room was large, quiet and clean, bed was comfortable, front desk efficient.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good value near the airport,"I had picked the Baymont because of it's proximity to the airport and the affordable rate I found online. It was my last overnight stay in the US before flying out of DEN the next day. The hotel is located in a nowhereland inbetween the city of Aurora and the airport. There are just hotels, gas-stations, a few restaurants and plenty of vacant lots. So this is not a place from where to go sightseeing. The Baymont itself is new, modern, with all the amenities of a business hotel. My room was of good size...also modern and clean. Staff were friendly, breakfast was fully satisfying. I enjoyed my stay, even though -in my opinion- there was nothing that would make the Baymont stand out from other hotels.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good airport hotel,This hotel was perfect for our needs. We got in late at night and left after breakfast in the morning. The room was clean and very spacious. Breakfast was the regular fare. There are MANY hotels in this area. I got the best rate at this one when I was making reservations. It seemed to be a popular hotel for airport travelers.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Well this was mixed feelings,"I have stayed her many times with no problems I spent a week then traveled around and can back to spend one last night before flying home.  Was please on the first week except they stop breakfast at 9 on the weekends which seems really early and was running out of food by 8:30 so big disappoint there.  Our one night stay was not what I ever excepted or experience at this Baymont, we had a 2 room suite and neither room had a tv remote, tried to make coffee and the coffee maker was broke, then went in bathroom and hair dryer was missing, but that was not the worse, had a bite on my shoulder and when I go home and went to the Dr found out it was bed bugs, so I would stay away from suite #201",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good standard service and accomodations,"This is a good and basic accommodation. In my case, it was a one night stay when en route back home to Texas. Room was clean, quiet hall, filling breakfast and the shuttle from and to the airport was very appreciated. Plenty of places to have dinner within walking distance (my recommendation is the nearby Holiday Inn restaurant where the dinner choices were very good).",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great stop for DIA travel!,We love to stay at Baymont the night before flying out of DIA and staying after our return flights. I really takes the strain off of traveling by allowing us to sneak in some quality relaxing in this very comfortable Hotel. I love the breakfast. I would even stay there to just get away. :),5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Standard airport hotel,"Stayed here for a night. Nothing too extraordinary - just your average airport hotel, and the shuttle picked up/drop off from the airport in time. The only downside for me was the lack of comfortable pillows.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice place. Got exactly what I expected. ,"It’s not fancy. It was clean and well maintained. The rooms were typical. The beds were full size so if you’re sharing that makes it a little more cozy. Based on what I paid for the hotel, I got exactly what I expected.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very Nice Hotel with an Excellent Staff,"The Baymont by Wyndham is located near the Denver Airport and is a very nice hotel.

This will be a definite repeat when I return to Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Just OK,"Stayed one night before an early flight out. Internet was unreliable and weird small lumpy pillows. However, it had a nice shuttle to airport and they only charge $5/day to leave your car parked there. ",4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Third visit,We love this hotel. It has a great rate and comes with a nice breakfast. Always there to assist with whatever you need from a ride to the airport to printing out boarding passes. Very clean which is a must for me.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good an clean Airport Hotel,Everyone was very friendly. Poolarea was nice. Free WiFi. Rooms big and clean. Airport Shuttle worked great. Driver was a blast. Next time I have to fly out from Denver I will stay there again for sure.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Incredible service from everyone!,"We recently stayed over just one night due to a connecting flight. We got in super late (midnight) and the shuttle that serves a bunch of the hotels in the area was pretty full. We had to wait for the second one, but it was only five minutes. At check in we asked for a late check out and got it! They were so nice! Our flight was then delayed and they let us stay till 3:00 just so we would not be doing nothing at the airport. Everyone we spoke to was kind and helpful.",5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Late night check-in,"We stayed here after a late evening arrival from UK. Ideally located near the airport. Clean bed and value for money. Complimentary breakfast is simple, but the fresh coffee was welcomed. Not a lot more can be said.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Few Flaws need work overall positive,The smell of the hotel was refreshing and clean. The room was clean and large however the pillow cover had stains on it. Our plane left earlySo we had to leave the hotel at 330 am and we were not offered breakfast as promised. We didn’t get to try any of the facilities due to our time arriving and leaving however everything looked nice. We are a Wyndham reward member so we used points that made room less than 95 a night. Bed was comfortable and we slept well. Would recommend.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice hotel,We stayed here on our way back to the airport.  Clean rooms and comfy beds.  Shuttle was awesome.  Pool was a little cold and I was hoping for more exercise equipment.   Good breakfast was a little crowded but would def recommend it.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Disappointing; Won't Be Back,"My wife checked in before me, and the front desk gave me the key for the wrong room - midnight surprise! Our room was large, but not very clean. We could hear footsteps from the floor above (wood, not concrete). The light above the sink did not work. Not very friendly at the front desk. With so many other hotels at DIA, I'll go somewhere else next time.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Room ok,We had no problems checking in.  The front desk staff was very nice and helpful.  The room was clean.  Beds weren't the most comfortable.  Mattresses were very creeky and would make noise at the slightest movement - tending to keep us awake - otherwise would have been a great stay.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Above and beyond customer service ,"We “got stuck” in Denver because our flight was cancelled. Grumpy, we found the only room we could near the airport. From the start the front desk was very accommodating and offered us a late check out of 2:00pm since our new flight didn’t leave until evening.Unexpectedly, my boyfriend got extremely ill around check out time.  We ended up needing to call an ambulance and the manager Marisa, stayed with us the entire time, communicated with them and when we eventually returned that evening she didn’t charge us for the room.  I would definitely return but hope the trip is less eventful",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Worst hotel I've stayed in ,"I've spent many nights in middle range priced hotels. It's not as if I expect to stay in the lap of luxury. However this hotel failed to meet even the most basic standards I expect. The beds were absolutely awful. Huge lumps in the middle, I woke up in horrible pain after minimal sleep. The air conditioning barely functioned leaving the room hot and uncomfortable. Needless to say I wouldn't even put my dog up here for the night, let alone my family.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Don't always Believe what seen on internet.,"The staff is very nice.  The breakfast is cold and watery eggs.

The bed and pillows were comfortable and helped provide a much needed rest. ",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Rocky mountain high score,"Flew into Denver to attend a Ryan Adams concert at the Red Rocks Amphitheater, chose this hotel as part of a package deal from Expedia. The Baymont provides free shuttle to and from Denver International which was a bonus. Arrived a little early and couldn't check in so we walked over to Ruby Tuesday and had lunch. Went back to check in and all went fantastic from that moment. Ground floor room proved to be beneficial providing quick and easy access to wonderful free hot buffet breakfast. The room was perfect, very comfortable beds great amenities, very attentive staff, we were overall extremely pleased at only 120.00 per night. ",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very Rude Staff & Hotel Misbooked the Date of PrepaidReservation,"We arrived for a one night stay at approximately 10 PM. When I gave my information to the front desk clerk they said they could not.fond my name in the system. Then they said it was booked last name first first name last. When they did find the reservation they claimed it was for July 12 instead of July 11. Before I could offer any input, the clerk, whom was likely also the evening manager -judging from her uniform , told me that they were fully booked anyway and that there was nothing she could do and that we were going to have to find other accommodations. Before I could even say anything else she told me I would have to go back to the online company that I booked the reservation with for a refund because they had no rooms available.

Shuttle was overfull even after reservations were required. Picking up from other hotel properties prior to Baymont filled the van. No one checked names for reservation. Breakfast was good. Simple choices for food. Hard boiled eggs would be a nice addition. We needed a fridge in the room and did not have one.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Stay,This was just a very short overnight stay because we had an early morning flight but everything was very satisfactory. The room was great and the shuttle to the airport was timely.  I was also impressed with the parking price for us to leave our car there it was extremely affordable.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good Staging Hotel Before A Flight,"Stayed here before a flight in May. Have stayed at several hotels in the area in the past. This Tower Road area hotel is one of the better ones. They allow inexpensive parking on the premises after you leave. A nice feature. Dependable AP shuttles and plenty of eateries nearby. Good, friendly staff and a garden variety breakfast.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Close to airport,"We stayed 2 separate nights.  The first night we arrived by hotel shuttle.  Very satisfied with the shuttle. The front desk clerk did her job to the minimum only.  The room was clean. No wash cloths, had to go to the front desk and ask for it.  We couldn't figure out how to turn off light over the sink. Called the front desk, she said ""I don't know"". I'll call someone and call you back.  No call back received.  We slept with the light on all night with our pillow partially blocking the light.  Not happy. Pillows are short. Bed is hard.  Next morning had a so-so breakfast.  Toast, scrambled egg (yuck), bacon, orange.  I saw the maintenance man and he came up to the room and showed us the button to push beside the card we had to insert in wall to turn on the electricity in the room.  We checked out and told front desk lady our troubles.  She was very nice and apologized and said she would tell manager.  After a few days we stayed there again on the way home.  Front desk was friendly and helpful. Room was clean. Had washcloths this time but only 1 hand towel. Shuttle left at 3:55 a.m. on time for airport.  Very good stay the second time.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Steer Clear if You want value for your dollar.,On a scale of 1-5 I put this hotel experience at a 3.  There are other hotels in this area and they probably receive similar volume.  I have not yet had a similar experience in room cleanliness.  Some quality assurance is in order.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Budget Accommodations,"Great hotel near the airport with shuttle service. Very quiet and clean. We've stayed here several times and it works fine for our needs. There is no evening restaurant, however the breakfast selection is very good.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Close to the Airport and Rental Car returns,We were less than 10 minutes from the Enterprise Car Rental station that served the airport.  The shuttle then took us to the airport and that was about 10 more minutes as they stop for each airline along the route.  A fairly trouble free drive to all the car rental returns as they all share the same section near the airport.  There are many places to eat that are within walking distance.  The motel seemed to be very new and extremely clean.  The only issue we experienced was those walking around repeatedly above us at 2:30 in the morning that woke us from our sleep (both of us).  We did not eat breakfast as the doors do not open until 6am.  This should be changed to 5am for those with early flights out of Denver. We ended up eating at the McDonalds at the airport.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Special thanks to the staff,"During a recent stay at the hotel, we were told that they did not have or reservation (made via AAA).  After searching, the front desk staff found that the reservation was made for the following night.  It was already paid for which was obviously aprovlem, but he went in the back to talk with the manager.  When he came back, he said everything was fine and they changed my reservation (no charge).  The hotel has other nice amenities.  It is really close to the airport, has a park and stay package (up to 14 days), and and a decent breakfast.The helpfulness of the staff was enjoy to merit a return stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Terrible Experience & NOT Recommended,"I stay an average of 110 nights in a Hotel every year & usually do not write bad reviews.  This one is a rare exception.  While the staff were pleasant, cordial & amiable, this hotel seriously needs help!  The AC/Heater was not working but they sent someone to fix it.  Then several lights in the room, including the door entrance did not work.  But the worst was this: I spotted some rats/mouse at the Lobby entrance while waiting for the airport shuttle.  The funny thing, it did not seem to bother the front-desk receptionist.  I was bewildered & appalled. PS: I have pictures to prove it.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Pretty decent hotel for the price,"The location of this hotel was very convenient from DIA - - only about a 15-minute shuttle ride.  You'll need to sign up to ride the shuttle at the front desk if you are going to the airport.For the most part, the hotel/room was quiet until a family checked in and proceeded to scream, yell and laugh in the hallway and push the elevator button a million times at 100a.  :(Breakfast was OK - the eggs were runny and didn't seem to be cooked all the way through.  My only real complaint is everyone we came in contact with at the front desk looked like they just rolled out of bed. I think that it should be an employee's responsibility to adhere to the standards of dress and personal appearance when working in the customer service industry.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Highly Recommended Hotel,"It was very clean and comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful and nice at checkin, during the stay and at checkout. They went above & beyond to accommodate my preferences of a view upon checkin and late checkout to catch the shuttle. The free airport shuttle was awesome and helpful! I stayed for 3 nights. The beds were comfortable and clean. The TV was large and had good channels.  Very clean and comfortable room. I will definitely stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Terrible ,"Not a fan, will never spend my money there again. Tv did not work, the woman put me on hold twice for over 10min..... twice. At first she was very rude and not accommodating, asking if we wanted to have a discounted room or move. I felt as though I was bothering her. Never have I ever had this kind of experience at a hotel. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!;,, if",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A few disappointments....,"Stayed 1 night before heading to the airport and upon arrival there was a coke can cut up with burn marks on the bottom...drug takers on site? a large 3' long, thick bit of polystyrene in the car park too, right out front of the hotel...Not the best start. The room in general was nice and also clean. The only problem was there was no remote for the tv and when trying to make the tv work, the picture on all channels was fuzzy, so resorted to using my iphone instead. The bathroom light also didnt work and switched off 2 seconds after turning it on each time, so showered with the door open to be able to get some light in the bathroom. The breakfast was good (but I didnt personally use it) with a variety of breakfast foods, standard to what you get in most hotels who serve a continental breakfast. Over all, the room was clean but I was not impressed with the bad points as advised above.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Beware of Bedbugs!,"Regarding our 4/16/2018 reservation, we arrived at our room at 11:15pm, checked in and went to our room (237). We set down our bags, then I noticed something on the wall, at first I thought it was just a speck of something but looked closer and it was a bed bug. I took a tissue and grabbed it, looking at it in the light just to make sure. We grabbed all of our bags again and brought the bedbug in the tissue down to the front desk and told the girl working. She didn't seem to think it was that big of a deal. I gave her the tissue to look at the bug or at least for proof that we had found one and she grabbed it and threw it in the trash. I said, ""you might want to make sure I killed it before throwing it away"" and she said, ""I'll just take the trash out later."" We asked her if they'd ever had bed bugs before and she shrugged, saying 'I mean, yeah, it's a hotel.' She told us she'd change our room and comp our stay that night but we didn't want to stay there if there was a chance of us getting bedbugs. She didn't not apologize about the bed bugs until we were leaving and the extent of her apology was 'Sorry about that.'I realize that hotels can get bed bugs from time to time, but they are a big problem, speaking from experience, and they should be treated as such, especially when a guest finds a live one on their wall. It would have been different if she would have apologized right away and ensured us they would be acting on doing a treatment to rid the bed bugs. We still wouldn't have stayed, but we felt like she just brushed off the concern. We were very disappointed with how the situation was handled and are taking extra precautions to make sure we did not get any bedbugs from the night we stayed there on Saturday the 14th. Thankfully we stayed in a different floor and different side of the hotel so we are hopeful they were not in that room but we don't want to chance it. We will not be staying here again and have advised our friends and families to not stay here as well.To be fair, we had no issues with our room when we stayed on 04/14/2018. The rooms looked nice and clean, but to think that they might not be treating bed bugs seriously is concerning.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Midnight wakeup call,"We slept fairly well until the entire hotel got a midnight wakeup call. We had only a limited number of hours to sleep, so that set us back a bit. otherwise, the stay was as expected.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Place,"The hotel was nice and clean and very quiet. The shuttle to the airport was efficient, but there was a little mess up for getting the shuttle back to the hotel. A driver who was scheduled to be done for the day went out of her way to come pick us up which I truly appreciated after waiting for over 20 minutes.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,No sleep,"It seemed that there was a problem with the phone system in that every15 minutes the phone would ring once.  This started at about 1:00 AM.  So when your half asleep and you hear only one ring, you get startled and are not sure what that was so you try and get some sleep.  After the 5th time I unplugged both phones.  Problem was I had to be up at 4:30 to catch my early morning flight.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Standard American hotel - OK for one night,"Typical standard American hotel. Carpets all over (Sorry, but I just hate that).Decent bed, OK cleaning.Good service.Breakfast more than boring.That's it!If you need one night before flying out of Denver then this is OK.Btw: Not that cheap.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Overnight stay,"Nice newer stylish hotel near airport. Rooms are spacious, comfortable with nice neutral colors and decor.  Comfortable beds and bedding.  Typical breakfast items.  Used rewards points and pleased with my stay.  Shuttle was timely for pickup and drop off at airport.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Bay month stay,"Breakfast was a bust, waffle makers were not working and no juice either. Coffee was only barely warm. No donuts and only 5 bagels available even though we were the first ones to arrive for breakfast.  Waited an hour and still nothing added.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great place for airport access,We used this Baymont as a jumping off point for the Denver airport.  The proximity to the airport as well as the free shuttles to and from the airport at all time of the day or night made our trip much less stressful. The room was large and well appointed. The staff was helpful and courteous.  We would definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not great,"I have stayed at much better hotels. The staff was very helpful and polite. The room cleanliness was poor at best. The mattress was very hard, bathroom almost looked like it had not even been cleaned and we found other guests little reminders scattered about the room. The extended parking and airport shuttle were very good.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,I would NEVER stay there again,"When I arrived at the airport I called the hotel for a shuttle pickup.  They had an automatic voice mail to push 2 for airport pickup, which I did.  But the mailbox was full and would not take a request.  So I called the hotel back twice before I finally reached a person, who said she would send the shuttle.  After waiting for 1/2 hour I called back and she said she had no idea where the driver was and had no way to contact him.  I called again in 20 minutes but she still knew nothing so I ended up calling Uber for a ride.  Got to the hotel very late and tired.  Went to my room and hung the do not disturb sign on the door as I was to picked up the next morning at 11 so was going to sleep in.  At 8 the maids knocked on my door and I told them I was sleeping in and at 9 they knocked again.  This is not what I expect from any hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Stay,Nice place.  There is a lot of hotels by the airport and all looked nice.  Great option if looking for a place near the airport.,4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Close to the airport, but that's the only plus","We stayed here one night because we had an early flight the next morning out of Denver.

(yes I know there is ample coffee in the lobby, but some of us need wake up coffee before we are presentable to the public!)Rooms are smallOverpriced for the amenities",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Four days just 4,"We stayed in this hotel this past week and it was a nice hotel.  Originally I had booked it near the Airport because we where going to fly in but ended up driving instead.  One thing about Colorado is that everything is a 1/2 hour away.  The Hotel was clean and the staff was wonderful especially the House Keeping Lady Flor.  She was so friendly and so helpful.  I was really disappointed that the pool was closed and was not fixed until the day we where leaving.   The fitness room didn't have any weights , it only had 3 machines.  There is a place called Lifetime Fitness I would check out in Parker it has an insane gym get a 3 day pass or something ask for Snake when you go he does personnel training.  Overall I would recommend this hotel also it has a shuttle to the Airport",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,No customer service,Requested a wake up call I never got. If I had not set the alarm clock in the room I would have missed my flight. Someone in the room above me must have been doing aerobics all evening as the stomping around on the floor was constant for over an hour.,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Denver airport overnight place,"Needed to find a hotel on short notice as flight was delayed until the following day.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wunderbar,"Always have enjoyable time no frills, free hot eggs, bacon or sausage, waffles,fruit, pastries and yogurt breakfast saves money and time.

Fly and go parking save time and money. Compare to other hotels in the neighborhood. Transportation provided by “Westrrn Shuttle”times vary",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Convenient, clean, all the basics","The Baymont Inn is a convenient stop for either coming or going from the Denver airport. Nothing extravagant, just the basics. Nice to have a good complementary breakfast also. Our stays were quiet, considering the volume of people staying there. The airport shuttle is the primary reason we chose Baymont, along with their prices.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Comfortable and clean,We had an early flight the next day so wanted to be close to DIA. We've never stayed at a Baymont Hotel before but chose this hotel based on other reviews and price. We got a room right behind the elevator so we were a little concerned about noise but didn't hear excessive noise from it. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was fine and is included in your stay. The girl at the front desk was competent but not the friendliest. The staff at breakfast and maids were all very nice and helpful. We would definitely stay again.,4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Chocolate Chip Cookies just before bed!!,Short overnight stay here before an early morning flight is just perfect for the price if you just need to sleep and catch the shuttle. Clean & modern and meets your basic needs. The bed and the pillows were comfy - the small square pillows are alarming at first until you realize they shake out to standard size! Loved the chocolate chip cookies at check in.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good Hotel,"I will not say this is an exceptional hotel, but I will say it was definitely a very good price for what we needed.

It is easy to get to from the airport and rental car lots, and is also close to the freeway and a short distance to Downtown.  Great local eateries nearby as well as grocery stores.  The wildlife preserve is close by which made for some fun trips as well.  The staff at the hotel was very friendly, the hotel was clean and quiet, parking is free, and the rooms have adequate space.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Untitled,"WhenI check into an airport hotel it is usually because a. inclement weather before or after a flight prompts a stay near the airport or b. departure time is early and we do not have to get up as early to drive the 60 miles to DIA.Ratings are below. No complaints. Attitude of staff was fine. Snow overnight in early hours of 1/21/18 may have been a factor in the breakfast not being set up on time- about 15 minutes late. It is a lot of work for 1 team member. Guests including myself began serving ourselves before the attendant officially opened the door, so no big deal. Those with earlier flights wee not delayed by this.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wonderful Stay,"Our trip was last minute to visit my in laws and this hotel was closest to their home. We landed earlier than expected so I took s chance and stopped to see if we could check in early and the woman at the front desk was so sweet and absolutely amazing.

Beds were comfy too!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great night manager!,"The hotel was in a good location to get to the airport. The room was average, but the bed was a bit hard.

Approximately half the price, and no endorsement from a franchise, would have been more responsible. It's been a very long time since I stayed a property like this. I was deceived positive reviews. The shuttle service reminded me of a trip to Mexico; not the driving or the driver, both of them were good. The bus hadn't been cleaned in many, many years...rickety and old.",1

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Expensive Mediocrity,"Baymont at DIA is a mediocre, over priced hotel.  Very spartan rooms, with minimal appointments and a fair breakfast.  Overpriced, but that goes with the territory, i.e. close to the airport and no transportation.  Details: one of the bed stand lights was out and the coffee maker did not work.  Funny the cleaning personnel didn't even bother to check the coffee pot, it was full of water.  Best thing: a comfortable bed.",3

I wasn't given any knowledge of the hotel or where to go or what they had to offer. My request for extra pillows or towels was not granted upon my arrival. Staff wasn't in uniform but in street clothes. Something that I am not used too seeing. Breakfast was good, but need more of a variety. Breakfast attendant wasn't visible to ask questions. It was annoying that the television was on a timer and popped out while I was watching important news. Shuttle service was great. Overall, I would stay again. The room was very clean and it was very quiet the entire time.  The king size bed was very comfortable.

Other reviews indicated mgmt were addressing concerns- apparently it has worked so far. Breakfast was hot, as was the coffee, nice selection- waffles, eggs n sausage, breads and yogurts.. Shuttle timing was right on time. We Will stay at Baymont again for future trips.",5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Review of Baymont Inn & Suites,"The Baymont Inn & Suites was a nice motel, however, because it did not provide a mini-fridge nor microwave in the rooms, I would not stay here again. It did have a great breakfast.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Room very small,"My first impression of the 2 double beds room was how cramped it was. We were 2 mid size adults and 1 small child with 2 biggish luggage pieces. We literally could not all be moving around the room at once. The bathroom also small and the one serving coffee pot took up most of space on sink vanity top. I would not stay in room 208 more than one night. In fact, I will not stay at Baymont again.  Also very very noisy. Walls thin. Floor noise above us for our stay literally unbearable. I got 3 hours sleep.  Our bedding had such a bleach smell my eyes burned. And bed very hard. Pillows weird. All 3 towels thin.  The many reviews that mention the rude or curt front desk staff are very true.  Both AM and PM never smiled.   Not very welcoming. Although there was one staff lady taking…",2

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Needs some work,"Our stay was decent but I do have complaints. The walls are paper thin so we could hear the people next door all the time talking loudly and watching tv. The water pressure in the shower was terrible. It took forever to shower properly. The bed was not very comfortable. The mattress pad and fitted sheet never stayed in place and we'd always end up with a pile of sheets under us while we laid on a bare mattress. The pillows are square and lumpy. I woke up with a neck ache every day. We were missing a garbage bin the first day (we know this because there was one put there the next day). We were also missing a couple of towels (no big deal since there were 2 and only 2 of us, but we noticed after the second day there were more hung up). We had 2 shampoos and a conditioner but no lotion for a couple of days. We had to ask for some. The pool towels are teeny tiny and absorb absolutely nothing. The pool is heated and warm, but when you get out it's freezing due to all glass windows surrounding it. The bathroom in the pool area is freezing too when you're wet. Breakfast everyday was okay. The cereal was stale, the pancake mix was eh. The sausage and bacon were not good and sat in a ton of grease. The free shuttle bus service was great! Front desk staff could be a little friendlier (make eye contact, smile at least a little). Overall, I don't think it was worth what we paid, but it was a place to rest our legs at the end of the day.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very friendly and helpful staff!!,"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel,  it was a comfortable and friendly atmosphere and the location was great and has a shuttle service to the airport, a gym and pool too that we used.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Won't Stay Here Again,"Checked in for an overnight stay before flying out of Denver. Room was clean with all the amenities. My complaint...the smell. Granted I know Colorado has legalized marijuana and to each his own. Doesn't mean I want to smell it. As this is a non-smoking establishment, I assumed this was for marijuana as well as cigarettes. The marijuana smell was so overpowering in both our room and hallway that it was unbearable. My husband went to the front desk. Their response was they couldn't do anything about it. My response...you won't get my money again at any of your locations if you can't respect that not all your guests want to smell marijuana.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice for early morning fights,"We stayed at this hotel overnight to catch an early morning flight to Mexico. We have stayed at many Baymont Inns & Suites and this one did not disappoint. Friendly and helpful staff, clean, large rooms and a comfortable bed. No restaurant on site however we found food at a grill inside the Holiday Inn Express just down the road. Nothing spectacular about this stay, but it was nice.",4

Very nice staff. The heat/AC unit was so loud you'd think an aircraft mistakenly landed outside the hotel. Around 3 am the unit went bonkers and started blowing cold air, on a 35 degrees F night. It could not be turned off at the thermostat or by any visible means. It went for about 1/2 hr then it shut off on its own. With decent HVAC, it would be a good value hotel.I",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Airport convenient,Very nice accomodations only 15 minutes from terminal.  Ideal for early morning departures.  Quality of the hotel was very good for the price paid.  Would seek out this hotel if I needed another room near DEN in the future.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great stay as always,"The hotel was great as always. The problem we encountered was with the shuttle service to the airport.  There was ice that morning and the driver did not clean off the step for people getting onto the shuttle.  One woman slipped as she was getting off.  He also did not ask which airlines and stopped at United (West Terminal) and unloaded all luggage without a word and for those of us needing the East Terminal, it was a long walk and we did it in spite of using a wheelchair to do that much walking.  He was totally not who you want for a shuttle driver!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Quick trip,I flew into Denver for a Business meeting and booked Baymont based on its reviews.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Worst front desk ever!!!,Checked in after a late flight. The Latino lady was rude and condescending.I asked her what floor my room was on and she said look at your number-wow. Had issues with the key you have to stick in the hole in the wall to get anything to turn on then off. Phones would not call the front desk. Used my cell phone and that woman would still not answer- took the card out of the wall since I had no help from her. Darn near froze to death as the key in the wall makes the heater/ac work -so I froze all night. The breakfast had no attendant in sight. I spoke with the morning front desk lady. She took the time to explain how the card works and was very nice. If they would get rid of the night front desk gal (she has bad attitude and is clearly racist) I would stay here again. If you like being treated like an idiot at check in this is the place for you. If not spend the money and do the embassy suites. Also the housekeeper was beating my door down at 8am to see if I was in there- had privacy placard displayed. Very limited English comprehension on her part. Even followed me to the elevator asking ‘you go?’ Yikes. Never again.,2

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Trying Hard,"The hotel resembles a large cruise ship with its huge atrium and rooms arranged around the perimeter and the buffet meals.  While comfortable, you probably wouldn't hang out there too long as it is a little tacky.  The rooms are enormous especially for an ""airport hotel"" with equally enormous bathrooms.  It appears to be trying hard to be a destination resort for folks flying in to DIA but for a brief overnight before or after a flight it's a little much.  Glad to have tried it, probably wouldn't go back.  Not a fan of breakfast buffets under any circumstances, though.",3

The lady up front said she needed a CC to hold the room, eve","They charged my CC which I was assured they wouldn't do. I had to go back and forth with the ladies there to get the charges reversed. The main lady there was extremely rude and acted like she didn't want to take the time to explain things to me. I would think after erroneously charging my card for $500 plus, there would be An explanation, but she was rude an acted like I was at fault!  Terrible customer service!  We have several trips coming up next month but I can't imagine ever dealing with her again!  Good luck!",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Mgmnt needs work,"Running a hotel is hard work and running an airport hotel is an extra challenge. From my perspective, the management of this hotel is not up to the task. We arrived at the same time as another guest in early evening, a popular check in time. The young woman behind the desk was courteous and efficient but it still took her almost 20 minutes to check us in. There were nonstop phone calls, several about their shuttle (see later), and computer issues. She was literally doing at least two jobs at once and there was no one to help.  The room itself was fine, a typical 2.5 star airport hotel room. Clean, decent bed, efficient bathroom, etc.  My experiences with staff in the three times that I have stayed here have always been very good but there is just a sense that they are running…",3

Free hot breakfast, washer and dryer, housekeeping does a great to good job, front desk and management are wonderful. Transportation by “Western Shuttle” vans are uptodate, they have larger buses if need for groups. Serval restaurants in the area, Walmart, King Super, restaurants and stores down the road. Uber and Lyft are good I use them when I need to shop. Light rail to downtown Denver is about 45 min walk or Uber it or park your. The hotel has fly and park check on rates  ",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Convenient, clean and close","I just stayed here one night with friends before an early airport departure.

It was also a more affordable option near the airport than some.",4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Perfect one night stay!,We arrived here at midnight after a trip into Denver Airport and a 10 minute drive.   We were greeted by a very friendly desk clerk who checked us in quickly.  The room was very clean with a comfortable bed and all the amenities needed.  We didn't a room with a view but ask for one if you need that.  The free breakfast had plenty of options including eggs and waffles.  We will definitely stay here again when flying in or out of Denver.,5

Everything was great except the Breakfast: the food was good, the problem was the way it was set up had guests going in circles instead of an even flow. I was not the only person saying this I would have to say it was the main complaint in the Breakfast Room.

If we needed anything else just contact the front desk. Great Staff and Great Service.,5

Parking was ample and the hotel was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was the usual bland and unappetizing hotel variety, but that is not why I choose a hotel, anyway.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Fine for Airport Departure,"Stayed on a Saturday night prior to our departure on Sunday. Check-in was fast and friendly. Room was quite large. Beds were comfortable. Our floor was very quiet.For the location and quality of the lodging, the price here is hard to beat.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great for an overnight stay.,"My wife and I stayed in the Bayford Inn & Suites Denver for one night after arriving tired from our flight from the UK. The hotel is very close to the airport and was very easy to find once we had picked up our hire car. The room was excellent but we had trouble operating the air conditioning unit (there seemed to be no off switch). Close to the hotel are three resturants. We chose 'Ruby Tuesday' and the salad bar had plenty of choice (one payment and go as many times as you like). Opt for one of the beverages with an endless supply (I chose iced tea) and it will be refilled until you decline the offered jug. The breakfast at the hotel was good. The hot fare being waffles, bacon and scrambled eggs.",5

The bed was very comfortable, check-in was quick, room was clean and breakfast was good too.  The only dissatisfaction was with the airport shuttle bus because it was late picking us up at the hotel and he dropped us off at Southwest counter when we were flying Delta and my husband is disabled and walks with a cane.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean hotel,"Stayed here for a mere 10 hours with my husband before an early morning flight.  Very few issues, room was clean, and bed was comfortable. However, soon after we checked in, the cable/satellite went out, which was disappointing and staff when alerted was unapologetic and said there was nothing they could do and it was raining.  There were several pillows, but I didn't find any of them to be comfortable.  The last issue we had was when trying to check out at the front desk in the early morning hours; it was several minutes before anyone came to the desk and there was no way to alert staff that someone was at the desk other than us calling out to no answer for a while.  However, the hotel was clean and close to the airport, and the hotel fit our needs for a short stay before an early flight.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,okish,shuttle was late all other hotels I saw two shuttles come in. Stayed in better for the $. Worst square pillows I have ever seen. I through them on the floor and just put my head on the mattress,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient to Airport,"We stay here every time we fly out of Denver.  Our room has always been clean, good shower and close to a couple of restaurants.  The shuttle service has been efficient, as well as the desk staff.  The breakfast area is small for the amount of clientele, but the breakfast has quite a few options. The rooms do not have a microwave or fridge.  There is a coffee maker.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Fine one night stand,"Before early flights and after late arriving ones, we almost always need an airport hotel, and this one is in the Tower Road area so a bit closer to the airport.  This means faster shuttle times and easy access to the road home.  The rooms are spacious with the usual furniture and fixtures.  There are still tub/shower combos which are great for those who like to take a bath instead of just a shower.  There is plenty of parking since this property is a bit off the main road.  Breakfast is the usual and very generous assortment of proteins, yogurts, cereals and breads.  There's no reason to go hungry in the morning here.  The front desk people are always very pleasant even with very late in the evening arrivals.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent property,"This is a very clean and comfortable property.  The bed, pillows and linens were high quality.  The facility was quiet and we had an overall great experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Mostly nice but some disappointments,The room was nice but I was disappointed that there was no mini-fridge and the only place to put our suitcases was on the floor.  One or two luggage stands would have been nice. There also was a power glitch during the night. Fortunately we woke up some time later and saw the clock on the radio flashing so we knew that we had to reset the clock and alarm.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean & nice facility,"This is a nice hotel, however, desk staff acted like we were bothering them when asking questions.  We had no vehicle so needed suggestions for dinner within walking distance.  He took us on a wild goose chase.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Smart Choice for DEN Access,Very convenient location to DEN and a variety of dining opportunities are nearby.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymount Inn by DIA,"I've stayed at Baymount Inn & Suites out by the Denver airport several times now.  Each time has been a great experience.  My rooms have been quiet, clean and comfy.  The staff members are friendly and efficient. My one suggestion would be to somehow arrange the tables in the breakfast area so that people aren't queued up waiting for their food.  Love the free breakfast though!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent hotel near airport,"We checked into this hotel late in the evening after a long flight. It's proximity to the airport is a real advantage, and it is easy to find and located in an area with relatively little traffic and with some really decent nearby restaurant options. Service and cleanliness met expectations.  My only complaint is that I twice ended up driving the wrong way on 1-way streets approaching the hotel because the street system in the area has center dividers with four exit lanes coming off of side streets but only one tiny lane to enter when turning off of the main road. The streets in the area should be marked with ""keep right"" signs at the end of center dividers. Fortunately, driving on the wrong side of the center divider was not a problem during the low-traffic times of the night.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not recommended!,This place do not have quality rooms.  It cost me two hundred dollars per night.  Not worth that much money at all.  I will never go back again. The rooms are small and smelled funny.  The staff were however helpful.  Breakfast was okay could be improved.  I do not recommend this place if you have other options.,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Denver Overnight,"The Baymont Inn and Suites was a very nice hotel for our overnight in Denver. We had to be up very early for our flight out, and this hotel was very close to the airport. Service was outstanding and the hotel was very quiet. The only thing I wish is that there would have been a mini frig in our room, but otherwise it was excellent.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,How very special,"One night stay, catching an early flight.  We had a great suite, the desk folks went above and beyond to recommend restaurant for dinner, making sure I had hot tea, etc.  wonderful service....best we enjoyed during 12 nights in different locales.  Would recount, in the future, we will look for Baymont Inns",5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Denver Airport Location,"Excellent location and Excellent staff... arrived with a welcome cookie, great breakfast in the morning and the beds were comfortable. Another bonus is that you are close but far enough away not to here the Airport flights. Quick in and out for travel!!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Excellent hotel, with free shuttle service to and from Denver Airport",Stayed at this location in order to catch an early morning flight.  Allowed us to check in 4 hours early (great as we had been on 15 day road trip).  Hotel was spotlessly clean - lobby as well as our room.  The desk clerk whose name was Gabby even printed our boarding passes for the next morning.  Early free breakfast was nice touch.  Shuttle pick up was at front door and right on time.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great night before early morning flight,Clean and comfortable.  Large room.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Poor Shuttle Service - Dusty Room,Shuttle service took an hour to get to airport.  All other hotels shuttles came and went several times.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,excellent for some rest after a long flight,"We arrived in the Baymont Inn & Suites Denver International Airport after 11 hours on a plane travelling through 8 time zones. So we were exhausted when we arrived and cleared immigration. Th hotel shuttle came within 10 minutes and after another ten minutes we arrived at the hotel. Check-inn was fast and efficient. The room (226) was large enough and clean. The beds were in excellent condition and after a long flight we slept very well. In the morning a small, but adequate breakfast was provided. The free WiFi was fast. After breakfast the airport shuttle took us back to the hotel were we rented a car. Check-out was fast again. Overall, this hotel is close to the airport and a good choice for a first night after a flight in or a last night before a flight out.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Perfect for what we needed,"We flew in late to Denver and were leaving early the next day to drive to New Mexico. I had booked somewhere cheaper, but after reading the reviews about that hotel, I decided to switch to the Baymont. I was traveling with small children and wanted to avoid any surprises. It was clean, the breakfast was fine, staff were helpful and friendly, and it was convenient for our needs.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A night in Denver,"We found the room to be very nice and quiet. Also included was a great breakfast the next morning, this meal was very good with a wide asst. of breakfast food. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the bathtub drain was slow to drain while showering and by the time you were done with your shower the water was ankle deep, also sink was the same way slow to drain. Problem was reported to staff the next morning and they jumped right on the problem and called maintenance to get it fixed.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Great hotel, 'isolated'location","A very good looking hotel, inside and out with very well furnished rooms. All the facilities you need are there with many additions. There is a small lobby with Tv as well as two fast PC and a printer free to use. Coffee machines are also available all day.There is a small gym and a very nice indoor pool.The breakfast was standard fare, but with enough variety for most people.The airport is only 20 minutes away and there is a FREE shuttle. Altogether then this represents very good value.AS for the location, the hotel is one of a dozen on a large rectangular plot, surrounded by what appears to be dry grassland on all sides. If you have transport then Denver downtown is not that far and other retail outlets about 4 miles away. However without a car there is no public transit available so you are pretty much confined to the hotel island. There are a choice of eateries nearby including a Ruby Tuesdays, which we enjoyed.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Unacceptable bed cleanliness,"Our  9/10/17 visit was disrupted around midnight with the discovery of bed bugs and several irratating bites.We were offered another room,that we used to shower,then spent the rest of the night in the lobby until our 5:05 am shuttle.Front desk was kind and apologized and waived our room fee.This experience has made us suspect of any hotel stay,regardless of corporate ownership.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good Airport Stay,"I needed to stay overnight close to Denver National Airport to catch an early morning flight.   Check in was easy, room  was clean, and a couple of restaurants are within walking distance. Great basic accommodations.   Needed to leave at 5:45 am. and the shuttle was right on time.  I can't comment on their breakfast, as I opted to eat at the airport.  I have read reviews of people complaining about the prices of the hotels in this area, but remember, you are paying to be close to the airport",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Could be better,"Good location, large room and bed but overnight stay was ruined by dreadful hard pillows and bath towel that was quite grey and felt slimy. After a very long international flight I really wanted a good nights sleep.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good place to stay,Very nice clean place to stay at a good price with friendly staff.  The only part of the stay that I would not rate excellent is that the pillows are not comfortable.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Quick overnight,"Made my reservation through wyndham rewards on phone. Was told park and fly was included with price. Got to motel only to find out that it wasn't. Only $35 more for parking. Okay, fine. Staff was courteous, room was clean, close to elevator. Was really very quiet, never heard a sound. Bed was comfortable. Did not care for the new style pillows Wyndham chains are using. Used the airport shuttle from hotel at 3:45 am. Part of the continental breakfast was already set up so there was availability of food before going to airport. Wyndham is working on the parking issue which was the only issue with the stay. I will go back if needing a place in the area again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Perfect for that first night after Trans Atlantic flight,"We had a long journey to get to Denver and just wanted to get into our room and sleep on arrival at 19:00.The Baymont was in a perfect location just 6 minutes from our Car Hire collection and ideally placed for our departure to Estes Park the next day.The rooms were clean , well equipped and the overall hotel suited us perfectly , check in was quick and efficient and the staff very helpful.We only stayed here 12 hours but awoke totally refreshed ready for our 3.5 week road trip",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Hotel ok, shuttle awful","We stayed here overnight to be close to the airport for a mid-morning flight.  The hotel is pretty basic.  Staff upon check-in were not friendly, nor were they very friendly the next morning.  The rooms were clean.  The beds were like rocks, so if you like a hard bed, this is the place for you.  Temperature control in the room was a bit erratic.  Breakfast was a bit sub-par for what we've seen with most hotels and we travel quite a bit.  There wasn't much, and what was there was all off brand. There are a couple places to eat within walking distance.  The biggest complaint I had was the airport shuttle service.  Note that you do have to reserve it, so make sure you do that when you check in.  They only make one stop, so beware if you are on Southwest.  We were going on a cruise to Canad, so we had three larger bags and two carry ones.  They stopped near United airlines, so we had to lug everything not just upstairs but then across the airport to get to Southwest's check in.  Other hotels make two stops.  It was pretty frustrating.  There is a lot of building going on in that area so hopefully there will be more hotels and restaurants in the area soon.  I'm not sure I would stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont Inn Review at Denver Airport,This is a nice 2.5 star facility. The staff especially Angie was great. The breakfast was nice but the lack of variety for lunch and dinner close by was an issue. We ordered in both nights we stayed.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Surprise!,My husband visited Colorado 2 weeks ago for a family wedding. Our flight west was a late one so we decided not to rent a car at the airport. I checked Trip Advisor and Baymont Inn was well reviewed and much cheaper than others in the area so I booked it. We were pleasently surprised by the ease of check in and out and the cleanliness of the spacious room. The breakfast was fine and the shuttle picked us up as expected.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Overall a good hotel,It's a nice hotel for a short term stay near the airport.  Stayed for 3 days as all flights to Houston got cancelled.  Free airport shuttle.  Friendly front desk.  Small but new workout apparatus and a clean swimming pool.  The daily service is not very functional.  Many amenities like towels and coffees were not refilled.  Carpets were not vacuumed every day.  Breakfast food are not regularly refilled.  The free shuttle runs in 40 min. time interval and need to call if not during the rush hours.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Energy Managment System and TV Didn't work,"In order to use the lights and thermostat in my room, you needed a card inserted into the wall. ""Energy Management System"" is what they call it!!! The light over the sink in the room would not go out unless I removed the card. If I removed the card the thermostat wouldn't work and it was hot in the room. The remote for the TV didn't work, so the front desk provided a different one. This remote wouldn't control the volume and the volume buttons on the TV itself did not work!!!",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Last-minute Reservation,"When I was stranded at the Denver airport due to bad weather, I needed a hotel in a hurry. This hotel offered complimentary shuttle service, a fair price at such a late hour for a reservation, and thankfully, a room was available. The young woman who answered the phone and who helped me at check in was so welcoming and understanding. I would stay at the Baymont Inn & Suites again, even if I wasn't in such a difficult situation.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great place! Great value! Friendly staff  Clean place.,Have stayed several times at this location. Always top notch service. Reasonable price. Very clean place for the $$. Indoor Pool is nice. Well maintained grounds.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,August Stay at Baymont Inn,A comfortable stay as usual.  I have stayed at this Baymont Inn several times when I have been flying out of DIA.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Positive Place,The only issue was with the shuttle to and from the airport. The desk clerk didn't describe the bus and gave us the name which was very small and on the side hardly noticeable at the busy airport.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,My son and I stayed here and I messed up on my reservation...,My son and I stayed here and I messed up on my reservation but they accommodated me anyways and I loved it. It is a great hotel,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean and Comfortable With the Essentials,"The Baymont Inn & Suites is an airport hotel and just that. It is clean, comfortable, and quiet with the basic essentials. Free wifi and shuttle service to and from the airport are also provided along with a continental breakfast. An Italian restaurant and a Ruby Tuesday are a 5 minute walk away and are certainly accessible and convenient. It works well for this reviewer and if I were flying in and out of Denver, I'd probably include the Baymont Inn in my plans.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Basic but fine for short airport stay,"Opposite a few restaurants (across the street: Italian place and Ruby Tuesdays). Basic but decent no frills room (no fridge, no safe, small bathroom) with, however, a huge TV (bigger than most hotels). Comfortable beds. Wifi sucked. Breakfast (included) was basic and just ok. Airport shuttle (which serves several hotels) operated well, both on arrival and departure, it went direct to the airport (as it was the last stop before heading to the airport).",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Staff was friendly and rooms are clean.,This was convenient to the airport. We checked in and then used the shuttle to get to the rental car place in the morning.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent Stay,"We stayed here for an overnighter so we could be close to the rental car agencies and airport, and it was a great choice! The rooms were very well lit and clean! The staff was very friendly and inviting, lots of smiles all around.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice hotel nearby airport ,"Stayed one night at Baymont Inn while overnighting in Denver. Overall it was a very nice experience. Hotel was clean, rooms were very comfortable and clean with large LED TV, and location was very quiet. Self-serve buffet breakfast was surprisingly good with breakfast sausage, scrambled eggs, yogurt, make your own waffles, orange juice and coffee. Staff was friendly and helpful. The only negative was that our room was on second floor and we could hear heavy walking above us. I suspect inadequate insulation between floors. If we stayed again I would ask for 4th floor room so no one would be above us.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont Denver Airport,Overall excellent - only wish - put a couple of towel holders by the sink.  The only towel holders are in the bathroom - very inconvenient - very low cost to fix.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice newer place close to Airport,This hotel was a newer place! Do nice & clean. My only complaints would be that there wasn't a small fridge & the pillows weren't what I would like! Usually there are different ones to satisfy!  Probably fine for some! Thankfully I had my neck pillow to help me to be able to get some rest!,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great when I needed a place to stay near the airport,"So I had a last minute route change due to electrical storms in the West, and had to find a place to stay that evening. I need to get back to the airport early the next day so I chose the Baymont due to location and price. So people know, if you do not stay on the actual airport property, the next hotels are in this location, an 8 mile trip. We took the free shuttle that is offered, but had to wait about 25 minutes for it to show up. THe next morning, we opted to not use the shuttle since it seemed to come at 45 minute intervals. The cab ride back was in the low $20 range.The rooms themselves were quiet, clean and in a standard set-up. We arrived after midnight and checked out at 6am, and both were quick. Did not get a chance to try any of the other facilities.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean and friendly,Staff were very friendly and responsive.  I was able to check in and out quickly without problems.  It was so easy to print my boarding pass as there are direct links to the major airlines.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Would definitely stay again.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Clean, quiet, not smelly but no fridge","I was able to sleep in it was so quiet, though booked full and near the airpot. I did not like the pillows or the lack of a fridge or any free water (Denver is very, very dry so many hotels, even fancy ones, give comp. water bottles so guests can stay hydrated). The wi fi had good speed and the TV was big, flat, and had a decent number of channels to choose from. The staff was friendly and helpful. I didn't have a chance to use the pool area and slept right through breakfast.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Worst Customer Service ,"Let me start off by saying, if there were a scale of 0 - 10, with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best, I would definitely offer the Baymont Inn & Suite, Denver International Airport, in Denver, Colorado a ).  This hotel provided me with the worst customer service I have ever received from such a franchise! Upon arriving in Denver from a very late flight from Atlanta, GA, I never would have guessed checking into my hotel would be so difficult. The front desk receptionist, Griselda, stated that she could not find my confirmed booking reservation.  After showing her my confirmation, she still stated that she could not check me in because “she could not find it on her system”. I had to call my booking agency several times and request that they email the confirmation to her before she would accept my reservation that I showed her.  This process took a minimum of at least 30 minutes. Keep in mind, I traveled from Atlanta, Ga, where there is a 2 hour time difference from the current Denver time of 12:45 am. Also, keep in mind that I had an early morning flight of 9:00 am, Denver time, scheduled and had to be at the airport by 7:30 am. Finally, after receiving the information from the travel agency and checking me in, Griselda NEVER apologized for the inconvenience or her manner of speaking with me, a pre-paying customer.  She NEVER showed remorse or offered any type empathy on behalf of the hotel's confusion with my booking. When I told her that I would not be staying here again, her reply was, ""Ok, that's fine."" When I told her that her customer service was extremely disrespectful and distasteful, she laughed and said, ""oh well, that's your opinion."" I can understand a mix up in communication, but I cannot understand POOR customer service! I will NEVER be back. And I will recommend that others stay far away from this hotel, especially if Griselda is working and still a part of your organization. I also feel that I should receive a FULL refund and some sort of acknowledgement from someone/management who values customers and their money.  Griselda is a very POOR representation of what I expected from your establishment.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Okay hotel near airport,"We stayed at this hotel due to its proximity to the airport and the availability of a free shuttle. Our check-in was quick and simple, and there were no discrepancies between the price guaranteed online and what they had on record. Our room was simple yet satisfactory with a king-sized bed, chair, desk, and office chair. The sink was outside of the (small) bathroom, but this wasn't a big deal. The hotel was quiet during the night. The bed was somewhat hard and there appeared to be pink lipstick on the sheets which was easily wiped off with my fingers, but yucky just the same. The morning breakfast was your usual continental fare. There wasn't nearly enough seating in the breakfast area though.Overall, this place was good enough for a one-night stay to be close to the airport. One last thing -- the shuttle bus that took us to the airport sounded like it was going to fall apart at any moment. There were constant rattling sounds and when the driver turned something sounded like a loud grinding. I was relieved it was a relatively short ride as the vehicle did not really feel safe to be riding in.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Stopover on Way Home,The front desk clerk was very courteous and she was able to accommodate our room type/location.  The room was comfortable and we were able to get a very restful sleep. We will consider this hotel in future trips as we return home.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,The room is cleaning and safety. I think it is a little expensive.,"The free bus picks up us at the airport,and next day sends us from the hotel to airport. The room is very clean.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Satisfactory,"This hotel was clean, staff nice. Nothing special, though. I was not happy having a handicapped room - made me feel like I was in the hospital.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Close to the airport with a free shuttle,"A good hotel if you have a flight out in the morning.  Other than the Westin and Courtyard by Marriott which adjoin the airport (and cost 2 to 2.5 times more), this hotel and the others around Tower Rd are the closest to the airport.  Baymont Inn has a free 24 hour shuttle that runs from the hotel every 45 minutes.  It takes about 10 minutes to get to the terminal.  Pick-up was easy;  just call them when you land and they'll direct you to the shuttle.  It's not exclusive to Baymont;  they drop off at other hotels as well, but it went quickly.  There are restaurants nearby that you can either Uber or walk to.  The room was adequate:  coffee maker, iron, standard toiletries.  Clean enough that I took off my shoes.  Staff was friendly.  I would stay here again for the convenience alone.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great stay,Overall we were pleased with the stay.  We were running late and a shuttle was waiting on us.  The front desk called and was polite informing us that the shuttle was there.  We will stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Tiny beds poor breakfast ,"This is our first stay in the hotel. The hotel is about 15 minutes from the airport on a shuttle. The hotel is just ok. Beds are small, not queen but 2 small doubles. Some rooms have a sink outside of a bathroom. Pillows are horrible. Breakfast is so bad that I could't eat anything. Coffee was barely warm. I wouldn't stay here again at this hotel. At this price range the hotel should have a better breakfast and better pillows.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"New looking, big and clean rooms","The hotel room I stayed was big and clean and seemed to be newly painted/furnished. Everything was perfect during the stay, there are some restaurants in walking distance. Perfect location to stay when arriving/leaving from the airport. The breakfast selection is very limited.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good fo an overnight; easy access to Stapleton...,"Room really nice, beds excellent; front desk personnel courteous and helpful. Ate at Ruby Tuesday's, within walking distance of the hotel; very good. Asked for a crib for one of our rooms, (it was a pack n play) delivered in a timely manner, but it was so, so dirty. Weren't sure we even wanted to use it, but really had no choice.  Other negative was the ""hot"" breakfast. Orange juice was awful (weak and sour) and I do not care for powdered eggs......  oh well, the chocolate chip cookies were good. 🍪🍪🍪",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Close to Airport ,"After weeks of traveling I was very grateful for the hotel location so close to airport. We had clean rooms, friendly staff. Unusual to see rabbits outside chewing on grassy lawns but we humans are taking over their homeland. Cute rabbits ... sad to see how we human evict nature for human comforts . I suppose graffiti, litter, noisy boom boom music will be next . For now it's pretty nice. Love the convenience of hotel proximity to airport... Traveling for 2 weeks and last night before flying home to florida . Flight leaves 6am. So gotta get to Airport by 4am.  (Anyone who thinks you can get away with 30 mins instead of Two hours early has not flown out of this airport. Started 345am dropped off car at rental off-sight, took free shuttle to Airport, walked walked to airline check in , all the way through line of TSA discovered didn't have all boarding passes, do had to go back to airline check in and get all paperwork and start the TSA line a gain . Discovered had rental car keys in pocket after getting through TSA. So had to step out of line 3rd time , Avis Rac said return them to airport counter... but no one there, Avis said take shuttle bus and return to off sight location and return keys ... we opted not to -- so we would not loose our flight home ... fed ex the keys from Florida.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Not terrible, but I'd stay somewhere else next time","I travel a lot for work. At this price point (including in comparison to nearby hotels), I expected nicer finishes, towels, and bath. I was also surprised that there was no mini-fridge in the room, which I thought was listed when I booked, though that may have been my mistake. The free airport shuttle is probably the best amenity, the room was fairly quiet despite its proximity to the airport, and the bed was comfortable, though the sheets weren't particularly clean (some stains - hopefully they were actually clean). If this is the cheapest option and all you need is a quiet place to sleep, it'll do the job, but I'd put it on par with the Quality Inn or Days Inn nearby, which are likely cheaper, and not as nice as most new Holiday Inns or La Quintas, which are also nearby and may not be any more expensive.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very Impressed,"The staff was friendly, the lobby was stocked with fresh ice water, coffee and other items...they provided free toiletries if you forgot your own (or had to discard them at the airport). Their complimentary breakfast was terrrific. Lots of choices and clean dining hall. The room was clean and refreshing. I would stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wishing This Baymont was more like Wyndam Time Share Properties,We sure expected a 4 or 5 star hotel since we paid nearly $200 a night for this hotel. The room needed an update. The room looked partially cleaned...I wonder if the cleaning staff could be trained to really clean the rooms like Wyndam time share properties. The amenities were scarce.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Requested a roll away bed and was confirmed with a...,"Requested a roll away bed and was confirmed with a receptionist on the phone. Upon arriving to the hotel we came to find only two double beds. Fits 4 not 5. We asked where is the roll away and the receptionist looked confused and said it doesn't fit in that room and didn't offer a different room. So I had to sleep on the floor. There was no accommodation's for the inconveniences, I was highly disappointed and sore from the hard floor. We only needed the room for that night we had an early flight to catch the next morning the least that could have been done was offer an additional room.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient to the airport,The hotel is clean and quiet. The rooms are spacious and the beds are relatively comfortable. There is a complementary breakfast. They have a shuttle service to the airport and you can park your car for $5 a night. It is outside parking. The place is no frills.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Airport Hotel,"Quick stop before catching an early plane. Was thrilled to find muffins, fruit, and coffee/tea available at 4 AM. Only complaint was the airport shuttle that was over-crowded. Half the people had to stand the whole way to the airport in order to get all the luggage in. We were on time but not happy that our safety was compromised.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Hotel looks nice,","The hotel is very deceiving, the room was dirty, the breakfast was horrible the waffle iron was broken and you burned it not knowing the timer wasn't working they also charged me to leave my vehicle at the hotel for three days, which other hotels let you leave your vehicle for free when I checked in I asked if it was free and the lady said as long as I was a customer there what a lie ! No hot tub to relax in just a pool! Big mistake will not stay or recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont Inn Stay - July 13th,The availability of the hotel to the Denver Airport is the reason I chose it.  All of the staff was very accommodating and professional.  Definitely a great choice!,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Everyone was nice and helpful.   My only problem was for as...,Everyone was nice and helpful.   My only problem was for as much as I paid for my room it should have been cleaner.   There was food on the floor by the bed that my baby could have put in his mouth.   And we found a flashlight so I know they are not taking the time to lift the little bed skirt and make sure everything is picked up and cleaned.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,First night in the USA,Arrived from Australia via LA and this was our first experience of accomodation in the USA.  The hotel was a short shuttle ride from the airport which was great considering the amount of flying we had done.  The hotel room was clean and plenty of room for the 2 of us.  Close to places to eat as well.  If you are staying in Denver as a stop over I highly recommend it.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"OK hotel, but won't stay again","Stayed here 2 nights. You get what you pay for. It seemed they were so concerned about saving money, they forgot they are in a service industry. First the pros: room was well lit, which usually can't be said of hotel rooms. It was clean, bed was comfortable and everything in the room worked ok. Cons: very little counter space. They only give you 2 paper cups per room, per day. Small complaint, but annoying. 2nd day, one of the two hand towels were not replaced. Since towels are small & thin, you get them damp quickly. Could have used more. In room coffee machine had coffee but no tea. There is no safe, minifrig or microwave. Very few outlets for charging electronics. Here's the biggest room problem-the on button must be held down while using the hairdryer to keep it on. So there is no way you can blow dry your hair and do any styling at the same time. My finger got very tired since I have longer hair! Also, the breakfast is probably the worst we've ever had at at ""free breakfast"" hotel. The hot water (for tea) & coffee were kept in carafes and were lukewarm, at best. We're not coffee drinkers, but we're told it wasn't good. The first day, the only fruit offered was old withered oranges. They did add bananas the second day. The toaster wasn't working at all the first day. The second day, it at least thawed the frozen (!) bread. The scrambled eggs were rectangles. Weird! One day they had sausage, the next bacon. Not hot oatmeal/only packets of Quaker oatmeal in one flavor. They did have make your own waffles. Muffins were flavorless. Ok hotel for overnight if you don't need the breakfast. Close to airport and has van back and forth.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Place to Stay,"The hotel is very pleasant, quiet, and a great location for access to the airport.  It is also close to restaurants and gas stations.  The room was very clean and service was friendly.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent hotel,"The hotel was very nice, clean, pleasing to the eye, with helpful staff.  I would definitely recommend staying here.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very dissapointed,"Check in process was slow but the room only rate 2 out of five stars. Two glaringly irritating issues:1. The towels/linens were extremely poor quality for a newer hotel. Cheap, thin, scratchy.2. There was a light over the vanity with NO light switch to be found!3.Close in parking was minimal and front entrance on back side of property.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean Room Near Airport,"The room was a bit dated, sort of smallish, but no complaints on the cleanliness.  They have a weird thing going on with the electricity and the room key. Also, I about lost my mind trying to figure out how in the world you get the light on in the bathroom.  When I finally did, we didn’t turn it off.  There was a slight mildew smell in the bathroom, but everything looked clean, even in the corners.   We don’t know how breakfast was because we had an early flight.  This was our 2nd place to stay near the airport.  We had scheduled our first and last nights of our trip at one hotel but it was so bad, we cancelled and switched here for our last night and were not disappointed.  A good place to stay near the airport and shuttles ran on time, even at 4AM.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not happy with the lack of shuttle service,"We arrived in Denver and called for the shuttle to pick us up. They said it would be twenty minutes. When it arrived there were so many people on it and we were told there is only one shuttle running and it would be another 40 minutes. We had to end up taking Uber. When we got to the hotel to check in we asked the front desk if we have to reserve a shuttle for around nine am. She said not because it isn't busy that late. When we went to get the shuttle for the 905 am departure we were told all shuttles were full until 1040 am. We had to take Uber again. The main reason I stayed here was to have a free shuttle and we could not get it either way. Very unhappy with the lack of shuttle availability. Also, the breakfast was very average and the pillows were uncomfortable. The front desk clerk did take some money off our bill for the inconvenience but we don't think we would stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,nice room. offers airport shutte,Nice room. Staff okay in friendliness. Breakfast was at 6 but still not early enough for us to eat due to early flight. Offers airport transport. Lamp  on one side of night stand didn't work. A little pricey but nice.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,OK place to overnight for the airport,"The lodging near the Denver Airport does have a rather captive audience, they charge what the market will bear.  The Baymont was the most reasonable place to stay that I found.  The rooms were a little smaller than some places, but they were clean and everything worked.  The thermostat for the air conditioner was set to display in celsius.  That turned out to be a learning opportunity for the kids.The breakfast selection was a little weak and the breakfast area was crowded.  The food was a little below average in quality as well.  It met our needs but not much more.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Pricey but nice,"This is a nice hotel, but not worth the $$. However, b/c of proximity, they can charge what they want.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very Nice Stay (2 stays),Stayed upon arrival in Denver and again night before departure. Front desk nice to deal with. Hotel had nice swimmimg pool and hot tub. Breakfast was better than usual continental - included eggs and sausage 1 day and eggs and bacon another. Coffee in room and 24 hrs in lobby.. 2 fast PCs and a printer for guest use. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Shopping like Walmart about 1 mile away,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean but nothing special,"Stayed on a Tuesday night before a DIA morning flight. Clean room, carpet and furniture a bit worn. Quite small towels to dry with after a shower. Parking was not a problem, have stayed at hotel on Tower Rd when parking after 9 pm has been a problem. We'd stay again.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,One night stay before a flight,"Like almost everyone else at this hotel (probably), I stayed here the night before a flight out of Denver. It was MUCH better than I was expecting for an airport hotel. Room was massive, bed was very comfortable, building and room were clean, and wifi worked great. The free shuttle to the airport the next day took 15 minutes from hotel to airport and left exactly on time. I appreciated the sign up sheet to ensure I reserved a spot on the shuttle I wanted. The continental breakfast did look pretty grim, but I am not a big breakfast eater to begin with so I suppose it would be fine if you were in a pinch and were fine with standard cereals, bagels, muffins, and a waffle maker (the eggs looked pretty scary). I was initially hesitant to stay at a brand I wasn't familiar with (I don't think these exist on the east coast just yet), but would definitely stay here again if I needed a quick and comfortable place to stay before a flight out of Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great stay,"We only stayed for one night, before flying out the next day. It was a reasonable price with a great location near the airport. There's not much (other than hotels) in the area but there are a few restaurants. Beds were comfy, rooms were quiet and dark. WiFi worked really well. TV had a good selection of channels. Continental breakfast - eggs, bacon, yogurt, etc. Convenient airport shuttle.I'd definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Always a winner,"I like this hotel it's clean, friendly, free washer, dryer and breakfast 100% eggs, bacon or sausage, fruit, yougurt, waffles and pastries beverages included. ""Western"" is the shuttle for several hotels in the area. Tipping the drivers for transportation is kind. I've been coming here going on 4 years",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Stayed due to a softball tournament,"The Baymont was/is a nice hotel. Couple of observations - although these specific items probably aren't applicable to everyone... We stayed here due to a ""stay to play"" softball tournament.  I will start by saying the hotel was kept clean and all staff were helpful and friendly. A couple of items that would be nice but are not amenities at the hotel are 1. A hot tub (though the saltwater pool is quite nice)2. Larger fitness area (currently it has one of each: elliptical machine, stationary bike and treadmill but no weights or resistance machines 3. Mini refrigerators The rooms are on the smaller side when it comes to hotels and just know the sink and mirror are in the main hotel room while the toilet and shower/tub are in the bathroom (with a family of 4 it's hard to get ready without waking others up when you have to get ready earlier than others) While this is not a big deal - just an FYI :)Side note - best hotel coffee I've had in a really long time!!",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Airport Hotel,They accepted our late check in. The room was welcoming. There was no small fridge in there. That was kind of a bummer. We had to stick our room key in a slot near the door to access the air conditioner and the heat (different) but worked. There was plenty of room for 3 people plus our 2 small service dogs. Nice person at the front desk. Very helpful.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Business Trip,I've been staying here for the past 2+ years for business trips.  It is very clean well run!  And the price is always very reasonable at any time of year.  Great value and outstanding property.,5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Returning home.,"While I thought the rooms were nice, the breakfast left a lot to be desired.   6 of us were returning from a 9  day family reunion, this was our last stop before returning home,  we stayed at the Hampton Inn and Quality Inn, both had far superior breakfasts.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good near airport choice,We used this hotel for our overnight before our flight home. I turned in our rental car and took the shuttle back to the hotel. Very convenient to not have to rush in the morning. A simple signup for the AM shuttle got us to the airport in plenty of time. Both shuttle drivers were very helpful. The hotel was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good stay by Denver airport,"My daughter, grandchildren and I stayed here prior to an early morning fllight from the Denver airport.  The shuttle driver was efficient and friendly and we got to the airport at the time we planned.  I appreciate leaving the car in the parking lot for the week we were gone and pleased with the minimal charge for parking it.  The hotel was quiet, clean, and worked very well for our one-night stay.  We arrived at 10 pm and left the next morning at 6 am so we weren't there long.",3

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good Location for Airport,"Three of us stayed here for two nights at the end of a long trip, as we wanted a day to explore downtown Denver.  The room was clean and had all of the amenities we needed.  We asked for a rollaway bed and it was promptly delivered.  The airport shuttle was great, and enabled us to return our rental car to the airport the evening before we flew home, then we just caught the next shuttle back to the hotel that night, and used it again to the next morning to catch our flights.  Easy to use the business center, and print boarding passes.  The free breakfast is pretty standard, but there were plenty of choices.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,overnight stay w/shuttle to DIA,This is a very nice hotel & we had no issues except for our pre-booked shuttle bus to DIA. It arrived full!  We had to stand & our luggage was literally put all over the bus even in the aisles. When we disembarked it was difficult to find it & we had to stop the bus twice before we had it all. This made the start of our vaca stressful.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"most expensive, least amount of ammenities","we stayed in 3 different hotels this trip. This hotel was the most expensive at $214 (after tax) for one night. The rooms were clean however the door was so heavy I had to put my full body weight into it to open it. The room did not have a fridge or microwave, which traveling with kids is a must, boo. The room did not have a luggage rack. Was I meant to put my luggage on the floor? Or maybe sleep with it on my bed? I went down to the front desk to ask for a luggage rack and there was ONE person manning the phones and the 8 person deep line coming in to check in. Once I had the luggage rack I went upstairs to start bedtime. The bathroom light was half hanging in the fixture and the tub had a strange plug that worked great for plugging the tub but did not drain well for showers. The last nail in the coffin for this over priced hotel was the breakfast. Terrible, my family eats a lot of eggs but these looked so horrible no one attempted. Pretty sure they were powdered eggs but even then cooks TRY to make them look edible. This was not the case. The eggs were cut into brownie shaped cubes and were a strange solid pale yellow color. I've had better powdered eggs at summer camp 30 years ago. One of the waffle makers wasn't timing the waffles so that got burnt and I'm pretty sure someone mixed a different juice in the orange juice dispenser. It tasted so strange neither of my kids would drink it and they love OJ of all kinds. So there you have it. The rooms are small and clean if you have money to burn, otherwise stay somewhere else. You have plenty of choices.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Family wedding,We had a very nice time at the Baymont Inn. It was close to the airport and very well run. We all enjoyed the breakfast before we traveled out to Crested Butte . Clean and friendly place!! Heading there again before flight home!,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont Inn & Suites Review,I was unaware of the Baymont Inn & Suites at Denver International Airport and was pleasantly surprised and impressed at the quality of this property and that it is a Wyndham property.  I was also relieved that it offered transportation to and from the airport.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A good place to stay near the Denver airport,"Nice rooms, pleasant staff, good breakfast, ontime shuttle to airport runs every 45 minutes and takes about 15 minutes to get there.  Fitness center small but nice, pool looked good but was locked when it was supposed to be open.  Business center worked well.  One nice feature was that they opened the restaurant before 6 am for coffee fruit and muffins and let me back in after 9 and fed me eggs and coffee.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very near the airport. Needed for our very early morning flight.  Actually on the 52 SQ mile property.,"Not a fair review because we did not use many of the hotel's facilities.

The room was fine and we would consider staying again, however, we thought the nightly rate was a bit high.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Value!,"This is a great hotel if you need a place near the airport.  We came in on a red-eye and didn't want to drive far that night.  I liked that the shuttle picked us up and delivered us to the hotel.  The shuttle service is open 24 hrs a day.  We really enjoyed the clean rooms, friendly front desk staff, and the hotel shuttle which worked seamlessly.  They offered to take my name and schedule my shuttle pick-up at the front desk for the morning as I was going back to pick up a rental car for the week.  They even offered to give me a wake up call so I'd make the shuttle on time.  In addition, we especially the breakfast buffet.  Even though there was not a huge selection of foods, what they did have was very tasty.  The make-your-own belgian waffle was excellent (on par with any restaurant waffle and even better), and the scrambled eggs and sausage patties were delicious!  They also had all the other cold items the you regularly expect to find like yogurt, juice, peanut butter, toast, etc.The only con is that the breakfast room is very small.  If you have a large group or if you are impatient in waiting for a seat, you may be disappointed.  Of course, you can always take your food to your room.  The table turnover seems to go pretty quickly if you are willing to stand around and wait for a short time.  A great value for the money!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Comfortable and convenient,"The hotel was close to the airport, clean & comfortable.  The room was spacious and the shower was a delight.  Check in was easy and the breakfast was very satisfactory.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont Inn DIA,"Overall satisfactory rating.  The shuttle to and from the airport was on-time.  Special note should go out to the shuttle driver on Sunday, June 18 @ 11:30...He went out of his way to come around and pick me up at American Airlines.  He also helped out an elderly couple at the Baymont once we arrived at the hotel.  He personally drove the shuttle over to their car so they wouldn't have to carry their luggage a long distance...Great customer service!     Breakfast could be improved with greater variety...Also a little bigger area, but I know that's not feasible.  Other than that, overall I would recommend this to other people.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very nice for quick stopover ,"Flew in late and checked in around midnight. Check in was very easy and room was ready.

However, our room bathroom toliet was clogged when we attempted to use it after returning late one evening. was able to get a plunger from the night clerk and corrected myself.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient when flying out of DIA,"We chose to stay at the Baymont Inn DIA because we had an early flight out and didn't want to have to fight rush-hour traffic. It is just minutes from the airport, offers a free shuttle to DIA and allows long-term parking for $5/day. It is pricey for the hotel quality, but less expensive than many of the neighboring hotels. We found it to be clean and quiet and were happy to leave the car and take the shuttle out for an easy early morning departure.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Service,We enjoyed this hotel. We wish the room had two queens beds instead of doubles but we managed. The tv was not working the first night we stayed but the manager came up to help with the issue. She discounted the room on night now and by night two the staff had it fixed. Warm cookies at check in were a huge hit with the kids. Nice pool. Great breakfast!,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Colorado Family Reunion,The Baymont was in the perfect location and the least expensive. I don't see what the other Hotels in the area could have had that this one didn't. Food was in walking distance (great if you've already returned your car rental). Shuttle to the airport. Availability to print boarding passes with user friendly software. It was great!!,5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Plenty Better DEN Options,"The Baymont Inn was the cheapest rate near the DEN airport but not worth money saved. We picked the Baymont because it had an airport shuttle but since we got here we noticed that all the nearby hotels have a shuttle.The Baymont rooms were so small. Uncomfortably small! The sheets were dirty and the front desk was not very welcoming. In short, choose a better option for the few bucks saved.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,not happy,"Very Disappointed with our stay for several reasons:  1) The price was way too high $148.00 for this property (I'm a Hilton member and have never stayed in a Baymont.)  2) for a ""Brand New Building"", it looked and felt like was from 30 years ago with a ""remodel"".  3)  The towels were threadbare and dirty/dingy looking (as if we were in a 30 year old hotel with ""original"" towels.  4) there was no safety handle in the tub/shower combo.  5)  There were no ""holders"" to hang your hand towels anywhere in the sink area.  6)  We never received our 4am wake up call.  7)  The coffee was old and cold.  8)  The employees were hard to find at the front desk and when we finally had one come out to check out, I informed her of all the above and her response was ""Well, sorry"".",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Just ok,"This place is great for a quick stop as a layover, however, would not want to stay here for any prolonged visit.They serve ""breakfast"", continental until 9.  However, when we were there the staff removed the coffee, waffle mix, jams etc; and only left some milk and cereal at 8:50am. People were trying to scramble to grab a couple of things before everything was put away.Rooms were clean, no issues there.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,NEVER AGAIN,The room smelled really bad and the beds are to small and so was the room. Only one trash can for the whole room.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Thanks so much,"Thanks to Baymont and Wyndham for helping us out. Our flight from Barcelona was canceled and we knew we couldn't keep our reservation at the Baymont in Denver. Unfortunately, our international phone service wasn't working so we sent an email to cancel our reservation hoping it would get through. Next day when we finally got back to the states, Baymont let us switch our reservation at no additional charge. We had been traveling for 21 hours and really needed the night's sleep before our four hour drive home. That''s good service.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient to Denver airport,We had an early flight next morning and the location of the hotel was convenient for us.  The reception staff was working around the clock and our check out at 3:30 a.m. was fast and smooth.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Accessibility issues, breakfast poor, overall stressful and not pleasant experience","Bad shuttle service: I waited at the airport for 35-40 minutes for the hotel shuttle (in the meantime two rounds of the other hotel shuttles came and went. Finally I had to take for a taxi (about $30). On the way back same story. I was getting nervous as I had to get to the airport in time. Finally the reception staff offered to get and pay for a taxi -- which also did not come for a while. Finally the shuttle came -- I had a 45 minute delay overall. Poor breakfast: the breakfast room was a little dingy, and the breakfast quality was poor (e.g. frozen bread). I had expected better from a 3-star hotel. I had very little and had to have breakfast later at the airport. The bathroom light switches were very difficult to use (it would switch on only after pressing very hard).Positive aspects: one of the reception staff (Gabriela) was really helpful, she even offered to call an Uber for me from her own phone as a favor when I was getting really late. Overall the hotel was slightly cheaper than the other 3-stars, but I had to pay extras and the experience was stressful and not very pleasant. I would not recommend it much to my friends.",2

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Pleasant personnel,Everyone at this hotel was pleasant and personable!  I called to confirm check-in and they were very patient even though I forgot about the time difference from PA.(it was 330am Denver time) The room staff were always ready with a smile and well wishes.

The hotel is clean and comfortable. Breakfast was simple and good. The shuttle service to the airport worked perfectly for us. We  took the shuttle at 4:30 am and arrived with time to spare.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Over the top rude management,"Everything decent about the hotel was outweighed by the rudeness of the management. There are countless new hotels all in walking distance of each other in the Denver airport area. The manager cancelled our reservation with no explanation. Then wanted to charge us substantially more at the counter. After a long verbal battle the subordinate employee caved in by reinstating our reservation. The room was clean and eh bed comfortable. However, for the price one can do much better. There's no frig or microwave in the room. MW is no problem because I used their kitchen.",2

Room - beds/bathroom were fairly clean. Desk chair had soo much dust on it like it was never cleaned. I didnt even feel like sitting on it after looking at it. Also one thing which we didn't like was all the lamps in the room were unplugged when we entered the room. I mean we were using our phone torch to look for plugs. Energy saving is a good thing but this was really inconvenient. Breakfast was basic. Ok for an overnight stay.",3

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very good one night stay near Denver airport,"My husband and I stayed at the Baymont for one night prior to a trip to Mexico.  The hotel was clean, quiet and room was spacious and comfortable.  The airport shuttle runs 24/7 and is a quick 10-minute ride to the airport.  Breakfast was pretty typical for a chain hotel, but it was available promptly at 6 am which was helpful for those of us who had to get to the airport for an early-morning flight.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very Disappointing,"I arrived at the Denver international airport on a Sunday afternoon.   I called the Baymont Inn to check on the airport shuttle, and was immediately put on hold for 6 minutes.  The free wifi connection was poor and kept disconnecting.   In this day and age, to get any work done, you need reliable internet.   But not here.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Experience out did previous reviews,"I was traveling in a Winnago 23 ft motorhome.  I needed a motel with ample space to park it.  Baymont was perfect with lots of free parking.  The parking area had lots of lights and I felt safe.  I booked for two nights.  Arriving at around 1 pm I asked if it were possible to check in early.  Front desk clerk said no rooms available but to check back in 30 minutes.  Did so and she pleasantly we checked me in.Reading previous reviews before I started writing this one left me questioning if the motel had a complete re-do.  So much to-do about the pillows.  My king size bed had five pillows.  Simply take a pillow grab two corners on the same end and shake the dickens out of it.  I found the pillow really nice after a shake or two.The room was spotless and carpeting new.  Linens were new and plentiful.  Wi-fi was strong and an Infinity hot spot for those that can take advantage.No idea what past reviewers expect from a motel breakfast with no full kitchen.  This breakfast included the typical waffle iron, cold cereal, 2% milk, fresh fruit, sweet rolls, white bread (ick) for toast, scrambled eggs, bacon cooked perfectly, and great coffee.  What I enjoyed most about the breakfast was the ample table space.  The TV was turned down low so not to distract those not wanting to watch the news.I used the shuttle to the airport four times during my stay.  It was always on time, driver was friendly and provided answers to questions.  It is about 10 minutes to the airport where you can catch the light rail into Denver.  I qualify for a senior discount so an all day pass was $4.50!Plenty of great places to eat within an easy walk.  I felt safe and comfortable in the area.With out a doubt  I would stay here again and recommend the motel to friends and family.Rates are some of the best for airport motels with shuttle service.",4

After an hour and no shuttle we called again and she told us sorry it is ""Gateway"" not ""Western"". Here comes a Gateway shuttle and the driver said they do not drive for Beaumont Hotel. We called back with the driver on speaker and the girl from the hotel tells us she does not know what to do. I ask if i can talk to someone else and she said I could talk to her boss in the morning. So what are we supposed to do know at 2 AM in the morning?  ""I don't know "" she said. We took a $35 taxi ride to the hotel.  When we got there the girl would not look at us and did not apologize. She handed us our room key and said nothing. I asked who i need to speak with and she told me Carols. I. the morning we spoke to Carlos who said he could not do anything because it was not the hotels fault that their shuttle was not there. We asked to speak to his boss who was on a conference call. We left our number and 3 days later she still has not called us back. I guess we will be calling corporate.  Do not stay here. much better options all around them and we saw all their airport shuttles about 4 times.",1

The young woman to whom I explained my predicament barked, ""Look, we've already sent maintenance up there.  It's a waste, because the remote works.""

The driver made a stop once in out pickup point but was full and could not pick us up. We called the hotel front desk three times and were told the shuttle was on his way each time.  All three times we got the impression from the front desk that we were bothering them.We finally got picked up at  12:55 and were in our hotel by 1:15 am.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great value near the airport,"Our room at this newer hotel was clean, comfortable, quiet, and spacious.  We parked our car here for $5/day while traveling to Orlando.  The free shuttle, which stops at a few other hotels in the area, picked us up as scheduled and we made it to the airport in plenty of time for our flight.  On the way back to the hotel from the airport, we only had to wait 10 minutes or so for the shuttle, which circulates every 25-30 minutes.  The breakfast was surprisingly good for this type of hotel, with fluffy scrambled eggs, bacon, bananas, cereal, and hot & cold drinks.  It's one of the least expensive hotels in the area. We'll definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Nice, clean place to stay","Booked a last minute reservation which was a good, reasonable rate.  Nice, roomy, clean place to stay.  Free limited breakfast options.  Would have been nice if had room service or food options for lunch or dinner but 2 restaurants within a few minutes walk.  Definitely would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Stop Off on the way to Avon, CO","Stopped over here for a night after 21 hrs travelling from London.

It was clean and comfortable and they were very helpful (e.g. gave good directions to find shutitle pick up, let us have a room at 10am, etc.). Would stay again if in the area...",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wouldnt stay here again,At check in it seemed the front desk was a little upset about something no smile or friendly greeting. It didnt bother me and i went ahead and checked in and scheduled a shuttle to the airport for 6:10. The room was clean but the beds were very small. I am 6 foot 2 and my the bed hit me about mid shin. I went down to catch the shuttle at 6 and saw one leaving. I asked the desk and was told that was a different shuttle and mine would be here at 6:10. At 6:15 the shuttle was not there. I was told it would be here. At 6:20 i asked again and they called the shuttle. I was aked if i wanted to wait till 6:50 or did i want them to come back and get me. There was a reason i scheduled at 6:10 not 6:50. Seem to make the front desk mad that i wanted the shuttle to come back.  The shuttle got back at 6:35. It was only a 25 minute delay but if the airport had been very busy it could have made a difference of missing my flight or not. I never got an apology from the front desk. Next time i will stay somewhere esle.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean and spacious,I checked in around 10:30 pm and had a morning flight. Check in was quick. The shuttle was prompt and a great perk. My room was large and clean.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Super clean spot and friendly staff.,The place was clean! The beds are small/firm so I suggest a king bed room. Other than that the place had friendly and helpful staff. Very convenient location by the airport. Not so close to downtown (about 25 mins away) but it beats waking up early for a flight lol.,5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Lack of Service!,"I checked into the Baymont due to its proximity to the airport and being able to leave my car there during my trip.  Unlike on line, I was told there was an extra fee to leave my car.  I was there late in the evening, so I paid due to a early morning flight.  I asked for a 3:45 wake up and a 4:30 shuttle.  I didn't get the wake up and missed my 6am flight.  The entire reason I checked into the hotel was to fy early.  It may be my fault in that I trusted the hotel for its services.  It truly was a lack of services.  The check in clerk did not look up or ever smile.  The check out clerk repeating said he was ""only a clerk"" and there was no manager to speak with regarding the lack of wake up call.  Highly don't recommend this hotel.",1

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Won't be back,Waited a half hour for the airport shuttle bus to pick us up after a long day of travel before a driver for a different hotel took pity on us and gave us a ride. When I mentioned my frustration to the front desk person she was completely indifferent and unpleasant. She also did not mention that we had to reserve space on the shuttle to head back to DIA the next day. We got lucky that there was space left in the morning. Room and breakfast was fine. I won't be back because of the attitude of the staff.,3

Reading reviews, I felt confident cleanliness was an asset. On the surface, the rooms appear clean; however, on both stays we have seen some serious laundry violations: 1) clean linen in a canvas cart- piled level with sides and a housekeeper lying across the clean linen while waiting on the elevator; 2) clean, folded sheets lying on the floor- in the hallway!!I am not comfortable with the cleanliness of their bedding!!",3

GFCI Wall outlet to right of sink was flaky causing coffee pot to appear not to work.  Reset GFCI several times.  Wiggled the plug in the outlet and the pot came on.  Press-type wall switch in bathroom had to be mashed into the wall to get the light to turn on.  Bulb burned out over reading chair.  Pillows were really small and lumpy.  TV remote had issues.  Got a new one...same problem...think it was the TV!  On the plus side, the bed was very good, Heating and AC unit was VERY quiet (nice!), and shower head put forth a nice stream of water.",3

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient location near airport,This hotel is in great condition and is very convenient located in a cluster of hotels near Denver International Airport.  We arrived after midnight after a flight delay and found the lobby overflowing with people. The all turned out to be with one tour group that has not reserved enough rooms.  I give high praise to the hotel for having it room ready and checking us in quickly when we arrived. They could have so easily given our room away with the hotel at capacity and dozens of people looking for a room.,4

Our shuttle to the airport had some troubles....the door wouldn't close.  After some fiddling, on of the passengers figured out there was a manual open/shut crank and we were on our way.

The front desk will tell you that shuttle takes 15 mins when in reality it takes an hour as the shuttle makes stops at other 5 hotels. At the end the management does not take their responsibility for providing false information and points fingers to the third party bus service. Stay away,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Terrible airport shuttle,"The airport shuttle service is a contracted company called Western connection and they are also used by 5 or more hotels and they go to all of these hotels not just directly to and from Baymont. It took me an hour to get to my hotel after waiting a very long time outside in cold weather, and the female shuttle driver was in no hurry to get us to our hotels...very frustrating.

To return to Atlanta we stayed in the Baymont at the Denver Airport.  Somehow I had picked up a lung infection on the plane to Denver and that combined with the high altitude in Frisco caused me to have respiratory failure. By the time I got back to Denver I knew that I needed medical care.  Mr. Obed Afrasa at the Baymont went out of his way to help my wife and me as I was hospitalized for three days in Denver.  Mr. Afrasa exhibited what ultimate customer service is.  He helped my wife figure out how to navigate to various nearby places to obtain things she needed to support me in the hospital.

The rooms are clean and comfortable and the shuttle to the airport short.

Also, nearby is Thai Chili, which is a fantastic place for dinner. (Avoid the the pad Thai but get the curry!)",4

I have always used La Quinta when overnighting at the Denver Airport, but though that the Baymont price was so much lower that it was worth a try. Overall, La Quinta has larger rooms, larger bathrooms, and always accommodated my request to be on the main floor for easy access.

My only two complaints are: we could hear every footstep upstairs and in the hallway even though there was a whole room between our bedroom and the hallway, and the pillows were horrible. We ended up ditching them and sleeping on bath towels. They are huge and square which looked nice, but aren't comfortable. We would book again, just bring your own pillows and earplugs.",4

The check in process was much better than my first visit however the phone again did not work, Twice the phones did not work.

I asked for the manager to call me to discuss this issue but never got a call back..  I bought extra parking days and when returning to Denver I waited for the ""Baymont"" shuttle which was to come ever 30 munites (15 and 45).

I went ahead and booked the hotel based on this information. When we arrived ( at 10pm at night, and needed to fly out at 5am) I was informed that I would have to pay per day that I left my vehicle there, and they refused to give me a refund on the room because i had booked it on false information.

It took about 15 minutes to get to the terminal cause we had to stop off and pickup other guests from a neighboring hotel, but not too bad.  Rooms were very clean and nice, except the bathtub surround wall had some rust stains on it.  It didn't bother me, but maintenance should clean that up and recaulk the tub surround in room 203.",5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Really disappointing - never again,"Upon arrival in my room I discovered hairs not belonging to me in the bathtub near the drain.  Since it was late at night, I waited until the next morning to let housekeeping know about the problem.  Apparently housekeeping forgot about the problem and the hairs were still there when I returned later that day.  On my third night there I returned to my room to find blood on both the sheets and comforter.  I called down to the front desk and the clerk brought up a new sheet and comforter but told me he did not know anything about making beds so I had to remake the bed.  The next morning I realized housekeeping had not bothered to replenish the supplies so I could have coffee in my room before going down to breakfast. This last item is on me for not checking room amenities.  Only the king suites have refrigerators.  It has been a long time since I have stayed at a hotel where the rooms do not all have refrigerators.  This hotel is surrounded by about six more and I will pick one of those for my next stay in Denver.",1

We like being able to park our car for $5/day for the length of our trip.  Check-in/check-out is quick, the phone is answered when we have called and we have been given accurate information.  Book early for the best rate.  Breakfast is quite good with a good choice of hot items, breads, fruit, cereals, etc.  Some items are even available before a very early morning flight.  The TV service was being repaired and was not available.  This information was posted at the desk; however, this is a loss especially when one is dealing with jet lag. 😃 I think it would have been good PR to discount the rate a bit as an apology.  The airport shuttle has always been prompt and takes 15-20 min.  All in all, we have been happy with this choice!",4

They were excellent with all of our needs.  We would recommend Baymont to everyone.",4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Needs Improvement,"Energy Efficiency is good, but could not figure out how to use bathroom light.  No towel bar to hang towel by sink or my toiletry bag.  Only 1 trashcan in the room, need at least two.  No luggage rack to put luggage on, had to set on the floor and keep bending all the way down to get things out, not good with a bad knee.  Had a light bulb out, but did not report, figured they should know from cleaning the room prior to me arriving.  Recommendation for breakfast....cuties.  So much easier for kids, and adults too.  The flimsy plastic knife was hard to cut the orange.  No kid channels on TV.",3

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Comfortable Clean and Friendly,"After 27 hours of traveling with two children, all we wanted was a comfortable clean place to sleep.  Our stay at Baymont Inn & Suites Denver International Airport did not dissapoint.  Free shuttle to the hotel from the airport, the driver was friendly and prompt (although, I wish the shuttle had the names of their hotels on it, we almost missed it - luckily the driver asked us where we were headed).  Check in was fast, easy, and friendly even at 1am.  The bedding and pillows were clean and comfortable and we all had a wonderful nights sleep.  Bathroom was clean and well stocked for our needs also.  We will use this hotel again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Cigarette Smell,"The hotel was not bad, it did have a very distinct smell of cigarettes even though it is a smoke free hotel. The staff at the front desk was nice but was very robotic in the way the checked people in. I was a little disappointed that even after I scheduled for the shuttle to pick us up it was not scheduled so it was late and then got there and was freezing cold cause the driver didn't let it warm up prior to picking up guests at 3am in the winter. The room seemed clean however the ice bucket had mold on the outside of it so I wonder just how clean the room actually was. We were only in the room for about 6 hours so not really worth what I paid. Also I know that smoking weed in CO is legal but maybe stop guests from doing it right in front of the door so other guests don't have to walk through the cloud.",3

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Comfortable stay,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights on a solo trip to checkout Denver. For the most part things went well but there was a couple things worth mentioning. I stayed in one of their king suites and when I entered the room the closet door was off its hinges and placed next to the tv, later removed by front desk. I was also woken up at 3:30am by a wake up call I did not ask for, leaving me unable to fall back asleep and quite shaken up as I was staying alone. On my last day there was a snow storm and again I was woken up to what sounded like staff shoveling snow by the side hotel exit, which was directly behind my bed, at 5:00am. Maybe waiting till a later time, even one hour, would be more reasonable. But all in all the hotel was well kept, housekeeping was friendly, and I enjoyed my stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not Great,"No refrigerator or microwave. Room was not cleaned after first night. Beds and room were small, but comfy.  We were staying for a more lengthy stay not just overnight. Would have been alright just to crash for a night,",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Bittersweet stay,"Very nice hotel, the staff was pleasant, breakfast could have a different variety of meat.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Flight attendant,Great place to stay. Staff took extra care to get me an extra quiet room knowing I'm a flight attendant. That was very kind of them!  Only thing better would have been more vans for early morning shuttle service. I had to leave 2 hrs before my report time because of the lack of shuttle service,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean and comfortable ,"The walls are pretty thin but luckily our neighbors were not too chatty at night. It was super convenient being so close to the airport and there is a Ruby Tuesdays just around the corner for dinner and lunch. Breakfast is free and I'm always happy with hot options like eggs and sausage as opposed to just pour your own waffle. Coffee was very good.  Beds are comfortable rooms are cozy. Amenities include coffee pot, free wifi, and TV. Affordable for Denver at $100 a night. I would most definitely stay here again! My only wish would be to have a mini fridge or a microwave but I understand that most guests probably only stay one night at this location. ",4

During the time of our stay, there were plumbing problems and we were not put in the requested room type. The hotel manager was very prompt in remedying the problem and Baymont refunded our Wydham rewards points that we used for the night. We still paid our cash portion for the room, but overall, it was a nice experience.",5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Night clerk cheated me on a fair deal for a taxi.,I needed a cab so I called the night clerk to have him call a taxi. Taxi arrived 3p minutes later. He had no id or fare monitor. I asked if the car was his personal car and he replied it was a new cab that hadn't been setup yet. He gave me a ride 15 miles away. Charged me $80.00 plus a tip. A week later I called a cab to pick me up where I was previously dropped off. He dropped me off at the same motel and the fare on the meter was $38.45. I am assuming since both cabbie and clerk are immigrants they are related or friends. Doesn't really matter now but they lost me as a loyal guest.,2

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not too impressed ,I called before I stayed and asked if they had an indoor heated pool. I was told yes they do! Go to jump in the water and it is COLD. Called and asked if they could turn the water temperature up and they said no they could not. I would have chose a different hotel had I known they not had a heated pool. I am here for a week and would like to swim in a warm pool. The cable here is only CNN and ESPN hbo and a few local channels. NOTHING to watch on tv. The breakfast is horrible! I am highly disappointed. Housekeeping was GREAT!,2

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not very clean,"Checked in for one night. Put on third floor with king bed. Room just not very clean. No one vacuumed, or only vacuumed around the door and bed. Don't look under any furniture! Hasn't been vacuumed in a long time. Hair, dust-bunnies, crums, seeds... Dried urine on the toilet. They leave you one shampoo, one conditioner, and one lotion. The lotion bottle was used and empty. Why you you put a used lotion bottle back on the sink stand? The bed was hard, but the pillows were nice and fluffy. The breakfast was sad. Cheerios, or raisin bran, pastries, bread, powdered scrambled eggs and terrible sausage. Some fruit - apples, bananas. Someone spilled their lunch all over the elevator. It stayed there overnight, no one cleaned it, smelly. I advise you to pay an extra $10 or $20 and stay at one of the other hotels at the airport.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Disappointing,"Not impressed, had a family vacation set for the holidays. Had my two boys excited to stay at a hotel with an indoor pool before leaving on an early flight out of Denver airport. After arriving to the hotel we noticed the pool was closed due to machanical issues.  The next morning we noticed bug bites on our 3 year old sons back and also one on my head. I called the supervisor and told her about the bites an she said they searched the room and didn't find anything but we're calling someone in to look at the room to take a closer look and would let me know if they found something. I have stayed here before and had a much better experience so the bar was set and just fell below this time but for the room rate and reasonable parking not a bad hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great place for staying near the airport!!,"Mom and I were flying out on Friday, 12/23, a heavy travel year. So we stayed at the Baymont and used the shuttle to get to the airport. We got more sleep, paid less for the parking, and didn't have to deal with the mess that is DIA parking around the holidays. You can sign up for the shuttle time when you check in, and it took 15 minutes for the shuttle to arrive a the airport to pick us up, even though they said it would be around 30 minutes. Great experience and made the trip much easier!!",4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Ok but loud,The hotel looks nice and was easy to get to from the airport but it was a bit loud.

We will return again and again. Julie from Grand Junction, CO",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice for the money,My son needed a hotel because the ski resort shuttle did not have a early morning shuttle to airport so it was either stay at airport all night or find a hotel with a shuttle.  He was more than happy with this property and seeing that the room was booked under my e-mail I have completed this with his input.  Despite some negative reviews shuttle was on time and got to airport at 5:45am.  He was also happy about ruby Tuesday being across the street so he could eat dinner.,5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good value and comfortable lodging,"This hotel offers very good value and a comfortable night's stay. One of the best parts of our stay was the $5 per day fee for parking. This is the lowest rate around, and the shuttle service to and from the airport was prompt and convenient.

When I went down to the front desk to ask about the water I was told they didn't know why it was doing that and to just let the water run. I ask for bottled water to brush my teeth and was told they didn't have any but I could get a cup of filtered water from the fitness room.

The cost was very reasonable, they had an airport shuttle running 24/7, free breakfast, clean room, and a tiny (but good enough for me) fitness center.  The rooms aren't massive but they're big enough if you're just using the room to sleep.  Small gripe - the maids kept trying to come into my room before 11am (checkout) to clean it.  I'd stay there again and I'd consider Baymonts in other areas too.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Truly Disappointing,"I booked this based on previous reviews.  I am glad others enjoyed their stay, but sadly, this was truly one of the most mediocre hotels I have ever been to.  We rolled in late having just driven 9 hours. In the morning, I noticed a stain suspiciously vomit like, hopefully, it was just food.  I asked housekeeping to attend to it and explained the room would be vacant for a couple hours.  I also explained that the vanity and a couple lamp's lights were out as well.  When I got back, no-one had tended to the room and it was time to get ready for the funeral I was in town for. As we are getting ready, housekeeping comes and I explain that we'd be leaving soon and to come back.  I also tell the front desk girl. Naturally, when we arrive, still not done.

I ask the front desk clerk if the bus would accommodate all the passengers signed up and she informed me that they would get another bus if necessary. She also indicated the airport was 6 miles away and the ride was 15 minute trip. The next morning I arrived at 5:30am for a 5:45 am shuttle ride.

I was never in Denver so it was sort of hit or miss when planning my trip, but did ok with the Baymont.  Everything was first class and would go back anytime.  The hotel is about 10 minutes from the airport the remainder of the trip went on without event.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean and comfortable,"We spent the night here recently and had a great experience.  The room was comfortable and clean.  We were surprised by the good breakfast that was served.  We had scrambled eggs, sausage, juice, coffee, cereal and a muffin.  Food was tasty and the eggs and sausage were hot.  We would definitely come here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Efficient clean good proximity to airport ,"I never like airport hotels, but this was perfect.  Nearby, clean and polite; it was just what I needed for a late night arrival before traveling to a morning of presentations.  Great friendly staff helped provide me with information regarding the greater Denver area and navigating to my meeting outside of Boulder. I definitely recommend this if you need a place to stay on your travels close to the airport!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Large room,"This hotel is near the airport in an area underdevelopment for many hotels. The room was large and nicely furnished. However, the bathroom sink is outside the bathroom. Not a feature I like. There is a grab bar in the shower. There is no refrigerator, microwave or safe. I suppose this is because it is an airport hotel and guests wouldn't normally stay for more than one night. The breakfast consisted of bagels, bread, cereal, sausage, eggs and muffins which were dry and tasteless.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,This is good hotel! ,I'm glad I chose this hotel for staying one night before our flight to Germany! They have shuttle for free! Bathroom was clean and I couldn't find any hair which good thing ☺️! Clean room! Friendly front desk 😊!,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Reasonable for near the airport. ,Nice hotel and felt like some of the negative reviews were unfounded other than the card you need to operate the lights.  We figured out the next morning theee was a switch on the card panel that operated the vanity light.  They need instructions on how it works. My husband is an engineer and he was baffled.  But nice accommodation and a comfortable bed.  Reasonable breakfast.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wyndham can do better,"Room had no place to put luggage, some kind of fan somewhere making a lot of noise.  Called the desk, they said they would check and call back, no call back.  Called them, they couldn't find anything.  Asked for a different room.   Front desk staff was rude and unwilling to move me.   I insisted, finally got another room.   Second room, couldn't get any ventilation to work.  Didn't get much sleep.  Will never go back.",1

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very pleased!,"had heard this place was remodeling so was concerned, but our room was very nice.  the air system was a little loud and they sent someone right down to fix it.   hotel staff very friendly. our room was close to the lobby so heard lots of noise early and late.  ",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Overnight stay at the DIA Baymont Inn,Excellent location close to DIA with shuttle to DIA.  Stay and park rate was very reasonable at $5.00 per night.  Our room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was good.  The shuttle ride to and from DIA was pleasant and quick.  The cost of the room was very reasonable.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont Review,The hotel is at a great location relative to Denver airport.  The bed was not so comfortable and the automatic light in the bath room was not conducive to a suite.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Overnight for an Early Flight,I liked this place.  The shuttle was easy to catch and check in was quick.  The lobby was pretty nice and it looked like it had a good place for breakfast.  I didn't get to enjoy it as my flight was too early.  The beds were comfortable and the room had lots of space.  It was clean and the wifi was good.  Also easy access to ice and ending machines.  Walking distance to a couple of restaurants and a 7/11.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Don''t use if you need to make your flight,This was a good place to stay for an overnight layover in Denver but we asked for a wake up call and never received it. We were late getting up and missed our flight out the next day! I wouldn't stay here if you need to be somewhere the next day.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Wonderful experience! Clean environment, friendly staff...","Wonderful experience! Clean environment, friendly staff.  My only comment is that it would be nice to have towel rack/hook near the sink so it was easier to dry your hands after washing them.  Definitely will consider staying again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Convenient, Clean and Dependable Stay at DIA","Just like my past experiences at this Baymont, it is convenient to DIA.  We checked in the day before departure by dropping the rental car nearby, and then catching the complimentary shuttle to the Baymont.   We went into Denver for dinner that night by catching the shuttle from the hotel to the light rail.  Waaaaaay easier than driving all the way into town.  Excellent bed comfort, great compliment breakfast and price.  Indoor pool that is very nicely maintained and ample workout room.  Shuttle drivers for the Baymont service all the airport satellite hotels and are not employees of Baymont.  My experience was generally favorable except for one extremely discourteous driver.   Great stay.....Recommended",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Decent stay,"High points: close to airport and car rental. Multiple restaurant within walking distance. Bed is comfy and breakfast was decent with a good selection-waffles, eggs, sausage, fruit, scones, cereal, yogurt and coffee.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Fine for sleeping,"Checked in and power went out almost immediately after getting to my room, showered by the light of my phone & cracked the window to cool off room. Made the most of just needing a place to sleep between trips in and out of Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Hidden Gem,"With bigger name hotels and more expensive prices just right next door, I was a little hesitant to spend the night at Baymont Inn.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  It was quiet, clean, easy to check in, and very easy to get to from the airport.  Would definitely recommend it!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,One Night Stay to Catch Flight,"My husband and I stayed here for one night to catch a flight from Denver. Upon entering the room, we were surprised to discover that there wasn't a mini-fridge or microwave. I booked this through my travel agent, and I just assumed the fridge was at least standard for a hotel room. We had a king-size bed and I thought it was comfortable. However, we were in an adjoining room and the people next to us were up at 4AM. Unfortunately, so were we since we could hear everything! The one morning we had the option to sleep in on our vacation and it didn't happen. The breakfast was okay. There were some hot items and lots of carb & gluten packed items. My husband & I are gluten-free, so the choices were limited. But we're used to that by now. I thought this hotel was okay for a night's stay. If it wasn't for the comfortable bed, I would probably just book someplace else.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice stay at the Baymount,"Clean, neat, comfortable, and easy to find.  Desk clerk friendly and available at 2:00 a.m.bed felt fabulous after a long day of traveling.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not family friendly enough for our family,"The ""energy efficient"" bathroom light left us all in the dark every time we used it. Housekeeping was knocking on our door by 9:30 Sunday morning asking what time  we would be checked out. Not what we were looking for on a family vacation. Highly recommend spending a little more on accommodations for a nicer visit to Denver.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont @ Denver Airport,Good location if you are transiting Denver airport.  Far out of town and just a couple of restaurant choices.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,overnight stay close to airport,Just an overnight stay before an early morning flight.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable.  Quiet hallway also.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Comfy room awful breakfast,"Breakfast was served until 9am but by 0830 they had run out of everything and there was a serious lack of seating and under Denver law you can't take your breakfast to the room.Suite was a decent size, bed comfortable and bathroom clean.For one night after a long flight across the Atlantic it was ok, anything longer and I recommend staying somewhere else.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient and a good value,"The location was great, it had a nice breakfast, and the shuttle was exactly on time as promised.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Quiet hotel near DIA,We chose the Baymont because it is close to DIA and affordable for the area. Very courteous staff and clean rooms. Prompt shuttle to DIA in the morning and $5/day to park our car while we were away. We had a pleasant evening before our trip and would stay there again.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,It was a very nice and clean place. Breakfast was good. It...,It was a very nice and clean place. Breakfast was good. It was also close to everything. The only thing that I had a problem with was the friendliness of the staff. When I asked to have a late checkout (being a diamond member of Wyndham Reward Points)  I thought this was a benefit) they were not very nice and wanted to charge me a fee to stay any extra time. ,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Bad Floor System!,"Everything was good...check-in, comfortable bed, cleanliness, staff.  We tried to catch a nap after check-in since we had a very early morning flight the next day but it sounded like a herd of elephants was above us-we decided it must be the cleaning crew but about 9 at night the same thing happened-I finally called the desk asking what was going on as we were on the 3rd floor with only 1 above us.  Taking the shuttle at 3:45 the next morning several people on there had the same problem, all on different floors so my opinion is the floor system is cheaply and poorly put together.  Sad because everything else was very good!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Denver Baymont Inn & Suites,Carpet had noticeable stains.  Desk chair cloth seat had spots and stains and would not rise - had to use pillows to set on to comfortably work on laptop at desk.  Bathroom tub/shower grout was rusty looking in places.  Upon checkout had to request a copy of the bill - was not offered.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Hotel among hotels,Can't say much good about this hotel. Some of the staff were courteous and some weren't.  We had issues with the A/C but perhaps that was 2nd room we had to move to.  This is a bare bones hotel at a good rate compared to all the large chain hotels in the immediate area. Hotel room was clean and bed was comfortable. The breakfast buffet was the absolute minimum for a large hotel of this size. very disappointed.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,VERY underwhelming,"I found this hotel a disappointment for the cost of the room. It was not very clean and was somewhat rundown. The breakfast had very limited options and there was no milk, and no one replaced it when told it was out. There were many hotels in the imediate area and I wish I would have chosen a different one.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Clean, quiet, and convenient to the airport","My family (two adults and one child) stayed at this property the night before our morning flight out of DIA. The staff were friendly and helpful (the morning desk clerk lent us a luggage scale so we could check the weight of our bags), the pool was well maintained, and the room was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. (The only negative is that the ""high-speed"" Internet was actually very slow that day, but it did not affect us so badly that we felt we needed to bring it to the attention of the staff.) The next time we fly in/our of DIA we will definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great stay!,This was a reasonably priced hotel - especially for Denver.  The location was convenient to the airport.  The breakfast was great.  The service was great-very nice lady at the front desk.  The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Affordable Hotel, Nice Breakfast","Two friends and I booked this hotel for our first night in Colorado before leaving for Breckenridge the next day. We were not disappointed . There was a hotel shuttle, offered through Western Transportation, to get us from the airport to the hotel. Note: The shuttle is free, though the drivers appreciate voluntary tips. The hotel is actually rather modern, which I didn't expect. You have to insert a card into a holder by room door in order to power the lights and the HVAC system. The mattresses and pillows are comfortable compared to many budget to mid-range hotels in which I've stayed. Bathrooms are spacious. I will note that I had some trouble with the shower drain not draining water from the tub as fast as I would've liked, but that was the only mishap with the room that I remember. Breakfast is a step above continental, as scrambled eggs and sausage are available. The breakfast here was actually a step above some of the more luxurious hotels at which we stayed in Colorado. Staff is friendly and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Poorly run hotel,"I'll usually cut a hotel a lot of slack, but I can't do that for this Baymont Hotel location. Check-in went smoothly. My husband left to do errands so I stayed in the room. I noticed a long dark hair on the bed, but I know misses happen occasionally. Then I noticed a hole in the carpet, and some small wall damage. I could live with that.  Then I noticed there was no plug in the sink drain. Well, we were just staying for one night, so no big deal. Settled into bed for the night and found a remote UNDER the sheets. Obviously, the bed had not been changed. Called the front desk to request a maid. ""Sorry, Housekeeping is gone for the day."" (It was 8:30pm on a Friday.) I asked to speak with the manager. ""Sorry, there is no manager here."" The desk clerk was the only one at the desk, and she was the only employee who could help me. I was flabbergasted. I asked for a different room, which she arranged. She actually LEFT the front desk to help me move our luggage to the new room. I showed her what I'd found. She said it was disgusting, and there was no justification for it. The new room seemed clean, so we stayed. However, no one followed up with in the morning, which just confirmed what we already thought: management just didn't care.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wonderful property,"We made this reservation eight months ago.   We have a very early flight and wanted to be near the airport.   From check-in to check-out we experienced first-class treatment.  The hotel is lovely, very clean and comfortable.   We had a suite on the second floor which was well-appointed with everything you could need for your stay.   We recommend this hotel with the highest regard.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Really wanted to rate it 3 1/2...,"Lovely, newer Inn conveniently located near airport.Breakfast buffet was average.Really disappointed there was noMini fridge and microwave..thus my 3 1/2 star rating.Outside of that, don't see how you can go wrong here!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good value and good location,"Used this for a one night stop when we first arrived in Denver.  There is a free shuttle bus from the airport,  check in was quick and straight forward and the room was lovely and clean and comfortable.  Just the thing after a long flight.  Breakfast was nothing special.",4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Hotel,"I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. The airport shuttle was outside my terminal upon arrival (no waiting).  The bed was comfortable.  The hair conditioner in the amenity kit was great.  If I had to complain about something, it might be that they only have one front desk person working.  The line can get pretty long at night.  Overall a great stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Adaquate nothing special,"Service was friendly, breakfast was typical, but boring after a couple of days no variety.  Rooms were neat, but maintenance was lacking; toilet seat nearly fell off, corners of floors were dirty appearing to be quick only once over cleanings.NOTE: do not prepay as hotel does not provide refunds on shortened stays and refers you to unknown third parties that processes payments.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Hotel is fine for what it is,"Hotel has airport shuttle, free breakfast.  Room was clean.  Convenient location with many other airport hotels.  A couple of restaurants you can walk to in or near the development.  Room was quiet.  I missed having a fridge and safe in the room.  I normally don't notice the pillows but I did not love the ones they have in the rooms-small and not especially comfortable. I would suggest looking at photos of the room so you have reasonable expectations of the hotel.  Reasonably priced for what you get.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Airport Overnite,Clean and friendly for overnight stay. If you leave very early for the airport don't expect breakfast. The rates do not include any free nights of parking while you are gone.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great airport location,We stayed 6 nights here.  We used the airport shuttle to catch the light rail downtown.  It was a good location to take our day trips.  The hotel was clean and staff were friendly.  My only concern was the breakfast- the breakfast room was too small for the amount of people staying there.  We ended up eating in the lobby a couple times.  2 mornings they ran out of the eggs and sausage.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Fine airport hotel,I spent one night here as I flew into Denver pretty late. The check-in process went smooth. Rooms are spacious and beds are good.Negative point: The hallway smelled like Indian food. And not just a little bit. This was both in the evening and in the morning so not just from someone just walking through.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Rip Off,"I thought I was getting my money's worth for $134 for the night, but this hotel is below par. The beds are hard as a rock and the room has no refrigerator or microwave. There is no hot tub either. It is only a Continental breakfast in the morning.  For comparison,  I looked at the Red Lion that's close and for $116 they offer the above ammenties that are lacking,  plus a hot breakfast. (Prices are from hotels.com)",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Stay,This hotel is convenient to the airport.  They have a company that provides free transportation to and from Denver International Airport.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Staff members were helpful.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent night sleep,"This hotel is in the mega hotel area near airport. Very convenient if you have a rental car or need a shuttle. Comfortable bed, though pillows were too fat. No microwave or fridge, but who needs one for one night stay. Two good restaurants within easy walking distance but otherwise no food unless some of the other hotels have restaurants. Free breakfast was just okay...mostly carbs. Room was large, very clean and well furnished.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wonderful Choice,The Denver area has a lot of choices to pick from. We selected this based on location and other reviews. We made a good choice and would go back here again when in the area. It's a lovely property that looks to be fairly new. Everything was immaculate and very well maintained throughout. Our room had a desk and chair as well as a comfortable side chair for reading or TV viewing. The TV was a large flat screen. Our room didn't have a microwave or refrigerator which was no problem as we never use them anyway. There was an elevator also. Stay here and you won't be sorry. Very convenient to stores and restaurants.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Cancelled reservation?,"I made a reservation at the Denver Airport Baymont Hotel over 6 weeks prior to my stay.  When I arrived they said my reservation had been cancelled.  I did not cancel my reservation and had never received a cancellation email.  At first, the front desk told me they were completely full.  When I pushed, they gave me a room that they were holding for emergencies (I assume).  So, I was pleased with the service for giving me that room as I was quite tired from driving 8 hours.The room was clean and there was plenty of parking.  I did not eat breakfast so I do not have any comments on breakfast, which opened at 6am on a Friday.I would stay here again as the price was good for the Denver airport hotels.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Business stat,Overall my stay was excellent.  The front desk staff worked to get me checked in early to facilitate my schedule for a meeting.  The Internet was great -- it carried my video conference call with no connect losses.  Great location from Denver airport.  The room was clean and met my expectations,5

The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The bathtub drain was not draining quickly so there was standing water for my quick shower. It was a little odd having to use a separate card to be able to adjust the thermostat.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Stayed one night,"It turned out to be a nice hotel. Only complaint had to do with air conditioner.  I'm sure it was just an adjustment.  It never seemed to turn on all night,so it did seem warm.  Staff very helpful and nice, room was clean.  Offered transport to air port following morning.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great location,"We stayed here on a stopover to California. Hubby cannot fly straight across country so we have to do it in ""hops"". Good location, just 30 minutes to Golden,  and right off interstate. The rooms were nice- the breakfast bar fine- just crammed with people and food not kept stocked. Also at exactly 9am (?) when the breakfast time was over the rude girl took away the coffee and when asked she said it would be outside later. The front desk people were OK- not overly friendly- and not open to helping out with directions.  If room hadn't been clean and neat it would have gotten a lower rating.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,good for early departures,"We stayed here our last night in the US. Hotelshuttle running every 30-40Min. Shuttle quite small for the tour Airport Hotel on Monday evening, but driver made the best out of it. Check in smooth but somehow rude. More like a check in at Barracks then in a hotel. (so i can't give 5 Tripadvisor stars as requested on cards at check in) Rooms clean and quite new. Breakfast ok. Hotel Airport Shuttle on Tuesday morning was adapted to amount of people, took only about 15Min with 1 Stop at other hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Disappointed,"Our room smelled like someone smoked a joint the night before and the hotel was sold out so we couldn't even change rooms. They didn't even offer a discount. The bed was comfortable enough, if your only needing a place to sleep one night then it'll do.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,unimpressive,"The room was average.  It was clean and the window offered a good view.  The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were hard and uncomfortable.  The access to the energy efficiency power system of the room was bizarre and over complicated.  The TV  did not operate like a normal one, and it lacked a channel guide of any kind thus making finding channels difficult.  Staff was mediocre.  There were no restaurants within easy walking distance.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Quick overnight ,"Hotel was fine , clean rooms and grounds . Mediocre all around. Nothing to be wowed by. Good for a overnight before the airport . We had an exhaust fan that was loud in the bathroom. Couldn't sleep that well unless we closed bathroom door to drown out the noise ",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Comfortable and Quiet,"We enjoyed our stay.  The check-in and check-out was good.  Room was roomy, clean and quiet.  They offered an airport shuttle and a few breakfast items at 3:15 am.  Did not use the pool or exercise room but did use equipment to print airline tickets.  A few Resturants near hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great place to stay around airport.,Stayed overnight with a great rate. All was good but you could tell the staff could use help. They all went about business and got work done but no interaction with guest unless approached. They lady who did the breakfast said nothing.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,IT WAS OK,"The hotel was fine, clean etc. The main complaint was the food for breakfast. There was a regular sign over the meat area that said out of meat today. I think it was a prominent sign. No fruit. We got there towards the middle to end of the breakfast. There should still be food available. ",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean and Comfortable,"My room was clean and comfortable.  Front desk was friendly, check in and check out was very easy.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Room issues,I had my own room and my friends shared a room. The fan in my bathroom buzzed and buzzed --an awful noise. Maintenance was gone for the day. Did not ask for another room because I wanted to be by my friends The next am my friend found a bug in her bed. Bed bug?  Who knows?  She took it to the front desk. Was given a 60% discount and the room was shut down. Should have been free. Asked if I could get a discount for the bathroom fan. Nope So many hotels by the airport in Denver. Don't choose this one,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not clean,"The room was missing the thermostat and had been sprayed with something that irritated our eyes.  Later we discovered the bed covers were filthy and the sheets themselves not too clean.  When we notified the front desk, they did immediately move us to another room that appeared clean, but it is hard to have faith in a hotel that would put us in such a gross room to start with.  Unfortunately all the other hotels nearby were fully booked, so we had to spend the night there.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice hotel,"This hotel was great, love the location with plenty of parking.. Will recommend this to anyone traveling by plane from dia.. Will stay here again when in the area.     Go Broncos, let's win another Superbowl champions..",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Extremely Poor Customer Service,"We had booked at Baymont Inn but ended up cancelling our room long before the date we had booked.  They proceeded to charge us for the room as a no show.  Errors do happen and so we called them. No one seems to care about correcting the situation.  We have  called and e-mailed and they promise to take care of the situation (File # 3714934) but nothing happens. We have not had an e-mail or call back from them. This occurred at the end of August and we were assured that it would be resolved by September 4. If this is the way you deal with hotel guests, we will never deal with this chain again.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent Airport Hotel,"Our suite was very large, very clean and extremely quiet.  The airport shuttle worked beautifully. Check-in and check-out was quick and efficient.  They even had a limited breakfast selection out for those of us on the 4;25 am shuttle. Lots of hot coffee, too! Would highly recommend Baymont at the airport.",5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nearly but not quite,"We recently stayed here on the 1st night of our holiday and,again,2 weeks later,on the last night.By chance,they had given us the same suite both visits.I had booked a suite which was very nice and very clean,but the sliding wardrobe door was hanging off it's hinge(even 2 weeks later.Arriving in the afternoon,we were glad to see the flasks of coffee and hot water in the lobby,together with teabags etc.However,the water was not even luke warm so I took a cup of it upstairstairs and microwaved it to make a cup of tea.On both visits,the ""hot"" water never got above tepid,even at breakfast!! When asked,the young girl working in the breakfast room got me boiling water from the kitchen.On that 2nd visit,the breakfast room was busy and the young girl couldn't cope...the trash was overflowing,most things had run out..even the bread for toast.I told reception she needed help,which they did.On our 2nd visit,the suite had no coffee in it,no tissues in the bathroom and only 2 paper cups.The bed was sumptuous but the numerous ""pillows"" were no bigger than scatter cushions and a nightmare to sleep with.The excellent free shuttle bus to and from the airport is a huge bonus,running every 35 minutes.A few eating places within a 15 minute walk but this is really only somewhere to stay the night you arrive or the night before you fly.",4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wonderful ,"Love this place ,rooms are clean, breakfast excellent,  eggs, bacon or sausage, muffins Danish, cereal, yogurt and fruit.

Free washer and dryer just bring the suds and bounce.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Staff very unfreindly,The hotel is convent. Front desk staff was very unfreindly when we checked out. I asked a question about the bill. I guess people cannot do that at this hotel.,2

King bed, chair,desk and chair.Their was no book on the hotel or restaurants in the area .The T.V. was dated with no listing for local or national channel lineups.The second day we went down for breakfast and this was at 7:00 AM their was no meat choice just a sign it was not available someone was doing their job the hotel had a lot of disappointed guests.A newer train stop is about mile away but when i asked the desk person he sent me to a station 4 miles away which was busy,so on my own exploring i went to the newer and less congested station.Their are a lot of hotel options in this area do your homework and check for the best offers sometimes not just the best price",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Did clean room,"I had to wait to get checked in, breakfast wasn't very good the 1st he room wasn't cleaned very good and no new towels, 2nd night they didn't even try to clean room",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice hotel,"This was a very nice, modern hotel with clean rooms but our room was really small. There wasn't much room for our toiletries and only a small ""closet"" area to keep our bags. Breakfast was very good but they kept running out of coffee and there weren't enough places to sit.There's a rule that we aren't allowed to take the breakfast food to your room so my kids had to sit on the floor in the lobby to eat their breakfast . This would be a great place for a couples or solo stay but I wouldn't recommend it for a family.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Short but Sweet,Very nice accommodations!  Only stayed for just over 12 hours since I was flying out the next morning; but very comfortable.  Employees were nice.  Glad I was able to use partial points to trim the cost down.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Okay Stay,Low lobby ceiling and narrow hallways and elevator lobbies made the hotel seem less attractive than we expected from the Yelp reviews.  The breakfast menu lacked oatmeal; it would have been nice if even instant oatmeal were offered.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Best value at DIA .,Best park and fly experience and value at DIA! No worries leaving your vehicle. Rooms always clean and comfortable.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Horrid avoid at all costs,"I booked my reservation through Expedia. Upon my arrival the lady at the front desk advised me that their system was down. To find a king bed that I had reserved, we literally went from room to room on the 3rd floor looking for a king bed while others waiting to check in waited. None found. Eventually given a key to a room on the 1st floor, but the key would not unlock the door to the room because the system was down. The key operated only the AC in the room which never came on. Having no key to the room, I was stranded unless I found a manager with a key to let me back in my room. Very poor control over the premises. I was locked into my room until I checked out the following morning. I will never stay here again!",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very good! ,"Hotel was really nice, new and clean. Staff was friendly and helpful! Bed was comfy, room on 4th floor had an ok view. I enjoyed staying here! Only thing I would change is have a mini fridge in the room. Pool is nice! It was also nice to be outside of downtown Denver, it's about 20 min away. If you want to be staying in the center of all the action, this hotel may not be for you, since it can get expensive to uber to and from Denver. We had a rental and drive was close. Will definitely stay again next time I go to Denver. the pic is a view from my window, it was nice to be in the open! By remember, nothing is really in walking distance except for a few restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good Service,"Had a lay over, late night but we were picked up and delivered to the Baymont by the service that hotels offer.  The room was well kept and comfortable.  Picked up again in the morning to catch an early flight.  We do like Baymont.  We were even able to get coffee and a quick breakfast before leaving even though it was before breakfast hours.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Pretty good,"Not bad at all.  Breakfast is good, not healthy but still better then nothing. Front dest very helpful and nice.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great place... Eco friendly...,"We stayed before checking into our conference hotel. Very near airport, standard breakfast included, looked brand new.  Very clean.. Upstairs at 4 AM patron was heavy footed. Stay nearer top floor. Energy controlled by card inserted into wall slot when entering. This allows control of AC  or heat. Shower heads control flow but are very sufficient.  Good price and value",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Pillows suck! Rooms noisy & I'm laying here wide awake!,"This place has horrible pillows! After spending 7 nights in different hotels from Las Vegas, to Salt Lake City, to to Jackson Hole, to the Grand Teton National Park to Steamboat Springs to Denver, I can honestly say this is the worst hotel for their pillows & the worst one for the fan noise on the heater/air. The bed is comfortable and the parking is convenient but they really need different pillows! These small lumps are costing me my sleep & I have to get up at 4! It didn't help that the last person here set the alarm for midnight & my husband & I jolted up out of a dead sleep! The fan for the wall a/c is humming away & kicking on & off like a jet plane & these tiny pillows feel like balled up material in a pillowcase! Thumbs down to this place!",2

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Bus Trip # 2 Day 2,Staying in a very nice room (212). Entire hotel is very energy controlled! Air conditioning works great. Desk clerks were very busy and not friendly! Breakfast was normal and seating area to small for the size of the hotel! People had to stand in lobby and hold their plates. Several restaurants in walking distance. No micro wave or refrigerator in rooms.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Clean, roomy and convenient",We spent one night here to be close to the airport for an early flight. The hotel was clean. The room was spacious and comfortable. The hotel was very close to the airport. The staff were very friendly. I would recommend this hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Perfect if you need to be near the airport.,"I booked this room mainly for its location near the Denver airport. It proved to be a good decision. The man who checked me in was a hospitality all star. Happy to help me,eager to answer questions,and genuinely concerned with our experience at his motel. The airport shuttle ran flawlessly,the room was decent,and breakfast was alright too. I'd stay here anytime I needed to be near the airport. It was a pleasant stay and a decent value for the price.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Extremely poor customer service and unfriendly desk staff,"I had a reservation and when I arrived at 10pm the parking lot was roped off with no possibility to get close to unload my 5 pieces of luggage.  Lobby was filled with very unhappy customers as I read taped signs to the door and at desk that renovations were beginning next day so no parking in lot and street parking would be towed.  When checking in the desk clerks were less than friendly or helpful.  I was lucky they had my room as I watched two couples behind me be turned away b/c they didn't have their rooms even though they had a reservation.  I waited for a cart as there were none around and got a small, less than helpful cart.  I lugged all my stuff from across the street to the room and asked if that was the only cart b/c I would need one at 6:30am when I left for airport.  She said they had 5 so the rest must be in people's room (which I considered taking one for my room to guarantee myself a cart but felt terrible for all those arriving lugging their luggage down and across the street as I had.  As suspected, at 6:20 when I looked for a cart there were none to be found and none being used.  When I voiced my concerns to the clerk, he said they all must be in rooms...sorry.  I had to make 3 trips from my room on the 2nd floor to my car across and down the street carrying it all.  Worst hotel experience I've encountered to date and everyone in hotel felt the same as all customers were bonding in the halls, breakfast room, etc over the horrible experience at The Baymont Inn at Denver International Airport.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,No confirmation on cancellation - did I pay for it anyway?,"I did book the hotel, did get the confirmation, but unfortunately became ill and needed an operation.Tried to cancel the booking several times, but never received  confirmation on my cancellation. Now I am afraid that I have been charged for the room after all.I have no idea, how the hotel is and surely hope that I am not paying for something I did cancel.I find it outrageious that my cancellTion has not been confirmed in spite of several remInders.",1

However the clerk at the front desk was very helpfull  in getting my family checked in... the breakfeast was not very appealing...",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Disappointed,I was disappointed. I booked this hotel because they provided parking while traveled. When I arrived I was told I couldn't leave my vehicle because they were going to be working on their lot. I paid 200 for the room and 72 more for parking. The pillows were very hard and large.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very helpful staff,"Clean & basic accommodations, with friendly and helpful staff. Does the trick if you arrive late or have an early flight from DIA.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean and comfortable,"Had to wait quite a while for an airport shuttle, even after calling the hotel, but the check-in was quick and the room was very clean and comfortable.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Bad Service,"I had reserved two doubles. One was available at check in time. Had to wait THREE hours for the other. Desk clerk was truly over his head. When I got the receipt, there was an one hundred forty-six dollar difference in the total cost of the rooms. I called the hotel. They said there was nothing that THEY, the site, could do. I told them just to refund the money. Reverse the charges to my card. They said no. The next day I called the customer help line. They first said there was nothing that they could do except offer me six thousand Wyndham Points. Would I be satisfied. I said Hell No! I want my one hundred forty six dollars back! It actually belonged to the church. I told them this. They transferred me to another division that REQUIRED me to go to the bank connected with the card used. Get transaction statement. Email it to them(I had to send it three times), and wait twenty-three days! I am furious!! To be offered six thousand Wyndham ""hush points"" as if I was a two bit prostitute, was most humiliating! I need way more than ""six thousand"" Wyndham Points to begin to erase the crappy experience. To wait that many days for a refund of monies that were charged in error is horrible. I was never told why the error took place!! Just happened! Really? I expect some compensation more than six thousand points. I remain upset. Bishop Charles L. Jackson. 428 Badger Creek Drive. Brighton, CO 80601. 720.561.0478. So unnecessary. And I am a Wyndham Points Member.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Conveniently close stay to Denver airport,"Family friendly property.  Good breakfast.  Conveniently located to airport.  Within walking distance to restaurants.  Shuttle service TO the airport was good, but inadequate for pick up FROM airport.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very spacious and affordable ,Me and my family stayed for a night in this hotel because we have an early flight the next day. The suite we had was very spacious and very clean. I loved the pillows and I hope they can help me with what brand they are so I can have one at home. The free shuttle service to the airport was very prompt and got on time without a problem. I recommend this hotel for anyone who will be looking for a peaceful and comfortable place to stay near the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A very pleasant surprise,"Quick facts: Pros: Spotless new facility (or at least appears to be), convenient airport shuttle, large guest rooms, free breakfast Cons: Sort of in the middle of nowhere, vending machines out of many items, free breakfast only until 9:00  I didn't intend on spending the night in Denver but I missed my connection and needed a room for the night so I booked this hotel via hotels.com without having done any of my usual research.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about.  The shuttle picked me up at the airport and was at the hotel in less than fifteen minutes.  I was checked in quickly and got to my room which was enormous and nicely furnished for what seemed like a basic place.  The bed was extremely comfortable and I got a much-needed good night's rest.  Unfortunately, this is…",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wonderful hotel,"We stay here two nights.  We did this to acclimate to the altitude before heading up the Idaho Springs to the cabin that we rented.  We took the shuttle back to the airport in the second day to catch the light rail to downtown Denver.  This system is very user friendly.  The hotel has an indoor pool, but it feels about 100 degrees when you step into the area.  Not very inviting.  Otherwise the breakfast was great, just wished they served it later than 9:oo am.  Would stay here again if return to Denver. ",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Easy access fromDenver International Airport,My king sized bed room was comfortable and clean. The lack of refrigerator and microwave was missed as most hotels anymore have in room. Shower curtain was torn and water wanted to splash onto the floor. You use your card to access htg/ac which is a nice touch. Nothing special about the included breakfast but it was adequate.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice room for the price~,"This room was very comfortable and peaceful.  Beds were cozy, nice toiletries, good breakfast choices.  The coffee was pretty good and the hotel was very clean and tidy.  The shuttle services was a great addition too!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,7,I don't recommend anything to anyone The price could be a but cheaper  I'm canadian ant that made the say expensive,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Staff Unacceptable,We liked the location & accommodations but the staff was not very accommodating or helpful when we had a family member slip & fall in the elevator.  They were not at all compassionate but scrambling to have us sign a waiver!,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great location for airport,"We stayed here the night before our flight home from Denver. Very helpful staff, sufficient breakfast and easy access/shuttle to the airport. While you might feel you are in the middle of nowhere, there is a terrific diner close by for take-out or eat in dining. ",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great service!,I booked the hotel room at the last minute due to a flight delay where I landed in Denver at 3am instead of 9am.  The front desk receptionist was extremely helpful and welcoming. The room was clean and very comfortable. ,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very generic average hotel,Easy check in but not much welcoming dialog from the receptionist. Room is fine.  Clean.    Worse pillows ever though.  TV remote needed batteries.  I took it down to front desk and they replaced the batteries but I guess they could not get the cover back on.  Remote returned to me with black duct tape holding the batteries in.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not what you ecpect from a Wydham a Hotel!!!,"Staff had too many responsibilities, expected to solve Internet, housekeeping issue. housekeeping needs assistance. When we checked in they were still working, didn't have time or energy to vacuum hallway, can't speak for other floors. Plastic, paper an Littered the hall. The hallways are  warm the hotel has strict sutility control.  Breakfast was certainly not good,,, stay at the Hyatt if you want an outstAnding breakfast. You might pay more but the rooms are clean. The staff courteous and knowledgable.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Insufficient Space and Food at Breakfast,"The room was too small to accommodate the guests, no yogurt was available, bagels were frozen forcing guests to use their hands to separate them. Could hear noise from other rooms and no outlet in the bathroom.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Going downhill,Stayed here about 3 years ago and it was very nice but on a recent trip I noticed that the facility has lost a lot of it's gleamThe check-in process was hampered by the fact only one person was helping people but she was dealing with a problem on the phone for 10 minutes while we waited to check in.Total check in time was nearly 20 minutes.The free airport transfer bus only ran every 40 minutes with an additional stop at another hotel property. Unacceptable for the morning rush. Repeat 40 minutes.The phone in the room did not work and I had to call the front desk to report the problem. I wanted a wake up call because I could not afford to miss the bus.They did not repair it as promised. Never called back because the phone was broken.Glad I had my cell phone as a back upThe free breakfast was not ready at the printed time of 530 as shown on the room info sheet. It did not open till 6AM. The selection was pitiful and was not even fully in operation at 6AM.Pretty sad property . Cutting costs by cutting hours and service is not a good way to operate a property,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Fantastic stay!!,"We had a wonderful experience at the Baymont. The room was amazing, the service was great and we loved the location.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Unfriendly and unclean,Pillow cases had a big makeup mark on them with a long hair that wasn't mine! Didn't seem like they washed the sheets at all. Wasn't even asked how my stay was when we checked out. However they did get us in our room quicker then we had expected which was nice.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,It's OK. ,"The hotel is perfectly acceptable for a one night stay for convenience before or after an early/late flight.  Shuttle service from airport to the hotel was terrible - only runs every 30 minutes and then when it finally showed up, it could only accommodate 5 more people when there were about 20 waiting. Ended up taking a cab which cost $22.60 before tip!!",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,15 min from Red Rocks Amphitheater ,"Excellent place to stay. It shares parking (and ownership, I believe) with a Quality Inn, so finding a spot after the concert was a bit of a challenge, but we found one. The bed was comfortable with thick, fluffy pillows. The shower was excellent. Even full, the place was quiet. Guarantee for late check in was well tracked.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Pre-flight stay,"I booked this hotel as it was the least expensive in the immediate Denver International Airport area. I didn't expect the hotel to be as nice as it was. The room was large and quite clean. The only feature I didn't care for was having the sink in the entryway of the room, rather than enclosed.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Just the usual,Nothing really special and nothing really bad either.  The rooms are fine and the beds are comfortable.  Didn't hear noises outside of our room so that was a huge plus. We went down to breakfast a little before 8:00 on a Wednesday and it was a slim selection. People had to ask for things to be refilled and it wasn't done in a rush.  The waffle batter was out of order which is real negative when traveling with a 9 year old.  I guess I would stay again if traveling via the Denver airport but get down to breakfast early!,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Overpriced, slow shuttle","The hotel is clean and the rooms are spacious, but it isn't worth the price. The location is near all the airport hotels, but you need Uber to get anywhere but the airport. You can take their shuttle to the airport and grab the light rail to downtown but it will double your time and cost $9 per person.The shuttle is infrequent and we waited for 80 minutes at the airport. The shuttle is shared by several hotels, but the one shared by Holiday and Days Inns came several times before ours.Also, the Internet was awful. I was dropped off several times.Overall: if you want to do anything in Denver, don't stay at the airport hotels.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Dirty and grim, poorly managed","Book elsewhere. This hotel is in poor condition and visibly dirty in both the common areas and guest rooms. The carpets are badly in need of simple vacuuming, foul smells pervade the air, the bed linens had stray hairs on them, hairs in the bathrooms, etc.  It took three tries to get a room that was clean enough (at least I hope) to stay the night. The front desk staff were kind and helpful but this hotel needs a major management overhaul. Take it from me and avoid this hotel at all costs.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Surprised and quick customer service,"We did not know what to expect as we had never stayed at this brand of hotel before. Check-in was quick and we were in the room within 2 minutes. When we entered our room it smelled like someone had been smoking. When I called the front desk to ask if they had put us in a smoking room we were informed the entire hotel is non-smoking. Immediately the front desk asked me to return and they would give me another room, no questions ask. At the front desk the manager met me to apologize and I heard him tell a staff member to put an ozone machine in the room to kill the orders. Since I have used ozone machines in the yachting business I know they work and will kill the smell within a couple of days. The rest of the stay was good but at breakfast there was a toaster available, just nothing to toast, no bread or bagels even though there was butter and cream cheese???",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very nice place to stay!!,"Was very worried about where we were staying through the weekend but turned out to be a nice place. We stayed in a room with double beds and it was perfect for 2 adults and 2 smaller kids. The pool was nice but a bit stuffy due to no ventilation so we saved swimming until it cooled down in the evenings. The lady at front desk upon check in and check out (same girl both times) was a bit snobby and seemed like she was in a rush. They also have vending machines on most floors which was nice with having 2 kids that seem to eat non stop. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone and will be staying again if we are in the area.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Big Surprise,"The biggest surprise we got arriving that the hotel was that it had won a 2015 award of excellencewe, definitely expected more. Has anyone ever been in a hotel with linoleum in the elevator? The room we were staying in had a urine stain on the chair, glaring evidence that the maintenance and cleaning of the hotel was lacking. The breakfast room is clearly not able to accommodate all the guests, better get there early. We had booked this same hotel for our return and immediately started looking for an alternate. My husband contacted to hotel manager to tell him we would not be returning and to the managers credit he arranged for a bigger slightly better maintained room for our return stay. The hotel is convenient to the airport but besides the location, it is a very tired and in need of some serious TLC.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,As a customer you are not important ! Worst customer service.,"we stayed in the hotel on June 22nd, I made a reservation on a credit card and when i checked out the second day i gave them a different credit card, and asked the clerk to cancel the charge on the first credit card. Now I am charged on tow credit cards , i called many times to get this problem resolved with no results, I he left number of messages to the general manager to call me back , so far no response.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Was charged an extra $80 for parking when I was told it was included in my rate.,"Honestly, I would have given this motel a 4 rating if it hadn't been for the fact that I was quoted a rate that was suppose to include park and fly.  I booked 2 rooms and ended up paying an extra $40 per room for the park and fly option.  I called customer care and they assured someone would be in touch with me within 24 hours, but I never heard from anyone.  I will not stay at this property again",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Decent hotel,Quite a good layover hotel as it's very convenient to the Airport with large rooms and comfortable beds. There is no restaurant on site but there are some good choices all within 5 minutes walk. They are on the airport shuttle route as well so all things considered it would be hard to find anything better.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good for a layover,"Hotel is at a good location, close to the airport, shuttle service every 30-40 min or on demand. Rooms are clean, comfortable. A good spot if you are on a budget and want to be close to the shuttle transportation.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient to Denver Airport,This hotel is reasonably priced and had all the amenities needed to catch a flight out of the Denver Airport. The rooms were comfortable and clean. They offer a free shuttle to the airport which is more than the more expensive hotels I looked into did.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean and comfortable...,"Unless you can afford to stay at the new Westin, right at Denver International, any ""airport"" stay will involve a shuttle trip about 8kms / 15 minutes drive from the airport.  Unless you catch the new A Line train from the airport in to the city.  Even arriving at 1/2 past midnight, I was still able to have a pickup from the complimentary shuttle bus, after collecting my bags.  Just be aware that the shuttle only runs every 30 to 40 minutes or so, and each bus will service 3 or 4 hotels, but they all have the hotel names on them.  The check-in was fairly standard, as it was close to 1.30am by the time I arrived, so just he night manager on duty was there.  But I was given all the information I needed, and a booking for the return shuttle to the airport also made.  The room was…",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Over night stop,"Shuttle from airport to hotel was a little confusing (different colors, first one that stopped(gray) told us to wait for a blue one. Hotel was great, shuttle back to the airport was right on time ",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Comfy bed after a long flight. ,Just what we needed after delayed arrival from U.K.  The bed was so comfortable. Breakfast was the usual help yourself affair but tasty enough. Shuttle to airport was efficient. We did the same last year in Vegas but opted for a cheaper hotel. This was definitely worth the extra.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice clean hotel,"Spent one night here, and it was very nice.  Room was spacious, clean, comfortable, and attractive.  Bed was quite comfortable.  My only objection was that there was no in room refrigerator or micro wave.Next time i am out by the Denver Airport, i will certainly consider staying here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A great experience,"One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in, seems pretty new and up to date. Room was spotless, comfortable, quiet. Great complimentary hot breakfast, great wifi (a rarity in my experience). Didn't use the pool or exercise room but they looked nice as well",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not recommended at all,"There are simple things you expect a hotel to do for the price. This one did not. We asked for 4 towels from housekeeping due to no towels in the pool area so had to use the ones in the room. They never showed.The pool is FREEZING btw. Breakfast...ugh. We went to a dinner the first morning here because the list of 'blehs' were too long. First, the food is very limited. Second, seating is very limited. Third, can't take your food to the room. So I guess go eat at your vehicle lol. We just at cereal be use the hot items are not good.Third last night, got in the shower and no wash clothes. Come on, people. We won't stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Newer hotel located few miles from airport,"We stayed at this hotel after returning from Aspen area in order to catch early morning flight.  Hotel was located in a cluster of about 10 hotels about 8 miles from airport.  There is a 24 hour shuttle from hotel to airport, but you need to schedule when you are going.  We had room with king bed and small sitting area.  Sink was located outside of bathroom so two people could get ready at same time.  Bed was comfortable.  Ruby Tuesday's restaurant located in walking distance.  Not much else located close by so you will need car to get to anything.  I booked this through booking.com and got a price cheaper than most other hotels were offering.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Good Front Desk, OK room","The room was small, with no fridge, and the bathroom light did not work.  Repeated assurances that the maintenance guy would come look resulted in being told that you just had to hit the wall.  Like Fonzie.  Not impressive.  However, later that night, when Gabby was apparently the only employee left in the entire place, she handled the sudden onrush of check-ins and room requests with ease and grace.  She never grumbled about extra pillows, towels for the pool (there were no towels in either the pool or the fitness room), or the constant stream of travelers arriving late into the night.  That said, the morning staff was a joke and the breakfast room was constantly a disaster, missing forks and spoons, running out of waffle batter, and never having enough space for the Denver regulations requiring food to remain in the serving area.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Perfect for an airport hotel,Room was very clean with comfortable bed and selection of pillows.  Shower was hot enough and good flow.  Internet in room was fast and always available never down.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Only the breakfast was not perfect for me it needed more fruit.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,July 11 Stay,Morning and evening hotel front desk personnel not very helpful. Asked for paper receipt and told me it was not possible. Then printed a receipt for next guest to ask. Morning breakfast was very lame.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very Comfortable spacious quiet room,We were sad we had to leave so early to the airport because the bed and pillows were so comfortable.  Nice clean room and very spacious.  They took extra time to make everything in the room good.  Reliable shuttle service helped us return our rental car and get back to the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Pleasantly Surprised,"I have never stayed at a Baymont Inn before, so I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome this hotel was . . .   It was much more inexpensive than other chain hotels in the area and met or exceeded all of my expectations.  Will definitely look for some more Baymonts!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Hotel for a night,"Wie stayed here after the oversea flight for one night. It's clean, quiet with good breakfast. Very comfortable beds. Close to the airport. They have great breakfast and an indoor pool. The check in was friendly and fast.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Clean enough hotel but missing lots of thngs,"We stayed at the Baymont one night. The hotel was clean enough but they were ""short"" on many things. There was coffee in the lobby but no hot water for tea. The computers were never useable for me. There were no towels in the exercise room or pool area. The breakfast wasn't very good - the hot water wasn't hot, the eggs were running and made from powder, many of the apples were rotten. When we saw the sign that said ""sewing kit available"" we thought ""great, we need one"" but there were no sewing kits. Oh, and housecleaning started knocking on our door at 7am. All in all, they seemed to lack all the things that make for a nice stay.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baytown Inn is a pleasant place to stay near Denver Airport.,Baytown Inn & Suites is not fancy but it is convenient if you must be near the airport. It also affords easy access to I-70 and points of interest like the mountains or Colorado Springs. Airport shuttles also are available at no extra charge. The prices are reasonable and a typical hotel breakfast is offered each morning.,4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Terrible Night Auditor -- Worst Hotel Experience EVER,"We booked a night through hotels.com and printed out a receipt for the payment we made. When we arrived at the hotel after a delayed flight into Denver International Airport, the night clerk told us he would not honor our paid reservation because he had already run a report and listed us as a no-show. We said, we are here now and need the room for which we paid. He told us according to the hotel policies that was impossible and tried to get us to pay again for a room for which we had already PAID IN FULL. He was extremely rude and told my family there was nothing he could do. We spent two hours trying to deal with this individual and a staff member at hotels.com tried to reason with him as well. To no avail. We decided to leave and as we were walking out the door he said he would wanted to talk to my husband (not me -- apparently he does not like to talk with women) and ""for the sake of the children"" he would ""give"" us the room we had already paid for. By this time it was five am. The room was fine. This review is based entirely on the poor customer service we received. I tried to get this matter settled by contacting the hotel directly. Brian, the assistant general manager, apologized for what happened and told me he'd call my back within the next day to make things right. I still haven't gotten a call back. He offered to comp us a room at this location but frankly I don't want it. I will never stay there again. I want my money back. My family did not have the ability to use the room as paid for. We were hassled and treated more poorly than I could have ever imagined.  Seriously unbelievable experience.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Reasonable place to stay,Stayed here for 2 nights at start of USA road trip.

This hotel is situated on a street with many airport hotels and restaurants are very close although not walking distance,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Large rooms,"The stay got off to a very bad start when I had to wait an hour at the airport for the shuttle bus; the hotel is 15 minutes away so I'm not sure why there was such a delay.

Breakfast room the next morning had the mini fridge typically full of yogurt but this one was empty, and none in the kitchen.  On the positive side the room was clean and the bed comfortable enough.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Billing process is not standard.,"we made our room reservations in advance for 2 nights.  The total bill was to be $271. Upon checking in, our bill reflected a charge of $301.  I questioned this with the desk clerk and he said it was ""common practice"" to do this.  I checked my Visa bill on-line and it did have a pending charge of $301.  The desk clerk explained that this was to protect against other charges or damages.  I travel a great deal and I have never had this done before.  Why is it necessary?  You have our credit card number, so you are in a position to take care of any problems. Several days after we checked out, the bill was $271, so no additional Mount was charged. I just think this is a very inappropriate way to handle he bill.       ",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great customer service saved us,"We were stranded at DIA due to a hail storm and our pilot timing out on his flyable hours.  Many other flights were also canceled that night. After learning our flight was canceled we started calling hotels. Almost everything was completely booked. The folks at Baymont were very friendly and helpful where many other hotels were not. They immediately sent a (free) shuttle for us and despite the fact that they did not have a room for us right away, they allowed us to stay in their lobby until a room was ready. They gave us breakfast and coffee and had a room ready for us as soon as possible. After a night of waiting on a plane, then the ticket lines to reschedule our flight, these acts of generosity could not be more appreciated. We were not the only group for whom they did this.…",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice,"Comfortable bed, nice room. I left my car there for 10 days, and they only charge $5 per day, and the first day, and pick up day are not charged. So it was only $40. Way better deal than parking at USA parking in Denver. Had an early flight, and the shuttle to the airport starts running at 3:00am.  ",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Nice hotel, no rewards","We stayed at this hotel 4 nights in June while attending a wedding.  The hotel was nice, clean and comfortable.  The problem for me is that the Wyndham chain, which owns this hotel does not award points when you have a discounted rate.  I don't have a lot of money for travel, and when I do travel I try to get discounts, and I try to get points for free nights,  I spent over $450 for 4 nights at this hotel, and was told I don't get points because I had a discounted rate.  I, for one, can't afford to travel when this is the case.  I am a member of other hotel chains reward systems that award points regardless of discounts.  I will be sure to use them in the future and not Wyndham hotels.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Shuttle to and from airport,"We flew in to Denver and was picked up by the free shuttle to the Baymont.

Totally sucked!!!!The breakfast was a joke - two toasters for how many people? The juice machine was broken (a worker had to hold a switch under it to get juice to flow) and no creamer (just little 1/2 and 1/2 junk... plus, the cereal turning mechanism was also broken and a screw fell into my cereal bowl.The room was quiet, that was the only good thing.",2

The shuttle drops off at multiple Wyndham properties. Told another shuttle would be on the way in 15 minutes, again waited 20 minutes. Was able to get on this shuttle. Arrived to the hotel after midnight, checked into the room, a running water sound coming from the bathroom which could be heard from the room. Called down told nothing they could do and turn up the A/C to cancel the noise. Bed was uncomfortable and pillows were not  nice either. Will find somewhere else to stay next time I'm flying in and out of Denver.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A decent place to stay,There are so many choices to make when looking for a hotel at the Denver airport.  The price was right and the hotel was okay.,3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nothing exciting,My only complaints were that they do not have a restaurant or NBC Sports. They actually told me I had to go to the Holiday Inn to watch the Stanley Cup Finals. Not what I feel I should expect with a property affiliated with Wyndham.,3

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Lousy Hotel,"Stayed here 3 nights for a girls week..First night they only emptied our trash and gave up fresh towels. Second night they never even came into our room to clean but we got a note slid under our door.. (see photo below) I wasn't happy to come back to a dirty room after being on a 12 hour mountain tour. So i took my trash up to the front desk and got clean towels to shower with . They where rude and said we are short staffed.Third day before we left for the day I asked if they are going to clean our room and the RUDEST guy at the front desk said "" we'll do what we can"". I wasn't happy but when we got back the room was clean.. I don't think they ever vacuum the hallway either . I seen the same trash there all 5 days! I will NEVER stay at another Baymont Inn again.. Paid over $100 bucks a night for this!",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Gone down hill! ,"Stayed here two years ago and it was amazing,so my family and I came back. This stay is anything but!!! The overnight front desk staff is amazing and helpful, but that's where it ends. We have been here 6 days and only seen housekeeping twice. The trash is over flowing, dirty towels piling up and the carpet needs vacuuming. I've resorted to piling it up in the hall. I've had to go to the front desk every night for toilet paper and towels, as well as trash bags. I should get paid for doing the maids job. I'm only getting two stars because of the amazing night staff or if based on housekeeping  would have been no stars.*Update* day 7Next day! Was told by manager it would be cleaned at 10:30am. We left at 8:30 got back at 12:30 and still wasn't done. So we've been hanging out in lobby.  We aren't  the only ones either several people have asked for the housekeeping managers name and number!Finally got done at 2pm.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,perfect for our overnight stay near the airport,"We got into Denver around 9 pm and needed a place to stay for the one night as we were going to leave early the next day for our final destination. So I got online to search for a reasonable hotel at a reasonable price near the airport. The Baymont was perfect for us.We had no problem finding the hotel from our rent a car pick up location, and it was located with many others very close to the airport. The check-in was easy and quick, and the staff on duty was courteous and efficient.The room was very clean, and everything worked well. We got a very good nite sleep, and then enjoyed the small breakfast buffet the next day. Again we found the staff courteous and the breakfast room was clean as was the buffet. My one ""complaint"" was no free morning newspaper, but no big deal. We didn't use the rest of the facilities, but the pool seemed nice.It was one of the most reasonably priced hotels by the airport, and because of the cleanliness, the courteous nature of the staff, and the low price, it was perfect for us.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Pick another hotel,"The hotel itself would be ok, if it were very cheap, because then you would accept certain things. But it's not cheap at all and, compared to other branded hotels in the same price category, absolutely not worth it. The rooms are so small that you cannot find space to open two suitcases. There is no fridge!!! There were two telephones, both of which were not working. The walls are paper thing, i.e. you can hear everything your neighbors next to you and above you are doing - horrible!!! Cleaners do not vacuum or clear hard to get to corners and they do not respect the ""eco policy"", i.e. a sign says ""If you do not wish your towels to be replaced, just leave them hanging on the rack"". So we did, but they were changed anyways. So why have an ""eco policy"" when it's not respected?! The worst is the airport shuttle. It's a shared shuttle service between 3 or 4 hotels in the same area. It would be nice to know that because the shuttle makes a lot of stops, which makes the trip to and from the airport quite long, especially because the Baymont Hotel is the last on the list! A little note from the hotel tells you that there is a shuttle from the airport every 30 min. We waited 45 min and another family had waited 1 hr. What's more, there was not enough space on the shuttle for everybody waiting, so people started fighting. That's not the experience you want to have after a long and exhausting flight! Neither did we want to have that experience after returning our rental car the evening before departure. And this doesn't seem to be an exception. As people started fighting over onboard space, the driver only said ""Don't complain to me. There's nothing I can do. It's often like that. I recommend you talk to the owner."" The owner of what, the hotel or the shuttle service? Overall, very disappointing for an airport hotel, for which an excellent airport shuttle service is essential! I would never stay there again. There are a lot of airport hotels in this area, so I can only recommend that you book another one, definitely not Baymont Inn!!!",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Summer time ,"Great hotel for the price, comfort, clean and great hot breakfast, scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, waffles, cereal,fruit pastries for you or a whole family.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Generally very good,"Wife and I stayed for 5 days while in Denver and generally was very good.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Lovely hotel,"We use this motel when we fly in from overseas and must spend the night before getting a flight home.   It always feels like luxury walking into the large, lovely room compared with the small European hotel rooms.   ""Ah, it's good to be home.""   Not to mention the American shower.   And it was so QUIET after spending many nights on busy, noisy streets in Europe.   The free airport shuttle is great.  The breakfast buffet has more variety than most, though there's not much for a heart-healthy diet, as usual.  Our stay was made all the sweeter because we had a free night under the Wyndham Rewards plan.   We hope to stay here many more times.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Fine for 1 Night, Cramped for a family","We stayed here one night after an arrival to Denver before the last leg of our trip in CO. It was clean and everyone was friendly. The free breakfast was well-stocked and yummy. There were incredible cookies at check-in. Loved the fitness room and thought it had a nice amount of space and I enjoyed that I could change the temperature control in the fitness room (no free-weights or strength machines, though. Cardio only).The room itself was very small for other rooms that our family has stayed in for the same price. I found it was noticeably cramped for my family of four and didn't have any kind of refrigerator to keep minor travel snacks/groceries cold which was a disappointment since we rely on traveling with things like that for our kids. It was just one night, so it suffices for a place to sleep, but I don't think we'll stay here with kids again.",4

Really?  Given the time and the fact that a lot of these people aren't eating again until 6 or so that evening, this was just wrong and hopefully can be fixed!",4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient for Airport Travel Yet Out of the Way--But Not for Long!,"There's a small complex of hotels near the Denver airport that's right in the middle of an area of development. You'll see the construction equipment and land clearing going on so go ahead and consider staying in this area as new things begin to pop up.Baymont is one of them and provides everything you would expect in a Wyndham Hotel. The hotel follows green practices, providing a room that was basic yet modern; every time we opened the door, we were greeted with a clean, fresh scent. Pow! There's a pool & small fitness facility onsite. And the complimentary breakfast provided ample choices. There is no lunch/dinner facility.While any of these area hotels are minutes from the airport, they provide meager dining choices. Right now, there are both a freestanding Ruby Tuesday's and Italian restaurant nearby along with a sports bar inside the Holiday Inn; plus, there's a small diner down the road in front of the Ramada Inn. That's it.However, the RTD just opened an airport hub that can take travelers directly from the airport to downtown for $9 (each way, p/ person). So if you want to utilize the comp hotel limo service to the airport (which apparently runs only until 12:30 p.m.???), you could feasibly piece together a morning trip to the city. According to the RTD website, there is a station within walking distance of all these hotels. The only problem I found was that it's not actually built yet! (I asked a front desk person about it and he had no idea what I was talking about, and a drive toward the area in question simply found cleared land and construction equipment only roads.) But, I can see where everything will eventually come together for this pocket of hotels once that station is built.Baymont was fine and we'd definitely consider staying again. Clean. Friendly people. Convenient location for travelers.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Comfortable, pleasant and clean",I was a little bummed there wasn't a fridge or microwave in our room BUT it was very clean and the down stairs area where they have continental breakfast was always open to the guests so we'd use their microwave since we stayed 5 days.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Poor customer service,"We have stayed at this hotel numerous times traveling to and from Denver.  It is conveniently located near the airport via a shuttle.  The shuttle is a group shuttle with other local hotels and is on about a 45 minute loop (not good if you just miss it, but you don't know when it was last at the airport).  The hotel is average but usually ok for an overnight stay.  This time our shower did not drain. We did not have time to have it looked at as we were on a schedule.  When I asked for a resolution at the front desk I was offered a $30 refund.  I asked to speak to the manager who was not available.  I asked to have him call me but did not hear from him.  I tried repeatedly to reach a manager to discuss the situation and that we were not satisfied with our stay, nor the lack of response.  I never was able to talk to anyone that could do anything about it and they won't return my calls.  I will not stay there again.  Also, the breakfast is poor unless you want to toast a store bought bagel or english muffin.  Eggs were sketchy and the bacon greasy and chewy.",3

I expect everything to be clean when I am staying in a hotel.  Would not stay again.",2

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Denver Airport Hotel Choices,"I have stayed at many of the airport hotels-often.  The Baymont is new to my repertoire, having stayed there only 2 times.  Both times I have found the staff distant, relatively unpleasant and poorly trained.  In the first room I had, the hair dryer appeared to have been ripped off the wall.  Perhaps some mention should have been made by the front desk staff or a note of apology from the maintenance or housekeeping staff.  The ""Fitness Center"" has 3 machines in it - hardly qualifying it to be referred to as an amenity.  On the positive side, the rooms are a street set back from Tower Road and thus are quiet.  I am not sure why the Towne Place (a Marriott brand) and the Baymont (Wyndham) seem to both have disagreeable front desk staffs when other hotels (like Fairfield, Courtyard…",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Just OK,"Room & bed comfortable. However, first room assigned filled with smell of smoke. We alerted manager, Brian, who was very attentive immediately, & reassigned another room.  We had a very short stay, so for the price, was acceptable.  Would reevaluate all rooms & settle on a price factor for next airport lodging...this would not be the top choice",3

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent Breakfast,"We stayed here one night. The directions on our GPS didn't take us to the hotel so we called to get directions but no one answered the phone. We stopped at another hotel to ask but it was snowing and difficult to see and follow where they told us to go. Once we got to the hotel the front desk staff was friendly. Our room was decent. It was basic and comfortable. The bathroom was clean. The hotel was quiet. It was well maintained inside and out. The free breakfast was fantastic. The breakfast attendant was super polite, extra friendly, such a sweet girl. A lot of breakfast options to choose from. The bacon was especially crispy, probably the best hotel bacon I've ever had. They offered cereal, waffles, muffins, bagels, bacon and sausage, biscuits and gravy, yogurt and juice. The food was continuously being filled and never ran out. When we checked out the girl at the front desk was also friendly. The hotel is near quite a few restaurants and very close to the airport. I would probably stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Oh by the way, extended parkiong closed","Generally clean, friendly staff.  After making advanced reservations weeks in advance we were notified ""at check-in"" that extended parking was closed.  This forced us to scramble at the last minute to find more expensive parking.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,missed connection,Stayed 4/5/2016.   Flight into Denver was late causing us to miss our connection.  Hotel provides a free shuttle service which runs every 20 - 30 minutes.  (No fault of the hotel but it is very congested at the airport to catch the shuttle).  Easy check-in although I thought it was strange that the clerk asked me what rate was on my reservation.  Nothing special about the room.  As expected it was clean and coffee provided.  At check-in added our name to list for 4:45am shuttle.  Was surprised when we got downstairs to find the breakfast area open.  Expressed my surprise to the girl at the reception desk.  She said it usually opens at 6 but she saw several people were leaving early so she opened early.  Very considerate and appreciated.,5

Lastly, I waited for an hour and 15 min at airport to be picked up by shuttle on my return. I will not be returning to this hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,wrong place wrong time,Used hotel advertising phone inside DIA airport.  Talked to someone in a call center who had no idea or any information about the shuttle or the hotel.

Called hotel directly and pushed 2 when directed about shuttle information.  rang...rang...rang...the message about mailbox is full.....waited...waited...waited....called hotel again....all the while raining/snowing.  This time pushed 0 to actually talk to someone and was told the van is marked as WESTERN.  which had been thru numerous times.   ...Too difficult to put baymont on these vans?

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,New Hotel - Bad Shuttle Svc,"The good - we had a great rate with Sam's Club Travel, weeknights are expensive at the airport.  The check-in was easy, friendly staff.  The bed was comfortable.  Then I booked again on each end of our vacation.  They charge $5 for parking, no problem - our prepaid room was $103 total.  Now the bad - Expected a $50 parking charge, got a $153 charge - the manager has not called back to correct & haven't seen the credit on my card, so I'll dispute.  The paper products are the lowest quality I've ever used.  Then the shuttle bus is shared with 4 other hotels, so it was awful - overcrowded.  We won't stay again.",3

To get the quoted price I had to use the hotel computer 6 foot away from the front desk to make my reservation on line. Then print it off and walk it 6 feet back to front desk.It happened to be a shared room with a locked door between the rooms. The sound of the guest in that room....good grief!

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Stay at Baymount,My first room had a broken handle on the toilet and did not have all of the typical amenities.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good Hotel near Denver Airport,"This is a basic, good hotel near the airport. The only reason I didn't give it an excellent rating is that I wish it had a restaurant or bar. But besides that, it's a nice place to spend the night before or after arriving. Rooms are quiet and clean. The staff is extremely capable and helpful. The breakfast in the morning is excellent.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Friendly, accomodating, comfortable and very reasonable.","We live about an hour from KDEN (DIA) (in Lakewood, 1st tier outside of Denver proper, ie, suburbs), without traffic on the interstates and freeways. For some reason I've never conclusively defined, flights out of Denver are heavily concentrated around 6-8am. So. A few years ago, we started booking family & friends visits (& us) at the Baymont. We check in around 7:30pm the night before, have a cheesy, wonderful, DELICIOUS dinner at DiCicco's, go back to Baymont across the street to a very comfortable room (great beds and linens!) for a good night sleep. All if us are rested and energized to face air travel. With U.S. airlines having gotten so predatory, tacky & cheap (obviously NOT in price but in service and additional charges) demanding, inefficient, horrible; Baymont helps to energize us to face the journey. Best wishes to consistently, helpful, professional and friendly staff. Kuddos to Baymont DIA!!",4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great customer service,"We needed a last minute room and was able to secure a room with this hotel at an amazing price, compared to surrounding hotels.  As a GM of a hotel I was very impressed with the FD staff, the lobby appearance and overall hotel.  I did run into an issue with the cleanliness of the rooms.  The first room I was put it had not even been cleaned.  The desk staff was apologetic and promptly switched rooms.  This room had been serviced but wasn't clean either.  There were no other rooms to move me into but at least I did have clean sheets and towels.  Working in the hospitality industry I know things happen.  The way the staff handled the situation was with a positive attitude, friendliness, and apologetic, I find this type of attitude the kind all hotels need to have.  I would recommend this hotel and stay at it again.  Everyone deserves a second chance.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"I would stay in this hotel again, but I did have an issue...","I would stay in this hotel again, but I did have an issue with the residents of the room across the hall from me having a barking dog in their room.  Two sleepless nights later, they left.  I don't know whether they were asked to leave or left on their own as I had to call about it two nights in a row before the issue was resolved.  I will assume that this wouldn't happen again.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Hotel,"We booked a couple rooms for one night due to an extended layover. Other than having to wait nearly 40 minutes for the shuttle (at 2 am), the hotel staff were friendly, room was clean, spacious and beds were very comfortable.  I felt it was good value for the room(s). The only hiccup was at 0600 am the following morning, when no one announced the shuttle had arrived (even though we had our names down on the list and asked the front desk.) This nearly caused us to miss our flight and added some stress.  Regardless, we would recommend this hotel as an excellent choice if you are overnighting in Denver. Just pay attention for those shuttles.",4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Not sure what the hype is about..,"I chose this hotel because of all the stellar ratings it received.  Honestly, my opinion is the hotel is decent and fairly clean but I would definitely not give it 4 or 5 stars.  The room we stayed in was very small and the beds were double beds not queens.  When traveling with our teenage son who is nearly 6 feet tall and my husband who is 6'3 and 220 pounds, sharing a double bed in a small room is not very comfortable.  They gave us a room at the front where you could hear the super loud shuttle bus pulling in and out all night and then first thing in the morning. Also the sink is in the main bedroom area separate from the bathroom.  So if you use the restroom in the night you're washing your hands 4 feet from your sleeping family.  The worst part was the shuttle service. Most hotels have their own shuttle.  This hotel contracts out to a different service. There was no room to put your numerous suitcases (ie: it's Denver and people are bringing big bags and ski's!)  and the driver was so rude and didn't even help a bus full of people with the bags!  The only good things I can say are the beds, although small were pretty comfortable and the have a free hot breakfast.  Otherwise you may want to stay at one of the other places near the airport.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Location, clean, transporation","Great place to stay if flying in and out of Denver International. The rooms were roomy, clean and bright. We were able to get a free shuttle to and from airport and leave our vehicle for $5.00/day at the hotel. Definitely saved money on that. Would like to have had some kleenex in the room and the shower actually had several holes drilled through it. Wasn't happy about that and covered it with a washcloth. Breakfast was ok. Front desk gals were friendly and helpful. Would also like to have had the option of a feather pillow. The pillows here were beyond firm and I felt like my head bounced off of them.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE / GREAT ROOM FOR GREAT PRICE,"I booked with Baymont Inn for 1 night due to an extensive layover from Denver to Arizona. Despite the slight wait for the shuttle to the hotel (it was unexpectedly cold for this Yuma girl), I must say that they were the best part of my travels back home. Their customer service was exceptional and far better than the service I did not receive from the airlines that delayed and canceled my flights on this vacation. The room was beautiful and spacious. I had a King/Non-smoking and it was glorious. Bed was ridiculously comfortable that I hated waking up at 0530 the next morning in order to rush to airport for what was the only on time flight on my trip. From New Orleans, my luggage went directly to my final destination, so I was without any hygiene products ...luckily, I packed an extra set of clothes in my carry-on...Baymont had all the items I needed and I did not have to pay for any of it. I have never had to stay in Denver longer than an hour or two but I am definitely happy that I chose Baymont Inn for this layover...it actually gave me one decent night's rest in the midst of all my travel chaos. Thank you very much for your wonderful accommodations and lovely customer service.  ***Rm was so nice, I had to take a picture of it...unfortunate that I cannot attach to this review.***ps. Login & PW for WiFi was rcvd but I was unable to connect, however that was the least of my worries. :)",5

We called before hand to make sure the age requirement was 18 so we weren't without a place to stay (we are only 19) the day before we left I called and the lady confirmed that you did have to be 21 to stay at this particular hotel but since we had made our reservations already that it was okay! Phew! Every single one of the staff members I talked to was friendly and great. Breakfast was better than most. And room had a lot of room which I really liked. My ONLY complaints are that the garbage cans didn't have garbage bags so we had no where to put garbage, the bathroom wasn't as clean and it could of been there were hairs in and on the toilet and the ice bucket had a piece of chewed gum on the top of it. (Yucky) i used to do housekeeping so I know what is expected and I think that is why it bothered me so much. But overall the price was great break was good and bedroom was alright :)",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Above Average Quality for the Price,"This is a mostly well-managed, clean, comfortable hotel that you will probably visit only en route somewhere and only for a night or two. I was there for five nights and got a good night’s sleep in a comfortable bed each night. The facility is new, the rooms are ample in size, and there’s reliable, free wi-fi. There is one convenience store (7-11) within a ¼ mile walk and three restaurants within walking distance. There’s really nothing else except other hotels that service the airport. This is a very isolated location.  There is a pool, but it’s not big enough for a swimming workout. There’s a workout facility, but it’s tiny and has a total of three machines. Very sparse. Breakfast is fine and similar to many hotels in this price range that offer free breakfast. The breakfast…",4

I requested a receipt and he acted as if it was a major inconvenience. ",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good value great breakfast!,"The staff was very friendly especially the girl who was in charge of the breakfast the morning of March 19th. I have never seen such a nice, hard working person in the breakfast area at a hotel before. It was clean with lots of variety and she kept replenishing items right up until they closed at 10:00. The beds were comfortable but the pillows are awful unless you like very a very firm, non-giving pillow & then you will be happy! Either bring your own or sleep without one. Nothing fancy but everything you need for a place ten minutes from the airport. They have a shuttle but bad weather changes the times so plan accordingly. The room was clean and nothing was noticeably worn so that is a plus. I would definitely recommend staying here.",4

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,It's a good choice,"There are many airport hotels near Denver International because the airport is so far away from the city.  They're all pretty nice.  The Baymont stands out for a great bed and above-average breakfast.  The breakfast starts very early (5 am) so it's more convenient.  There's a gas station nearby for the car rental fill-up and a few chain restaurants nearby.  The only negative (if at all) is the lack of an in-room fridge, which some other hotels have.  I would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,GREAT STAY     FRIENDLY STAFF    TOP NOTCH ACCOMMODATIONS,Needed  a  good hotel  with long term parking. Found that the Baymont would fit the bill.  Hotel and staff were above and  beyond our expatiations!,5

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Clean, convenient, friendly","I stayed here the night before an early morning flight out of DIA. I checked in around 4 and the process was quick and painless. They even had chocolate chip cookies on the counter. My room was at the end of the hall on the second floor, so it was very quiet. The bed was comfortable, the room was spotlessly clean, and I got a great night's sleep before I caught the shuttle at 4am. The only complaint I had about the room was that the coffee for the in-room coffee maker was horrid, but they have plenty in the lobby. I also noticed that the breakfast room was set up and ready at 3:55 when I got downstairs, which was really nice for us early birds. The shuttle left promptly at 4, and from the time I got out of bed at 3:30 until I walked up to my gate, less than an hour had elapsed. If I had stayed at home, I probably would have stayed up all night because I would have had to leave my house at 2:30 to catch the Sky Ride. The shuttle itself was very roomy and clean. I have another early flight in April, and this is where I'll stay the night before.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Good stay, shuttle disappointment",The stay was great.  The shuttle ride to the airport was a disappointment.  Never have I been on a shuttle where the driver never helped anyone with their bags getting on or off.  I had a tip ready but kept it.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,High Value for Price,"Very Spacious Rooms, Very Clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was very good with many choices. Only quirky thing was a card to get the lights and heat going like in Europe but once figured that out never another thought.  There is a Mexican and an Italian restaurant about 5 minutes walk out the back and a filling station to refuel a rental car within a few blocks. The service station also has a convenience store.  To return a rental car you take a shuttle from the rental car place back to the airport, then take the ""Western"" shuttle back to the hotel.  This was a nice place to stay and quiet.  I was very sick and they let me have another comforter within a few minutes of the request.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Looks can be deceiving. ,"I booked this room to meet the love of my life. It looked like a great room, and it was relatively close to the airport. I had a fantastic time, and the room kind of happily melted into the background. Here are the problems with this hotel: 1. They have no canteen. You cannot purchase anything in this hotel like Advil, a decent snack, dental floss. They did have individually packaged, one-serving toothpaste packs.  So that was nice. If you need anything after your flight, you are going to need to purchase it from Walgreens before your stay. 2. The wifi is terrible. Don't expect to be able to access anything on the cloud while you are here. 3. The television was impossible to operate. Ours was stuck in Spanish-language mode that could not be changed without a minor degree in electronic engineering. You can't access the HD inputs, so forget about chromecast or hooking up your laptop. 4. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom. Some people may say ""eh, what's the big deal?"" I'll tell ya: If you have traveled to Denver to meet a significant other you adore, and to whom you want to make a good impression upon, it's a little difficult for the impression to not be tainted by the faint odor of.........coming out of the bathroom, or lingering like a giant cloud of poisonous gas. 5. The FLOORS are paper thin. My girlfriend and I wondered if there was an endless meringue happening on the floor above us. Every time someone ambled down the hall, it was like the place had a footfall amplifier. It was comical after a while. 6. No fridge. 7. No microwave. Those were the issues I had. I'm sure there were others that were mildly annoying, but those were the highlights. I gave it two stars because it was clean. And seemed to be secure from a mountain lion attack. My advice: Look somewhere else. Were it not for the charm of the company I was with, I would have been pretty pissed about the whole ordeal.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great DIA Park and fly option,"I live in Vail was catching 6:45am flight. Was well worth the cost to stay at the Baymont, park my car, and catch some zzz's. The shuttle runs every 30 minutes. Would have liked it if there were some packaged breakfast items out before 5am. Maybe frozen breakfast sandwich etc... Room was clean and fairly modern, shampoo and other amenities are somewhat small, especially for double room. Staff was great!",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Consistency ,"Always a great place to stay, clean, stay here monthly for several years. Transportation is okay gets you to and from the airport. The hotel offers free hot breakfast, not like others in the area that don't offer hot breakfast . Free washer and dryer just pay for the cleaning supplies. Staff is very good and professional. They also offer Togo menus and local restaurants. It's worth the money no surprises",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont Inn,Baymont Inn was a pleasant stay.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Okay, but not great","The bed was fine, the room was clean and totally adequate, the desk people were slow, but fine, the breakfast was not good.  The bacon was sitting in grease, the bread was so stale it was hard, and the servers did not speak enough English to communicate.  If the breakfast had been better, I would have given the hotel a higher rating.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Denver,Staff was great! My kids loved breakfast! Although my room didn't come with refrigerator I was able to store my daughter's milk in staff refrigerator. Thank you all so much!,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Stay,"This was an excellent hotel.  Staff was wonderful and very close to the airport.  With an early morning flight, we were very pleased with the shuttle service to the airport.  Right on time!  Will stay there again during our next trip to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A Good Night,"Nice clean room.  It was not super fancy, but comfortable and roomy.  Good desk space and chair for sitting.  The free breakfast was tasty with ham, eggs, and waffles.  The bed was not the most comfortable that I have slept in, but compared to many hotel beds, it was good.  The location is conveniently close to the Denver airport.  I would stay here again and I recommend it.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Overnight Layover in Denver,"I had an overnight layover in Denver and this was the most reasonably priced hotel near the Denver International Airport that I could find. The hotel is pretty new and it seemed like the whole area where it is located is new with lots of development. Given the fact that all I cared about was getting some much needed rest before heading out to Newark the next day and then eventually to India, it turned out to be a perfect and restful stay for me. The staff were all very friendly and I was pleasantly surprised by the hot items they had at breakfast like eggs and bacon. (They even had a waffle maker!) My only tale of caution is to allow plenty of time to get to the airport if you are using the airport shuttle they use. It looks like this hotel uses a third party shuttle company to bus its guests to the airport which stops at one other hotel to pick up more people before heading to the airport (at least on this particular morning it did). That should have been fine except that the shuttle was having mechanical problems. It took forever to get to the airport, long story short, I ended up missing my flight. Had I arrived at the airport just 10 minutes earlier I would have been fine. I ended up getting on the next flight and all was ok in the end. I'm not blaming the hotel, things happen and I should have just taken the previous shuttle. All in all I really enjoyed my stay here and would stay here again if I had another overnight stay in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Beware ,Beware and check everything out before you book. Not friendly and incompetence appears to be a requirement for employment here. Not as budget friendly as promoted to be. No breakfast available as stated and the shuttle stops at multiple locations on way to airport - make sure time is allowed for this.,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Economical & Convenient To The Airport,"We stayed here the last night of our Colorado vacation because we had a very early flight out of DIA the next AM. Baymont Inn was very nice & at one of the cheapest prices in the area. It also has a free shuttle to the airport which was awesome, especially at 0-dark hundred.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Hotel,"Overall, the hotel is very nice.  The only thing lacking was a small fridge in the room.  But I would recommend the hotel based on cleanliness, good beds and nice TV.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great place to stay for a night,My husband and I stayed here for 1 night because we arrived at the airport late at night. It was a very nice and clean place to get some sleep before starting our Colorado journey the next day. There was a timely airport shuttle and the breakfast was pretty good. We had no complaints.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Business trip,"Good hotel, comfortable spacious room. 10 min. Taxi from airport. Fare Was 32$ but there is the hotel shuttle for free.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Perfect for an overnight stay before a flight from Denver International,"This is my second stay at this hotel.  There is a cluster of these properties just outside the airport in Denver all ready to serve.  I looked at pricing, and to be fair, I am a ""club"" member of the Wyndham Rewards program, so I chose the Baymont primarily for this reason.  The price is right around $100 with tax (Feb 16) and is a good buy.  The rooms are clean and modern.  There is a shuttle to the airport every 30 minutes - round the clock.  It takes about 25 minutes to make it to the terminal, and another 5 minutes to the check-ins.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent in my opinion!,"Love this hotel & will return for sure! Check-in was a breeze even though they were extremely busy and it was 11pm. Rooms were clean (if you don't look under the bed), bed was very comfortable, blinds shut out the light so you can sleep late or during the day if needed, it was nice & quite, we couldn't hear neighbors or hallway noise. They do offer shuttle to & from airport. They have a decent gym. Pool is indoor. Breakfast was good, eggs, waffles, muffins, sliced ham, toast, bagels, cereal, etc. I really have no complaints (other then there was trash under our bed), we had a great stay & will use this hotel next time we fly DIA.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Well worth the stay - reasonably priced,"I enjoyed my stay at Baymont Inn.  It was a quick trip, so I wasn't looking for much more than a place to sleep and wash up for 2 days.  It seemed clean and cared for, and all the staff I interacted with were very friendly and professional.  A few of the cable stations were out or having difficulty with picture and/or sound, but I wasn't there long enough to say anything about it.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,My stay,"While in CO I also stayed in a Cobblestone Inn & Suites in Kersey. Room accommodations were much nicer. I was a little disappointed, not to mention the problem with a light switch only one trash can and toilet was stopped up in the room I was in at Baymont.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very accomodating to handicapped persons,"I rate this hotel based on it being an average hotel.  Average soap, shampoo, lumpy big pillows, but all in all, room was adequate and clean.  Service was great to arrange the shuttle to airport for a wheelchair assisted bus.  Roll in shower accommodates a wheelchair.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,I'll be staying here again!,I came into Denver to visit a family member and to checkout the downtown area.  It was located across the street from a Ruby Tuesdays and another restaurant that both deliver when your in a nearby hotel.  The breakfast offered in the morning had a very good selection and was replenished often.  The rooms were nice and cozy.  I had no complaints.  I'm a huge fan of using public trans in cities I'm new to so I can enjoy the scenery and I was able to do that as well.  I took the free airport shuttle back to the airport and then took a bus downtown!  Super convenient!,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Quick trip!,"Hotel was clean, front desk staff was very friendly. The room was clean and comfortable. Easy access to the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A Couple of Return Visits to Update Comments on a Familiar Hotel,"I had the opportunity to stay overnight on two separate occasions in Feb 2016 at this hotel that I had previously reviewed in May 22, 2015.  I thought it would be interesting to compare the findings of the 2015 visit with the two recent visits of Feb 2016.  To my surprise, I found specific repeat offenses which might indicate to management that they have a systemic problem rather than simply a random coincidental finding.The first recent visit to this hotel was Feb 5, 2016, and I had to check in late though the room was prepaid in full.  Upon arrival in the room I discovered that the sink was backed up and draining extremely slowly, allowing dirty, soapy water to accumulate in the sink and splash back at me as I tried to wash my face and hands.  This triggered my memory, and I recalled having a similar problem back in May 2015 (you can read my previous review about having the same problem), so I immediately called the front desk.  The front desk manager was sympathetic to my complaint and offered me a different room, which I said I would accept since my wife and I had not completely unpacked yet.  When I returned to the front desk to pick up the new key cards, the front desk manager was checking in a male customer and two female customers were in line waiting to be checked in.  When the front desk manager finished checking in the male customer, she turned to me and, instead of giving me the keys to the new room, she asked me if she could check in the other customers first.  I was rather taken aback by her request, since I had already spent time waiting in line to be checked in earlier and then been given a faulty room for which I then had to come back to the front desk to be given a new room assignment.  I still had to go back up to the faulty room and collect all of our luggage and move with my wife to the new room.  If this were not enough of an inconvenience, the front desk manager then creates a situation in which I am made to look like a boor by her asking me if I would allow her to check in the other (female) customers first!  So I was initially speechless when she asked me about allowing her to check in the other customers first, but then, after a long pause, I rolled my eyes to the ceiling and said in a slow, exasperated manner, ""WELLLLLL, OOOKAAAYYY........"", not believing that the front desk manager would have the nerve to try to make ME look like the bad guy in front of the other (female) customers!  Fortunately, the next customer waiting in line realized what was going on and tried to defuse the situation by insisting to the front desk manager that she check me in first, which she did.  I thanked the customer for her perception and sensitivity and had a short conversation with her which revealed that she was, indeed, a very thoughtful and caring person.  To the front desk manager's credit, I was given a free upgrade to a suite with much more room, though because I had checked in so late, there was little time to utilize it.A few other things I discovered about the hotel were that its hallway carpets were noticeably dirty and needed vacuuming.  The suite we were given had two TVs, but one of them had a nonfunctional remote controller; and though roomier, the layout of the suite was such that there seemed to be a lot of wasted space.  On the plus-side, there was a pullout couch which could have provided an extra bed, though we didn't need it; the king-sized bed was nice and comfortable; and the Wi-Fi connection was quickly established and functioned well.  The breakfast was included with the room, and it provided a variety of American-type breakfast options which were of averagely good quality.  Comments in my previous review of this hotel for May 22, 2015, regarding other features such as the pool and exercise room, were basically applicable to this stay.  Because this review is getting rather long, please see the separate review for my additional recent Feb 12, 2016 stay at this same hotel which discusses a possible systemic problem.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Really liked this hotel!,"There are quite a few hotels clustered together but no doubt THIS IS A GREAT ONE. I would stay here again.  We ate breakfast at the hotel and walked across the street to Ruby Tuesday for dinner. We didn't have a rental car, but if you have a car, there are quite a few shopping choices, restaurants and movies about 8 miles away.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,clean and close to the airport,"The hotel is very clean and very convenient to the airport. They offer a free shuttle and free breakfast, if you are up by nine am",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Poor airport shuttle service,"Standard smallish airport hotel type room. Poor airport shuttle service. Had to call four times from freezing Denver airport to ask about the shuttle, and ended up waiting 40 minutes. In that time span other hotel shuttles came and went 3 or 4 times. Would choose a different hotel next time.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,The hotel I choose for flying,I have stayed at this hotel many times when flying to/from Denver.  The people are pleasant and the accommodations are excellent.  I rest well when staying at this location.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,A wonderful place,"I recommend this hotel. Even though it's at the airport and we weren't flying in, it was the best for us. Great service and cleanliness--everything was updated nicely. Really very nice, especially for the price. I would like to see more vegan options for breakfast. Maybe a tofu scramble or vegan sausage patties. Tofu is actually very cheap, and it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect/want this in Denver. It would take the experience to a new level. Thanks!",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Perfect for Airport Layover, but...","The Baymont at DIA is perfect for an airport layover, either coming or going. Nice, clean, spacious rooms with free breakfast, free airport shuttle, free wifi, all for, usually, under $100. Just don't stay in Room 218 (or on that line or close) as those rooms are above the entrance and the 30 passenger diesel bus will idle there on the hour and half hour, including a 30 minute warm up shortly after 4 AM so your sleep will end then.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,To small,The beds are way to small and it was so hotI had the air conditioning on in the middle of January for breakfast they gave us deli ham and eggs,1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great for early flights,"Needing a place for a few hours sleep prior to a 5:45am flight, this hotel was perfect.  Front desk was very nice and helpful even during a late night check in with kids.  Hotel is basic but very clean.  Well organized breakfast to go in the morning and shuttle to the airport every 30 minutes.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Don't plan on a hot shower!!!,Stayed at this hotel on 1/22 when I arrived in Denver. Hotel was clean staff was nice. But when I tried to shower the next morning the water was lukewarm at best!! Which made me think how hot is the water that they wash their linen with?? Not taking the risk. Never staying here again.,2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Clean, Cofy, Convienent","Easy and close to DIA. Free shuttle to and from airport! Very clean, and friendly staff. Breakfast just OK.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Delano Duncan,"i have not been to a lot of hotels per say to be a judge of a 3 to 4 star hotel but i was happy with this hotel, the room was clean and the sheet were clean and the mattress was good and comfortable",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont Inn at Denver Airport,"This Baymont Inn is the best ever.  Not only do they have excellent and clean facilities, their staff is outstanding.  Gian MacKenzie and other check-in employees always meet our accommodations. Every 6 months to a year, I visit Denver for medical reasons and always stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Quick Stay but Great Trip,"We needed a room quick because we got in at midnight (Denver time) and needed a place to stay until we met up with our friends, this was a great option. We were about a 9 minute drive from the airport. It was in the area where all the airport hotels were located so getting into town would have been a little expensive without a car. They had a great breakfast in the morning. We only stayed here for a few hours, but it was great.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,NWSS stay,Hotel appeared very clean both in the rooms and lobby/breakfast area. The room was smaller than expected but served its purpose and was comfortable.  The complimentary breakfast was basic but very good. Will definitely stay here again if on the Denver Airport area.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good Solid experience,"The check in process and quick and painless, as was the checkout time.    The room was clean and quiet.   There was a small problem with one of the end table lamps.  I reported the issue to the front desk, but it was late and we were leaving early, so I didn't ask them to fix it right away. The bathroom was absolutely huge, but the sink area was a bit too small to fit all out necessities.  These two items is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.   Breakfast was pretty good with pancakes and scrambled eggs.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,All around excellent,"Spacious and clean room, lots of choices for the included hot/cold breakfast, attentive staff, prompt shuttle to airport every half hour. Very nice experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Stay,"This was a great place to stay.  Near airport, very clean, personal well informed and helpful. We also used the exercise room and it was well kept.  Easy access to resturants and convient stores.  The airport shuttle was right on time.  We will definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent hotel near DIA,"Clean and pleasant room, excellent bed, quiet.  Very well run hotel.  Only thing to take away from a five stars (for the ptice) was an average breakfast.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good hotel for airport,Was just looking for hotel close to airport to pick up late arriving family member.    Third party vendor airport shuttle was good.    Hotel was nice for purpose.    A few good restaurants nearby.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Stay,"The Baymont Inn Hotel is eight minutes away from the Denver Airport. It's clean & comfortable, with free breakfast (fresh fruit, eggs, sausage and the other basic breakfast stuff) and a free shuttle (I did not use the shuttle.) There's a few restaurants in the area which was cool. The check-out staff was awesome and friendly, I checked in around 8:00pm the check-in staff was not friendly & seemed overwhelmed. However If I'm in the Denver area I will stay at Baymont again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Gloria Worley,I was a great stay. Friendly people and clean room. The food was great. I will be staying there again when i am in the Denver area.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice Stay,"The hotel is 8 minutes from the airport, it's a nice & clean hotel. The hotel offer free breakfast which is cool. There's a few good restaurants in the area which is also cool. I would stay at the Baymont again.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Baymont,I was stuck in Denver over the Holidays due to flight cancellation. I called Baymont  Inn at 3a.m. to reserve a room.  They were very accommodating the staff was wonderful and the hotel was very clean!! would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Denver Area!,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Terrible problems with noisy guests, and lack of security","I was pleased with everything about the hotel until I tried to get a good nights sleep.  At 12:36AM there were about 10 to 12 people gathered outside my room near the elevator area.They were speaking very loudly, and arguing with each other, in SPANISH.I called the front desk and asked for them to be quiet.  The girl told me that they had just checked in and that she would take care of it.  I called again at 12:40AM, and asked her to send a security person.  She explained that she was the only hotel employee on duty.   What????????????????At 12:52AM I called her a third time and asked for the telephone number of the hotel manager........she refused.I then told her I would call ""911"" and she pleaded with me not to do so.  I really, REALLY wished that I had done so.  The offending people gradually left the are over the next 10 minutes.When I explained the situation to the hotel manager the next morning, all he could say was ""I am sorry""!  He told me that the desk clerk was indeed alone, and that Denver law requires only one employee unless there are more than 150 guests in the hotel.  Ridiculous!At about noon that day, I suspect the same guests, assembled again in the lobby, and began a similarly loud, and obnoxious conversation. I NOTIFIED the manager again, but don't know what he did about it!ALL I WANTED WAS A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP, BUT THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS HOTEL.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good value if you catch it on the right day,"The hotel was fine, but our young female friend was harassed by the shuttle driver when she came from the airport. The hotel was very helpful and the shuttle company is handling the complaint.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Good Night Stay,Great Check-in .. The Breakfast we more that I expected!!!Ride to DIA was late but we left 3 hours early because of the New Years rush!!,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Very nice, very reasonable","When we're flying out of DIA during the winter we typically come up a night early and fly out the next morning. We've tried several hotels in the area and really came up short until now. The staff was very pleasant, room was clean, everything worked and check in/check out was very smooth. This is where we will be staying from now on for DIA flights.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Ok Stay,"I had called and confirmed 3 times with reservations that we would have 2 adjoining rooms with the 5 rooms we requested and that we would all be on the same floor.  One group arrived a day early and was not given the adjoining room as requested.  Front desk clerk seemed annoyed that she had to change the room.  The next day when the other 4 rooms showed up we were not all placed on the same floor as requested by me to the front desk before we left for the day.  The rooms are clean and housekeeping did a great job.  Breakfast was not managed well, trash cans were constantly overflowing and coffee was empty and not kept up to speed of the groups that were there.  Pool was very dingy and dirty like it needs to be drained and cleaned well.  Hard to let my children swim they way it looked.  There was an item left it in the hotel which was found and when talking with front desk to have that shipped back they were not that helpful and again seemed annoyed with my questions.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Close to Airport, Right price",One night stay on a layover.  Rooms are very clean.  Staff was very nice and helpful.  Provided shuttle service to and from airport no charge.  Free breakfast with good selection of choices.  Not best location if you want easy access to Denver proper.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great,Great service.  I got in late at night and was offered late check out.  Spacious room that was very clean.  Very comfortable bed.  Great breakfast.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Super service,During the holidays we had 3 kids coming in on 2 different airlines.  Loved the shuttle to and from the airport so we didn't have to deal with parking the car and finding the kids.  Great service and we used it when they departed.  Awesome service and a nice clean room.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,great place to stay,Hotel staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly! Rooms were immaculate! easy to find and tons of parking with many eateries near by.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Overnight near the airport,"A last minute/flight cancellation booking on a night when everything  should be closed down due to weather...the hotel staff was friendly, the shuttle drivers are pleasant and competent.

"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Wonderful place away from the airport,"Excellent accomodations.  We enjoy so much the professional staff at the Baymont.The bed is most comfortable, the breakfast more than adequate and delicious, and the desk assistance is five star.  Thank you again.  SUPER internet throughout the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great Hotel and Location,I was surprised to see how nice this Baymonte was in Denver. i work for the chain and I have to say this is one of the nicest hotels next to any airport I've stayed at. Everything was clean. the rooms were well equipped and had some very comfortable beds. The shuttle service was really easy to spot. The issue most people have is they don't realize they have to call to schedule the pick up. We arrived in Denver at 10:30 pm and were at the hotel by 11:15. Had zero issues with the shuttle. Overall my stay was great. We were there for 2 nights. At the start and end of our vacation and it couldn't have been better. Ina Ramirez at the front desk was very professional and extremely accommodating. If I'm in Denver again I will definitely choose this location as my go to hotel. We were a group of 10 people and it just felt really comfortable and worry free.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent overall,"We flew to Florida for ten days from Denver because the airfare was MUCH better than from Rapid City, SD. Rather than pay the exorbitant airport parking fees, we booked a room here because the flight back would be a late one and they had a Park-and-Fly option. Imagine my surprise on arrival when they told me they could reduce that rate greatly. We got parking for $5/day while in FL.  Upon return, we found the room to be far superior to the last one we had in FL for about 1/5 the cost! Great service, easy shuttle (Yeah, you have to wait - if that's a huge deal, take a cab, idiot).  Recommend this highly unless you are someone who expects first-class service for really great rates.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Convenient Location,"Good value, good service, convenient location to the airport and clean.  This is not a luxury hotel, just a place to stage your trip to or from someplace else and as such functions fine. The Baymont delivers as promised.  There are several restaurants and a convenience store close by.  Shuttle was on time.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,I really don't like criticizing a business BUT......,"Upsides: room very nice for price, breakfast quite adequate....Downsides: 1) in spite of my wearing good ear plugs, I was awoken at 3:45 AM to the sound of footsteps (walking but not pounding or anything) in the room above me--is there any insulation in the ceiling?; 2) no coffee pot with coffee machine in room; 3) you better know in advance the shuttle to this ""at""-airport hotel is called the ""Western"" shuttle, and it takes 25-30 minutes with other hotel stops; 4) I was unable to get change for a 10-dollar bill either around 9:30 at night when I checked in, nor around 7:45 am when I checked out (no 1's or 5's at all?--seriously); 5) the night counter-person didn't smile or welcome me; and last but not least: 6) the morning guy did all of the following: didn't ask how my stay was, never smiled, didn't offer me a receipt, and did not thank me for leaving him a 5-dollar tip (got change from another customer) to give to my room's housekeeping person(s).  Enough said....",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,What a horrible experience,"My husband and I stayed here on a business trip for 2 nights. We'd stayed before and while not a luxury hotel it was ok, there's not much room for moving around, they cram it pretty full of furniture. Our second stay was the nightmare. My husband was standing in the bathtub/shower with his towel drying off when his feet went out from under him. He was not attempting to get out but rather just standing there. Upon investigation I discovered that the ""no slip"" surface was worn down to the point of no longer being no slip. We mentioned it when we checked out and were met with a ""sorry that happened"".  We were attending a board meeting for a fund raiser and he became increasingly pale and the pain in his elbow got worse so I took him to the local urgent care where they determined he had broken his elbow. After several months of dealing with their insurance company we received a letter telling us that they'd determined it couldn't be their fault. I wouldn't stay there again if it was the last hotel in town.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Misleading,"This hotel is pretty clean, offers a decent breakfast and is a great location if you want to be near DIA.  I have to say, I am very disappointed with the shuttle service and the parking arrangements which is the only reason we chose this hotel over others in the area.  When we arrived, there was a sign on the desk stating that there was no space for long term parking. I explained to staff that we chose the hotel for the long-term parking option and she was gracious enough to let us park, however, according to the site that we booked through, the parking was free.  When we arrived, she stated it was an additional 5 dollars per day.  Had we known this, we would have just chosen a parking lot and not even stayed at a hotel. We live near by but wanted an option to get to the airport without high parking fees and with a shuttle.   The website had incorrect information which made us believe we were getting free parking when we booked.  The shuttle runs every 30 minutes.  Would be nice to have more frequent stops.  On our return trip on the shuttle from the airport to the hotel, the driver tried to say that our service dog was not allowed.  I argued with him for a minute before he gave up and decided to let us on.  I am not impressed.  The hotel was nice enough, probably over priced like most hotels in Denver, but if you are looking for amenities including shuttle and extended parking options, definitely call ahead to get more specific details because the website and outside booking sites are very misleading.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Worst shuttle and service,"I just spent 45 min waiting in a freezing Denver airport for the shuttle to take me to the Baymont Inn Hotel. Although I called the hotel asking for information the front desk never told me that the the shuttle didn't have the name on the front but rather a ""western"" logo that I was supposed to identify. The worst part was arriving at the hotel and being treated poorly and disrespectful by the person at the front desk.",1
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Very nice experience,Denver cancelled 425 flights out the day we stayed but the front desk was calm and professional. Our room was quiet with comfortable beds. Breakfast was appreciated and OK. good experience at a time it could have been ugly.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Nice property, desk staff needs sometraining","I was impressed initially with this hotel and to be honest, it was one of the best Baymonts that I have ever stayed in from an aesthetic standpoint. I had an issue with my tv and contacted the front desk. I never got an ""I'm sorry"" or an ""I apologize for any inconvenience"" but was just told that I had to switch rooms which took a couple of trips on my own. The feeling was that I put the desk staff out. Aside from that, everything was good. I think they could have accommodated me better as I am a gold member. Then I was given a room with a smaller tv. I think they should have looked out for their loyal patrons or maybe I should take my loyalty elsewhere. I utilize hotels over 150 nights per year and if they don't want to help me, I will move on.",3
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Lovely,We stayed here only for one night before transferring to another hotel. I really wished we stayed here for the entire week. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were immaculate! By far one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. I highly recommend staying here.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Perfect overnight before flying,Baymont Inn provided an easy place from which to catch an early morning plane.  We returned our car late the night before and caught shuttles to the Baymont.  And their shuttle in the morning left on time for a smooth trip home.  Clean.  Easy.  Breakfast was free and okay.,4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Convenient, clean and good breakfast","Convenient to the airport with a complimentary shuttle, clean rooms, computer and printer available for printing boarding pass, excellent breakfast with perfect selection of choices starting at 5am which really helped us.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Nice and convenient ,"Traveled to DIA night before early morning flight. Hotel was very nice clean and met our needs for one night stay. Reasonably priced with good breakfast which opened at 5am, earlier than other hotels I've stayed at. Nice for those early flights.",5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Thanksgiving Travel,Enjoyed our visit. Would recommend that you extend the complimentary breakfast from 9 AM to 9:30 AM.,5
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,be wary,"shuttle service from the airport is completely unreliable, we waited 45 minutes for it, breathing exhaust fumes from hundreds of cars and shuttle buses, then gave up and took a 40 dollar cab ride to the hotel. the manager  Trevor Bain was told about this and did not reimburse us, even though he promised he would. this was after several phone calls and e mails were sent. if shuttle service from the airport is important to you, stay somewhere else.",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Excellent Room Stay,"Everything about room and hotel was excellent.  Rooms had full size beds, Queen size would have been better.  Possibly due to hotel being close to airport.  Otherwise excellent property to stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,"Room was dirty, gum was stuck in the rug, dirty chair, need a blue recycle garbage can,","I was disappointed in my room.  The room was dirty and really could have used a good cleaning.  Housekeeper need to use a knife and ice cubes to remove the gum that was stuck in the rug.  That was gross.  Then the chair in the corner was dirty, something had been spilt on it and again, it would have taken a housekeeper with a small bottle of upholstery shampoo 10 mins to clean the chair.  That was gross as well.  And there wasn't enough garbage cans, you should have a blue recycle garbage can in all rooms. ",2
"Denver, CO",Baymont by Wyndham Denver International Airport,Great economical hotel with wonderful service,we had great service on our recent stay. we were flying out of DIA early the Saturday after Thanksgiving so stayed the night with our three kids on Friday night. Brian at the front desk went above and beyond to make our kids comfortable and even brought us an extra rollaway bed. the room was large and the morning breakfast was simple but adequate to grab and go and take to the airport. ,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great location, Spacious Suites, Friendly Staff. Recommended for Globalists.","As a Globalist, I always have an excellent experience at Grand Hyatts all over and this was no different. The staff (Amy, Katy, Vanessa, Suzie, Cara), and especially Kelly, were open, receptive and accommodating of my needs. I had my favorite beverage waiting for me in my suite on my arrival. The suite was very spacious, had motorized blinds and provided good views. The pool was at a good temperature. Though the Club Lounge was closed due to limited occupancy and staffing, I was able to work out of the beautiful and spacious lobby. The location is central and I used a ride hailing app to get around town. I was there for Christmas and loved the tree in the lobby, as well as the one from Spain a block away. World of Hyatt members can check in online, receive a digital key on the app, can skip the front desk and go straight to their room. The digital key can also be used in the gym and the pool. I didn't need a physical key card throughout my stay. Fantastic feature! On future trips to Denver, this will definitely be my go-to Hyatt.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location and quality hotel,"I was somewhat reluctant to travel during covid but I am so glad that I did.  First of all, the hotel is conveniently located near the 16th St Mall.  The hotel was immaculately clean.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  I received a room upgrade without asking which is always a great thing.  Room service was fantastic and they had a nice selection of beverages especially the Graham Cracker Porter.  Even parking was easy.  Top-notch!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful hotel with good location,"My girlfriend and I stayed one night here, and we wished our stay was longer. We had a high floor, corner room and the large windows made the view absolutely awesome. Room was large, had a nice bar area, and plenty of seating. Hotel is very high-end as are all the items in the rooms. Only interacted with 1 member of staff during check-in and she was very kind and helpful. There are a ton of hotels in Downtown Denver, and this is absolutely one of the best.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay,"We loved our stay at the Grand Hyatt Downtown. Great customer service and all around great hotel. It was peaceful and quiet at night. Parking was great also. Everything was near our hotel, even walking distance.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Full service hotel operating as limited service,How can you operate this hotel with a grab and go market with a few cooked to order breakfast? State opened up dining to 25 percent. Why not open the restaurant? This is cost cutting underway. When asking the front desk I got an attitude and very poor customer service. If a Grand cannot operate as a grand due to COVID...I’m sorry but you need to close temporarily. It is very misleading to guests who expect certain services from the brand to simply not be available. This grab and go model is being used at select service properties and not a good idea for full service properties. Why can’t you have room service for all meals for guest safety? Pass on this place. Amy at the desk does not possess good customer service skills. She was rude matter of fact and instead of apologizes tried to challenge and oppose my feedback...just appalling ...gm and regional director will be contacted,1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent,"Great experience overall. Staff was great, Covid-19 precautions were on point. Their lattes are awesome, must have! Nicely clean. I had the comforter feathers coming out (not pleasant) but I called and even though it was late at night they brought me a new comforter to replace the one I had. Very friendly and kind staff. I would stay again for sure I needed to!!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Not coming here again,Staff at front desk was kind. The room was not for the price we paid. Overall not clean or well kept. Location was great. But that doesn't take away from the fact that we paid over $400 for what was supposed to be a beautiful room.,1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Was a nice getwaway, but where is the microwave?","The hotel was clean and fancy just as represented in the pictures online.  Was surprised of the amount of noise walking down the hallways but quieted down immensely at bed time.  We were looking for a pool, which they had (yeah) but no hot tub (boo), and would have loved access to a microwave, especially during Covid.  Overall, was an enjoyable stay and would go again anytime!",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Amazing experience,"Staff was super friendly, hotel was spotless. The cleaning procedures they have in place regarding COVID are really spot on. The views and California king size bed were amazing. Also the two different blinds to darken the room are great.  A go to in Denver",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel,"The room was very nice, however the manager was very rude to me and my wife. If you are a smoker there isn't anywhere to smoke around the exterior of the hotel. Mediocre quality especially compared to nearby options",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay!! Best customer service,Everyone was super friendly love that the market in the hotel was open all the time so if you needed a late night snack they were there for you also the room was gray in the fuser awesome the pool and gym are still open it was a great stay with great people.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Downtown Denver,"26 floor hotel, awesome lobby, beautiful view of the city and surrounding area, walking distance to 16th street mall and everything to love about downtown Denver.  Hyatt did a great job taking care of us during these particular times.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Amazing Customer Service and Sparkling Property,Check was a breeze and I wish I could remember the lady's name who helped us. She was there at check out too. She was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed! It was a wonderful experience. I would definitely go back because of her. The gentleman that helped us at the Courier bar was also amazing. The staff stood out the most as well as the wonderful property. The view from our room was amazing!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful Place with Nice Price!,"This was my second time visiting this hotel. This time I booked the cheapest room in cash and the hotel automatically upgraded me to a large high floor corner room, which I guess is the best they can do for an Explorist member.The room was cleanand large, and got a great view. Slippers and dental kits were delivered to my door to avoid contact. I have to say from room to service, this Grand Hyatt holds the high standard of the brand. Nice job!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Stay amid COVID,"Before our long stay at Grand Hyatt Denver, Operations director Kelly M. reached out via email to ensure our needs would be met ahead of our check-in. She was professional and courteous, big shout-out to her.We worried about the cleanliness naturally during the pandemic. Upon entering the room, we inspected everything and wiped down the surfaces using Lysol wipes. The sheets and pillowcases were crisp and clean, the surfaces spotless. We liked that we could text the hotel for towels, toiletries etc. Masks were required in public areas of the hotel. There was always one staff at the entrance greeting people and ensuring the rule was enforced. This made us feel at ease. There was a lady that didn’t wear a mask at the breakfast bar area, the staff reminded her right away. Overall, it was a great stay. I hope slowly and safely the hotel can open up the Hyatt club. I have another trip coming up in Denver and I’ll likely consider the Grand Hyatt again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Shopping Getaway Downtown Denver Grand Hyatt,Even during COVID The Grand Hyatt makes a wonderful place to stay!  Hot breakfast and snack options plus bar opened until 10 pm.  Hotel was remarkably clean and COVID prepared.  Stayed for business one day and shopping the next!  GREAT STAY as always in my favorite downtown Denver hotel!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful property,Very friendly staff. Nicely appointed rooms (3.5-4 star) Checkin was quick and we even got an upgrade to the 21st floor with great views and away from the elevators. Comfortable beds and lots of towels. Great proximity to the 16th street mall. The grab and go food bar was perfect on our way to the airport. Would absolutely visit again.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Fantastic staycation!,Overnight to celebrate a birthday.  Suzy at the front desk was warm and welcoming.Matt from security called me after I forgot a bag at checkout.Nice property with great location and views!I would happily return in the future.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Quick Getaway,"We enjoyed our stay at the Denver Grand Hyatt. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and spacious. The pool was the highlight of our trip, we immensely enjoyed it. It was never crowded and they strictly adhere to Covid rules. Only 10 people at a time and you have to book a time slot.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt,Nice Hotel convienently located in Downtown and close to everything.Only giving four stars not becuase of the Hotel but because because covid 19 made some of the hotel options limited like in room dining only.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,LOVE THIS HOTEL,"great experience, 2nd stay in a year; the staff is responsive and courteous; room in great condition; plan to stay again in Jan, in the middle of everything downtown.  the downstairs market had plenty of food and room service is great",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great property,My stay here was great and it’s in a great location. I’m walking distance to the 16th street mall. I did have loud neighbors that woke me up at 5am bc they were arguing. They should do every other room.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Loved our stay but expected GH to do a little better.,Glassware in room a must even if you reuse the same glassware needs to be there. Microwave in lobby that guest share. All fine hotels has fridge micro combo. Find a way to do limited turndown/ rom refresh service. Love GH Denver but feel they fell short!,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Loved it!,We were on our honeymoon trip and they offered an upgrade for us. So kind of them. Much better than the Brown Palace hotel! Modern and cleaner. Cheaper parking too. Excellent value. Staffs were very polite and had awesome service.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,NOT A GREAT VALUE,We rented an executive suite but felt that the value wasn't there  . The room was large but felt very dated and really didn't have any amenities to speak of. There was no phone in the main living area or even a small microwave . the sofa was very worn and uncomfortable .There wasn't even a pen writing pad. the décor was very bland .  Overall it was rather disappointing for what we spent.,3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,The best of the best,"Because of the Grand Hyatt's overall service, aesthetic, and customer care, I will only ever stay at Hyatts from now on! The room was quiet, clean, and comfortable. Staff were kind and prompt to respond. The food and beverage options are always top notch, and the beds are super cozy.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Amazing Customer Service,"We had an emergency situation at our home in Denver and needed a quick place to stay while we waited for repairs to be done.  The team at the Grand Hyatt was amazing!  They gave us an early check in and a late check out.  Reservations for the pool and fitness area were efficient and felt safe.  There were hand sanitizer stations throughout the hotel and they really practiced social distancing everywhere.  We also ate exclusively at the hotel including room service and found the food to be good.  The room we were given was spacious and the 5 of us fit comfortably.  My only suggestion would be that while the room was clean and overall nice, it could use some updating.  Admittedly, I am pretty picky and I felt the room was in line with the price point.  I would definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,The Grand Hyatt isn't so Grand,"Rude staff, no designated smoking area, issues with check-in. The business center was closed and there was nohousekeeling This property does not reflect the standards of a Grand Hyatt. I would NOT recommend this proprerty.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,In Denver for family,"Great place, nice room.  Huge window with motorized shades.  Bed was very confortable. Love the robe. Breakfast at the bar downstairs was good and made to order.  Hotel staff was courteous  Only thing missing in our room was a microwave but the fridge and the coffee machine worked great.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent!!!,"Excellent! Best hotel in Denver.  Close to everything, beautiful rooms, clean, good food at the lounge, Wonderfull staff, super polite and helpful! The pet fee was a little pricey, however they brought up a doggie bed and elevated food & water bowls for my pet within 10 minutes of checking in. I didn't expect my dog to get first class service as well! All and all a really excellent hotel, excellent staff and all around wonderfull. I won't stay anywhere else in Denver. PS... They have 2 peloton bikes in the fitness area!!! Super awesome! Can't miss my Cody Rigsby class!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Center to everything,"Closed to the downtown, mall , some recreational area and freeways.The hotel is clean, nice decor and ambience inside was chic.The staff were ok not too much help with your needs. The management has policy of NO CLEANING of your room during your entire stay. We stayed for 3 nights and 4 days.Due to Covid 19 they want to prevent their staff to get sick not thinking that their guests are getting into a room that they used in n out of the area. I don’t know what concept is that because once we leave they will clean the room. So do they know how exposed the guest has been and coming to a unclean room. The shower tub is plugged.You paid full price plus a $35 /day parking fee. It was unfair for me.Consideration is appreciated if they could have clean the room every other day at least. Not even free coffee in the lobby is offered. 😞 sad and disappointed 😕",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful Room!!!,Huge bay window with a gorgeous view of the city. Loved the automated black out curtains. Very spacious and luxurious room with motion sensor lights so you aren't stumbling around in the middle of the night.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Overrated,On arrival I find I have to pay 35$ to park. I also had to check in before I could even go in to park and then to back to my car to park it and bring in my bags. Upon arrival to my room and there was a huge hairballl in the toilet which made me wonder how clean the room was in the midst of a pandemic that’s kind of terrifying. Overall the room wasn’t bad just not worth what I paid for it.,2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay and location,Great place to stay in Denver.  Close to all the sites and the amenities are wonderful.  Room was ultra clean and spacious and the shower was like a dream—just stood under the steamy water and relaxed.  Great bar and eats despite Covid restrictions as well,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay & incredible staff!,Our stay at the Grand Hyatt Denver was even better than expected during this time of COVID-19. The staff was extremely friendly and beyond helpful. The room was clean and we loved our view. We would stay here again in the future.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good but not as expected,"Corner room was requested. They have provided corner room showing other part of downtown and not towards 16th street. If it’s not towards 16th street, I didn’t have to pay for corner room. Otherwise everything else is good.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Busy hotel in the heart of Denver,"This was a disappointing stay. There was no valet parking as the car park was full so had to find alternate parking. The hotel reception was incredibly busy, no social distancing being enforced and no hand sanitizer. Whilst it's very centrally located, and close to the bars and restaurants, I prefer not to hear people screaming down the hallway at 3 am.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Pleasant Stay,"We stayed here on a quick trip to Denver.  Good location where we could walk to downtown, catch the bus down the mall and back.  As it was during COVID they did ask that we use a mask when walking in the general areas and only two people in an elevator at one time.   All very doable.  The room was clean and they still have a breakfast (of sorts) fruit, granola bar, pastry and coffee.  Wasn’t going to fill us up, but it was nice to have something.  We paid for parking at $20 per day with in and out privileges.  Would consider staying here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Rave next door,Woke up between 1-2 am to a rave happening in the adjacent room. Had to call front desk multiple times and threaten to call police to have it shut down. Appreciate Danny and morning crew for comping my room and apologizing for the experience.,3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Awesome,"Awesome place to stay, rooms clean hospitality is great great bar. Great location, very friendly staff, good food.Very classy place, great for business meetings and company meetings.This is the only hotel I stay at in Denver",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Weird Smell,"This hotel in general is nice. But when I walked into the lobby, I noticed a smell. Like an old carpet/plumbing issue/dirty water smell. I have bad allergies and was annoyed but went to check-in. I got to my room, and the smell was strong in the room as well. I ended up switching hotels and going to the Hyatt Regency.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Not good enough,"I booked the executive suit using 20k of Hyatt points. However, breakfast was still not included due I was just an Explorist. I thought executive rooms include lounge or breakfast but no.Also, there was only stand shower and the bathroom is small.I would give 5/5 for the cleanness, 5/5 for the convenience, 3/5 for the bathroom and 1/5 for not providing complementary breakfast for executive rooms.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Colorado Trip 2020,Taking a trip during Covid....... you don’t know what to expect....We had a great time at the Grand Hyatt in Denver. The room was beautiful and had all of the Hyatt touches.  The employees were all kind and engaging. The housekeeper from the Ukraine took such immense pride in her work.Thank you for making our special stay~very special! PS we would like to buy the photo I enclosed if possible-,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Clean, fancy, but parking is unfair","The hotel was gorgeous and the room was super clean, especially during a COVID. Very limited interaction with staff and guests. The only draw back is parking. You have to pay $32 to self park. It should at least be cheaper than other options around the hotel as a guest.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wedding,I cannot even begin to tell you about the fabulous weekend we had at the grand Hyatt. Our daughter was getting married in Denver and we are from San Francisco.  I reserved a block Of rooms months ago and the staff could not have been nicer. As covid hit and our guest list diminished they continued to go above and beyond. Rooms were upgraded parking was waved my daughter and son in law were upgraded to a beautiful suite complete with champagne and chocolates ❤️The perfect setting to get ready with all of us for her beautiful wedding day in the gorgeous mountains of boulder.  Thank you thank you thank you!!!Hopefully the party will continue next year and we will be back at the Hyatt,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,GREAT HOTEL,"An amazing stay from the beginning of entering the hotel, to the day I checked out and exit. They are so humble & sweet. The was amazing clean. Love the window blinds. Amazing view at night. I should've gotten room on the upper floor. But I was on the 9th. Still nice... Overall, I will definitely go back to that hotel❤",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Denver Grand Hyatt,"Despite the fact that a bloody booger filled tissue was found stuck to my pillow,which caused a mental breakdown in my husband, staff was very friendly and accommodating. Especially Amy, Luke, AJ, &Joy",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Just ok,"Very nice, welcoming and helpful staff. The hotel itself was just ok and can't say it met my expectations of upscale or luxury. The rooms were basic. Also, while I was there a lot of construction outside. The water was also shut off for a short period of time for repairs so they gave us free bottled water. Rooms are fine to suit basic needs and you're in the downtown area, but you could stay elsewhere and be fine as well.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Hospitality ,"This hotel is one of the best service ever had. hospitality is over the top.  Friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommended , room was cleaned and quite, WiFi working well, I will stay again when I come back. Greeting from Victor Mnz.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very loud construction/drilling noise. Poor customer service.,"[CONSTRUCTION ONGOING - Don't stay for at least the next 6 months] Unfortunately, my stay at the Denver Grand Hyatt was a horrible, sleepless experience. Very loud construction noise began sometime before 7 am. Imagine someone drilling directly into both of your ears. This came after loud party noise from across the room all night.When I called around 7 am to let them know about the construction noise and asked for earplugs after not being able to sleep for awhile, someone came 20 minutes later with a dozen Q-tips. I asked if they have earplugs - not Q-tips - she said no. The loud banging and drilling noise still continued and it was painful just being in the room. After not being able to sleep for another hour, I called the front desk again to ask if they have earplugs. They finally brought earplugs another 20 minutes later, but, by then, I was already tired and up from the continuous drilling noise. I understand that constructions happen, but if I had been notified and given earplugs the night before, this would have been less of an issue. Disappointing customer service overall. I am very disappointed and will not be staying here again.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Used to be better,Now I understand its a pandemic.  I do. But man it used to be so clean and upscale and this visit it just feels sort of like a basic roadside hotel. There’s dirt built up in corners of bathroom. Broken mirror. Black marks on walls.  Just lower than I remember. However the staff is amazing. Bartenders are great. So friendly and wonderful. Dylan was really wonderful. Woman greeting us at Parking/Check in was super friendly.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great location with a few hiccups. ",Overall the hotel is beautiful and the staff is probably the most friendly and service oriented of any hotels I have stayed at recently!  However there were a few hiccups as the title says. First there is a lot of construction happening on the streets in front and around the hotel that at times in the morning got louder than we would have liked for a vacation. Second we found the the smoke detector in out room had been covered by paper towels-napkins. I’m assuming this was done by an earlier guest so that they could smoke in the room. However this was not caught by the cleaning staff. Lastly the chrome-cast in our room didn’t work. The later 2 issues were acted upon very quickly and professionally when we brought them to the front desks attention and both maintenance staff members were very apologetic and nice. Overall I would stay here again in a heartbeat.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,none,Rick was an awesome bartender! We sat down and he came right over with water in plastic cups incase we wanted to walk around Denver.He did not care if we were ordering anything. We decided to stay for a drink because of his wonderful customer service. Thanks Rick. You made our day.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown," Nice, good location ","Stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is in the middle of downtown, about 2 blocks from the 16th street promenade, which has lots of restaurants with patios. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. Due to COVID, you don’t get cleaning service every day but can request items. Food service is also limited but the grab and go cafe isn’t bad. The bar is open until 10. There’s also no valet parking but self parking is attached and easy to get in and out of. Staff was friendly and helpful.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt ...Covid 2020,"Hand sanitizer was everywhere and overall clean.There were no microwaves in the rooms, making it possible to get overpriced food at their bottom floor market. Trash receptacles were hard to find. The bed didn't look like a king and was very uncomfortable. They also assumed we were paying for 3 nights of covered parking when it was only 1 night.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Excellent Service, Comfortable Stay",The location of hotel is amazing as well as the staff of the hotel is quite good and always comes on time whenever you need them. THe rooms and food was amazing. beds were also soo comfortable and had a good sleep.. overall amzing hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great event venue,"We had a stellar school gala here last year. It's a great location in downtown and there are nice ballrooms and two in-house bars. The food was good. There is plenty of room and a nice layout. My favorite thing though was when I called the day after our event to try to track down a bottle of wine I had bought but not ended up with, I talked to the most amazing security guy, Matt. He went through security camera footage with me to discover eventually where I had left the gift bag. Seriously: above and beyond helpful!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Exaggerated Pet Fee,"Stayed in Grand Hyatt Denver for one night and paid ~$110 since I came with my dog , I had to pay $100 per fees so basically pet fee was the same as a nightly rate. Which is extremely high and unreasonable. If I’d known i would have never stayed there. So I hope this review will help others.  And to grand Hyatt management - as someone who travels a lot with my pet, a normal pet fee is $15-$25 and in an era of less people traveling (because of Covid19), you should even consider waiving the fee. Will never stay there again.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Absolutely Fantastic,"The Grand Hyatt Denver is amazing in every way!  The ppl are so sweet.  Even during Covid-19, they did Housekeeping bc I requested it.  We had a King Corner Room on the 23rd floor & the view was beautiful.  Great location right downtown next to 16th Street Mall.  Suzie was THE BEST, but everyone that works there is so sweet, including the Manager.  Room was very clean, and there isn't a person on the planet pickier than I am with hotels.  Great TV channel selection.  Food from Market was great!  I don't have 1 negative thing to say!  It was perfect : )",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good business hotel,"Nice and modern. Breakfast was pretty terrible but everything else was nice. Good central location. Entrance to the parking was more of a hassle than it should have been. TA wants my review to be longer, so here is a meaningless sentence. Happy?",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Comfortable stay. ,Stayed her last night and very comfortable. Watched fireworks out our 20th window. We ate in the restaurant here and had great shrimp and burgers. Friendly staff throughout our stay. Valuable stay in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Decent stay,"Stayed at this hotel for two nights as the city was opening up. Lobby is beautiful, bar is well stocked, rooms were nice and the bathroom shower is great. Using the text system worked well to replenish the room during our COVID stay. Room wasn’t as clean as I would like as there were stains on the ceiling. (Picture attached as evidence, room 2406) Your room doesn’t get cleaned so make sure to be specific about your needs.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,When In Denver,"This Grand Hyatt in Downtown Denver is a VERY nice facility.  Just be careful what you tell Uber.  There are at least 3 Hyatt Hotels in close range to each other in ""downtown"".  Unfortunately we ended up at the wrong one once, but the ""right"" one was in walking distance.  Food was always good, although pricey.  We were there on business and liked the location.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful Hotel / Walking Distance to 16th Street Mall,Beautiful Hotel with much larger rooms than expected. Walking distance to many attractions. We stayed here on our first night in Denver and was able to walk to Coors Field for the game that night. Highly Recommended,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Awesome Staff,"We were supposed to be skiing but the virus ended our adventure. We stayed a night in Denver and had the best stay and sleep at the Hyatt. Great location, room with a view, comfy bed, exquisite linens, nice bathroom, etc etc. can’t say enough good stuff about our stay. Billy Ray and Allie S are the best!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"First class hotel, great brunch","Very nice hotel, huge lobby area. Had weekend brunch, a great value. Located downtown with easy pickup area. Parking is expensive, so try to avoid bringing a car.Room was great. Nice bedding, large TV.Staff was good.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Honeymoon,"This was the end of our trip going back home to Texas; we just stayed in Devver one night & it was very specai & very easy. I would highly recommend this hotel, all staff were very informative. They gave us the exact way to get back to airport using Union Station & was very hassle free.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place to stay!,"We love this location in downtown Denver. We were able to use the light rail from the airport to downtown, and frequent the 16th Street Mall when we visit. Very walkable area, close to a paved river trail and so many restaurants. Also a quick walk to the convention center are. Staff was flexible with an early check-in and late check-out, which we greatly appreciated due to our flight schedule. We stayed here a few years ago, and our experience this time was at least as good, if not better. We've often gone back to the same hotels to find everything in worse condition than we remember, but that was not the case for this hotel. We will definitely be back when we are back in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent hotel,"Located in downtown very close to 16th street mall. Modern, spacious, clean, comfortable. Excellent service. The hotel restaurant Courier is fantastic. Valet parking is expensive but one can park much cheaper few blocks away.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great get away.,"From upon entrance into the hotel, to the accommodation, and the views everything was better than expected. A close walk to great restaurants or stay in and enjoy Courier's the restaurant in the hotel. From the track or tennis court in the sky to the view's of the city. It was a great get away!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent time!,"I had a great time. The hotel was great, staff was great, no complaints. I would definitely recommend this location to others who area visiting Denver, Colorado. The location was excellent - close to stores, nightlife, and tourist opportunities!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Denver for Conference,"Great hotel for a business conference, although meeting rooms were in two different buildings. Located in the heart of downtown. Pillows felt like slabs of marble, but otherwise room was nice and comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very Nice Hotel w/Quick Access to Downtown Denver Venues,"The Grand Hyatt Denver was a very nice hotel.  The room was clean with plenty of space.  Housekeeping did an excellent job.  It is centrally located in downtown Denver with quick access to the multitude of shopping & eating establishments in downtown.  It was also within walking distance or the free MallRide bus I was able to grab at Union Station after getting off the train from the airport, making transportation to & from the hotel very easy.  With the MallRide being a free bus, there were unfortunately some ""colorful"" characters riding on it so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it at night, by yourself.  However, the hotel itself was very well located.  The bed was a little hard for me, but it was clean with lots of pillows.  The breakfast buffet was a little pricey, but the food was great!  Our waitress could have been a little peppier, but she was attentive.  Just a forewarning, valet parking is expensive!!",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,It was better than I thought and worth the price.,"The service was exceptional. Everyone did their best to accommodate my needs. I thought the food was a little pricey for what they serve. But, it was still worth trying. The space was nice and clean. I liked the shower because it was a step -in and not a tub. The black-out curtains were amazing. I could nap in the middle of the day and the room was dark like it was 1 AM.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Conference Convenience,"After spending 4 days recently at the Grand Hyatt Denver for a conference, I can highly recommend this hotel for its location, service, and helpfulness.  Many conferences are held at hotels that are inconveniently located. However, the Grand Hyatt Denver is in a great location.  Within easy walking distance, we could get to a variety of restaurants, local breweries, the Capitol building, shopping, convenience stores, and local culture (For example ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown Museum"")  When time between conference sessions is often limited, we could still easily get out for an hour or two during the day and explore without needing a vehicle. The staff, without exception, were friendly and helpful: This includes staff at the front desk, housekeeping, servers, bartenders, and others. Staff were helpful in recommending places to see and eat, where to get office related work done, setting up and facilitating the conference, and even creating a special cocktail for my indecisive friend :-)",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Bad Service for Business Trip,"I was staying at this hotel for a group conference. We had a hospitality suite for the event. The first evening we were kicked out of the suite due to noise. We received no warning and worst of all were treated very poorly. The security guard AJ yelled as he entered the room. When I spoke to the front desk their response was ""AJ is Iraqi so just talks loud."" I found that to be offensive. On the 3rd night myself and two individuals were in the suite again. The TV was on mute and we were quietly talking. AJ and his crew again came busting in and kicked us out. They were rude and clearly had a bone to pick. I would not choose a Grand Hyatt for a future conference. Other areas of the hotel were good. The rooms were nice and check in was efficient.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful Venue,"The staff is very friendly, helpful and efficient.  No time at all to check-in and check-out.  The guest rooms have lots of extra touches like sensor lights that unobtrusively come on, Starbucks coffee, a nice big shower, comfortable bed, a big screen TV.  Yes it's a little pricey but the extra amenities makes it worth it.  Great location, too.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Would stay again - place was alive and found food very good as well as rooms,"This property had a nice feel from arrival until I left.  Would be my first choice for Denver when and if I return.  Across form Convention centre ( which was also impressive and well staffed)  and restaurants nearby in 16th street.  Rooms were large and very comfortable.  Breakfast fine and evening meals - ate their twice - was quite nice,  Outside restaurants in 16th street good and less expensive but you expect that at a hotel.  Staff across the whole spectrum were pleasant and helpful.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellant hotel,This place was an excellent place to have a business meeting.  The staff was helpful in all areas.  I had to go to an Urgent Care when I was there and the staff called a taxi for me and helped me locate the Urgent Care nearest to the hotel.  This place is one of the best places I've been in.,1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt Denver,"The beds are wonderful and I loved the automatic lighting.  There were two beds, but only enough drawers for one person, but the closet was spacious and the bathroom was wonderfully designed.  Very quiet and excellent service.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Screeching escalator left to cry,"We were vendors selling our crafts in the hallway above the Lobby to 2nd floor escalator. The escalator would screech and squeal every minute. It was a very great relief to get away from the booth each day. Courier restaurant was great. Rooms were clean. But, the escalator! Maintenance was ineffective at correcting the problem. We were there for 4 full days-Monday through Thursday.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Fabulous week,Staff at this hotel was amazing.  Rooms clean.  Room service was there within minutes of we needed something.  Bar and large lobby made greeting people easy.  Lots of great meeting rooms!!Made our convention outstanding!,5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great service and wonderful stay!,"We spent a few nights in early February, 2020 at the Grand Hyatt in Denver.  What a marvelous time we had!  The staff at all times could not have been more courteous or professional, and were always making us feel like royalty.  The hotel itself and our room were superb, exceptionally clean and fresh.  The icing on the cake is the Grand Club, which I strongly recommend to travelers.  Food, drink, a nice quiet place to relax out of the room-we love it!I have to give a special shout-out and thank you to one employee in particular, Andrew Carroll.  He was our host in the Grand Club two of the evenings.  What a fantastic young man!  As I said, all the employees were great, but Andrew obviously enjoys going that extra mile to please his customers, and make them feel so welcome.  We cannot say enough about him.  Hyatt has a gem there!We loved our stay, will definitely return, and highly recommend Grand Hyatt Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Conference in Denver at Grand Hyatt Downtown,"Excellent place to stay and meet as well as get to interesting things to do in downtown Denver. Walking distance to a variety of bars, restaurants and retail. 16th street area only 1 city block away. Great place for a smaller meeting group.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Comfortable and convenient,"The good: The Grand Hyatt is in a wonderful location. It is a one block walk from the 16th Street Mall to the hotel. The bus on the mall is so wonderfully convenient and can take you from one into town to the other. Stores, restaurants, and bars, oh my! The hotel itself is very nice. The room was comfortably sized. The bathroom was spacious. The in room safe, mini fridge, and coffee maker was appreciated. The opportunity to “go green“ was also a nice touch. The bad: We found the beds to be very uncomfortable. We called down for the complementary shoeshine but no one ever came to get the shoes and never let us know that they were not coming. Room service was disappointing. Breakfast was very good. Dinner? Not so much! The service itself was good but the food left a lot to be desired. All in all, the hotel was fine and our weekend was pleasant.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Special Requests are not ignored!,I have a relative who eats a very specific diet (Kosher). The Grand Hyatt in Denver went out of their way to accommodate us and even did a few things that were just above and beyond what we expected! I am thrilled with my experience with them and look forward to staying with them again soon!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt Denver delivers,"Just what you expect from a Grand Hyatt. Great atmosphere, nice and large rooms, clean and classy. Walk to convention center. Good value although not cheap. Easy check in and out processes. Friendly and efficient staff",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Home away from home,"This hotel is centrally located in DT Denver so easy for me to get where I need to go.  I really like the well equipped gym, and the restaurant for breakfast.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  Will definitely stop by again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Would stay there again!,"Friendly staff and clean hotel. The hotel had a friendly vibe, piano music in the lobby, open lobby area. Check in was easy and staff were responsive with any requests I made. I had to join my co-workers at a different hotel midnway through the week, and I didn’t want to leave !",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,First time Downtown Denver,Hotel was very close and convenient to the Downtown 16th street mall.  I really enjoyed this hotel and would recommend it to others.  It was unusually quiet and I thought the motion-sensor floor lights to improve visibility when getting up in the dark were a great feature.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great downtown location,"I enjoyed staying at the Grand Hyatt.  The hotel is very comfortable and the staff  is very helpful and friendly.  I walked between Union Station, the Convention Center, 16th ST Mall and the Grand Hyatt.  Also, the Grand Hyatt is located very near some great restaurants.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Friendly, great location","Stayed for 3 nights, best customer service. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay great. Location was perfect, easy access in and out. Checking in, valets, everyone was accommodating. Courier Market is perfect for grabbing food to go. Lobby is beautiful. Each night there was someone playing guitar and singing, perfect for grabbing a glass of wine and relaxing. Rooms were very clean. Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good experience.,I got reservations at this hotel as part of a full travel package for a Conference. This price was unbeatable and the stay did not disappoint in any way. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for peace and quiet for a great night’s sleep.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,I enjoyed my stay at the Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"I enjoyed my stay at the Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown. The clubroom and ameneties were superb. The staff continued to go above and beyond expectations; they were attentive, kind, and thoughtful.  I was traveling to Denver for work and enjoyed the Grand Club option. I was especially keen on the breakfasts, drinks, and snacks as I was able to save my perdiem for an extravagant dinner at many of the wonderful Denver resaurants nearby. I would recommend considering the Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown for your stay in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place for a business meeting or conference,"The Grand Hyatt is a great place for a business meeting or conference. The facilities are clean and the food and beverage options for a large group exceeded expectations. The Pinnacle Club has incredible views and is a large space for a good value. My only complaint was that the hotel room had a surprising amount of traffic and outside noise, but overall I recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay,"Friendly,efficient and clean. Great location for many places to visit for shopping and food. Staff were very helpful and went above and beyond for assistance and information. Would recommend this hotel to those in town for business or pleasure.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Nice roo.s, well run with exorbitant food and drink prices.","I would reccomend to stay there as the rooms are great,  the service is good.  I would also recommend that you immediately run out of the hotel each day to dine or when seeking entertainment as it is sparce and extremely expensive.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good not Grand,"I had read so many amazing reviews that I expected to be really impressed! I was disappointed in my room because I had called ahead to request something special and would have paid extra for a suite. It was never offered to me.  I was given a standard room. It was worn, as the pictures show. They agreed to upgrade us to a corner king, but after a short time there it was apparent that we would not get any sleep as the the noise from the street was terrible. So we ended up on the 26th floor. The employees were very nice. However, the room was ordinary and awkward. The lighting didn't work very well. The coffee machine also didn't work and we had to call to have that replaced. The club access was a good perk, and I enjoyed the food each day. I can't say that I would agree that this is one of the nicest hotels in Denver. It was not luxurious in any way, but was comfortable and clean with friendly employees.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,The people are trained differently,You know how people who work at Chikfila are trained differently from people who work at other fast food restaurants? As in chikfila employees come out with real life business and leadership skills? It's because they have an amazing training program. Same goes with this hotel. They hire well and they train even better. Staff is exceptional including kathleen and andrew. I now stay here instead of regency when in Denver. I have diamond at Hilton but still stay here.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Perfect location and amazingly perfect.,I loved everything about our stay at the Grand Hyatt. The location is so perfect and the hotel amenities are welcoming. The staff was very friendly and personable from the time we pulled in until the moment we left. I will definitely be back.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful hotel with absolutely amazing staff!!,"From the moment I walked in I felt special at the Grand Hyatt located in Downtown Denver and since it was my birthday weekend that was the objective.  I was taken care of at the front desk by Dazzle and he was absolutely amazing.  He checked me in and booked me on the 8th floor. I left to run errands and after thinking about it wanted to be on a higher floor.  I called back to the hotel and was connected to Dazzle.  I explained how wanted to stay on a higher floor and he said that it would not be a problem and to come see him once I got back to the hotel.  When I got back to the lobby, Dazzle booked me on the 24th floor with a city view, amazing!!!The next morning when we went down to Courier, the restaurant in the hotel, we were helped by Lou and he was an absolute delight!!  Also, the hotel has a tennis court, a weight room with Peleton machines and Balmain tolietries!! I mean, who could ask for more?!!  I will be staying again!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Delightful in Denver,"We stay one night using points and could not have been happier with the visit.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt lives up to its name!,"The Grand Hyatt was what I was hoping for and more in a downtown hotel. It was clean, upscale and accommodating on every level from the moment we arrived. Check in was seamless, room was clean with a great view, restaurant and music on site was fabulous, staff was always helpful. Staff recommendations on places to see and eat were accurate. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,One of My favorite Grand Hyatts in the Country~,"Love the views of the city, Rockies, and the exceptional staff. Grand club is 2nd to none!! All staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly. This is our 2nd visit--we'll be back again & again!!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,One of Denver's Best Properties,"Everything about this Grand Hyatt is impeccable. Centrally located with beautiful rooms and a great staff, there's just not enough I can say about this property. As an explorist member, I was upgraded upon arrival to a club access room, which provided some beautiful views of Downtown Denver. Service was so warm and welcoming. The lobby area is gorgeous. You're very centrally located, so you can either walk to some venues or are a quick ride away. Do yourself a favor and stay here!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel - would definitely recommend.,"I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel.  It has everything I needed, was clean, good gym, and one of the best “continental” breakfasts I’ve had with omelets and pancakes made to order.  Also conveniently located and could walk downtown.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Best hotel in Denver,We came for a family trip and business conference and my kids still ask to go back. Walking distance to the shops downtown and about an hour and a half from some great ski resorts. The hotel and rooms are exceptionally clean. The staff is as friendly as you can get. The Club level is worth the money. My toddler became ill while there and the staff was overwhelmingly kind and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Classic,"This location caters to many groups that are in town for events or shows. Though the lobby and waiting area seems smaller it can cater to bigger groups. Cleanliness - 4Most everything is kept clean and smelling nice but the meticulousness may be missing in some areas. Water stains and hair was left in the bathroom. Service - 4Professional and fun. Most of the staff will dress for the occasion/event for the time. Location - 4In the heart of Denver downtown but more for business instead of tourist. Would recommend their pub/restaurant for a simple drink and meal. If you want anything nice, check our Guard and Grace. Would return for another nice stay. Just remember that valet pick up is in a different location than drop off.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A good clean hotel,Don’t let the street view put you off. When I first looked at the outside I was disappointed. Don’t judge a book by its cover. This is a great hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean. The bar is fun and the staff amazing.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Monet exhibit trip!,"Everyone was very helpful and kind, the bartender could have been a bit more tentative however it was busy with the Rodeo group (we had fun with them). We were disappointed that there wasn't a hot tub, I didn't look close enough at the pool description. I didn't plan on paying extra for parking, not sure if it was included in the other hotels. I would still have chosen Hyatt and would again for the price and experience.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,An amazing honeymoon experience,"A really, really awesome experience! The hotel staff, and Mark the manager, helped to make our honeymoon super special.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent Stay,I went to Denver on business and was extremely pleased with everything about the hotel. The rooms are large. The bathrooms are spacious. The customer service is excellent from the front desk staff to the valet and restaurant. It is worth every penny you pay.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,2019 New Years Eve Package,"Amazing fun...the most welcoming and organized NYE party we have attended in the Denver area (from Estes Park to Ft. Collins)...3 large dancing rooms and a karaoke room providing dance music for all ages (25-75)...excellent choice of dinner foods/deserts for the evening buffet with 2 separate full setups (which remained serviced for 3-4 hours) so no standing in long food lines...open bar with no lines and no watered-down drinks.  A hotel staff presence that was plentiful and friendly.  At the end of the party, a simple elevator ride up to our room.  In summary, the best NYE we have attended and we will be back bringing friends for the December 31, 2020 party.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent,"This is an excellent hotel.  The bed was spectacular....nice crisp sheets. Clean bath, large walk in shower.    The breakfast buffet was really outstanding. The staff could not have been nicer from check in to check out.  Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,We'll be back,Celabrated my wife's birthday here and it didn't dissapoint. For starters we were upgraded for our room and when we got to the room there was a nice bottle of bubbly along with a plate full of goodies to eat as well as a card. We also had club access that was well worth it. Another nice touch is there are motion lights floor level so if you get up in the middle of the night you have light. Great idea.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel,"Clean, comfortable and has everything you need for a nice stay. The bathroom and bed were great. The hotel shouldn't be knocked for this, but the sirens and sounds of the city were all too loud for a good nights sleep. Light sleepers may need some earplugs.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,New Years Eve,This was so much fun! 4 different rooms to party and dance the night away. The hotel had an electric vibe and the staff were on point. Everyone in our party had an amazing time and would definitely come back again. The NYE parties did not disappoint! The rooms were clean and a great size. The toiletries were Balmain and smelled amazing!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great hotel, friendly staff, great location","I have stayed in many downtown Denver Hotels.  This is my favorite so far. I would go back and stay again.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,New Year's Eve with the Nacho Men!,"We went to the Grand Hyatt Denver for the New Year's Eve Party to dance to the sounds (and antics) of the Nacho Men.  We had a great time dancing, socializing with friends, and enjoying the overnight comforts of the hotel!  Great dinner buffet and wonderful service all around from the valet and bell hop to the efficient checkin front desk to the wait staff at the buffet!  Hope to do this again in the future!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Don't plan on Sleeping!,"Huge problem was the very loud drilling/vibrating noise apparently from the other side of our wall that began before 8 a.m.  Woke us abruptly and caused some concern. Would it really have been so terrible for maintenance to wait until check-out time when no one is trying to sleep? Rooms were clean and staff was pleasant and efficient. Parking is outrageously over priced. Sure, surrounding parking lots are busy, also pricey, but since valet is the only hotel option, some consideration should be given for guests without gouging.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,short Denver Vacation,"The room was excellent, comfortable bed, clean, comfy chair with ottoman and a desk. The restaurant is excellent.  Drinks are a little more expensive,  but very good. There's also a little shop with food and drinks and coffee.  Ample parking all around the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent stay,We went to the Hyatt for the NYE party and got a room. The Hyatt beyond exceeded our expectations. The only problem we had was the beds... they are SO uncomfortable. Even being as drunk as I was I woke up every hour due to my bad back and that bed.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"What a staff, what a view!","Modern location central to key landmarks and restaurants Downtown. Andrew took care of us at the front and did a phenomenal job setting our room up after an early arrival off the plane. Really appreciate his patience, professionalism, and personable accommodation. They have a 24hr text line to check on you (versus you needing to pick up the room phone). Dropped a note to let us know our room was ready and a second note after we were fully checked to see if we needed anything else. An unexpected, but nice contemporary touch!Micah got our room service together and was pleasant over the phone. Order the Bread Pudding!We’ll be back again, Grand Hyatt! Excellent job!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Best hotel stay I've ever had,"The club room experience was amazing.  Never stayed at a Hyatt before, and this surpassed every Marriott and Hilton experience I've had.  Extra large room with every comfort including automated night lights under the bedside chests and sink in the bathroom.  Lovely room, wonderful service, beautiful hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel; bad pillows,"Food, staff, cleanliness, entertainment were all great!  Pillows were like rocks.  Worst night sleep ever at a hotel and we've stayed at a lot of them. In addition to a lack of sleep we woke up with terrible headaches.  The pillows ruined a great evening at the Hyatt.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Frequent Grand Hyatt Customer,"Room was clean and comfortable with a great view of the snow capped mountains.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,New Year's Eve Party ,"The hotel put on a very nice event. The festivities began at 8 pm with a welcome cocktail and photo opportunity. There were 2 large buffets with appetizers and dinner items. Choices included stuffed mushrooms, mini beef wellingtons, egg rolls, deviled eggs, duck confit potatoes, etc. Dinner included pasta, roasted beef. Salmon, mac and cheese, and chicken. They had 2 ballrooms with limited seating and music plus karaoke in the downstairs bar. There was an extra room with big round tables but they didn't decorate it or make it match the atmosphere in the ballroom. Note. Get in line early to get good seating at a table.The checkin process was easy and hotel room was nice. We got a package of the king room and 2 tickets for $600. Pricey but worth it. Our corner room was spacious.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Recent vacation stay,Hotel was in a good location. 16th street mall was a block away. Breakfast Buffet was one of the best I’ve ever had. Bell service was prompt when we arrived and checked out. I wish there would have been an on-site laundry facility to wash my families clothes before we checked out. We had to pay $35 to have them laundered at a nearby laundromat.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Exceeded expectations,"I stay in a lot of Hyatt’s for business, but this one was for pleasure and my family and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  We had some last minute changes and the staff was very professional and accommodating.  Everything was clean and the towels were fantastic (Im kind of a towel snob).  Great location as well.  We’ll be back!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Loved my Denver stay,The staff was awesome and the location was perfect. We were celebrating our 15 wedding anniversary and are dinner at Elway’s which was also perfect. I will recommend anyone to stay at this location. The free appetizers and drinks on the 26th floor didn’t hurt the experience either!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Stay!,"We had a great one night stay. Close to many shops and restaurants. The staff was very friendly and kind. From the front desk to the valet, to housekeeping. The only downfall is the parking situation. If you choose to bring a car, I would recommend using the valet service. No breakfast included but hey, you are in downtown Denver, check out one of the fabulous local spots.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Parking for customers, microwaves","I don't like the fact that you have no parking for people's cars, I got two tickets bc you do t have anywhere for me to park. Yu should pay my 75 dollars in tickets bc it's you who don't have customer parking. I'm very mad about this. Plus u need microwaves in your room. How do people spend this much and can't even have a microwave",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Denver Family Trip,We were so pleased with our stay at the Grand Hyatt on Welton! The hotel staff was amazing. The rooms were very comfortable and the prices were reasonable. The food at the Courier Market was exceptional as is the wait staff.  We will be back!!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice Esthetics. Horrible Noise.,"Super noisy stay. First, despite being a rewards member & requesting a quiet room, they put me next door to screaming toddlers. They moved me to a corner room, which was lovely to look at, but experienced loud thumping noises all hours of the night. Desk staff was polite. Food service not so much. Horrible experience with the food as well. Had purchased a Park & Perk package, got double charged for the parking, still waiting on refund. Was denied discount on market purchases for some reason.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful Hyatt Experience,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Downtown Denver, which was the base location for a large wedding that we attended in early November.  This was our first stay at a Hyatt Hotel -- anywhere -- and I must say that this place is wonderful from the front desk staff, valet, doormen, bartenders, wait staff, and housecleaning, to the on-site restaurant.  The location is convenient to the 16th Street pedestrian mall, light rail system, restaurants, bars, and nightlife.  The rooms are bright, modern, and spotless.  We highly recommend the Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown Hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful Hotel and Staff!,Such a great hotel and super attentive staff! We just stayed here for one night to watch the Avalanche play and the experience was perfect (except for the Avs loosing)! Every hotel staff we interacted with was so friendly and helpful.

Highly recommend this hotel if you are in Denver!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Downtown Denver a Grand Hyatt,"We spent a weekday night at the Grand. 3 couples celebrating a birthday. The hotel is perfectly situated in downtown Denver. Although since we took advantage of the lounge access ,we never left the hotel. Happy hour at the lounge was lovely . Views from the room looked out over downtown and were mesmerizing . Room was spotless and bed was wonderful. Looking forward to coming back soon.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt  Denver,We really loved staying at the Grand Hyatt in Denver.We met 2 other couples friends that we have known for over 40 years.The Grand was what we wanted.Eat at the club upstairs playing cards in thelobby just relaxing in a beautiful place.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Best Hyatt I've stayed in,"Love this hotel! I travel often for work and usually stay only at Marriott's. I couldn't get a room at my usual hotel so thought I would stay here while in town for business and am sure glad I did! This Hyatt is fantastic! The staff is super friendly, the rooms are spotlessly clean, and very quiet which is important to me. I never heard another person while in my room. Honestly wouldn't change a thing! They've converted me and I will stay here next time I'm in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt is indeed GRAND!,"My daughter and I flew in for one night only and the special occasion of seeing the Monet Exhibition.  The staff were super friendly and helpful and we definitely chose the right hotel - love, love the two fireplaces and large community table - also, plenty of spaces to lounge in the lobby.  We were on the 11th floor and we liked that the elevators require a key to operate by guests for every floor.  The breakfast buffet was fresh and a wonderful variety.  We would most definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"nice property, rude (morning)customer service","Stay the night; DO NOT eat at the Courier restaurant!! If you order off the menu instead of the Sunday buffet, you may not EVER get your food. We did not. When we asked when our breakfast order would be out we were informed that it would ""be awhile longer"" because there was only one person working in the kitchen.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Another short but GRAND stay!,"Had another absolutely wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Denver. We arrived here after checking out of the Grand Hyatt Vail. Valet parking was a breeze. The hotel manager had reached out in advance to make any final arrangements and confirm an arrival time, which is something I definitely appreciate. Again, the location is perfect. Just a block from the 16th St. Mall and a great area to stroll. For this stay, we were given a club level room with outstanding views of the skyline and mountains behind.  There are so many nice features in these rooms including robes and slippers, and motion activated floor level and under-vanity lighting. Plenty of outlets and USB ports by the bed and desk area and the TV was huge by any hotel standard. For being right in the middle of the city, the room has that resort feel.The stay was so short, all we did was sleep in the room, but we did stop by the Club Lounge in the evening before dinner and again the next morning. In both cases, we found an absolutely wonderful spread of food and drinks. The staff were very friendly and the lounge was clean and well stocked. The roasted vegetables, hot appetizers, homemade granola, and perfectly cooked oatmeal all hit the spot. I'm so glad I decided to spring for another stay at the Grand Hyatt Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good Downtown Hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt. Pros:-close to everything-comfortable rooms-nice staff-well decorated/pretty facilities-we absolutely loved our shower, best water pressure everCons:-beds were extremely uncomfortable; both of us woke up hurting every morning-food, especially in the club, was not good at all-with events going on, parking, even valet, was extremely difficult at night",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,First time in Denver,"Staff was amazing. Area was safe to walk at all times.Location was perfect, quick walk anywhere you want to go. Valet parking fee was a bit high. We decided to park across the street for half the price. Will return in the summer.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Would stay again,"I would stay here again, but it wasn't great.  Front desk and bell staff were very friendly.  Housekeeping wasn't great and on one day I returned to my room at 3pm and my room was still not serviced.  Had a group and went to the lobby bar after our event at 11:15pm. Bartender closed the bar and wouldn't serve as it appeared she was just wanting to leave.  There were 6 or 8 ppl already in the bar that she was kicking out early as well.Attended meetings at the Denver Convention Center and it was about a 4 block walk which wasn't bad at all.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,EXCELLENT SERVICE!,"Our room was great- clean, very comfortable bed, updated- we love the barn door on the bathroom and the super large shower.  Staff was friendly, helpful, and quick to respond.  The restaurant was great.  The breakfast buffet and regular menu offered so many great options.  The gym is nice and so is the indoor pool.  The only ""wish was different"" that we have is a HOT TUB(s).  We came to Denver for an active vacation- Skiing, outdoors at the Broncos, walking the Denver elevation- it would have been nice to have a hot tub.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,HOSPITALITY,"25th floor room east facing very comfortable. Delighted to see a comfy 2 person sofa. Usually one comfy seat and your companion sits in an office chair or on the bed? What a clever and sensible idea. Also full length mirror and plenty of luggage space. Decent closet, good bedding and spacious restroom. Only a single vanity but you could have a party with three friends in the shower. Practical desk with good lighting.The Grand Club on 26th floor very accommodating and excellent staff. Light meal, snacks, small bites in the evening and a good continental breakfast with coffee options in the morning. Lobby bar hosts live music some evenings and restaurant and bar reasonable options and price.Very limited space for valet car drop off and pick up is challenging. Pick up area much nicer since adding carpet and artwork but very limited seating. Strange large desk below TV and one small bench. Delete the desk and add more simple bench seating please. Also can be a bit slow and very congested. However the valet situation does not deter from the fact that this is a really nice hotel and great location.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,December 2019,"Excellent service at check in,  clean room,  friendly service at the coffee bar. The fireside area is lovely,  the decorations were lovely.   The pool and exercise area were clean and nice. We will stay here again.",5

We stayed last year, and, again, it was a lovely experience.  Location is wonderful.  We got up the next morning and went to Syrup for lunch.  Night before had drinks at the Brown Palace, a short walk away.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice Room eat elsewhere,"Awesome room like the motion lighting on the ground. Resturant Managers, the two that I dealt with with were amazing with their coustomer service,waitress and bartenters same. But the food was just not for me. They need more REGULAR type of food. had much better luck with room service. Just my thought.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Nice hotel, great staff","Stayed here for a week whilst attending a conference at the nearby conference centre. Easy check in, the young lady was very helpful and organised transport for the next days event. Room was pretty spacious & very clean with a nice bathroom. I found a leaflet in the hotel which offered amongst other things a tea kettle. Which was ordered & arrived in 15 minutes. I was not too well for the stay so stayed in the room for most of it. It is a 15 minute walk from the hotel to the conference centre which is convenient. Lots of restaurants within a short walk. Despite being on the 15th floor the roads surrounding it are pretty busy & you get emergency service vehicles morning, noon & especially at night. Overall as regards the a/c & heating though the room is pretty quiet. I didn't manage to make breakfast in the hotel at all, but did use the Starbucks which is a few minutes across the porte cochere, posh word for covered car entrance. I didn't eat in the restaurant but did use room service which was good, service was quick.The housekeepers were great providing tea bags as required & also cleaning the room to my schedule. Checkout was painless &transport was organised to the airport with little effort.y only complaint was it was pretty expensive. Probably because of the conference that was on.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great Hotel, Excellent Service!","The staff was very outgoing and made travelling with a two year old so much easier.  They gave her toys, the host at the restaurant entertained her (he was great!), and everybody was very willing to help with whatever we needed.  Also, I made a mistake and sent my dry cleaning out late and it was not scheduled to be ready until after I was supposed to be at an event.  I called laundry services and they put me in touch with the manager, Sean.  Sean was able to track down my dry cleaning and get it to me in plenty of time to make our event!  He saved me from getting killed by my wife and having to go out and buy a new suit.  I can't say enough good things about The Grand Hyatt Denver.  Because of this experience Hyatt is definitely our hotel of choice from now on.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent Service with clean rooms,"Excellent service and amenities.  Slippers, robe, eye mask and ear plugs were much appreciated.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice hotel with a very convenient location.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Centrally located, super clean, great staff",We had a great suite. It was immaculate!The sheets were so fresh and comfortable as were the beds. Great views.

You can walk to hundreds of places of interest from the hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great last minute gem,We booked at the HYATT at the very last minute. Road conditions prevented our road trip. The hotel was very nice with a modern appeal.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"A Very Comfortable and Spacious Stay, Right in the Heart of Denver.","The hotel is situated within walking distance of the convention center and other downtown attractions, so that is a big plus. When I checked in, they offered an upgrade, for an extra cost, and I politely declined. Then they gave it to me anyway... which was a little weird. The room was extremely spacious, with lots of room between the furniture and an extra lounge/chaise. The bathroom had a very long shower, which was nice, but also a little odd. The only slightly negative thing is where I was at--close to the elevator shafts, I could hear the elevators go up and down all day and all night. It wasn't loud and when you had the TV on, you could forget about it, but they should add something within the walls to deaden the elevator sounds. The curtains were on a horizontal roller and controlled by buttons on the wall, to which you can open or close completely, open a quarter, half, or three-forth. The only thing is when operating the curtains, it sounded like you were opening or closing the blast doors to a bomb shelter. Overall it was a nice stay and I would recommend staying here... just politely decline the upgrade next to the elevator shafts.",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Felt more like a Hyatt Centric than a Grand Hyatt,"We have stayed in this hotel numerous times, however, not in the last year or two. Although a Grand Hyatt, it was anything but grand. If you close the restaurant for an event, at a minimum have enough staff at the bar to support guests wanting a meal and drinks.  We were ""upgraded"" to a VIP suite, because when we checked in at almost 5pm, original suite was not available. There was dried chocolate (or some other brown substance I'd like to at least think was chocolate) on the chairs of the conference table, as well as long brown hair on our sink.",3

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Hotel + Club Access,"Loved every inch of this hotel. The appearance was clean, modern, and still cozy enough to relax. Our room had a nice view of Denver and looked just as nice as the rest of the hotel. I was impressed with the ease of use from the lighting, thermostat, shower, and plug-ins. We opted for the club access and it was 100% worth the extra charge. Between breakfast, TVs, mid-day cookies, views of Denver, and appetizers/drinks in the evening (plus the truly phenomenal staff that work the club), it was the perfect ""in between"" when you need a break from your room, but aren't ready to leave the hotel yet.",5

Allowing us to go out on Halloween while the new guest checked in and got into the room without problem. I would recommend the Grand Hyatt in Denver!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hyatt property in downtown Denver,"We stayed here for a last minute trip. The staff was super accommodating as we added an extra night at the last minute. Beds were comfortable, and the room was well appointed including a rain shower. They also have a very nice lounge if you're a Hyatt member. Only complaint is how many sirens you can hear at night! It felt like an ambulance/police car/firetruck must've driven by every 15 minutes. No fault of the hotel of course, but bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Second visit and still great!,This was our second visit to this property in 4 months and it did not disappoint!

The gym had many options too and the staff was on top of thing. Best part was the coffee maker in the room, it had BOLD decaf!!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A nice hotel with a few quirks,"Check-in sucked. Imagine taking some standing college computer work desks from IKEA, putting some desktop computers on them, and doing a free-for-all check-in process. I guess the old-school long counter-top is too old fashion. One of the staff decided her personal conversation with a non-geust was more important than those of use with luggage standing there waiting to check-in. She even called him back to keep talking when he saw us waiting on her and tried to leave.Room Service and House Keeping were awesome. The room was clean and very nice.You need to swipe your card on the portal on the elevator panel and then press your button to get to your floor. Most of the elevator signs that say that are faded and you don't notice. My check-in person didn't bother to tell me so I got to go up and down a couple of times until I went back and asked.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,They care and it shows,"I travel a lot. This stay with Hyatt DT Denver has been one of the best experiences I have had.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Room Not Guaranteed,"I was traveling for work, booked my room in September and checked in on-line the day of my arrival knowing I would be getting in late. When I arrive after 11:00pm I was told my king bed room was not available. The staff also told me that rooms are NEVER guaranteed when booking a standard room. I was given a double queen room for a single person and the staff 's comment was ""they are all the same"". I reminded them that the bed sizes were not the same. I was also told I should have checked in on-line. When I produced a receipt from the on-line check-in I was told ""well that's still processing"", something I have no control of, even though I have checked in on-line at 11:00am. Which means that my room was not available at 11:00AM the day of my arrival. Another staff member attempted to jump in stating they had sold out the king rooms three days earlier. When I told her I had booked my king room over a month ago she quickly retreated from the conversation. I was given a $50 room credit for my troubles which they did not honored on my room service order.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great location, wonderfully friendly","Good location in downtown.  Easy walk to convention center.  The hotel is very nice, and I was quite impressed with the quality of everything.  While it depends on your definite of nice or luxury, while this obviously isn't a Park Hyatt, I think it is one of the best Grand Hyatt's out there.  What truly made my stay was the staff.  Everyone from check-in, to housekeeping, to the lounge was incredibly friendly and helpful.  And they were genuine too.  Andrew in the Grand club was particularly friendly and helpful.  Thank you.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Responsive GM, the best Grand Club in the United States, Modern rooms!","I stayed here back in November/December 2018 as an Explorist. I reached out to the GM, Mark Stiebeling, in advance as I was celebrating a birthday. Mark took great care of us, upgrading us to a suite on the Grand Club floor which I thought was an incredibly kind gesture. The staff we talked to in the Grand Club were so fun and friendly and the food was excellent - there were several hot food items out in the evening. We had room service once and it was tasty and reasonably priced. I shelled out for the expensive valet parking although you can probably find parking for less in nearby garages - check that out first. Hotel was in a decent location walkable to the Mall. The room was clean, comfortable, and modern. I would stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel.  Loved the sensor night light throughout the room.  Made it easy to navigate without  waking everyone up.  Would definitely stay there again.  Close to food, convention center and the 16th Street Mall - walking distance.",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,afternoon Nap,"This is a beautiful hotel. We left our other hotel bc there was no late checkout available. We got a room so we could relax and take a nap before our overnight flight home. It is located a block off the mall and has street parking available. that saved us the 30 a day from the last place. The check in staff was so nice. The lobby was gorgeous  and very soothing. We headed up to our room which was large and spacious and spotless. We left after a few hours rested and relaxed. If we come to Denver, this would be high on our list.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Experience at a Grand Hotel,The staff here go over the top to ensure your stay is all you can expect.  I was impressed with the level of service.  Food and beverage offering were top notch as well.  The little things like music in the lobby each night put the finishing touches on this stay. The hotel was within walking distance to many local attractions and a short ride to others.  I'll be back when in the Denver area.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt Denver,"The Grand Hyatt was centrally located and provided easy access to downtown Denver.  This was a business trip, and I attended a conference at the adjacent building.  The conference facility was well appointed and had a fabulous view of the surrounding area and mountains.  I would definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt Denver again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,The night the lights went out in Denver,"I do not stay at Hyatts very often, but I arrived in my room after dinner at 7p lost power at the facility and no water to take shower.  Woke up in the morning to power only to leave.  Expensive camping experience without the water or forest view.  This rating could have been much higher but after a 15 hour travel day, i just wanted a shower.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Mediocrity at best.,"I requested early check in and did not receive it, while i understand that this is not guaranteed, the Front Desk Clerk's solution was to try to upsell me an upgrade so I could have a room immediately. As someone traveling since 4AM and exhausted this came off sleazy and tacky. I waited another hour and saw plenty of other people check in and go to rooms, I finally went to a different agent (Joy) who immediately checked me in and was a joy to work with. My room was incredibly subpar. I backed up to the elevators and enjoyed a lovely roaring noise every time one went by. The tile grout in the shower was grungey (visibly) like you could see the gradient as the grunge got cleaner towards the walls and areas less used in the shower. The comforter felt like a thin piece of cardboard. I kept looking behind me thinking i was sleeping on top of the duvet and under one of those decorative top layers hotels use. Nope that truly was the duvet. The food for the conference was subpar. One meal they tried serving us tacos, and it was the worst hotel meal I've ever had, after that I stopped eating the conference food.The one good thing about the experience was a lady named Joy who worked at the Front Desk. Anytime I had a question, or needed to speak to someone she was more than helpful and very friendly (unlike the first person I dealt with at the front desk). Joy was the only good thing about this experience. Everything else was mediocre at its best.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Hotel or Circus...,"The staff is awesome, the rooms are OK as long as the circus isn't in town. Elephants in party mode is not fun, I think they were playing basketball in their room! The seals were quieter but you could still hear the loud rapturous snores wafting in from the ceiling, maybe they were walrus's???",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location and Great staff,"The Room and staff were very good and very professional.  A short power outage and my concerns about it were handled well.  Ate mostly with a conference, but the caprese flatbread was outstanding and the room service very fast.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Location,Our room was big and cozy and completely quiet.  We had a bit of trouble figuring out how to turn on the lights - the lighting seemed a bit old-fashioned.  There was live music in the lobby.  The staff was friendly and efficient but not overbearing.  We must have been staying there during a busy time because the room rates were quite high.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Look Hyatt but not this one!,Two night stay for conference and had no water or electricity. Couldn't flush toilet or shower. Unable to charge or work on computer or phone. Then had brown water that looked like coffee come out of faucet. I understand a power issue but they were less than accommodating or offered any assistance or anything for that matter. Plus the restaurant had terrible service and both times after being seated and waiting forever - we finally walked out and down the street to another place.,2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"First time stay in Hyatt, first time stay in Denver","Hotel is conveniently located 2 blocks from the 16th street mall and the 16th street free bus which traverses the length of downtown Denver.  Art Museum and Mint Museum, among others, are also within easy walking distance.  The staff was friendly, the hotel was clean.  Power actually went out on its city block fro an hour one night.  We missed this, but returned to free drinks at the bar as an apology (an apology I personally don't think was necessary...stuff happens!).  Great experience, highly recommend this hotel for your Denver stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Nice hotel, centrally located in Denver","Had a very pleasant stay at this hotel recently. The staff is excellent and the amenities are very nice.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,nice short stay - Denver Grand Hyatt,"2 overnights for a business conference - room clean and although paid $5 per night for a ""view"" not really worth it - would have preferred the mountain views. Service was excellent - check in and concierge on advise on where to get transportation. Also left my phone charge in the room and came back and they promptly retrieved it from the room for me. Attended the conference in the adjoining building 38th floor with magnificent views, nice service and very good food! Great location to 16th street mall and Union Station.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Overall great,I use Uber/Lyft a lot. I had to leave in the early morning and then I did not know where to meet my driver. Hopefully this location can help set up pick up location instruction like airport for people who use this type of service.Location was great and easy to access. The bar at the first floor has enough space to host most event attendees. I had a good time and opportunity with my prospect.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great Hotel, Poor Restaurant ","The hotel and staff were great but the on-site restaurant, Courier, made our experience less than stellar.  Unfortunately it was freezing cold and snowing so we were ""forced"" to eat here twice.  The food was so-so, very limited menu, lots of salads, wraps, and meat/cheese boards.  Not exactly a good fit when the temp outside was single digits.  Maybe more soups and warm offerings?  But by far the worse part of the dining experience was the service.  If you don't have two hours to dine, I would go elsewhere, and that was at an off time with few other diners.  You'll be hangry by the time you get your cold wrap or salad before heading out the door into the bitter cold.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice hotel in nice location,"I was here for conference for 2 days. It's the first Grand Hyatt I've stayed at, the open concept at the check-in is very nice. Staff can better introduce everything to you.I got a 2 Queen room on the 8th floor without much view. But the bed is very comfortable. Part of the conference is in the meeting rooms on the 38th floor of the building next to the hotel which belongs to the hotel. From there I get the nice view of Denver and the Rocky Mountains.The food served during conference were very good, I'd say above average.The hotel is located one block from the 16th Street pedestrian mall which you can find lots of restaurants, shops and entertainment.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"\Excellent Service, Location and Lounge Ammenities!","My friend and I had an excellent stay at the hotel. All the hotel staff we encountered were positive, friendly, and  went out of their way to help where they could. We chose a room that allowed us to have Lounge Access. It was WONDERFUL: breakfast array included: scrambled eggs, fresh berry medly, warm oatmeals (with toppings including their housemade granola), array of fresh breads/muffins/bagels, Salmon/capers/onions/tomatoes/cream cheese, array of cereals, juices/coffees/teas/espresso machine. Service was REMARKABLE upstairs during lounge access - eager to help staff and very friendly and warm. We went the evening too and nice array of crackers/meat/cheese/nuts/bar/etc. was offered. Excellent service upon check-in, check-out and during our stay. In fact. on the day of our departure, I could not locate the train schedule, so the concierge staff member voluntarily delivered a printed out train station schedule to my room. So kind and super helpful!Great location - heart of downtown and within 1.5 blocks of 16th street Mall and about 1/2 - 1mile from several sights - ie: Union Station, Larimer Square, etc.  Close to many Denver spots to see.

My only complaint would be that even on the 23rd floor, I was woken up by sirens all night long. They do offer ear plugs, which I would suggest if you have a corner room.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Anahi was outstanding🙏🏽,I’m staying at your hotel this weekend for my residency with Syracuse U.  Anahi was extremely helpful in giving me tips on what to do to kill time as I waited for my room.  She also went above and beyond by sharing with me local music and dancing venues to visit as I’m from out of town and like to experience nightlife in cities that I visit.  She was a pleasure to deal with and sets the standard for what you would expect from a Hyatt associate.  Thanks and l look forward to visiting Denver and staying with you in the future.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Super, super solid hotel!","It’s been a few months since I’ve stayed at the Grand Hyatt, although I’ve been traveling for work the majority of the year and I just have to say - I miss it. I’m a Hyatt loyalty member but I’ve tried other Hyatt brand in other cities and they just don’t compare! This is truly one of the nicest out there. You will not be disappointed. Rooms are beautiful, views are amazing, beds are sublime, and the service is all around great. If you’re deciding between Grand or Regency, DEFINITELY go with Grand and avoid the convention crowd.Lobby bar is great (drinks/service/live music), but the adjacent restaurant bar is usually an odd crowd. I wish I could teleport back, if only for a room service fresh-from-the-oven brownie sundae 🥰Oh - and there are literally 2 Starbucks within feet of the hotel (just make sure you’re placing your online order with the right one)...",5

So it is better to search for a public parking somewhere close because it is half price.,4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Starbucks 24/7, great gym / take train from airport","A 3-night stay on business.  A great hotel in downtown that I was not able to explore. As a fitness enthusiast, the gym was great and spacious, even when more busy. Plus a view to the outside - a big plus. Rooms are standard, I did not bother with a mountain -view ($10.00 more per night.) A visit to the Bar / restaurant on the 27th floor was my idea of the mountain view. As I stayed on NYC time, have a 24/7 Starbucks in the Lobby was a fantastic plus. Highly recommend a stay at this spacious and modern hotel. (Took train from the airport late at night. You can buy a ticket ahead of time online.)",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Flew in for a Broncos game,Wasn't real impressed with the hotel itself. Will not stay there ever again. But the valet lady Anna Anahi was super nice!

Bed was comfortable, we could have used a few more towels but that was not a deal breaker.We had the King Club room which gave us access to the Club Room. The breakfast was a traditional continental breakfast, nothing to write home about, but the evening appetizers the nights we were there were fantastic! The waitstaff were super friendly and attentive. The free sodas, water, juice, coffee/tea was appreciated. Alcohol was an honor bar so not free, but we knew that ahead of time.The staff are super helpful, we had 2 maintenance issues during our stay, we notified the front desk and the issues were fixed by the time we retuned later that afternoon. They even left a card explaining what happened and how it was fixed. I appreciated that.The hotel is about 2 blocks from 16th Street Mall and 8 or so blocks from Union Station and Coors Field. Very centrally located. There is a 7-11 on the corner for some basics, or the hotel has a small market within the restaurant/bar if you need something NOW!Free postcards! The hotel provided free postcards, you fill in the postcard they will drop the postage on it and mail it for you! LOVED THAT, so did my mom, cause she got a postcard!I would stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Superb Location,"I'm loyal to Hyatt, so I of course stayed at one during my weekend getaway to Denver. I really enjoyed this property. There were a few minor glitches that the staff promptly corrected. Other than that, my room was extremely clean, the staff friendly, breakfast good and the location was PERFECT. It's in the center of downtown Denver, so only blocks away from plenty of dining options and walking through the city. I would stay here again, primarily for the location.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice place to stay,All amenities were available but while I was on business I did not have a great deal of time to enjoy the tennis court or the aquatic center. The hotel is just a couple of blocks for the trolley that connects to Union Station where you can catch the light rail to the airport for only $10.00. Heck of a deal!!,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Good location, happy staff but small pool and old furniture","It is located in the center of downtown area, only two blocks from walking street, so very convenient for walking around city center. The valet parking cost 48 a day but nearby parking lots costs about half. The room is nice and comfortable and the breakfasts is very good too. The swimming pool is (similar to many Hyatt in the USA) kids play size, not good for laps. The Hyatt club staff is nice but furniture is old and need paint job. The alcoholic drink although offered free in all other grand Hyatt, strangely is not free in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt Denver Stay,Traveled to Denver for a professional conference. The Grand Hyatt served as host hotel for lodging. Provided all accommodations expected. It was an easy walk to the Denver Convention Center. It also had a nice roof top running track. If traveling for pleasure this would not be my hotel choice.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very nice hotel,"We got a suite when we stayed here. Very spacious, well appointed and clean. Hotel is located in a great location downtown within easy walking distance to the local pedestrian mall. Save yourself a few bucks when you stay there and park at the parking garage right next door instead of using the valet.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great room, very reasonable cost, perfect downtown location, couldnt be better","I was treated very well by all I came in contact with at the Grand Hyatt. I had a great room, great price, felt very safe, secure in a big city, as an alone female. I loved Clayton took control over an UBER cost inflation  told me not to order it and ordered me a limo instead. I loved how he took over and handled it.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Very nice hotel, with great staff.  Just too expensive for my personal taste.","The hotel staff was excellent!  My only issue was our room wasn't cleaned one of the days we were there (to be fair we were in and out of the room during typical cleaning hours).  I asked the front desk to send more towels and wash cloths to be sent up to get us by.  The fresh towels never arrived.  Again, a minor glitch in otherwise stellar service.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,grand visit,"This is a great facility for a convention.  Rooms are well appointed, and food was served quickly.  The banquet dinner was especially delicious.It was easy to find our way around the building and to move from to and from the second and third floors.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great Stay, helpful staff","Had a great experience at Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown. Staff is super friendly and accommodating. Mark, General Manager reached out prior to my arrival and made sure all was intact with my reservation and wanted to know if there were any additional needs. Upon arrival staff provided details of hotel and immediately checked me in. Great room. Great Views. Food is fantastic. Staff is very welcoming. I would highly recommend Grand Hyatt Downtown Denver and do NOT forget the brunch in the morning! Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,National Guard Association of United States stay,"Amiee is the first face to great you in the valet area. She is courteous, friendly and wonderful with all patrons! The hotel was clean and hospitable.  The overall stay was very relaxing considering it was a business trip.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Lovely rooms, overpriced breakfast buffet","The room was clean, updated and had a great little cucumber lotion that smelled terrific. The restaurant was overpriced and the staff were unattentive, $18 for a continental breakfast and $24 for the breakfast buffet is way overpriced. I feel that there should be a discount or coupon or something for the guests staying in the hotel to receive free or discounted breakfast especially at the prices we are paying for the hotel room. The hotel staff was great my only issue was the restaurant staff were very unattentive and we sat there waiting for our food for over half an hour and then we waited another 35 minutes for our check and could not get our waitress and nobody else would come and help us they said that they would get our waitress but never did.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very nice facility,"My stay was very pleasant. The property is clean, modern and well maintained. The location is great - so much within walking distance. My only complaint would be regarding the extremely expensive daily parking rate of $46.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Business Stay,Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  Rooms were very clean and cleaning staff was very friendly and accommodating when asked.  Not inexpensive but the room was spacious and easy to work from and rest.,5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Let My Friend Sleep in the Street,I used all my points to stay at the Grand Hyatt for one night with 3 of my friends. One of our friends got separated from the group and was able to make it back to the hotel. He had lost his phone and ID at the club. Upon arriving and trying to figure out what room we were in he was told that camera footage had been reviewed and that he had never been to that hotel. They proceeded to tell him he could not stay in the hotel lobby. 7 hours later I went outside and found him. All the hotel could tell me was that they reviewed footage of me and my friends checking in with two other individuals but somehow failed to notice who the other two individuals were.,1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful property,Great location to downtown Denver and the convention center. Gorgeous rooms with excellent bed and mattress. Amazing and prompt service. Will definitely continue to use Hyatt locations in all my destinations. ,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place,"We came to stay at the Gran Hyatt for our 6 year anniversary. We wanted to spend a night out in town dancing at a club, we definitely had a great time everything was within  walking distance and we really enjoyed coming back to a confortable room.  Overall on the Hotel is great place,  great people, and great food. Definitely will be back again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very nice,"I forgot a razor and used their text service and one was left on my door, super fast and convenient.  Also, upon check-out someone charged breakfast to my room which i didn't order, but it was quickly removed-no questions asked.  One morning the gym was little crowded, but the next day it wasn't, but even better they have an outdoor running track around a tennis court (connected to gym).    Very cool!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very clean,"It is what I expected, which is very comforting when picking a place to lay your head for the night.    The restaurant bar area is a little weird.  You are sitting in a convenience store/bagel shop/bar/café style restaurant and it is not inviting for a drink.  ",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Pay for A Club Room, You Will Not Regret It!","If you stay here, make sure to get a Club Room. The food and hospitality are outstanding! The location is excellent, but bring your earplugs because you'll need them.  There are scooters all over town, so you can scoot all over town with ease!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Quick Weekend Trip,We were very pleased with our stay at the Grand Hyatt Denver. The hotel was very asthetically pleasing upon checking in. We were even able to check in several hours early. Our room was very clean and spacious. I wish we had been able to spend more time enjoying it!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel.  Great location,"Really enjoyed our stay.  Staff were wonderful and super helpful.  Gave us a bunch of great tips.The room was large and very clean.  Location of the hotel is great.Only issue we had was the number of sirens outside throughout the night.  Nothing the hotel can control.  The hotel must be on a well traveled ambulance route.  If you are a sound sleeper, you will have no issues.  We will definitely be back",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Downtown Denver Adventure,"Great location for public transportation, RTD, public bus (free 16th street bus). Coors Field is only blocks away. Great restaurants and watering holes all within blocks of the Hotel.  Rental Car companies are additionally located near the hotel. The hotel staff helped us imenslly by giving us an early check in.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Comfortable ,"I arrived early and the front desk was very accommodating and allowed me to check in which was much appreciated.  However, the front desk during check out was curt so perhaps a five star check in and a three star departure.  This hotel is older but does a good job of keeping it refreshed.  Great location with some nice views.  A bonus since the hotel is older stock is that the rooms tend to be larger than the newer hotels.  The bathrooms were updated and nice. The lounge, if you have access,  has nice views and a decent breakfast.  Overall very comfortable.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt  Denver - Just OK,"We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt and while the hotel itself was okay, it was certainly nothing special. Our bathroom was a bit dirty upon arrival (dusty door, countertop was dirty), and the bathroom sink was slow to drain. However, the big downside was the neighborhood. There was garbage and homeless people everywhere, and there must have been a fire or police station nearby because even on the 20th floor we could hear sirens all night long.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very Gracious and accommodating,"Our stay at the Grand Hyatt Denver was really enjoyable primarily because the location downtown, the view of the city from our room and the accommodating staff. We stayed on the 23rd floor (looking towards the TIAA tower) and it was an amazing backdrop to a couple of days stay in the center of Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very clean and friendly staff!,"I will definitely be booking my stay there again when I go back to Denver! Beautiful view, everyone was nice even the other guest! Close to 16th Street Mall with great food, shopping and entertainment!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Expensive but convenient ,"This hotel is very nice but beware of all the “extras.”  Parking is extra (and extremely expensive), breakfast is extra (also very expensive), and the fridge is teeny if you’re wanting to not eat out constantly.  The location is very convenient to public transit and to lots of restaurants, so that’s a big plus.  Staff is very nice and the beds are comfy, but next time I’d choose to stay somewhere with a free breakfast buffet and free parking.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent Team,"Everyone that I came in contact with at the Grand Hyatt Denver was great to work with.  From check in to realizing that I had forgotten my toothpaste and needed a replacement, everyone was on top of it and ready to assist.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Very geed except wheelchair access to ""accessible"" rooms.","The heavy door and raised threshold make it nearly impossible to enter or leave an otherwise accessible room without assistance. The food in the restaurant was exceptional and a good value.  Except for the difficulty entering, the accessible room was fine.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Exceptional Hotel!!!,"We were provided exceptional customer service from the moment we arrived.  The venue is beautiful and has everything you need, especially a wonderful staff to help you with any needs or offer any assistance.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location and service; Beautiful rooms and club lounge,"We recently got married at the Pinnacle Club (owned by and right next to the Grand Hyatt Denver). We stayed at the Grand Hyatt, and most of our guests did as well. Service was fantastic! All of our guests received a welcome and a free drink/appetizer, etc. of their choice. Our parents were upgraded to fantastic, large rooms with stunning mountain views. Beds were exceptionally comfortable, and some rooms were recently remodeled and held a beautiful, modern design. Our guests who stayed in standard rooms were also impressed and enjoyed their stay. Club lounge is larger than others we have been to with options throughout the day. Staff in the club lounge were super friendly and accommodating! Food was fantastic at the club lounge and at Courier, the restaurant downstairs. We can't wait to go back!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Place and Location.,"Stayed for a convention, great location close to events in the city.Great food and service. We were able to enjoy the baseball game as well as enjoy the local night life. Hotel is within walking distance to great local restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,In Denver for Conference,"Very nice hotel and conference center. A little pricey on some of the amenities but it is to be excepted for being Denver. The dining was good but could have a larger venue, they struggled with large crowds.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location and service,"This was our last stop on a week long vacation. We were going to be doing a walking food tour of Denver and were worried about logistics. Upon arrival at 10:30 am, they let us check in and gave us a room (I used the text ahead service that was emailed). This allowed us to get our things settled and head out for a hot day. The Courier restaurant was great for a late-dinner (nothing spectacular but easy for two tired children and a Mom that wanted a glass of wine). I didn't check out the fitness center, but was happy with the room. My only complaints: I hate having to pay for coffee in the morning, a coffee station would have been nice. OR a better machine in the room to make my own. And the valet station is confusing..we stood outside for a good 5 minutes before someone saw us and told us that our car would be in another area.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,nice hotel but terrible valet parking experience,"My wife and I spent a night in this hotel and enjoyed the clean and nice room. The location being a block away from the 16th street mall and an easy walk to the Coors Field was very nice. We used the valet service to have our car parked overnight and assumed considering the amount of money for valet parking that our car would be safely parked. But after we got back home, we noticed a big scrape with a dent about 5 inches wide on the front part of the roof. It looked like the car (an SUV) was too tall for a low hanging structure. Although it was clear to us that the damage was done during the valet at the hotel, since we didn't immediately notice it when we picked up the car, we had no way of proving that the hotel valet caused it. The damage ended up costing us more than $1k to repair it. So what was to be a nice night out became a very expensive trip for us. My advice to anyone that use the valet service here (or anywhere for that matter), and this is what I'll do from now on, please thoroughly check your car for damage before accepting the car from valet. I know they try to hurry you along, but I think it's worth it to take the time.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location for Walking,"Grand Hyatt Denver downtown location is perfect for walking to nearby restaurants and Union Station, US Mint, shopping etc. Only drawback is the street people are apparent in this area. Parking lots nearby for $5 a day on weekends.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful hotel,"Was a perfect place to stay in Downtown Denver.  A short walk to 16th street.  Hotel itself had tasty room service, great customer service, and it was pretty.  Took my kiddo along and he told me this was the nicest hotel he's stayed at.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Consider me impressed,"I stayed here for a few nights for a conference - and it left me wondering why I don't use Hyatt more often.  On the outside this hotel looks a bit drab - however not at all on the inside!  The lobby and hallways feel fresh and modern, and the room I had was in excellent working condition.  The elevators move fast and get you to your floor quickly.  In the rooms, there are some very well thought out features, which other hotel chains (even 5 star ones) could learn from.  The bedrooms have motion sensing lights in the nightstands, which give just enough light to show the way to the bathroom in the middle of the night when you step on the rug - and go out quickly when you get back in bed.  This is a fantastic feature!  The beds are made with a sheet and blanket, NOT a winter Duvet.  Thank you Hyatt!  Why on Earth do so many excellent hotels dress their beds like its the middle of winter, even in July?  Also, the window shades in my room were electronic; a lovely and useful luxury.  The technology worked well, with large television with many HD channels, with many free channels and pay per view movies.  The thermostat worked.  The bathroom was not large, however it was well laid out, and the shower was particularly comfortable with plenty of room, good water pressure, and sliding glass doors that didn't let lots of water out onto the floor.  The bed was firm but not too much, and there was a great leather reading chair in the room with a well-placed reading lamp just behind it.  All in all, this hotel room showed an attention to detail from those who designed and furnished it, with thoughtful touches proving they cared about what a traveler and human being would actually find useful.  I'd stay here again, no doubt.  Excellent value for your money.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great Service, Beautiful Rooms","The staff were very helpful and attentive to all of my needs. The rooms are beautifully kept and has a great view of the city. The hotel is located in the heart of Denver, so it is walking distance to the 16th Street Mall among other attractions.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Comfort and service A plus,Spend few days here in May this year and it was very good and a great location. Food and service was excellent and big comfortable rooms. Bars at first floor are fun to stay at with good atmoThank youH Jonasson,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place to stay,Everyone was above  and beyond anything that I expected!  Andrew on the food service place on the top floor went above and beyond my expectations and even though he was very busy was there to contribute to a wonderful experience,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Aimee in Valet was GREAT!,"We stay at Hyatt's all the time.  Although the room wasn't as clean as I would expect, overall we had a great time with great service.  Aimee in Valet was friendly, helpful, and courteous.  We enjoyed meeting her.  She was even kind enough to take a picture with us so we could keep an ongoing joke going regarding my husband's car that he named Aimee.  She was a great sport and a great employee.  Hyatt should appreciate her!",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location ,"Great location! Perfect hotel based on location and proximity to walking. Highly recommend if you are staying in the downtown area.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Central location with notable comfort,"I stayed in a king bedroom at the Grand Hyatt Denver for one night before a job interview downtown last month (July 2019). My check-in process was efficient; the desk staff identified my Hyatt Passport loyalty number (as I am not a frequent Hyatt visitor) to ensure that I was rewarded for the stay. After check-in, I proceeded to my room, where unfortunately I immediately noticed the amount of noise coming from the room next door. After debating briefly (I probably would have toughed it out had I not had a job interview the next morning), I called down to the front desk and spoke with the same desk attendant that had checked me in minutes prior. I explained the situation and was asked to return down to the front desk; within minutes I was in a new, suitably quiet room. I am appreciative of the desk staff for taking the complaint seriously and making sure that my concerns were addressed right away (even without any Hyatt loyalty status, etc.) The room itself was of standard size for a branded, downtown hotel room. The furniture and fixtures were updated; I was glad to have a comfortable desk chair and an adequate work area in order to tackle several work tasks that night and the next morning. The standard WiFi speed was acceptable in order to get said work done. However, unfortunately for me, I realized after unpacking that I left behind a padfolio, and despite my initial panic, I found that the hotel was just blocks away from the 16th Street Mall, where I was able to get a new padfolio (and other supplies) at Target. I also had a number of dining options within blocks as a result. What a relief!The linens were clean and fresh, and the bed itself was notably comfortable. I travel somewhat often for both business and pleasure, and this particular bed stood out from others for its firm but inviting support. I also always appreciate a complimentary robe--not necessary, but it is a nice touch for a hotel stay. The bathroom was adequately sized and clean as well; no surprises but sufficient to get me ready for my big day in the morning.I did not eat breakfast down in the lobby, but I did catch lunch in the marketplace after the interview and before my flight. I was really appreciative of the counter staff that bore with me as I took an unexpected work call and mouthed my order to them--they were very understanding and courteous, and even helped me find a table space and grabbed napkins for me while I wrapped up the call. The wrap that I had was above par for a typical grab and go lunch outfit. In summary I praise this Grand Hyatt for its central location, comfortable rooms, and attentive staff--and that is coming from a Hilton loyalist. With a little brightening of the decor/more usage of natural light in the design, this hotel would earn high marks across the board.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A very nice stay that comes at a price.,"This is an agreeable hotel that could do better. The acoustics in the entrance hall are not very good, so when there's a musician performing it is very hard to have a conversation. The room was good even though the furniture looks a bit tired and worn. The view from our room was spectacular and the bathroom was more than adequate, with plenty of towels. The room comes with a coffee machine and a fridge but no microwave. Parking is very easy if you use the valet service. The hotel has a huge car park which is used for valet parking. This means that one can ring ahead for the car to be delivered at the entrance of the car park. It works well but the price for this service is similar to San Francisco. Guests at the hotel are not allowed to park their cars at this car park. Breakfast is very good, with smoked salmon offered , which was a first for me in the U.S. All that was needed was for the hotel to offer a glass or two of prosecco to make breakfast memorable in Denver. The service needs to be tightened up though as it is too laid back for my liking. The hotel is exceedingly well situated but avoid staying when there's a convention in town as the lobby becomes a mass of people full energy and hence the noise level becomes unbearable. Finally, there is something that looks like an open fire at the bar and for some reason it reminded of how Hollywood portrays hell. I thought it was very funny seeing people drinking at the bar and this very large fire in front of them. Perhaps this is a way of getting to repent their sins!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent location and great customer service all the way around,"The location provides easy walking to downtown Denver.  Also close to mass transit and tons of bike kiosk around Denver.  If that's not your speed Uber and Lyft are just a phone call away.  HINT:  I would not try and park downtown, especially overnight.  Valet cost for parking were $48/night.  You can find some cheaper around the area, but still your better getting on a bike or catching Uber, Lyft, and a taxi.  Price for hotel is not overly expensive for area.  Room was on 10th floor and was interesting you could hear everything outside...Siren's, Vehicles, etc.  So maybe when hotel upgrades they will invest in some better windows???  Overall the stay was great and the staff were excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,overall good,"Overall is good. Room is clean, has a small fridge, quiet, room service was good, but toilet and sink (faucet) not that satisfactory, club breakfast has no bacon or sausage which is too bad, only warm food was egg, but food at other times are good. They also provide beverages and water.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Business Trip to Denver,"I had a quick, one night business trip to Denver last week.  I stayed at the Grand Hyatt downtown.  It's a very good hotel, well located with a wonderful staff.  The condition of the hotel is very good.  The only negative was my experience at the Grand Club where there was clearly a large group staying in the hotel who took over the club for breakfast making it difficult to impossible for anyone else to enjoy their breakfast in the club.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Best Stay Ever,"Words can not express the love and professionalism that we were shown. The entire team to include Mahina ( front Desk), and the entire Valet staff. Thank you to them all. It was my boyfriends birthday and the made it Fabulous!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Helpful Beyond Belief!,"I was traveling with a colleague and asked for our rooms to be located on the same floor if possible. Despite the difficulty of this request, every effort was made by staff upon check-in to locate my colleague and I on the same floor and, in fact, in side-by-side rooms! It made everything so much more convenient during the week-long trip and I could not be more appreciative! As a woman traveling alone (except for my colleague) this meant everything to me! Thank you so much! The staff is so very caring here and I cannot say enough about how much this seemingly small thing meant to me (especially because I know how difficult it is to do such a thing in practice)! Exceptional service!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful,Spectacular Lobby area with full on bar and coffee bar that did a great job with my complex order. Check in was flawless. Fitness center was large and had a large selection of equipment. Didn’t feel crowded and it was nice and cold . Yeah! Comfortable bed with little coffee bar we didn’t use. Across from the convention and shopping area. Perfect stay!,5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Hotel near 16th Street Downtown Denver,Hotel was good location but not near Lodo and Market area.   Free shuttle on 16th to take you to all the desired parts of the city. Use Spot hero and park nearby as it's $46/night there. Breakfast at the restaurant there was great,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Nice hotel, great location","Nicely updated hotel with very friendly staff. Great location, can walk to a lot of downtown’s interesting locations.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A Room with the View,"We only stayed a night, but, loved our room and the view of downtown Denver. The location was perfect for walking to dinner or a late night stroll around the town. Any time we had a question the staff was very helpful. Also, you must try breakfast at the little restaurant.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel,Great hotel in a convenient location.  Enjoyed my experience and would recommend it to other travelers.  They let me do a one hour later checkout which really helped my conference schedule and work afterwards,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,It’s a do it yourself place.,"If you stay here, be prepared to do it all yourself. Check in is chaotic, with four laptop stations, no clear way to queue up and the staff wander in and out at will, no matter how many people are waiting to check in. Pay attention and just grab the first open person. Want a ride somewhere - Uber and Lyft, there is no one to get you a cab or help with your luggage. Flights going out later in the day?  Forget late check out. The front desk will tell you that you can’t ask for late check out until the day of and then, no matter when you ask for late check out (I called at 6 am) 1:00 is the latest they will give you. Hungry? There is one restaurant with a limited one page menu and a  snack “market place” that sells what a kiosk at the airport would offer. Lack of staff means that the plentiful Denver homeless population camp on the street outside the hotel and guests are on their own to navigate around them to get in and out to restaurants and shopping which are are plentiful two to three blocks away. I’ve travelled all over the world and felt uncomfortable getting from this hotel to where I needed to go daily.  Need to park your car? There are reasonably priced garages in the neighborhood ($20 a day) but the staff won’t tell you about them. To park here is $47 a day. Have a question? Don’t call the hotel — you have to physically go to the hotel front desk. The operator won’t even transfer your call to the front desk to hold for someone. Probably because they know no one will answer. They will tell you the staff is busy call back later.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,stay for business.,great but dont expect things to open too early even on business days around the area. even the fedex although there are conferences happening.the starbucks was not even open on sunday.room and service fabulous.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,The rooms were not clean.,The bathroom was disgusting. We only stayed one night but as a Hyatt member I was very disappointed in the overall cleanliness of the room.  The service was amazing though.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"central location, very nice attendants, comfortable rooms, quite good food","I attended a conference- 6 days. The experience was pleasant.  All the staff were attentive.  In the downstairs restaurant, the choices were enough and tasty with willingness to ""lettuce wrap"" and substitute. Lyft and Uber were easy finds- pick up in completely overhead sheltered valet parking. Easy walking distance to 16th street mall and Union station. Maybe skip the breakfast room service, but the rooms were clean and bright, beds were comfy.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Perfect,Perfect place to spend a few nights .  We love tennis and the court was great with pretty views . I usually don’t write reviews but I am today and it says I need to have 200 characters minimum .  So I hope this helps,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Easy, convenient and nice","The hotel was a great place to stay. The rooms were nice, spacious, and clean. The check in and check out process was very easy and fast. The only downside I would have is the valet parking. They charge you $46 per day, where we actually entered the same parking ramp they use and paid $18 per day.. ",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,nice downtown hotel,"Nice hotel, close to 16th street mall and Larimer Square.  Very business oriented.  Maid service was at times slow.  Parking expensive but there is a parking garage across street that is more reasonable.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,the room smelled like urine,The title says it all.  the cleaning crew admitted the room smelled like urine and offerred to spray more chemicals to cover it up.  i chose to get a different room.  There were no vending machines nor water fountains on my floor.  there was an ice machine.  the only way for me to water was to either melt the ice or pay nearly $6,2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Recent family stay,"No surprises. The grand Hyatt performed per the grand Hyatt name, style and quality. Room rates for this trip were good and so value was higher than at other times. Club access was a plus and breakfast was routine but tasty. Service at all levels was terrific although no check acknowledgement of my globalist statusGood downtown location. Beware that parking prices are very high and even park leaves a lot to be desired. I thought I was paying $8/day on weekends. Read the Very fine print, got charged $23",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Wonderful hotel, friendly staff, updated rooms",The hotel staff could not do enough for us.  The amenities were amazing and the rooms were all updated and clean.  We were here for my brothers wedding and they did an amazing job!  The wedding venue was beautiful and had the best views,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay!,"Great experience-   Friendly and helpful staff.   Wonderful breakfast.   Nice room.   Nice pool.   Nice location, especially for a short stay as it is centrally located.   Made a mistake in my reservation and staff helped me with the needed extra night!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great, but not Grand, Hyatt property in the heart of downtown Denver","I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Denver for 2 nights this past weekend.  My experience itself was good, however, the rooms seemed dated and some of the customer service was lacking in certain areas of the hotel.  I was promised an upgrade to a suite the night before check-in when I called in to see if there were any suites, not to mention I am a Signature Travel Network member and part of my ammenities is to recieve an upgrade to a suite.  On top of the fact that the day before check-in Hyatt also e-mailed me and offered me an upgrade to a suite for $40 additional a night.  I was assured I would get a suite and a note was put on my folio.  I go to check-in and the Front Desk manager Amy advised me no suites were available and the best they could do was give me a high floor room.    Very disappointing.  Club Level access is worth the additional money because a) the food is better than Courier resturant and the b) so is the service.  Andrew in the Grand Club was amazing and provided top notch customer service.  Keep in mind there is very little to do around the property besides the 16th street mall.  It will cos you approximatley $40 via Uber or Lyft one-way to get to the property and the hotel does not provide a shuttle service.  HOWEVER, they will recommend a third party shuttle service that you can make a reservation with in advance for a ride to and from the airport for $24 one-way which is way less expensive that a ride share or cab.  Having the ability to text the hotel and ask for a late check-out and for more information about anything was a nice touch too.  The service was better than the product and property itself and I would recommend staying here to business professionals passing through Denver who have business to tend to in downtown.  I would not recommend this property to families with children because the indoor pool on the 4th floor is  extremely small and there is nothing to do for kids in property vicinity.  I also do not think that the price  per night is worth the room I stayed in, but the addition of Club Level access did make it worth the stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Corner is King,Stayed for 2 nights in a corner King it was spacious and well set up.  The hotel is clean and neutral.  The pool and outdoor deck space were fab.   Staff was quick and friendly - no issues or concerns.  We will be back !!!  Thank you Grand Hyatt for a GREAT weekend !!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,unexpected parking charge,"There was only one unexpected item - parking. could have found a garage, or parking spot, but when traveling late, it was easier to pay the $50, but unexpected. Room, staff, very nice. Very clean hotel",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"nice, clean rooms; attentive staff",I upgraded room to corner and it was worth every penny. Also stayed on 6th floor (colleagues on 25th floor) so that was convenient. Staff was attentive in answering questions and making me comfortable.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,For Business,Great service from front desk staff to breakfast at Courier to housekeeping staff. The location of the hotel was great too...it was convenient to restaurants and the downtown mall. The conference services were exceptional. Also jumping on train to main station to airport was very convenient.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great conference hotel,"This is a great hotel for a conference.  The location is right in downtown, the bedrooms are clean and comfortable, and the amenities (conference rooms, elevators, restaurant) are great.  Check-in was easy, the staff friendly - overall good customer service.  The room was a good size, the AC quiet, and the bed comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hotel,"We arrived on Monday, after taking the 16th Street bus to Welton. After a two block walk, we arrived to friendly service and saw lots of areas: The Courier restaurant, The Market for needed items, the bar, and spacious lobby area. They also have a valet service, but we did not use it. To get upstairs you must be a guest and have a key-a plus in any large city! Upon arriving in our room, there were two comfortable beds with four pillows, a well stocked bathroom with all toiletry items, and a large spacious walk in closet. We were on the 18 th floor and it was much quieter (couldn't hear sirens and traffic) than our friend's room on the 15th floor. My friend used the workout facilities with treadmill, bike, and other equipment. She ran on the outside track, but did not use the tennis court. We both enjoyed the indoor pool and sun deck, although at 99 degrees the outdoor area was almost two hot. This hotel is located across the street from a Seven Eleven for any forgotten needs, but we felt like we had everything we needed within the hotel. There is a Starbucks across the covered alley (where valet parking is located). There are great restaurants, shopping, and entertainment within walking distance, though I would not be on the street alone after dark, for safety reasons. If in the area I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel,"I was here for a conference. I have never stayed at a Hyatt before. It was a very good experience. The food was good, great service, friendly staff. The breakfast buffet was really good and the event staff did an excellent job.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Fantastic stay at Grand Hyatt Denver,"My daughter and I stayed at Grand Hyatt Denver for six nights on the 25th floor. We had a great view and  it was nice and quiet. We had club status and there were drinks and coffee all day, a continental breakfast and wonderful offerings in the evening. A shout out to Rich who took care of us in the club room, which also had a computer/printer, bathroom and a terrific view.The hotel is off the 16th street mall with free service up and down the mall with mall ride.If we are ever in Denver will definitely stay here again.,Everyone from check-in to check out was wonderful",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful facility but front desk staff untrained in their job.,"Front desk woefully trained in what a business traveler needs to know at check in. I was not told of the WiFi service, how to log in, the cost for Hyatt members, the green bonus to forego clean towels, the amenities of the club room, etc. . My reservation requested a very quiet room and I was given a room across from the elevator and the maids room.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Stay at the Denver Hyatt,"Great staff. Great location. Clean and quiet. Only offered Valet Parking which was a little steep at 46.00 US a night, but it was super convenient, and they did allow in/out privileges!! Would definitely stay here again",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful staff and clean hotel,I definitely recommend this hotel to my family and friends! Me and my daughter had an amazing stay! The staff is very friendly and welcoming and the rooms are very clean.. I'll be back soon on my next trip.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great location, fantastic club service, and a strong smell.","Our family visited this hotel over the 4th of July holiday. We stayed on the club level and I can’t say enough about the staff there. Food was fantastic. Great coffee in the downstairs market area. $3 craft beer happy hour. Beautiful lobby. Our kids loved the pool and the hotel was very clean. They have a good fitness center and an outdoor track. Beds were comfy. Bathroom was large and modern. Downsides? Our bathroom door was one of those sliding ones that has the glass on it that you can’t quite see through, but if someone has to go to the bathroom in the night, the light wakes everyone up. Annoying! And no lock which is tough with kids. And we had the unpleasant experience of smelling pot for three days straight in our hallway. It was super strong...if you like that, then maybe that’s a plus? We didn’t, but couldn’t seem to get anyone to do anything about it. Overall, I’d recommend this hotel. We had a great time in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice hotel close with easy access to 16th street,"Stayed at the hotel for a family wedding.  Reservation and checkin was effortless.  Management was very proactive -- reached out a few days before the stay to check if any special arrangements were required.  I asked for a fan and extra pillows, which were correctly placed in the room before arrival.  The room had 2 queens, so when I asked to change it, they moved the fan and pillows before we got to the room.  The rooms were clean and well appointed.  They also have a menu for any travel accessories that a travel may have missed.  They promptly relieved a few items like hairspray, shoe mitt, etc, within 5 minuites of calling it.  Special shoutout to Donny, Amy and Kim for their proactive support.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Nice hotel, with one exception.","My wife and two daughters (6 and 10) spent three nights here. Room was nice; we were on the club floor, which was also excellent. However, each night our end of the hallway reeked of marijuana, and the hotel did not seem to be able to do anything about it. One night we could smell it while in our own room with the door closed. The hotel said they had security check on the issue, but it persisted throughout our whole trip.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Fine, but nothing more than that","This hotel is Fine, but nothing more than that. Friendly staff,  nice sized rooms. But also a bit worn and oldish.  The pool seems a bit filthy and is cold. Ok location, and dinner and bar was to our expectations.  Would probably stay again, it's just the rating that does not correspond to European standards",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very comfortable,"Had a very nice 3 night stay. Excellent concierge/check in. Spacious, comfortable room, especially the great mattress and pillows. The room service response was quick and courteous and the ladies turning the room daily were very friendly. Car valet crew could be friendlier.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Outstanding Service ,I called the hotel looking to arrange a special surprise amenity for my boyfriend and son who were staying overnight for the Dead and Company concert. Ashley the assistant outlets director was so sweet accommodating and patient with me while together we chose the very special amenity that I envisioned to send. (A taste of Colorado) Thanks Ashley! You’re the best!!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful location and staff,I stayed here with my daughter for two nights. The room was comfortable and very clean. The staff was excellent. The workout space was excellent. And location was great. My only possible complaint was cost of parking. But I knew that going in.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great downtown Denver hotel!,"We stayed here for our honeymoon and they upgraded us to a Corner King room. They also provided us a coupon for one free item (like a bottle of wine or a snack from the courier downstairs). The room was spacious, very comfortable, and had a great view of the city. The Grand Club at the top floor was amazing; it had free breakfast in the mornings, free coffee any time, and free snacks at night. Pool, fitness center, and rooftop tennis courts seemed very nice, although I didn't end up using them. I bought the valet parking package and it was very convenient to hand off and retrieve my vehicle at any time.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice Rooms and Professional Staff,"The rooms are very clean and feel new. Fitness center, outdoor track, pool, and lobby dining options are a plus. No on site self-parking though. Have to use valet or one of the outdoor public parking lots in the area.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Fantastic place to stay!,"The Grand Hyatt has excellent views, and a superb location in downtown Denver. Very close to shops, food and all sorts of fun places! The rooms are very spacious, modern and clean. I highly recommend this hotel, whether you're on holiday or on a work trip - definitely worth the stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,In town for the Astros/Rockies games,"Everything was fantastic! We got there in the morning, so our room wasn't ready. We began sight-seeing and soon got a text that it was all set. Checkin was smooth, with friendly desk staff. The room was very clean; we especially liked the motion-sensor lights during the night. After the game, we went to the bar, and the bartender handled a full bar and people sitting on nearby couches flawlessly. The only thing that bothered us is the nearby parking lot...$18 a day, which sounds great. However, each day starts at 5:00 am. That means we got charged $36 each time we left because it was a new day. Regardless, I'd go back!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful Hotel close to all the Action,"Great spot for your Denver hub activities, easy walk to free mall bus & access to Union Station.  The buffet breakfast each morning in Courier was exceptional & staff was great. If you're Grand Club member that's also a great plus as the munchies, appetizers and drinks available were an additional bonus. Would've rated room & sleep quality higher but corner room not as cool as we're used to and bed was a bit hard for us. But otherwise great size room & amenities!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Bugs in our room!,"Called housekeeping to clean up and despite waiting for 45 mins and being told they’d come , they didn’t. We went to eat and came back to more flying bugs in the room and dead ones in the bathroom. Worst stay ever.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Happy customer,Marriott is taken over lots of hotel properties and giving Other hotel properties a run for their money....Grand Hyatt is standing strong in their excellent service and customer satisfaction delivery...stay away from their main call in reservation dept as they will steer you away from whatever you'd ask for...go directly to the web site and then discuss directly with this hotel staff...they are great,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Go Astros!,"My trip to see the Astros play the Rockies was very enjoyable. The Grand Hyatt continues to be beautiful, amenable and attentive to my needs. A couple of glitches in my room were fixed immediately. The location is just two blocks from the 16th street free mall transport. Room service was just what I ordered and on time. Late night dining and spirits were wonderful; the  flatbread was tasty. All staff were very kind, informative and responsive.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great value for your money!,Stayed at the hotel during our vacation. In the heart of downtown Denver. Staff very friendly. Had a couple of maintenance related issues. Staff were very eager in solving the problem. Great service. Highly recommend.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Angry at checkout! Rude and unprofessional staff!,"We arrived at a hurried reception by Valet for our auto. He jumped in and was ready to drive off, even though our luggage was still in the car! He was very impatient and did ask about the valet service I was told it was included in our rate. He did agree! The bellhop was friendly and very good. The room was clean but the temperature was very warm. It took several hours to get to 70 degrees. Quiet room, great shower, and plenty of towels. On checkout, we were charged for valet parking $45 for one night. I was shocked because I had called direct to this hotel and it was included in our stay. The front desk cleck said ""oh well, you have to pay it""",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Mixed feelings,Hotel was nice. Staff was friendly. Request for a luggage cart to remain with our room for a half hour to load was denied due to tripping hazard even though we offered to wheel it in our room. We had a dog and did not want the dog barking at the bellhop. Though there was a microwave in the hall for 2 days as well as of course maid service carts. Parking very expensive and added 30% to the room cost. Location of the hotel is good and room was well kept. So mixed review.,3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful Ambience,"Wow! Stopped through  on our last night in Denver.. Beautiful facility.. very accommodating staff.. I do suggest renting parking a block or so away as valet parking only here at $46.. which was a 1/3 of the price of our stay.. We found one for $19.99 a night.. but cheaper the earlier you reserve on parking Panda app. Starbucks right across the way.. Paramount Theatres, 16th street Mall. Everything downtown to see. COORS FIELD, BRONCOS STADIUM, CHILDRENS MUSEUM. PEPSI CENTER.. Hotel very clean. STAFF VERY FRIENDLY! WE LOVED OUR VIEW FROM 22ND FLOOR. Definately will come back..",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay,Location is everything here! Perfect area to stay in while visiting Denver. Close to lots of key areas & close to the free bus route to hit the main spots. Hotel beautifully appointed as well! Would stay here again!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,5 stars for sure,"Stayed here while attending a conference at the convention center, great location, convenient starbucks right outside the main doors.   Rooms were very nice, the bathroom was perfect (make up mirror and lighting), very clean and modern.  The breakfast buffet at the restaurant downstairs was good and the staff was very accommodating.  Check in was painless (thank goodness, it can sometimes be awful) and the concierge was very prompt and efficient when we checked our bags.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Love this hotel!,I have enjoyed every single detail of my stay here at the Grand Hyatt.  From the friendliness of the staff to the excellent customer service of both the breakfast servers/cooks and the young gentlemen at valet that helped me in and out of uber's daily.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling for business or pleasure.  Stayed on the 24th floor and room was prestige and crisp sheets daily.  Can't wait to come back for my next business trip to the Grand Hyatt Denver!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a 2-week holiday around the Southwest USA, as it was the ideal place from which to fly back to the UK.  We were very pleased with our choice and everything was pretty much perfect from start to finish.  We had a King room with Club access located on a high floor with great views.  Our room was very comfortable and clean - we particularly liked the settee, which was a nice feature.  The best part of our stay was the Grand Club Lounge, which we used every day.  Andrew looked after us each evening and made us feel very welcome.  He is a fount of knowledge about the city and was able to give us lots of recommendations on what to see and where to eat.  More importantly, however, he made sure our glasses were never empty, and that there was plenty of food.  A nominal charge is levied for alcoholic drinks, which is fair enough given the quality and quantities.  The evening canapés and the breakfast buffet in the Grand Club were excellent throughout our stay.We also used the swimming pool once, but the space felt rather soulless to us and it was not conducive to spend much time there or return.  Whilst not the hotel's fault, we found Denver to have some serious homelessness and drug problems, meaning that caution should be exercised when exploring the city, for which the hotel's location is nonetheless ideal.  The hotel itself felt extremely safe and secure, making for a welcome retreat from the city outside.  In the unlikely event we were to return to downtown Denver in the future, we would certainly stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful Hotel,Excellent customer service at a beautiful hotel centrally located in downtown Denver.  I had a fantastic view from the 24th floor.  Room was clean and bed was very comfortable.  Loved the big shower!  I highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location.... Superb Staff!,"I have stayed at this property several times and I have to praise the staff for their outstanding service. A special mention for the staff at the Grand Club, they are engaging, attentive to detail and they make sure that you enjoy your stay. This time I was upgraded to a large suite on the 26th that it was heavenly... steps from the Club and with incredible city views. The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Denver, walking distance from most major attractions and restaurants. If you are in Denver to enjoy the city or for business, you will fall in love with this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel,"I was here for work and did not choose the hotel, but it was perfect.  Close to the convention center (maybe 4 or 5 blocks) and close to great food and shopping.  Safe, clean, and friendly staff.  I would stay here again for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel in the middle of downtown,I stayed there 3 nights and was very happy with my decision.  The room was spacious with a walkin closet and large windows.  The bed was a little too firm but some like that.  The bathroom was bright and open. Oh and the elevator is fast lol,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Dirty room,"Hair in the shower, stains and pubic hair on bedding.  There was a pile of sawdust by the rolling bathroom door that looked like it had been building up for months.  Told staff, and they didn’t do anything about it.  Housekeeping also failed to clean my room the next day.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Breakfast let's it down ,"Beautiful hotel, very comfortable beds and clean rooms. Dinner at hotel was good but the supposedly cooked fresh breakfast dishes appear to be items from buffet plated up as individual meal. Came cold and the fried eggs were very runny even though we requested over medium. The management did wave the breakfast charge but they need to get it right first time.Hotel is well positioned and whole city very walkable",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A Gem in Downtown Denver,"I had my choice of hotels for a three day work conference recently and I remember this one as being particularly unique. The bar food is excellent, staff very attentive and the room comfy and quiet. And all within walking distance to the 16th street mall.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A Grand Experience!,"I was truly impressed with the Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown. I was in Denver for two nights for all day depositions so a comfortable room and a hotel with amenities, particularly room service was very important. The Grand Hyatt was perfect. Returning to my room was the highlight of my day. The room was spacious, the bedding comfortable. A full room service menu is available 24 hours and the food was delicious. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, restaurants and bars. A memorable stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel,The Grand Hyatt Downtown is in a great location and is a really nice hotel.  Plenty of shops and places to eat within blocks.  Famous 16th Ave is a few blocks away and is one of the reasons we wanted to stay at the Hyatt.,5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Experience... as usual.,"As usual, the staff were all friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.

You also can’t beat the view. ",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place to stay,"The staff was helpful and friendly, the rooms were clean, the restaurant was good and accommodates special dietary needs, they had a nice gym. The rest of this is just to take up the rest of the minimum 200 characters.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great for Business in Denver,"Very clean, good food, great water pressure in the shower. If I had to come up with one negative the pillow was a little too soft. I found myself waking up because my head had sunk too far into the pillow while sleeping.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very Pleased,"I spent two nights at this hotel in Denver. The location was perfect for me, and I was able to easily walk to the various places I wished to see. The room and bathroom were comfortable, clean, and of a high standard. The fitness room was satisfactory. Service was excellent. I would recommend this hotel to others, and would stay here again if I returned to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place for conferences!,"From planning to execution- the entire Grand Hyatt team made this our best conference yet! It was flawless! The location was great, check in for a large group was easy, and F&B was excellent. Thank you for everything!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,$5 for a bottle of water.,"Location was okay overall, staff was helpful and the restaurant downstairs was decent. Charging $5 for a bottle of water in the room is a joke when I’m paying $175 per night for a room. Will reconsider in the future.",3

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good business hotel in convenient location,"Good standards business hotel in convenient location and facilities. It’s perfect for that business trip, but doesn’t necessarily stand out as a vacation hotel. It’s very clean, good service, and can definitely be recommended.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great location, clean with comfortable beds","This location is very central. It's an easy walk to the free 16th Street Mall shuttle, which gives you an enormous range of shopping and dining opportunities. The staff was courteous and professional. They kept my suitcase after I checked out so that I could explore the city for the remaining day. The room was clean, and the bed was quite comfortable. I got it for $110 a night. A great deal!",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay,5 stars from minute 1.  Susie upgraded room and helped with parking. And the awesome lounge was made better by both Ally and Andrew.  Denver was our first of two stops in Colorado and we certainly picked a winner to stay at.,5

I recommend the Grand Hyatt and would not hesitate to stay there next time I travel to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good hotel expensive parking,Decent hotel but expensive parking was a downside. The couple fighting in the hallway at midnight was an unwelcome feature as was the drunken 2 am party the next night. The only parking available was valet which was $42 a night on top of the room and tip.,3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,AEC2019 Visit to Denver,We enjoyed our stay and would stay there on any return trip to Denver.  Service was great throughout our stay and everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful.  The room and facilities were as good as they could have been.,5

Close to restaurants and shopping in case you forgot to bring anything. I would recommend this hotel with no hesitation.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location,"Great location-hotel not so great.  No help with luggage.  Check in certainly not welcoming . Guess hotel gets so many guests that don't feel the need to be welcoming.  Location makes it easy to get to Denver Convention Center and to 16th street.  For the cost, value definitely lacking.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Beautiful, well-maintained hotel","We had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt. The lobby is beautiful and striking as soon as you enter the hotel. We had two rooms, and received an upgrade to a top floor, corner suite for one of the rooms which was superb!  It was larger than some apartments, nicely decorated with a huge walk in shower.  Customer service at every point was friendly, attentive and seamless. Shout out goes to the lovely woman who called us before our trip, to help sort out our multiple reservations and add an extra day. We will definitely make the Grand Hyatt our go-to hotel in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Don’t valet park,"I had a good nights sleep, but the $46 valet parking charge was an insult.  There are much more reasonable parking options as close as across the street. I would think they would offer some sort of discount for a World of Hyatt member. Very disappointing.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Excellent hotel, great downtown location, walk to everything","Spent a long weekend at the Grand Hyatt.  Opted for a Club Level room and wasn't disappointed.  Room was on the 24th floor, spacious, great views.  Blackout shades were a nice feature.  One negative - the closet was ridiculously small, fine for a two-night stay, but too small for anything longer.  And what's up with the move away from a dresser or chest of drawers in hotel rooms?  Saw this in a recent visit to a first-class hotel in London.  I understand operators are looking to save space, but a few drawers at floor level beneath a tv console do not make a dresser.I would recommend the Club Level.  The club is on the 26th floor and accessed by your room keycard.  The club offers an excellent buffet breakfast, complete with scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, bagels, oatmeal, fresh berries, sliced melons, baked goods and more.  There are tables and seating areas, very comfortable.  Snacks are offered throughout the day, and in the evening, a selection of hot and cold hors d'ouvres are offered between 5 and 8pm.  Would definitely return and recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Pleasant stay,"The hotel is conveniently  located in the center of the city one block away from the 16 streetMall, easy access to everything including the free bus that takes you to on one end the Union Station and the other the Civic Center  and the State Capital Building.  We enjoyed our stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Overated,"Over priced, dirty, expensive. Bill was $80 more than the advertised price because of the valet parking that was $47 for the night. No itemized receipt.  Just one big surprise when  the bill came. We tried the restaurant but had to leave because it was dirty. Never again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Work with comfort,This is a great place to stay if you are traveling to Denver. It was just a few minutes from our Denver office and it had great locations to work from if staying in. Overall great hotel with a good restaurant and bar options.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Hospitalized while in Denver!!,I was in Denver on May 18-22 for a Physician Assistant conference when I suddenly had chest pain and shortness of breath. I was admitted to a local hospital for 4 days while they tried to figure out what was wrong with me. During the time I didn't know what was going but hospital wanted me to stay because I had to be on Oxygen. The hotel manager Amy was so caring that they held my room and even comp my room rate so I can focus on getting better. The whole situation was super stressful as this was my first time away from my new baby too!! I just want to thank all the staff at the Hotel for treating me with such caring during one of the most scariest times of my life.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel in easy location,"Lovely Hyatt hotel with very attentive staff and delicious cafe. Surprisingly nice live music in lobby each night we were there. Room was clean, bright, and comfortable. Would definitely look to stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Broken bathroom door,I was trapped in the bathroom 2x’s the first time for over 25min.. I get very  claustrophobic and it was scary for me.  This happened 2x’s the second time thankfully my husband was In the room.  The front desk didn’t seem phased at all.,2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location and incredible facility,"Stayed for a recent conference and it was awesome.  Clean, very nice, friendly staff and perfect location. We used the facility for the conference events, catering, and some late night events.  It was perfect across the board!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place to stay !,Great place to stay and enjoy your trip to Denver.Pros- great location- professional and friendly staff- clean and in order- high quality rooms- everything is close by- fedex office down stairsCons- remains to be seen!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very nice place and great location!,"I have stayed at this hotel twice in the past two years and have enjoyed my stay both times.  My profile says I am a light sleeper so prefer high floor, away from noise/elevators.  When I checked in I was assigned floor 4 which was not a high floor considering they have 27 floors.  I requested a higher floor and they were very quick to provide a room on the 22nd floor.  When I got off the elevator I recognized my room was IMMEDIATELY off the elevators and was concerned.  It seemed quiet enough so I decided not to be difficult and thought if it was bad that I would change rooms the next day. I was tired from traveling all day and just wanted to shower and go to bed.  I was pleasantly surprised that I never really heard a sound.  They have signs requesting quiet hours that are reasonable for those that need to get a decent nights sleep.  The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was very nice.  I hate carpet and wish they would replace carpet with a hard surface like they do in Europe but it's just not customary here.  The room was spacious and I had a lovely view.  If you use the gym you should for sure check out the roof top (open air) track and tennis courts.  They also have bags if you are into that.  It was great!  Work out room is small but sufficient and the pool is large and nice (indoor).  The lobby is great and they had live entertainment (solo or duo acoustic acts) each night I was there.  It was lovely!  I walked to the center of ""town"" a number of times...it's only a few blocks away.  This is in a great location.  Many food options within a few minutes walk.  I felt safe in general.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place,"Was a super nice hotel and everyone there was great. They helped us with our credit card authorization form after it had been lost, helped us get setup in our rooms and then when I lost my jacket, they let me borrow a blazer for my meeting from one of the staff. Went above and beyond at every turn. Great job.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Executive Suite is amazing,This is our second stay here. It’s my favorite place we have ever been. It is the size of a large 1bdrm apt. The TV’s and technology is amazing. The shower is so nice too. I love this place!! The picture is the view from the top floor club level!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel!!,"We will be staying at this hotel every time we are in Denver.  We were walking distance to Coors Field and the 16th St Mall.  Everything you could need was within walking distance.  Fabulous staff from front desk, to the housekeepers, to the concierge desk.   Would recommend this hotel for families w/o a doubt!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Loved my stay here!,Loved my corner guest room (even had mini view of mountains)!  And the location is great...only a couple of blocks to the 16th St Mall and in walking distance of the convention center and other areas of interest.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Outstamding in every way.,"Although I was at sessions and activities for a conference at the Denver convention center into the night all three days; from what I did experience, all of the facilities, rooms, and caring/responsive staff were outstanding in every way.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Lovely property in a great location,"The Hyatt has a number of properties in the Denver downtown area and the Grand Hyatt is a excellent example of Hyatt service.The property is well maintained and the staff are friendly as well as very helpful. Hotel offers a number of on-site bars and restaurants which are fairly priced. A variety of cuisine choices are available which will satisfy every taste. Portions are good size and the quantity is very good.The hotel is located 5 minutes off the main walking street. Lots of bars, restaurants, shopping and other entertainment options are easy walking distance. Hyatt has built their reputation on quality service and the Denver hotels are no exception to this. Great staff makes or breaks a hotel these days and the staff at this hotel are second to none. Very engaging, helpful and determined to go that little extra step to ensure guest satisfaction.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very nice,Hotel is modern and clean. We had a corner room with a nice view.  The room was very large.  I liked the electric blinds. and the built in automatic lights on the floor and in the bathroom that light up when you walk at night.  Located about a block from 16th Street Mall with stores and restaurants. Felt like a safe location.  Would definitely stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Guest room causing allergy,"Carpet is old and the room we stayed caused allergy for both me and my husband! We ordered coffee and bagels from the Courier market, while the price is decent compared to other restaurants in this kind of hotel, the food itself doesn't tastes good. Coffee was very blend and bagels seem old.",3

The rooms were great with thoughtful touches like automatic blackout curtains. The service was excellent, and the location is walkable to major restaurants, attractions and bars. I would definitely stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice Hotel-Expensive Parking,"Stayed with the family and got a great deal for a nice room. Unfortunately, all money saved on the room was lost on parking. $46/day for parking. The biggest rip off is the self parking attached to the hotel which says it’s $19 max but that’s for specific hours. I checked in at 3:30 pm and left and 8:30 am the next day and was charged $44! Park just across the street in the open lot for $16 a day.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Nice hotel, good location, ""Grand"" Hyatt though?","Nice location in the cenver of Denver, easy access from the airport (via the Lightrail and the free 16th St Mall trolly). Big, clean rooms, well appointed. Food was just OK (I was at a conference, so...). Lobby and main spaces are fine. A little less ""Grand"" than I would expect, but nice nonetheless.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,No safe place  to park unless you pay $47.00 for valet,"Outragous car parking cost.  Was told valet parking was $47 or 21/2 blocks away with no security.  Felt pressured to pay the fee.  After checking in I saw a parking garage just across the street for under $20, buy too late",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Business Trip,Excellent Stay and Service. Would recommend this hotel to others. Room service and food was excellent each day. Food was perfect temperature. Room was very clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Great location.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Fine hotel, centrally located, cheaper parking elsewhere.","Hotel is centrally located downtown with nice lobby and small bar. Our king room was nice and spacious with a large window. The Grand Club room was nice, but not very comfortable. Good food selection with both hot and cold items, honor bar with wine, local and domestic beers, and small menu of liquors. Cheaper parking can be found elsewhere around the hotel thru multiple parking apps.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great visit downtown,Great hotel with lovely rooms and smart lighting features.

Our room was kept clean and they took care of our special request without a problem. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and I would return there if I return to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,All that I wanted,"The hotel was off the beaten path which is wonderful for peace but less than ideal if you want to be near the Colorado Convention Center or the action of 16th street. With that in mind, staff were wonderful, the rooms were clean (albeit dimly lit), and their amenities are fantastic - you just need to ask and it is there! Overall, I am happy to recommend the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Right from the start, everything felt right 😀","I am writing this review before I close my eyes and sleep. I am just happy with this hotel that I thought I’d make a review about them. GREAT SERVICE for the gentleman named Michael. When my Uber arrived, a handsome employee approached us and welcome us.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice Stay,"I went for a conference and to stop the rat race of my life. Staff was always friendly, facilities were always clean and the 2 meals I had there (breakfast in their restaurant and dinner in my room) were good. I thoroughly enjoyed getting my workouts in in the gym and the pool. My only complaint for someone who wasn't going to do a lot of exploring was that they didn't have a store in the hotel that I could buy some tweezers, hosiery or something of the like. They do, however, have gratis service of essentials (razors, toothbrush, etc)",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,The Grand Hyatt is Grand!,I always felt that a Hyatt would be a great place but I was pleasantly surprised at every turn! The Grand Club was a really great perk too. Wish I had more time to use the pool and fitness center but did check it out. Next time for sure that will be added to my list of amenities to take advantage of.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Would Definitely Stay Again,Came to stay here for three days on a work trip. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and extremely clean. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I opted out of the housekeeping option in order to gain Hyatt points.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,clean downtown hotel,nice downtown place to stay with an awesome staff forego the suites as their not that grand for the price but overall a great place to stay p.s park across the street its cheaper than the parking garage at the hotel,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,They Made It Personal,"Prior to this visit I didn’t really consider Hyatt to be all that different from its competition. But during my stay here last week I experienced a nearly perfect ‘10’ of basically everything, most of all the authentic interactions with staff in ALL positions. Check-in was a breeze, and my room was very nice, as expected. Employees were friendly and helpful, but that’s also expected.My first morning I opted to eat in the hotel restaurant and ordered off the menu; alas it turns out the kitchen was slammed and my breakfast companion had finished his buffet breakfast before I was ever served. My waitress apologized and let me eat at the buffet for the lower price I would have paid for my eggs. I ended up several minutes late for my conference but appreciated her effort. That evening when I returned to my room I found a hand-written note from management apologizing for the delay, and they included a card I used for a nice lunch the next day. Nice touch! (When I thanked the server the next morning she BEAMED at my gratitude and told me she hoped it would help to ‘make it right.’)Then I started noticing EVERYONE in this place made eye contact, said hello, and actually seemed to mean it. Concierge, bellhop, valet, restaurant host, bartender, deli person. Attention Hilton and Marriott: the bar has been set. THIS is the overall experience that will make me consider Hyatt first for my next reservation. Now it’s personal.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Perfect,We spent one night in this very nice hotel. There is a valet parking and the accommodations are very nice. Rooms are big. Excellent for one night. Attention maybe this hotel and the rooms begin to be old... a refreshment would be necessary soon.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful Mother's Day Weekend with my daughters!,"I travel a lot for business.  I was so impressed with the level of attention and service from the staff at this hotel.  The hotel is located near all of the downtown Denver highlights.  The rooms are spacious and up to date.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good business or leisure hotel,"This is very good business &/or leisure hotel.  Centrally located, right in heart of downtown.

I’ll be staying here again too on my next visit. ",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good Conference Facility,"I attended a large conference at the Grand Hyatt. My room was clean and well appointed. But it was rather pricey, I guess that's what you pay to be in downtown Denver. The conference facility was very good but the tables were a bit too close so it was hard to get in and out of your seat and we kept running out of water. They had large water dispensing jugs but they seemed to be empty more than full.",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A good downtown Denver option,"Convenient location and a very friendly and helpful staff were all positives. The room was also nicely updated, along with the bathroom as well. The only knock here is the lack of decent bar & dining options, as well as a good small store for essentials. There is a 7-11 across the street, but something on the property would be nice to have. Overall it’s a nice hotel, but not quite 5 stars.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Restaurant - Dinner,"My daughter and I were visiting Denver. She made plans to see friends so I was on my own for dinner. I was actually staying at a hotel down the street and was walking by the Hyatt.   Looking in the window it seemed like an inviting restaurant. ""Former Saint"" is the name of it. I was greeted immediately and seated in a quaint quiet booth, perfect for one person.  David was my server and I could not have asked for a more pleasant person.  He was friendly and helpful. I was undecided on which Chardonnay to have so he came back with two wines for me to taste and decide.  He also explained the meals and helped me choose the perfect dinner. Do not leave without having the Pan Seared Sea Bass!  You will not regret it.  For desseert--- a must have is the Toasted Milk and Honey Cheesecake. Light, delicious  and absolutely one of the best desserts I have ever had. 😍. You will not be sorry.   If there overall hotel service is like the service I had for dinner, I will stay here the next time my travels take me to downtown Denver.  Ask for David when you dine!",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt is nice hotel w/eminities,However don't expect compensation if things aren't working as they should be.

And this is what I HATE about traveling.  Loved their bed.  WINDOWS:  THEY OPEN.  2 of them.  I was extremely happy to have fresh air. Starbucks coffee in the room.  There is a great Starbucks just outside the front door which is part of an office building so the line was NEVER long.  They provided NYT, WSJ and today papers.  I was very happy!  MY ONLY COMPLAINT.  The soaps and shampoos they provided were HORRID.  So smelly and perfumey.  I had to purchase my own.  PLEASE CHANGE GRAND HYATT.  But you cannot go wrong staying here.  I was very pleased.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grea location,"Great location in heart of Denver. There were nice floor-to-ceiling windows by pool. So it made for a better than average pool area, as a result. Staff was nice and the food was fine.  Great value for a trip to the center of Denver.",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Gran Hyatt Denver,Great place and location.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  The conference facilities were wonderful and the views were great.  The conference food was very good.  The restaurant food was priced too high and $5 for the bottle of water left in the room is too high.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Excellent, Clean, and Friendly","Great stay, and very clean! Best place to stay in Downtown Denver if visiting. Walking distance (1.5 blocks) to 16th street, where a bunch of shops and restaurants are located. Wish it was more 420 friendly but that didn't impact my stay since it was a block and a half away from the nearest dispensary! Great customer service!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Location!,"This hotel was excellent and in the heart of the city.  It was only a few blocks away from the 16th Street Mall area, close to several restaurants and local bars and eateries.  Great experiences all in walking distance.  Pepsi Arena was only about five minutes away by car from this hotel.  The service, staff, and the bar area were great at this hotel.  Awesome place to stay when visiting Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt Denver is a good place to stay!,"Staff here are exceptional!  They are very accommodating and extremely welcoming.  Hotel is a mere block and a half off of 16th Street Mall which has anything and everything you may seek.  I would have rated exceptional, however this hotel doesn't not provide shuttle service to the airport.  However, lobby staff were very helpful in securing me a shuttle!",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Mixed bag,There is alot to like about this hotel and then some things that are a disappointment.  The room is large and comfortable.  The bathroom is just right and I prefer their shower stall arrangement.  The beds are comfortable and there are a mix of pillows.  TV is average but I don't care much about that anyway.  Workout room is freely available to guests.  HVAC is whisper quiet and accurate in temperature. USB outlets - modern layout.  Was confirmed a king room and but was assigned at check-in a room overlooking the pool.  Very dark and couldn't image a multiple day stay in that deary room - next to pool not sure how noisy it would have been.  I insisted on a different room and was switched to a double.  During the switch a checkin clerk offered me a water which I accepted.  Later found a $5 charge on my bill.  You offered me a water with the insinuation it was complimentary (perhaps in return for initially assigning me a crappy room) and later charged me about $1 an ounce for it???   You just lost a future customer over a silly water scam.  Was reassigned to a double room.  Safe didn't work.  Walls transmit sound - frequently heard guests in next room.  Overall location is good.  Would be ok staying there again but probably wouldn't be my first choice.  Won't accept the water next time.,3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good hotel in convenient location,"Room was nice, my room had a nice round chair with an ottoman which was very comfortable for relaxing but the other chair in my room was horrible, luckily I was by myself so I didn't have to fight for the comfortable chair.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place!,Lovely accommodations and close to the activities!  We walked to 16th st mall for lunch and dinners.  Everyone at hotel so helpful and rooms are impeccably clean.  Beds comfortable and motion lights help for seeing in the night.,5

Comfortable beds, clean bathrooms, spacious rooms, and excellent views of the city. Love this property and will definitely stay again and again. Definitely consider the Grand Hyatt for your next trip to Denver. Go Broncos!!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Downtown Hotel,"We recently stayed at the hotel for an event. We were very pleased with the room, location and friendliness of staff. The location is excellent for getting around the downtown area. Value for our money was outstanding. Many, many positives. On the negative side, it took two attempts to get the fittings on bathtub fixed but on the second call the engineer came right away and had everything fixed in less than ten minutes. The bathroom was a bit small but the room made up for it in spaciousness. I highly recommend this hotel. Not so much the restaurant. Friday night for dinner was a bit confusion and chaotic. We were told there was a 40 minute wait but there were several tables available. We found a waitress who took our order and she found us a place to sit. She was very helpful and sweet. So I suggest staying at the hotel and there are many options for dining very close by.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Underwhelmed,"Premium price for less than average accommodations. The only redeeming quality was the location, which was very good. Other than that everthing was overpriced by a factor of two, at least. Charging 5 bucks for a bottle of water? Really?",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very nice hotel in Downtown Denver,"We have been to Denver many times on business, but this was the first time staying at the Grand Hyatt.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Lots of hiccups,"Here for a short weekend business meeting in the hotel. Front desk is very nice, but the good stops there. Checked in to my room and toilet was making a loud sound and would not flush. Luckily they sent someone up right away to fix it. Requested a quiet room but it was next to the elevators and not quiet. Placed a takeout order at the courier restaurant and the bartender was a bit rude and obviously very busy. She told me my order would be ready in 15-20 min. I came back in 30 to be on the safe side and it turned out she had forgotten to place the order. Got an insincere apology and a lot of attitude, waited for my order in restaurant this time. Would not recommend this hotel- have been here for 2 hours and already can’t wait to leave.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Criminal  or  Valued Elite Guest ??,"On Friday 29 March I was up till after 530am assisting another department on a delayed project and got into bed about 6am. I had not gotten much sleep the entire week.  At 710am...I was still awake, as I glanced at the clock. FINALLY, drifting off to Blissful & Restful Snoozetime. I was RUDELY awakened at 1135am...by someone LOUDLY BANGING & KNOCKING on my Door !!! I must not have heard the first set of BANGS, as I though the door was going to be TORN DOWN !! !! !! Gosh !! I, in my stupor and Still Sleepy went to the Door. ""yes"" I asked. ""This is Hotel Security, we are doing a Daily Room Check"".  Whattttt ?? Did I awaken in:  North Korea, the USSR or perhaps Iran ?! ?! ?!  ""Just a moment"", as I changed  into Day Clothes, NOT knowing WHAT to EXPECT ?! ?!  I opened the door, to the Look of this Caucasian Man of maybe Eastern European decent, with a DETERMINED, AGGITATED & NASTY look on his face. He comes BARRELING into my Guestroom, gets to the 2nd bed and turns around and Marches out, very Brashly !!!!!!! I felt: Violated. Threatened. It was NOT a Good feeling. Needless to say, I could not return to sleep after this In all my years of hotel stays, I had YET to experience  this ""daily room check"" procedure. And, Reception did not advise me of this either. I mentioned this to a female colleague, also a Globalist and her response: "" The Grand Hyatt Denver (GHD) is Arrogrant & Abrasive, that is why I now stay at the Ritz-Carlton Denver {RCD}. GHD sent a Loud & Strong message to me last Christmas when they CLOSED the Grand Club for 5 days at Christmas. Hotels are like Air Lines, they are 24/7 and employees are expected to work Holidays. Do the Air Lines closed the Air Lines Clubs at Holidays, NO, they don't. GHD doesn't give a DAMN about its Guests. Its ALL ABOUT: the Hotel and its Employees. Nevermind the Guests. The RCD is a Breathe of FRESH AIR, after GHD. I had TOOO Many problems at GHD and the FINAL straw was 5 days of Grand Club Closure at Christmas. WHY have a Grand Club if you are going to Close it ?!  I should stay at a Motel 6, instead. AND, I know GHD will PULL the same CRAP this December and Close it AGAIN at Christmas. They are a LOUSY Property and just, Do NOT Care.""  Sadly, my Colleague is Correct and I have to agree. Would I Recomend GHD to others ??  HECK No.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Awesome stay,"We stay here all the time when we come to Rockies games!  It's within walking distance to the field, 16th Street Mall and everything else!  The breakfast for the Hyatt members is not very complete, no meat (bacon or sausage) and no potatoes.  The front desk is very friendly.  Originally they put our room right next to the elevators, but when I called down to asked to be moved, the gentleman was very nice and moved up promptly!",1

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Extremely nice w/ pricey parking,"This is a very nice hotel in all regards.  The rooms and beds are great; the entire physical facility is well-maintained and aesthetically appealing in a modern, understated but posh way.  All the staff I dealt with were very pleasant and helpful - outstandingly so.  The only quibble one might have is that the valet parking is $46 per night, which seems on the steep side.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very nice place to stay in Denver,Close proximity to convention center (3 blocks) and a variety of restaurants and small mall.  Larger shopping center is a $10 cab ride (10-15 minutes). The Grand Hyatt is a cozy hotel as compared to the Hyatt Regency which is a massive industrial hotel. Food and beverage selections are also extensive and reasonably priced.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Mostly good stay,"I spent 6 nights at the Grand Hyatt for work. Front desk was great - friendly, funny, welcoming.  Room was great - high floor, nice bed, nice products, clean bathroom and attentive housekeeping.  But the bar and restaurant are terrible.  They can't manage crowds or workflow and need to get their act together.  One night the bartender was snapping at everyone and the waits were eternal to get a drink.  Then after a storm the restaurant couldn't handle crowds - they kept all their signs out to wait to be seated and then the host would scream at people that they can't be seated.  This was too bad as the rest of the hotel stay was quite nice. Oh and there is a creepy guy who hangs out with the valets in the morning and tries to get you to ride with him rather than Lyft to get to the airport.  Tell him to buzz off. Otherwise this was a very nice stay and I'll probably stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,exceeded my expectations,"I stayed at the Grant Hyatt during a conference, and found it to be comfortable and elegant.

I was able to take the 16th Street mall bus to Union Station, then hop onto the train to DIA.  Everything was so easy!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel in downtown Denver.,"I was at the Grand Hyatt for a professional meeting, and everything worked out great.

Pristine, clean, bright, and overall... amazing!From the Valet, Matt, who was so friendly and welcoming, to the desk staff, and the restaurant staff... everyone was extremely warm and professional.My only concern is that about 1am there was loud music (almost sounded like elevator music), and I couldn't tell the source. I heard it closest by my window, but didn't see the source. I called the desk, and they said they'd call security, but it didn't go away. I don't know if it was outside, and the windows were too thin to block it out, or what.Anyway, I appreciate the great attention to detail and impeccability at the Hyatt Grand Hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good option,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown as it was the hotel chosen for our academic conference this year.

We would recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Welcoming, well appointed business hotel","Facilities are well appointed and comfortable; staff is helpful and welcoming. Lobby bar is a bit obtuse, as the bar itself is perpendicular making it difficult when crowded to place an order, and the alternate restaurant bar is very small. But if you don't plan on spending a lot of time in the bar, its a great place to stay in the downtown area.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Fantastic customer service,"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt with a large group. The customer service was fantastic!

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Friendly!,The staff really make this place. They were unfailingly warm and welcoming.

My husband and I were seeing a concert at the Paramount Theater and this location was perfect. Just 1 block or 3 minutes from the hotel. Clean rooms. Neatly done out decor. Fun social hour with drinks and music. There is such a positive vibe at this place. My only let down is the Courier restaurant. It's good food but way too over priced at $81 for 2 people (meal and water).. The portions are very small and service took about 45 minutes. The wait staff were friendly but our personal waiter was incompetent. I would definitely stay here again, but eat somewhere else.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Double charged for bad breakfast plus $46 for parking.,"Typical room rates for this hotel are close to $200 per night.  We stayed here on February 18.  Booked the room with the breakfast package included.  Had breakfast the next morning and checked out.  The clerk acknowledged that breakfast had been paid for in advance and would not be charged to my card.  Checked my credit card statement this week and was charged $53.76 for breakfast.  Not only is the breakfast an absolute ripoff at $53, but I was charged for it twice.  Trust me the food is way below the quality of an iHop or even McDonalds.  They could not fry eggs to order correctly.  The eggs in the omelets taste horrid.  Their pancake mix is like concrete.  The breakfast buffet is $20 per person, and you pay extra for beverages.  No milk, juice or coffee is included.  It is not worth it.  You will get a far better breakfast at any restaurant and save 50%. There is a nice restaurant one block away that does a full omelet breakfast for $7.  On top of all that, parking for the night was $46 and does not include in and out privileges, so you have to use a taxi and leave your car behind to go anywhere.  For the price of this hotel, the add-ons are just gouging.",1

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent hotel,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Denver for 6 days. Staff were helpful and friendly. It was clean and comfortable. Had all the amenities. They didn't make us pay for printing from the computer as some hotels do, so as a business customer, it was very helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful Hotel,"This is a wonderful, centrally located hotel.  I highly recommend it! No matter if you are going for business or pleasure, just go!  It is within walking distance to anything you could need to get or want to eat.  Just a block from the 16th Street Mall.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great hotel, reasonable price.","This is a great hotel to stay at in downtown Denver.  It is a block away from the 16th street mall, which has many shops and restaurants.  The staff was knowledgeable and helpful about restaurants close by.  The room was nice and very clean.  I loved the little night lights that came on when you got out of bed during the night.  The refrigerator didn't work well, but I didn't find that to be a big deal.  When I looked at reviews on Tripadvisor this hotel had the best reviews.  It also was one of the best prices.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Guest survey,"This hotel is in great location, friendly staff.  They should have more restaurant to choose from in the premises so avoid long line for coffee in the morning.  I like the singer in the lobby it relaxes you after a long business meeting.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel!,The room was lovely and the room service breakfast was amazing. Every single aspect was delicious and the hash browns were the best I’ve ever had. There were a ton of amenities in the hotel and it is at a great location in downtown Denver! The bed was a little hard but I think that was just my taste. My husband loved the bed!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Had a great stay,I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I left my entire toiletry bag at home and they provided me what I needed within ten minutes. Good restaurant in the lobby. Easy checkout. Centrally located near convention center and shopping is reasonably close.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very Nice,The place is very nice and the staff was very polite and helpful. Be aware of the cost of parking. You will need a GPS to get around downtown. The staff was always willing to help with anything or answer any questions. The real drawback was always having to pay for parking. I really think that there should be free or at least discounted parking for hotel guests.,3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Really Nice,"Nice rooms, really clean, friendly staff and items available if you forgot something. It’s conveniently located downtown and has valet parking so you can walk to most places. Every staff member was friendly and I’d highly recommend this place.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Loved this hotel,"Loved my stay! Very welcoming. The guy at the front who checked us in, gave us great recommendations and was very accommodating.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Solid hotel,"Stayed here for business. Amenities were great. Clean comfortable and spacious rooms. I am pretty picky about hotel rooms but this met with my approval because things were logical such as outlets, lighting and bathroom arrangement.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Cozy Stay,"I checked into this hotel while in Denver to see Michelle Obama on tour. My first impression was that the hotel had extremely nice decor and was very welcoming. My check in/ check out process was seamless, and the concierge was very informative and friendly. My room was spacious and spotless, room service options were all appetizing and the service was rather quick. The location is pretty central to all of what downtown has to offer. If you’re lucky you’ll get a nice view of it. Overall my stay here was very comfortable. I highly recommend staying at Grand Hyatt Denver if you’re in the area.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Thoughtful touches,The design of the room was perfect for a business trip. I loved the robe and slippers and motion sensor lights that came on at night. I like having a full restaurant in the hotel. The buffet was the most economical but still expensive. There was love music in the lobby when I arrived which was lovely though a bit loud. The bed was super comfortable but there was some noise that kept me up a bit. The room had a great work desk and place to sit while reading and working.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,hotel is nice and the club lounge is great but be warned it does NOT come with suite booking,"I booked a suite at the hotel for couple of nights because I have 2 little kids and wanted the room to spread out. We also wanted the club lounge access because the review for the lounge had been great. I am not dinging the hotel itself for this problem we had but hyatt in general. When booking the room you have the choice of ""Standard room, room with club access, suite"" and that's it. so I naturally assumed (bad on my part for assuming) that suite is the most expensive and above room with club in order then it should come with lounge access. there is also not an option to book suites with club access. So I showed up at the hotel and was told that my rate for the suite does not include club access... really? I showed the booking page (on hyatt web site) to the agent at desk and he was puzzled too. But it was late in the evening and he said I need to talk to a manager in the morning. So I got up early (because the kids yell for breakfast) to see if I can get club access to feed the family. I talked to the manager on duty and sure enough the suite rate does NOT include club access.I was told the majority of the suite guests were upgrades for hyatt globalists who has automatic club lounge access anyway so there weren't much complaining. Then I was offered a discount price of $30 per night to add on the club access. I have looked at the booking price and knew that was indeed a discount not a deep one but I took it. The staff in the lounge were great at servicing the guests and the food offering were well above average lounges. They even remembered my wife's coffee preference and gave her the same soy milk decaf latte the next morning. Back to the booking issue, I then looked at other hotels in hyatt chain that has club lounge and none of them offer booking suites with club. Weird. so as I said I am not blaming the hotel itself for the problem but hyatt to have this global problem. The hotel is otherwise nice and I really didn't have much to complain about. The room and public area (like the hallways) shows a bit age but that's again normal. The club lounge gave us the most lasting impression.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent Experience,"I always have such a wonderful experience anytime I stay at any Hyatt location and this time was nothing less than perfect. The staff was very helpful and always very polite. I also love the fact that you can opt out of room services to go a little more green. The extra Hyatt point aren't a bad plus either! Overall, this is a wonderful hotel Nd I would recommend it 10 of 10.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel,"Beautiful large window with Mountain View.  Room was nice sized.  Bathroom nice size with large shower.  Very clean!  The bed was a bit hard and not crazy about the pillows.  One pillow was dinky and other larger but hard.  Bring your own pillow.  I must say the Hotel was very clean, hallways, room, bar area!  We would come back but I’m bringing my own pillow next time.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotels!!,Great experiences everytime and they always have my back! I forgot toothpaste once and they brought some to me at no charge. I will always choose Hyatt over any other hotel due to the accomadations and proffessionalism provided.,5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel,I stayed for a week on business.  The staff were helpful and very accommodating.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  They had outlets everywhere which is rare and I could plug in all my devices close to the bed for easy access.  Good location to walk to shopping and restaurants (if the weather is good).,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,2019 Vacation from Australia,"Anticipated friendly, courteous & compliant service. Clean comfortable rooms as would be expected from a Hotel of this caliper. Easy access to surrounding restaurants in area. Only noise experienced was from a Fire Engine / Truck going past but this could be experienced in any Hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Place To Stay,"As always, Hyatt does not disappoint. Highly recommend any of their properties. We've been to almost each of the various Hyatt properties in Denver, and every one has its own unique feel and decor. However, one thing that never differs is the staff's commitment to providing excellent service for their guests.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great central location,"Nice centrally located hotel, so very convenient for downtown.  Good food and facilities.  Slight complaint is that the windows are not as sound-proofed as I would have expected.  I was on the 9th floor and could hear sirens etc., more clearly than I would have expected for this level of hotel",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good Location,Was expecting a Grand Hyatt service but it wasn’t there. It’s missing the wow experience from the moment you arrived and when you check out. Over all just a regular hotel experience. Buffet Breakfast was just ok.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Comfy Bed!,I would have given 5 stars but my King Corner room (902) was not equipped with a type of mini fridge that would keep food properly cold...plus the fridge was not evening working.  Too many $$$ to have a glorified “cooler” as a fridge.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Awesome hotel experience!,This hotel stay continues to exceed my expectations -- from check-in to check-out -- absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel! Each and every staff member went out of their way to make sure I had a favorable experience.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Just a good hotel,"Hotel was in a good location, but the rooms were loud, could hear sirens all night. The parking charge if $46/night was high, especially for what they are already charging for the rooms. Just a good hotel, not great.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel!,"Everything from the Check in to Check out was super nice and easy. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The market that they had downstairs offers great food. Also, the view of downtown denver was beautiful! Highly recommend!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Parking,"Overnight/valet parking was too expensive at 49 a night.    Chose other less expensive options.  Also did not recall seeing at the time of booking.  Otherwise, everything else was great overall about our stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great Denver Hotel. Very clean, warm, comfortable beds, clean rooms, great service, welcoming staff, easy check in/out","Great hotel, welcoming staff, secure, safe, warm, comfortable beds, clean rooms, good food, great service, up to date accommodations, spacious, good location to Rodeo/Stock Show, great rates, overall a great place to stay when in Denver whether business or personal travel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location and price,Great location and price. Room was very comfortable. Breakfast was horrible and so was coffee. All other things were ok. Can take train to Downtown and then mall bus to hotel. Saves money over taxi or uber,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Not great value,"My first stay at a Grand Hyatt, but I didn’t find it to be very “Grand” at all. Pretty ordinary chain hotel and you can find much better at a cheaper price. Good location for downtown Denver. Bedroom was comfortable enough, but water pressure was terrible and WiFi pretty poor.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay,Had a great stay recently at the Grand Hyatt in Denver as i was attending a local conference. i like that it was centrally located to the conference and down town shopping. the customer service i recieved was wonderful from check in to check out,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Weekend Stay,"Stayed down here for the weekend for a dance competition.  Check in was super quick and easy. Rooms were nice and clean and I love that they had queen beds vs double beds. We had club access which was fantastic.  Andrew in the club lounge was amazing. Greeted us with a smile and explained how it worked and that he would be there for anything we needed - and he was!! He was so kind, always happy and always made us feel welcomed.  The gal that worked in the morning while we were there was not friendly and not helpful at all. We were happy to see Andrew's face the morning we left because he usually worked nights when we were there.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Not worth it,"After paying for your room, you will have to pay an additional $46 if you want to park. I just used Spot Hero and parked at a nearby lot for $12 a night. Checkout was at noon, yet starting around 8:30 the cleaning service entered my room 3 separate times without notice or permission, waking me up and startling the hell out of me. The third time I was in the shower with bathroom for open and felt so exposed and had to scream to leave and please not come back until checkout at noon. They also don't have basics like coffee and microwave in the rooms, which isn't convenient and forces you to purchase more from them. Between that and the parking, you aren't getting a deal by being a Hyatt member, so really, what's the point?",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Poor and Sloppy Customer Service,As a Hyatt member I have stayed at various Hyatt hotel and have always been impressed with the quality of service provided by staff  and hotel and facilities. Not at this hotel - a request to have access to their club service was not actioned. When I arrived I was told they could not do it as they were too busy and would offer me a credit. That was never applied to my bill - again lack of ownership and follow up! Just disappointing - the restaurant service was very slow and I had to return my under cooked meal when it arrived. The pool area was overrun with I suspect too people for size of pool. Not the relaxing customer centered visit I expected.,2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Quick trip to Denver,"We went to Denver for just an overnight visit with family.  Hotel was extremely busy with a Dance competition of some sort.  Staff was calm, helpful and pretty much unfazed by the activity this dance competition brought to the hotel.  Great job. and we appreciated Andrew on the Club level.  Very helpful and pleasant person.  Thanks.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Responsive Friendly Staff,"Stayed here in conjunction with a conference in the hotel.  The meeting rooms are spectacular, layout made the transition from meeting rooms quick.  Pleasantly surprised with the fitness center and reliability of the complementary WIFI.   The rooms were quiet, comfortable and superbly decorated.  The ease to travel from the airport to hotel via the light railway was too good to be true.  $10.50 to unions station and mall transit with in 100 meters of the hotel entrance.  I would definitely use this as a great weekend vacation sometime.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent hotel,This hotel was fantastic. We stayed there for 2 nights on our way to the snow although we which we stayed there for longer. The staff was very friendly and the room was great and comfortable with a view of Denver. We had the breakfast in the mornings which was extremely amazing. Great hotel,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel,Be ready to pay $46 per day for parking.  The hotel is obviously renovated.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice hotel,"Stayed here one night for business.  Room was spacious and clean, with very nice views.  I was given club access and had a nice breakfast there.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good stay but headache issues and overcharged with deposit and room cancellation,"I had a 2 day trip to Denver from Dec 28th to Dec 30th. This Hotel is really good, except the front desk service. I mean their attitude is really good but I orderred Hyatt Place and they mistaked for a Hyatt house room. I had to swiped my credit card 4 or 5 times for deposits. After the stay I found I got cancelled room and 6 times the deposit goes to my credit card. When I contacted them, they felt sorry but actually they are not able to do anything about it and I have to turn to bank for help. This is really disappointing. They really need to optimitize their system and customer service ability.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful Hotel,It's within walking distance of many downtown restaurants and venues. The staff is attentive and the breakfast was a good value.  Overall the hotel is a great value on a weekend.  We will definitely be back.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,One night stay,"Fantastic hotel where you can catch a good nights rest. Cool big chair to cozy up on and read books. Enjoyed the prompt service from valet to bellhop and registration everyone was a delight. Would stay here again. Centerally located downtown. Breakfast at Courier was eh, service amazing (seriously our waiter was top notch) but food selection although broad missed the mark. Stay at the hotel but consider eating elsewhere.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Bad rooms,"The restaurant manager name Luis does not belong in hospitably business, nor in management, his customer service scales are zero, the GM, seems like a nice guy, but the stuff in the restaurant were very nice",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great downtown option,"I really like the GH line and Denver's is one that certainly meets or exceeds my expectations. Just returned from a satisfying stay. I've stayed here a couple of times over the years, as well as attended various conferences and events. The rooms are clean, spacious and functional. When attending conferences in general, I never really have any expectation of enjoying the food, but the last one I attended here had excellent food and snacks--fresh, healthy, flavorful. And the staff are super friendly.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,No dining options,"There is only one restaurant in the hotel, the attached bar is not at all cozy or attractive or has any bar character. The restaurant is not very inviting, due to the automatic door to the outside opening and closing constantly Not a great experience. The other hotel bar is constantly closed, due to low volume. We will not return.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great value and location,I had the pleasure of staying at the Grand Hyatt in Denver. The room was very clean and spacious. The location is great downtown and close to lots of restaurants and shops. The hotel was very quiet and the staff was professional. Look forward to a future visit.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,DENVER’S FINEST,"We stayed 14 nights, so we really had a chance to get to know the Hotel and the staff. Large, stylish, well-equipped guest rooms, with super views of the surroundings. Excellent housekeeping - competent and discreet. Fantastic location. All staff professional, accommodating and kind - at all times. A luxurious Hotel that we hope to return to. Many thanks indeed!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,This hotel always performs,"This Grand Hyatt is the perfect example of the Grand experience. Great location, easy access, fairly close to the airport, wonderful Grand Club room and lovely lobby and bar space. I would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Dog barks lowdly,"We stayed in the Grand Hyatt Denver. The room is great and the city view is nice. But our neighbor has a dog, and it kept barking. We contacted the front desk agents, but the dog still managed to wake us up in the midnight. This is such as terrible experience!",1

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Awesome hotel!  Close off street parking and close to everything on the 16th street mall!!  Staff are always great!!!,"Close off street parking!  Starbucks across the way and access to the 16 th street mall, what more could you ask for.  Staff are always nice and helpful with recommendations and directions!  Got lost and helped us out!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Truly Exceptional,"This trip was actually one of my favorites. My wife and I spent three days and two nights in Denver (we live nearby) to see the sites and lights of the season.  The Grand Hyatt stay was the most enjoyable in our memory.  The food was exceptional, the room clean and very neat, and the front desk memorable.  Memorable, because of the setup and the quality of service.  The front-desk was not a desk at all.  There were three tables with attendants, a computer and they stood directly in front of you as though they were discussing only YOUR needs.  Of course, this was at a time when hotels may have fewer customers than normal, but nonetheless efficient, effective, and enjoyable.  I don't think we could have asked for better service.  Housekeeping actually left a message in the room (since we had been out all day) to ask if there was anything they could do for us.  We had left a door hanger out on the door for them not to provide service that day.  It simply was not needed.  Unimaginable.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Not for everybody,"Probably the snobby rich people would not find this hotel glitzy enough for their liking.  However, for everybody else this is a gem.  It's very clean, the rooms are spacious, and the location is ideal.  The staff is beyond friendly and helpful.  The only reason for not giving five stars is the breakfast situation.  There was only one person making the waffles and pancakes, resulting in a very long wait for those items.  The bacon was cold and rubbery, and the croissants were crumbly.  On a positive note the bed was extremely comfortable.  We would stay again, but not eat breakfast there.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Greenbay,We had a great room. Staff was extremely friendly. Location is ideal for getting every where.? We always feel welcome at every Hyatt we stay at. This was our first stay and we will stay againAt this location,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Blown away,"My wife stayed here for one night during her visit to Denver and was totally blown away.  She loved the facility.. how clean it was , the room, and the views.  The room was very affordable which was good but the food and drinks were a bit pricey. Valet parking was $50 for the night.  That cost more than what we paid to rent our car.  We will be staying there during our next visit to Denver for sure.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Park and Perks does not work,"I chose option Park and Perks package which was $27 more. The description from TripAdvisor for this package was parking, 2 cocktails upon arrival and 2 VIP attraction packages. Upon arrived, I was informed by the hotel staff that there was no such package. The ""Perks"" they refer to was only a voucher for 50%off of purchase from their market store. After some back and forth, they offer 2 vouchers for draft beer and non-alcohol drinks to make this up.Hotel website does describe the package different from what was on Trip advisor. Watch out when you book any package via TripAdvisor since the hotel may deny what posted there. Water bottle is $5 on purchase.The parking fee at the hotel is $40+. However, there are several parking option close by for $10.Room is clean and bed is comfy.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A great value!,"I didn't expect much but I made a great choice for a 3 night stay!  Great location and easy access to rail station, airport.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good Service,"Recently stayed for two nights, service from the minute we walked in was terrific, efficient, friendly, very accommodating and this was then replicated from the reception desk, restaurant staff, the doorman, this is clearly valued. The location of the hotel is good, short walk to 16th Street Mall and all other locations. Our room and bathroom was spacious, just a little tired looking, a little wear and tear and needed a bit of clean. No mini bar which suits our family but no glasses in the room which was a little inconvenient. Hotel facilities were good, outdoor running track, indoor pool and gym. The little restaurant had a simple menu but food was good quality and they had a little market shop which was very handy for the basics like water juice and snacks. If I returned to Denver I would consider staying again.",3

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very Nice Hotel Downtown,We were booked here by the company I was interviewing with and spent a few extra days while we explored Denver and the surrounding areas for relocation. We had a corner room on the 22 floor with Mountain Views. The room was pretty large and the bathroom was updated. Close proximity to 16th Street Mall and Broadway offices. Request an upper floor to reduce street noise.,4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice place to stay,A nice hotel in the heart of downtown Denver. Close to great restaurants and shopping.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Perfect,"Great location for the Denver Center and the Convention Center. Our rooms were very clean, wonderful mattress that is just the right firmness, quiet rooms, adequate workout facility and helpful staff. Lots of nearby parking that is cheaper than the hotel. It’s cheap and easy to use Lyft to get around the city. We tried the electric scooters and had a great time. Just download the Bird app and you are ready to go. We didn’t try the hotel food because there are too many unique restaurants close by. Check out syrup for sure just a 5 minute walk. I would definitely stay here again. Have a great time!!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Phenomenal and Pristine,"The hotel is both phenomenal and pristine.  I loved my room and its decor.  I was given a room on the 15th floor, and the view provided a wonderful picture of the Denver skyline.  Downstairs in the lobby, the word that comes to mind is warm.  The color scheme coupled with the soft lighting coming from the actual lights and the nearby fireplace created a welcoming environment.  The Christmas tree was especially lovely as well.  The young front desk agents matched the hotel's level of warmth and class.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Our room,"Our room was tired, the only chair was chipped, there were no grab bars in the shower, the carpet was soiled, The bed was comfortable and the linens were nice.The breakfast was good in the club  floor but the appetizers were mediocre. Worse than the airline club food. There were no wine glasses in our room--we had to go to the club floor to get some. Not the kind of service we have had at other  major hotels we have stayed in around the world.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Well located, great hotel.","The Grand Hyatt Denver is clean, well furnished and very well located with easy access to shops and restaurants and the free mall train.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A night in Denver,"We had a Christmas Party in the hotel and decided to take advantage and spend the night.  What a wonderful surprise.  Room was very spacious, bright, contemporary and welcoming. TV was so easy to navigate, walk in shower with waterfall, blackout curtains for a good nights sleep, comfortable bed. We were in Room 1825, which is at the end of the hall and very quiet as well as beautiful nighttime views. We walked down to the 16th Street Mall and took the free bus to Union Station for the Christmas Market.  On the way back, stopped at the German Market. Christmas in Denver is wonderful and this was such a great place to start the holiday.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Fantastic staff!,"We had the best experience at the Grand Hyatt. The staff was so helpful, kind and courteous. My husband forgot a dress shirt and they had one for him to use, top notch service. The room was beautiful too. Highly recommend staying here!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very disappointed ,"I paid 200$ for my room. At 230am, I had to use the bathroom. The toilet had no water in it. I checked the connections and the filler valve thing. I made sure the plumbing hose was open. I then called the desk and a repairman came and fixed it. He was there from about 230 to 3am. I understand that things break. I don't feel like I should pay full price to be up in the middle of the night with no toilet and a repairman in the room while I should be getting the sleep I paid for. There was no refund, no gift certificate for a discounted stay. Nothing. I guess this is just what you can expect when you pay full price at the Hyatt. I understand that things break. I also believe that they owe me a better expierence. I own a business and if we under-delivered so poorly, I would try to make it right. They didn't.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,First Rate,"I enjoyed my stay here thoroughly. Great location for access to the convention center and 16th Street. I received a warm welcome (check), appreciated the free internet (check), and found the hotel to be exceptionally quiet. My ""housekeeper"" was sweet and friendly and the room was comfortable. No complaints may seem like faint praise, but not for experienced travelers. It met all my expectations--I'd stay here again.",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A Sustained Excellence,"From the outset of my stay i was impressed by the response of the staff. I believe Suzy welcomed me.  I would also say that the restaurant Courier was most significant. Dariia served my colleague and me the first two nights. Her care and advice were most appreciated. The food which i sampled for lunch, dinner and in between was some of the finest I have had in any hotel in the States, Canada or in Europe. My deep appreciation to the chefs. The servers were also caring and considerate. Let me also add that Mario who serviced our room was thorough and efficient. In sum, my deepest thanks for such good work.

So sorry for having a good time..lol",2

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Educause 2018 - 10/29 to 11/2,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown from 10/29 to 11/2. The hotel itself and my room in particular were immaculate and I had positive interactions with hotel staff during my stay. The only issue I had (which was addressed promptly during checkout) was with my laptop being dropped from WiFi randomly. I paid extra to allow for streaming video and video calls and when I mentioned being dropped during my checkout, the staff member assisting me waived these charges - a welcome development that I wasn't even expecting or asking for (welcome nonetheless!)",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Lovely hotel!,"I was at the Grand Hyatt only one night but wished I could stay longer.  As another reviewer mentioned, the feeling is 'serene' with a unique, minimalist front desk area.  Before I knew it, I was in the room which was large and well-appointed.  Never got a sense that I was downtown as everything was amazingly quiet.  There is a very nice 'grocery' area that was a step above most others.  And a Starbucks a few hundred feet away!  Heaven!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Disappointed,"I have stayed here several times but this time was awful. Upon arrival our floor was dirty, the tables were dusty, and the comforter was filthy. After maid service the comforter was still terrible. 3 were made and several hours passed before they fixed the issue.",2

The hotel and the rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. I really enjoyed my stay there. Staff were very friendly, attentive and accommodating. For me, that's a huge part of paying for any service, and it sells the hotel. Good sized rooms. Wi-Fi and safe included. Great restaurant with great food and alcohol in terms of quality and choice served. We had a great time watching the England vs Sweden World Cup match which the staff had on for us in the bar area since the nearest sports bars and British Pubs were rammed to the rafters! Hotel located near some great shops and restaurants / bars as well. Denver itself is a fantastic city - not overcrowded and plenty of amenities.",5

I did not sleep at all, the pillows were not comfortable as well.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,One Promise Not Kept,"There was a problem with the lock on our initial room.  After two trips back on the front desk, we ended up with a different room.  The front desk gentleman offered a $50 credit toward room charges.  After checkout I noticed the credit not applied.  I called the hotel about it and was told it would be done.  I have not seen a credit on my card as of yet.  The fact it was promised and not delivered kind of irked me.",4

From the doorman, to the front desk, to the bellman, to the various waitresses in the coffee shop I was universally impressed with the staff.  Otherwise I would have rated this hotel average.

He helped her wrap her ankle and made it comfortable for her to enjoy the rest of her stay.  The food was very good and the people working the front desk were very helpful to give directions, arrange cabs or anything else we asked.  Overall this hotel experience was excellent!",5

When I tried to explain I was a guest, Milo the security guard mocked me and wouldn’t leave even while I washed my hands.  I went straight to the front desk to complain to the manager. He gave me a slight apology but when he asked Milo why he did this, he said he got a call 2 homeless women were in there. I, as a Gold Passport Member, was clearly NOT homeless dressed in a business type dress and still Milo Never apologized, not once, not even a sorry, it was a misunderstanding. I will NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN!!!",1

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A very good business hotel,"I recently spent 2 nights at the Grand Hyatt. The location was very convenient for my meetings in town. Only had to walk a few blocks to get to the convention center and restaurants. While not unique or memorable, the room was nice and comfortable. Comfortable bed. The shower pressure was a bit disappointing. I did visit the Courier bar which was nice. Decent drinks. I would definitely stay here again, but would probably choose the Hyatt Regency over the Grand Hyatt if I had to choose.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful Modern Hotel with a Very Attentive Staff,"I would have given it a 4 1/2 star were it not for the lack of a privacy door in the 1 bedroom suite. We always book and pay extra for a 1 bedroom suite for privacy reasons as my wife goes to bed early and I am a night owl. It is bizarre that the door opening and frame separating the living room to the spacious bedroom appears to be easy to install a basic door between the rooms, but it has not been done. I was told by a staff member that they are receiving a ton of negative feedback about this shortcoming. A shame really because with that exception, the Grand Hyatt Denver is amazing.",4

Easy to use free bus from the bus/train station and walk block to hotel.Rooms good size, nice and clean with comfy beds. Coffee machine in room and hotel very kindly provided more coffee when we arrived back late at night. Swimming pool has access to outside patio but weather so hot we were unable to sit outside.Hotel lounge could have provided more seating, there were singers most nights, very enjoyable, especially during happy hour, but limited seating meant some people chose not to stay.Staff polite and helpful. Would stay again if in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,a little dated,"the hotel is in a great location, maybe that is why the overnight parking is so expensive. Not stayed in a hotel for a while that has a shower curtain, so a decor update is probably overdue. Very good staff and ambience",3

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Conference Hotel,Was there for a conference but I believe if I had been in town for a vacation I would happily stay in the property.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"The food at Lounge is horrible, they put stale food. Can you imagine eating that and getting sick?","The food at Lounge was horrible for me since they did not have any choice for Vegetarians. Also, some of the stuff they put in were stale and I had to ask the staff to remove it since people could get sick with this type of food. I don't think the staff at Lounge, especially in the evening, cares about the guests(health). I am totally disappointed with the lounge food/service.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very comfortable and enjoyable stay,"Recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Denver for a conference which was taking place at the hotel.  Was warmly welcomed by the staff and very efficiently checked in and offered information - not too much just the right amount for me (a first time stayer).  Room was very large and comfortable -- plenty of room to relax and work as well.  One note is the chair/loveseat in the room looks very inviting and like a place I wanted to hang and read -- but is not very comfortable at all.  It is much harder than it appears.  The bed was great as was the shower.  The staff throughout the visit - front desk, housekeeping, conference staff, and the staff at Courier and the lobby bar were all great!!!  Five stars to them alone.  Location was great - close to 16th street, easy walk to the ballpark and great place from which to have a morning walk to the civic plaza.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel and great location ,"One block from the 16th Street Mall which is something I didn’t even know about when booking. It’s a street that doesn’t have traffic but has tons of stores, restaurants, bars etc. it’s very nice and definitely an easy walk from the hotel. The rooms are modern and clean.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel Right In Downtown,"Lovely amenities, helpful staff, beautiful 4th floor outdoor track, quiet air control in rooms, Starbucks coffee! What more can you ask for? My only issue was that I had called the hotel to find out about transportation to the hotel. They told me the Supershuttle would take me to the door of the hotel but when I called the day of arrival to tell them I would be late checking in, they told me thete was no direct shuttle to the hotel and I would have to take a taxi or Uber. I am surprised by this? I had to downliad an Uber app to pay for the car to hotel.",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,In Denver for Rockies Game,"Our family of 5 stayed one night in two connecting club-level rooms and here is our review of the property..Arrival / Check-in: Valet parking and check-in is very easy and the rooms were available on time. There is a nice lobby area with couches and a bar if you need to wait. The valet has its own separate lobby where they pull your car up indoors, which I’m sure is a luxury in the winter vs waiting outside.Service: We found the service at the club level to be very accommodating and all staff helpful.Room(s): Soaring views over Denver, clean rooms, comfortable bedding and convenient motion-activated night lamps on the floor to allow you to navigate the dark.Club-Level: Light snacks during the day include nuts, chips and soft drinks / water. Breakfast included most items you would want, but a little higher end than standard continental fare. They have a nice espresso machine where you can make your own Starbucks latte.Property: The Grand Hyatt feels more in the basic business district, but is only a block over from the walking 16th street mall area. To go to the Rockies game, we walked to 16th street, took the free trolley up the street, and over to Coors Field. On the way home, a Rick-Shaw brought us all the way back. Very convenient. There is also a nice indoor pool, nice workout facility, tennis court, jogging track and shuffle board. Better amenities than expected.Overall Impression: We didn’t expect our stay here to be more than a basic, safe stay. However, we left impressed that we had a wonderful stay and we would definitely visit again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Loved this Hyatt and loved the outdoor track!,My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Grand Hyatt in Denver this past weekend for one evening.  We were upgraded to a Grand Stay room and totally enjoyed access to the Grand Club.  I especially enjoyed the outdoor track (which is attached to the fitness center).  The track was @ 1/10 mile and it had a great view of downtown Denver.The location is fantastic - a short distance from the 16th Street mall and all of the great people watching there.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Warm service, lovely property","Though in the midst of downtown Denver, our room was quiet and peaceful. Nice bed linens and towels, great pillows - and a large selection of them on each bed. Very clean. Nice complimentary toiletries, too. The service received was outstanding - warm and friendly, always available to accommodate requests. Excellent restaurant, too.The one point off the room was just that the furniture was a little banged up (dresser).",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Best Hotel in Downtown Denver Hands Down!,"I love the Hyatt - they’re the only hotel chain that I prefer to stay at, and I’ve never had a bad stay. The Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown was exceptional, and have over the top exceeded my expectations! Since I did the online check-in process, I received an email a few hours before my actual check-in time with the room number. So, when I arrived at the Grand Hyatt, I was able to pick up my key quickly and head up to my hotel room. Well, all I could say is that I was completely surprised that I got upgraded to a Club King when I arrived at the highest floor. This means that I got access to the Club Room (a place to chill that included light breakfast, midday snacks, light dinner, dessert, and drinks - water! which I really need as I am prone to altitude sickness).I’ve stayed at pretty much every hotel close to my company’s headquarters (Magnolia, Monaco, Renaissance, Residence Inn), and finally decided to try the Grand Hyatt, which is a little further away (but so is the Brown, where I stayed for a conference in the past). I am soooo glad that I decided to give the Grand Hyatt a try. The Grand Hyatt is worth the walk (really only a few minutes extra). I finally got some good sequential sleep in Denver (never had a good night's sleep at any of the other hotels, except when I was really sick one night from the altitude). The king bed was super comfy, and I got a sweet bathroom with a fancy tub, and lights that can be dimmed (which really helped with being able to sleep, as I don't like to sleep in total darkness).I will continue to stay at the Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown in my future trips to Denver.  What makes the Hyatt brand different from everyone else (including the Westin and Ritz) is that no matter what type of Hyatt I’ve stayed at (House, Place, Regency, Resort, etc.), the service/catering is exceptional.Bravo and Thank You Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown! You never disappoint!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great experience,"Stayed at this hotel for 6 nights, part of the time for business the other time for pleasure. Had an overall enjoyable experience the staff was very friendly and professional the rooms were clean and it was situated the downtown area. Excellent lobby area with occasional easy listening entertainment. The only issue I had was that there weren’t many affordable eating places near the hotel (within 1-2 blocks). Overall enjoyable experience !",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Clean, High Value, Great Location",I stayed here for a conference. My room was very well kept by housekeeping and they reorganized my belongings to a T. Staff were friendly and welcoming in every interaction. Wish there were more gluten free food options advertised. They did have GF bread but I didn't know that until another guest let me know.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A very satisfying three night stay.  Don't miss the breakfast.,"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Denver for a three night getaway.  Check-in was easy. The corner room was spacious, quiet, and very comfortable.  We spent most of our time away from the hotel but we were always glad to return.  Our room was always proptly cleaned before our return.  Breakfast was terrific and the breakfast waiter, Jake, was very good.  The only thing missing at this hotel is a conceriege.  The workout area looked very adequate. Our bill was error free and check-out was quick.  We would return to this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Hotel Was Great, Poor Customer Service","I made a reservation for a room with a king size bed. I checked in and was not told that I was given a room with 2 queen beds. I get up to my room only to find out this was changed. I try to call the front desk and it is a busy signal for 15 mins. I go back down and tell the person who checked me in and they blew me off and told me ""we try to honor the request but we can't always."" This I understand but I ask why I was not informed at check in this was changed and why then I could not call down to the desk for 15 mins and was not given any answer. I also asked if it was possible to change rooms the next night or if the room I requested became available and was again told ""no."" VERY poor customer service.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very impressed,"We come to Denver fairly often to see our son and new grandson. We often stay at the Ritz Carleton but this visit I had a meeting at the Hyatt so we stayed there. Everything about the hotel was great. The rooms, staff, gym and more.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Love it!,"We LOVED this hotel. The staff was so friendly, and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. The room was so spacious and modern. The only unfortunate thing I will say is that the Starbucks was closed on Sunday, but it's okay we walked to another one that was close!! I always recommend Hyatt, so cheers to another great stay! Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Fine stay,"This hotel is in a great location and everyone was friendly. The only complaint was the inability to get the a/c to a comfortable temperature, and the adjacent rooms and halls were very loud late and night which interfered with sleep. Otherwise, it was a fine stay. Thanks.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice stay,"Hotel is very nice.  Rooms are updated, modern and clean.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Great location.  There is a Starbucks right next to the hotel, however it is not open on Sundays.  Not a fan of the barn door on the bathroom.  It did not pull smoothly so was hard to open and close and I just think the barn door style is dumb for bathrooms.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Sweet Spot,"Centrally located, beautiful Hotel, with the friendliest staff on Earth, make sure you opt for The Grand Club option, which includes Breakfast, all the Soft drinks you can drink, Hot afternoon snacks , and $4 cocktails, as well as coffee , tea, espresso etc. Go ahead, try and beat that deal.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Lovely stay,"This hotel is fantastic.  The customer service is great, as is the Grand Club, which serves a fine continental breakfast, with scrambled eggs and oatmeal, and soft drinks, and appetizers throughout the day.  The room is very clean.  The front desk personnel are attentive and very friendly.  If you need anything, you can text the hotel staff and they will accommodate you.  The gym, though small, was functional, but the outside running court, more than made up for it, and there is a large indoor pool.  Loved the Grand Hyatt.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Disappointing visit,This was our 3rd stay at the Grand Hyatt. I think this was a one off because we usually are quite happy here. We stayed just for a quick weekend for the Broncos game. The 2 big faults on this trip were our service at the hotel restaurant and the cleanliness of our room.  We left the Broncos game at the start of the 4th quarter (Saturday night) and returned to the hotel for a late dinner and a drink. The waitress was nice enough but overwhelmed and never brought out drinks. We tried to make eye contact with her but she seemed to be avoiding us. After 15 minutes I went to the bar and asked if I could carry our own drinks to the table since they'd been sitting there. She apologized. The food came out immediately after. No one wants their food to arrive with their drink. Do the…,2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Quick trip to Denver,"used this hotel as access to visit Denver Museum of Art.  Only problem was that staff could not direct us to museum.Otherwise, hotel very good. Room very clean. Food only so so. Ambience very nice. Parking convenient",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Pleasant Stay,Stayed overnight and the room was very comfortable. The bathroom was nice with good toiletries.  We tried the restaurant for dinner and breakfast both of which were nice. The hotel is well located with lots to do nearby.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great comfortable beds and pillows, friendly staff, big corner rooms","I am in the room now writing this review.  This is my 3rd visit to the hotel and I think I like it more every time I visit.  This time I have a great view out of my 25th floor corner room.  The room is huge for typical hotel standards and has a nice bath with big walkin shower.  The mattress and pillows are quite comfortable and there are just nice extras that make me smile.  For example,  I love the wall-mounted drapery controls that let me make minor adjustments quickly from a keypad whenever I want to switch the view or sleep.  There are nice path lights that light up at night.  It is a great location very close to the 16th street mall and dining options.  Great conference center as well!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Nice hotel, friendly staff,","Stayed here for three nights. Clean and nice. The check-in area has several counters instead of one large counter. I checked in after midnight and unfortunately there was only one agent. Had to wait for about 12-15 mins, although there was only one guest ahead of me.Need the card to use the elevator. The room and the bathroom was very nice. There are motion activated lights illuminating the floor in the bathroom. A nice touch.The rooms have a fridge and coffee machine. About six blocks to the convention center. There is a 7/11 right across the street. Also a Starbucks within a block. The prices for water and other snacks were very reasonable at 7/11.I took a star out for the following reasons.There was a wall lamp that they fixed with tapes. For a hotel of this caliber I did not expect this (see picture). The dresser doors get stuck and you had to open the closet door to pull the dresser drawers out.May be have one more agent to expedite the check-in?",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Awesome Downtown Denver Hotel,We enjoyed a club level room.  The club room was worth the extra expense.  Each staff member that we encountered was very nice and went above and beyond to make our stay perfect.  The hotel is a 15-min walk to Coors Stadium.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,The Hyatt never disappoints,We had a business meeting at this location and everything went smoothly with everyone's needs met. Fantastic location and easy to get around downtown. The hotel is lovely and the rooms well appointed.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Clean and quiet- no breakfast,"Stayed in the Grand Hyatt Aug 2018 for my husband’s business trip. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel in the lobby area, elevators and our room. Our room was spacious with a king bed and surprisingly quiet. Bathroom had a large rain shower shower head with consistent pressure and heat. I only wish a breakfast option was available. The hotel was just a couple of blocks from a Target and CBS and just 1 1/2 blocks from the 16th Street Mall, which is FILLED with amazing restaurants for any mealtime as well as the free mall shuttle that takes you from Union Station to the Capitol.Just 2-3 blocks from 3 major car rental agency’s and a 10 minute walk from the state Capitol and a terrific walking tour of the city.Also just 2 blocks from the iconic open air shopping mall on 16th (if you like shopping) and 2 blocks from great clips for a quick cut if needed.The staff was super friendly at check in (getting us in early) and check out. Would not only stay here again, but would recommend others do too! The 4 rating is because there is no breakfast option which forces out to find breakfast each morning.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Nice, friendly, but noisy and uncomfortable.","Beautiful place with great staff. However, the bed is quite uncomfortable. The pillows are all the same, so if you don't like feathers you are out of luck.  Would love to see a memory foam topper and pillow option. My room, 2502, was very noisy.  I could hear everything around me; doors shutting, stairs, neighbors, and a strange sound from above.  I've seen better soundproofing in hotels that are half the price and twice as old.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Staff and family environment,Check was very simple and quick. Service was very profession and caring. Several things were forgotten but staff provided me with everything I needed. Awesome 4 day experience. Looking forward to my next stay.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else when coming to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place to stay.,"Comfortable, clean, and friendly staff. Only a block from the 16th street mall. The hotel has a bar/restaurant, pool, exercise room and a running track and tennis court on the adjoining rooftop. I would recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice and Clean,"Hotel was clean as expected and location was prime for shopping and food.  There was a workout gym, but it was small and you were staring at four walls.  The track and tennis court was an excellent alternative workout option. The only complaint we had was not having a running fridge.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay!,"Staff was super friendly, room was modern and clean with a comfy bed and 5 different pillows! Hotel breakfast buffet was superb, the bar was nice and the overall experience was great. There was a Starbucks in the lobby of the adjacent building and the hotel was only 1 mile from union train station. Great shopping and restaurants within walking distance of hotel. Will be staying here again next year.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great stay,"Stayed at this hotel at the start of our road trip. Lovely hotel, friendly helpful staff.  Comfortable room.Restaurant with good Choice of food and an excellent breakfast. There is also a coffee/snack shop.Hotel in a good location - all sites within walking distance.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Comfortable overall,"This Hyatt was clean, quiet, and comfortable, and I would recommend it for business travel. I appreciated the wifi and the gym/pool facilities. I did have issues with the condition of the room (a slow-draining sink and sliding door off its tracks) that made an otherwise nice room something of a pain to deal with. Hotel staff was uniformly polite and friendly, but when I went to the front desk about a housekeeping request the message was never conveyed. Don't expect the simple perks you might find at another hotel; a basic bottle of water, for example, will set you back $5, and my room did not have even a coffee maker. If you are driving, research parking options beforehand, as valet through the hotel itself is laughably expensive. All in all, this is a nice hotel, but for what the Hyatt name bills itself as, it could be better.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice Updated Hotel with Clean Rooms and close to everything Downtown,"The good things: We pulled up to unload our luggage and they allowed us to leave our car for a bit out front while e got checked in and situated. The hotel is easy to get to and centrally located. Check in was a breeze and literally took less than 5 minutes. (There happened to be no line, otherwise the check in area is small and I can see how it might get congested and confusing if there were lines.). The elevator is fast and you must have a key card to get to any floor. The rooms are up to date and our was clean. The bathroom and shower were even clean (where I find at most, even nice hotels, there is some form of black mold happening somewhere, which was not the case at The Grand Hyatt.). The not so good: The beds are too hard. The TV kept shutting off.The very expensive breakfast buffet ($20 as of yesterday) shuts down at 9:30AM. Valet parking is very expensive at $46/day (of of yesterday) and when I called before checking in to ask if there were other parking options, they said there are parking decks all over town. (There is a parking deck directly across the street from the entrance. There is also free and paid street parking, depending on the day and hours and number of hours needed to park.). (We did not see or use the pool or gym so cannot comment on that.). We booked in advance and got a great nightly rate for our stay (compared to the current $190/night showing) , Overall I would stay here every time, but only at our special rate again",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Terrible Customer service,"Housekeeping is the worst of the bunch but the front desk was really no better just an overall poor attitude and seemed bothered to be asked any questions. Air did work beds are super uncomfortable. No breakfast and expensive parking. Plenty of other nicer, friendlier more economic places in the area.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,FANTASTIC HOTEL! 10 OUT OF 10 !,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone!  Incredible!  Rooms are large, clean and comfortable!

My flight arrived early in the day and i was pleasantly surprised that i was able to check in early!! We ate at the hotel restaurant and it was good. They also have a snack bar area with drinks, salads, sandwiches and snacks. Very nice to have something close if you’d like a snack while in traveling. Attended a conference located in the hotel so that was convenient. I would stay here again if in Denver. Good rate also.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice but snotty ,"Stayed for a conference. Nice enough rooms. Great location. Expensive parking. Conference center is across the driveway, not in the same building. Likely to stay again for business, but not for pleasure.",4

Close by the 16th Street Shopping area and restaurants. Rooms were very clean and quiet, beds were super comfy. Staff was friendly and responsive to any requests. Would recommend highly.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Not recommended,"We were very disappointed by the housekeeping service.  We had to call to request this everyday.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt Denver,"Nice clean hotel.  Nice surprise one afternoon when we returned to the hotel and they had a cart of fresh flowers and little vases and invited the guests to make a bouquet to take back to their room.

Hotel has nice location, easy to walk to restaurants, Union station, etc.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Stay,"We stayed here while my husband was on a business trip.  Very nice hotel.  I really enjoyed the outdoor walking track and sun deck.  The exercise room was nice too.  I never used the pool, but it was nice.  The room had a cooler but not a refrigerator.  I had some food that I needed a refrigerator.  I called the front desk and they sent one up.  One evening it was raining and they let us use an umbrella.  They were very accommodating. The location was good.  16th Street Mall was one block away with several restaurants and shopping.  Plus 16th St. Mall has a free bus system to get you around.  Hope my husband's company sends him back in the future and I get to tag along again.",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,FCC Conference,"Nice place, the adjoining room had noisy people but overall a great experience.My biggest disappointment was a limited late night menu.  The food was good, but the choices after 10pm were few.  To be fair, many places do not have late night service at all.I say so a good place could improve and become a great place.  I would be happy to stay there again.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location!,"We recently stayed one night at the Grand Hyatt and had an excellent experience. The staff were welcoming and accommodating. Breakfast at the restaurant was incredible, and again, the staff were so kind.  It was just a two block walk to the 16th St. pedestrian mall where we could get on a free shuttle bus along the mall to Union Station.  (We traveled by Amtrak from Chicago to Denver, so this was a free way to travel to the hotel.)",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful hotel in a central location,"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a conference.  The hotel is located in downtown Denver, within walking distance from major attractions such as Denver Pavilion Mall, 16th Street Mall, Union Station, and Coors Field.  My room was on the 23rd floor with a view of some office buildings.  The room was very large and spacious, but the bathrooms are standard size.  The furnishings were modern and the room was clean.  There were a lot of thoughtful touches and can provide a lot of necessities. You can request a lot of things such as umbrellas, curling irons, yoga mat, toothpaste/dental kit, deodorant, slippers, etc.  Pros:- Good location- Clean and spacious rooms- Great service all around- Fast elevators- Provide all of the required necessities if you forget to pack thingsCons:- No complimentary water, which I typically get at other hotels- Room facing other buildings can be a bit darkOverall I had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay here again.  The room itself wasn't very distinctive, but what sets the Grand Hyatt apart is the prime location and great service.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Conference Pleasure,"I recently had the opportunity of attending a conference at the property and the venue was perfect. The Hyatt is in a perfect location with ease of parking. The parking garage is located across the street so that was a plus. As soon as you enter for conference, hotel staff members are there to greet several events. it is very easy to get to where you need to go with elevators as soon as you enter with listing of conferences. Each room/ area was well lit and comfortable. The food was diverse and tasty.Will definitely recommend to other companies to reserve a conference there.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Building noise,"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Denver over a weekend.  Despite requesting a “quiet room” on the Hyatt website, the room we received (1908) had noise issues which I believe were related to its proximity to the service elevator.  Every few minutes, day and night, there would be the same rolling noise.  The AC was good and the shower was fine.  I did not care for the mattress but I have certainly slept on worse.And, Hyatt, you may think that linking my Hyatt survey to TripAdvisor is saving me time.  But when TripAdvisor only receives ten characters of the review and I end up having to write it all again (like I am now) you are not scoring points with the customer.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,very nice & updated,very nice update to this hotel since last year - the staff were very nice & it is prime location for downtown Denver.Only drawback was I had a corner suite & there was jack hammering going on after 11PM each night which was a bummer.,5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt experience was grand indeed!,"While visiting Denver with a conference, I was delighted to give Grand Hyatt a try! I was not disappointed!  The room was very comfortable, quiet and well-appointed. I hate being awakened all night by noisy refrigerators, A/C units and neighbors.  None of those things happened in this room! The hotel restaurant is usually disappointing and expensive, but not Courier.  Courier at the Grand Hyatt employed a creative menu, fresh ingredients and nicely decorated with typewriters and courier font! The best surprise, though, was the rooftop track.  What a perfect use of forgotten space! I will be looking forward to my next chance to spend a few days at Grand Hyatt Denver!",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great location, thoughtful staff, and nice amenities","We were pleasantly surprised to find an updated and modern hotel with a welcoming reception area - with staggered work stations that invite conversation and interaction instead of the traditional long front desk that imposes a barrier between staff and guests. Our room was large and comfortable, as were the beds. They had several lights on motion sensor so that when you got out of bed, a light near the floor lit up to guide your way to the bathroom. Once in the bathroom, another low light came on so that you didn't have to deal with putting on bright lights while others sleep. The location was great - just a block from the 16th Street Mall with its continuous buses taking people up and back. The front desk staff was particularly helpful with a special request and everyone was…",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,AICPA Conference,"First time in Denver, CO - absolutely loved this hotel.  It is 1 block away from the 16th Street Mall.  Lots of shopping and good places to eat within walking distance.  The hotel staff was very friendly including the valet staff, front desk staff, housekeeping and club room staff.  The food was tasty. The rooms were very clean.  The common areas were clean as well.  Would only recommend that the hotel consider updating the valet waiting area.  The valet staff stated that there was a special waiting area for valet and made it seem really nice. But it was just a bench and a tv.  Hotel should consider putting more decor and make it feel like the rest of the hotel.  Just a suggestion. ",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Fantastic customer service experience!,"Stayed at The Grand Hyatt on business for 2 nights. Staff is very customer oriented, friendly, professional and anticipates your needs. I travel for a living and they do everything right at this hotel. The restaurant/bar located off of the lobby is great as well, you can take a sandwich or fruit etc. from their “kitchen” to your room or eat in. They have a nice selection of foods available on the menu, I had salmon one night and shared an asparagus flatbread another night, both were excellent. This hotel will leave you with a warm feeling, as if you stayed at a friend’s home, not at a hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in,The rooms were clean and comfortable. The executive lounge was fantastic with so much available. It made for a great trip. The roof top track was relaxing for an evening workout. The pool was small for real swim exercise,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,First time in Denver,"This hotel is very nice and the room is very spacious. The room and bathroom looked updated. The bed was very firm which I loved but like all hotels the pillows sucked.  The mini fridge didnt get too cold but it was good enough to store our bottle water. The location was great if you want to stay downtown, its close to 16th mall, Union square and Coors Field. There are plenty of restaurants that are walking distance.  We also had breakfast at this hotel, the breakfast buffet was very good the pancakes were delicious! I do have a negative, not sure if this hotel is near a hospital because we heard a lot of sirens in the middle of the night.  Also as we were waiting for our shuttle to pick us up we were sitting on the couches in the lobby. The couches have a funny smell so I would definitely not sit on them again. These two negatives are minor to me and I would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Terrific Location,"The Grand Hyatt is in a terrific location just about a block from the 16th Street Mall area.  It is within walking distance from many attractions and restaurants or one may hop on a bus to get to other places like the zoo or Botanic Gardens.  The hotel is updated with spacious rooms and tasteful décor.  The lobby and bar area is lovely.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  We stayed on the 18th floor and never had to wait more than a few seconds for an elevator, there are five.  There was always cold fruit infused water in the lobby available during the day.  If we return to the city we would choose to stay at the Grand Hyatt again.  The only negative comments I have is that their mini refrigerators are not food safe and didn't even keep our water cold, and there was not enough drawer space for clothing.  I had to live out of my suitcase for nine days.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place to stay.,"My room was very big, the bed was comfortable and room service was great. Very close to the city center. It's even suitable for longer business trips.The bar had a nice selection of whiskys. Definitely recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Excellent hotel, wish it was 1 block closer to convention center","I loved the friendliness of the staff and quality of the hotel.  It is environmentally friendly, which is also important to me.  I was attending a conference at the Convention Center, so I wish this hotel was just 1 block closer, but it was still easy walking distance for an able-bodied person.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful Place to Stay Downtown,We are staying several nights here. So far it is a lovely hotel.  Very simply and elegantly furnished.  Beds are amazing.  Music at night in the lobby.  Not much help if you need tickets to something.  They advise getting online to do that. We asked about a baseball game on Friday and they said yes but go online to get tickets.  Turns out it was an away game.  Think there are lots of new people here but they are nice just not as seasoned as one would expect at a Hyatt downtown.  Nice place to stay.  Close to everything.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Easy walking access!,We Stayed for a 3 game baseball series. $8 lyft ride or 15 min walk away from all the fun of LODO. In a quiet business district where when we were ready to leave the noise we were actually able to get sleep!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Comfortable, Clean, Convenient!",The rooms were comfortable with a large shower/bath. Motion censored lighting was really convenient as well. Conveniently located near 16th Street where there is lots of restaurants and is a pedestrian street (no driving).,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great time!,"My boyfriend and I brought his 8 year old son to Denver to see a baseball game and we stayed at the grand Hyatt. I used points and a club lounge upgrade I had- it was well worth it! GREAT breakfast, GREAT service. Great for families, couples or business travelers.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice service but hotel is not impressive,"We've stayed here for 3 nights, on top floor. We have access to lough, but was disappointed by what was provided in lounge. Breakfast is average, and really nothing special. Our room is large, clean, but somehow empty. There is a walk-in closet for hanging clothes.. No additional table or storage space within the room for common items - very inconvenient. Bathroom is nice but really not impressive compared to other Park or Grand Hyatt we've visited. Also, there is only one mirror in bathroom, which is rather uncommon.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great location in downtown Denver,"Really enjoyed a recent business stay at this hotel.  Located close to many restaurants and my meetings.  Nice rooms, very clean, quiet and well-appointed. Staff was accommodating and check-in and check-out were a breeze.  Would certainly choose this hotel again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Denver Conference,We stayed at this Hyatt walking distance to the convention center and 16th mall street. This is great location . The lobby are nice and clean. The rooms are clean and nice. Comfortable bed. The gym are fairly good size with treadmill and free weights. All and all a fairly decent hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great location, Good Service, NIce rooms","We stayed in October, and the weather was great for walking around.  Great location, close to shopping, malls, bars, restaurants, etc.  Rooms were high quality and very quiet.  Room service was great, but tock about 40 minutes.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Right across the street from the convention center,"This is a big convention hotel right next to the convention center. Don't bother with the Regency Club lounge.  It is over sold and always crowded with very average food.  If you do pay extra for the Regency Club (or have status), make sure you are on the higher floors.  There are two sets of elevators - low floors and high floors.  I was on the lower floors side and had to go down to the lower level and take the high floor elevator up to the Club.  That was really annoying.  There are plenty of stores and restaurants close by.  16th street mall is just one block away.  I found the pillows to be very uncomfortable but that may just be me.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice Hotel,Stayed at this Hyatt for meetings at the convention center. A little far to walk in the Denver heat with a suit on. Rooms and hallways a little dark for my taste. Common areas were pleasant. Nothing fancy or top of the line. Stayed on the Concierge level. Nice free breakfast provided. Nice workout facility. All and all a decent hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Ask for a room away from the elevators,"It was my grand daughters birthday, we went to Denver to watch a concert and decided to spent the evening. I wanted valet parking and location close to the concert. We were pleased with the accommodations until we tried to sleep, sadly we were right next to the elevators and it sounded like we were next to the light rail tracks. I highly recommend this hotel, although next time I would not accept a room so close to the elevators.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel.excellent location.near 16th Avenue,Laimer square and near all shopping and dining options.there is a 7/11 and Starbucks right below the hotel.ample parking options just opposite the hotel.the hotel and staff itself are very good.excellent and tasty breakfast spread.huge running track,tennis court,indoor (non heated) pool.very good ,clean,spacious,modern rooms and bathrooms.the upholstery,linen,towels are very clean and fresh.we requested for some homemade food to be warmed.the hotel provided with a microwave instantly.Highly recommend for anyone going to Denver downtown.Special mention of staff in all departments..front desk, restaurant,bar,concierge,house keeping.everyone always had a smile and went out of their way to help.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,What a hotel should be like,Just what I expect from a Grand Hyatt.  Excellent and friendly service. super rooms and even though the restaurant was being remodeled the lobby lounge did a great job in serving lunch and breakfast.  The service in the concierge club was exceptional.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,July 4th week in Denver,"Absolutely fantastic stay.  First time in Denver and chose the Grand Hyatt due to my curiosity of their on-site tennis court, track, and indoor pool.  Arrived from the airport via the RTD rail to Union Station and took the free 16th Street Mall bus.  Checkin was a breeze. We were offered bottles of water which we graciously accepted being that it may have been the hottest day of the week then.  We were staying in the Executive Suite on the 26th floor with access to the Grand Club.  Very comfortable room.  Separate living area, comfortable king bed in a separate bedroom, small kitchenette, shower with strong water pressure.  Outside noise was not a problem.One issue we did encounter with our room... walking into the bathroom in the morning we were met with a floor of water.  One of the pipes in the ceiling was leaking.  Engineering was quick to respond.  We left the room to them and went about our plans for the day.  Not a problem for us.  What surprised us that upon returning to the hotel in the afternoon, Andrew the front desk manager, apologized to us constantly for the inconvenience and moved us into the Presidential Suite.  Wasn't expected and wasn't necessary, but it shows the exceptional care they put in to a guest's stay.The Grand Hyatt is conveniently located a block away from the 16th Street mall.  Plenty of dining options await with access to light rail.  On July 3rd, there's a fantastic firework display at the Civic Center Park several blocks away.Truly enjoyed this first trip to Denver.  Will be sure to return.  Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Dodger Baseball Weekend,"Good location to catch a series at Coors Field, a game at Mile High or any events in the LoDo area. We make the 20 minute walk from Union Station after taking the train from the Airport. There is some local construction that makes you cross where there are closed sidewlks. (might be that way for another year or 2) The Hotel has a cafe in the back, lounge in the lobby and a starbucks in the adjoining building. Good service and the rates were moderate compared to other options in the area. Rooms have been remodelled and the washrooms were spacious. We would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent Hotel,Quality for the money was fantastic.  The staff and service provided were outstanding.  The bed and pillows were soooooo comfortable!!  The location was fantastic as we were only a block away from the free bus shuttle that takes you up and down the pedestrian walkway.  The staff greeted us upon entering and leaving the facility.  The rooms were exceptionally clean and even the housekeeping staff was very friendly and quick to ask if we needed anything.  Thanks Hyatt,5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Enjoyed my stay,I stayed for 4 nights during my conference.  On check in fresh flowers were available in the lobby to create a small bouquet to bring to your room which was a nice touch.  Other days they had Colorado post cards in the lobby that guest could complete and they would stamp and mail out for you for free.  The staff were all very nice.  The room was quite and comfortable.,5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Incredible service!,"I can’t say enough amazing things about this Hyatt and the incredible staff! Teresa went above and beyond to make our stay extra special with surprises in the room (and the room was gorgeous to boot!). Elicia was so welcoming at checkin and wished us a happy anniversary and offered a late checkout, which we were more than thrilled to take advantage of. The room was sparkling clean and beautiful thanks to Fatima. Andrew in the Grand Club was super friendly and helpful. The hotel is beautiful, views are great, rooms large and modern, but really it’s the incredible staff that will make your stay extra special. We can’t wait to come back next time we are in town. We prefer breakfast at the club over anything in town. You won’t regret staying at this Hyatt—we can’t wait to come back!!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Hyatt Hotel Stay,"For the quality of stay, I would come back again!

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,great location for 16th street mall access,"The location was great for this hotel. It was close to shopping and restaurants. The work-out room was ok. The running track was great. My room was hot and did not cool down. As with most downtown hotels you do have to deal with the traffic noise at night, but it was not that bad.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Nice Hotel, Central and Convenient Location","Hotel is very clean and elevators are fast. rooms are quiet and very clean, service is very good. Close to everything in downtown. Parking is another story. Valet is 46.00 a day which I found very steep considering the night rate was under 150.00. self parking close to the hotel was 26, so add to the daily cost. Service was excellent with people eager to help you.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great experience!,"Was there for a conference (my company's conference) and all the staff were friendly, accommodating, and helpful.

Location is perfect for my purposes, in a safe, comfortable location.  Easy walk to the 16th Street Mall. Staff was exceptional in providing customer service and attention to detail. Nice casual restaurant as well as a very well appointed Club Floor room for light breakfast and evening snacks/cocktails (additional charge).  Indoor pool, more than adequate workout facilities plus a running track and outdoor tennis court.  At night, there is entertainment in the downstairs lounge area. The singer on Saturday night was quite good. Had a lovely room with view of the mountains in the distance. Bed super comfortable and the room was quiet. I will be back at this hotel for my next visit to Denver. Hyatt always does a nice job for me.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Comfortable room,"Comfortable beds, friendly staff, good location for downtown activities. Floor in room needed additional cleaning, but staff was very responsive when requested.  Hotel could have done a better job managing crowds in the lobby on Saturday morning.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel, great location. Enjoyed walking the 16th Street Mall. Staff was very helpful and friendly.   Conference rooms were nice and clean.  I would definitely recommend the hotel and hope that the next conference is held at that location.",4

Great experience for a business conference!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,HOME,"I enjoyed this location because it had two 7-11s on each corner.  It wasn't too far from the convention center and very close to the 16th St. Mall.  The staff was courteous, kind, and willing to help.  I loved the view from the corner room.  It was a pleasant stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Accomodating and very comfortable,"Guest room was comfortable in every way and nicely appointed.

Awesome breakfast buffet!",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Downtown Denver stay,"Great location with easy access to all amenities downtown. Hotel staff was excellent and friendly.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Bar staff rip you off,The hotel is very nice but I have just returned to my room having had two 6oz drinks but I have been charged for two 9oz. I will be speaking to management in the morning as I believe either this was a mistake from a bartender or a deliberate attempt to extort money so beware of this place.,1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Good place to rest,Went to this place for business. Centrally located and ease to get around town. Staff is friendly an helpful. Breakfast is expensive. rooms are not sound proof and if someone had party next door you not be able to sleep.,4

We enjoyed the food at a wedding in the Pinnacle Room, enjoyed breakfast at the Courier and thought the bar service on the main floor was excellent.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Tip Top Trip,Rooms are very nice.  Best beds ever.  Cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen in a hotel!  Customer service staff friendly and so helpful. Valet parking got us in and out quickly.  If traveling with a lot of luggage call concierge for help they will get you set up.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Best hotel stay we've ever had,"We stay at hotels often for both business and pleasure so ranking this the BEST ever is saying something. From the moment we pulled up to the hotel to the minute we checked out, we had a positive, warm, and 'feel at home' experience. Staff took time to learn our names, visit with us, and this extended to all departments - valet, housekeeping, front desk, food/drink, etc. We should have known this was going to be the nature of our stay as the GM sent one of those pre-stay emails. I replied with a question and he immediately responded and added a staff member to assist and couldn't have been more pleasant. He was genuinely interested in us, the reason for our visit, and how he and his crew could make it an enjoyable stay.  Indeed, it was. We can't wait to go back. They are 5 star when it come so consumer service.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,peace and quiet in a big city,"marvelous room overlooking the tennis court and track, which I highly recommend.Also do not miss the restaurant which has an extensive menu with a good chefwho serves up large portions.Can be reached from union station (amtrak arrival) via the mall bus on 16thwhich is free.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel except for one really annoying housekeeping process.,"Great hotel except for one really annoying housekeeping process.Stayed for a week in late May 2018; great location; conveniently close to lots of shops, restaurants, and bars (mostly along 16th Street Mall). Valet and bell staff were all very nice and friendly. Front desk staff and housekeeping personnel were all hospitable. The 24-hour café was very convenient. And, the prices weren't too high.Room was clean and nice but the restroom is rather small.Our only gripe is that their housekeeping staff came knocking on our door despite the Privacy Please sign was on the door handle. After 3 knocks, they even open the door and announce ""housekeeping"". What's the point of having the Privacy Please sign? Upon opening the door, the staff member indicated that ""we were just making sure"". My though is, ""making sure of what?""I can understanding if a room doesn't get cleaned or serviced for maybe 3 or more days, that a welfare check might be warrant (considering all the crazy things that happen in hotel rooms these days), but this happened TWICE the week we stayed; once literally the day after we checked in and again the very next day after we did get housekeeping service. This was especially annoying because we have a pre-toddler with us on this trip and each time I was trying to put him to sleep.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great place to stay,The staff was great very nice and professional.  They helped answer questions and friendly.  They made me feel at home and make this the place I would stay next time.  Great location in downtown Denver with valet parking or attached parking garage.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Wonderful Stay at the Beautiful Grand Hyatt!,We were in town for a wedding in Golden of dear friends! Couldn't have stayed at a more welcoming or delightful hotel. Convenient to great restaurants and the 16th Street mile long mall with the free shuttle. Loved our guest room with its fabulous views. The first morning we awoke to a stunning sunrise! Perfect in every way!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great Downtown Hotel, Family Stay","Quick Hits:Clean, modern, excellent location! Overall very good hotel.Couple of notes/recommendations:1) Recommendation: the valet parking is typically worthwhile and I am sure the service is fantastic... except here the parking garage is less than HALF of the cost of valet, and is literally attached to the hotel. Level 1 off the elevator is a VERY short walk to the entrance to the hotel. This is not a knock on the valet, the proximity of a cost conscious parking garage is actually a compliment, especially for a hotel that is downtown. 2) Note/complaint: they cleverly state that ""the swimming pool, outdoor track, and gym open 24 hours are all located on the 4th floor."" However, only 1 of those things is open 24 hours...the pool was our goal after a full day of fantastic Denver activities and yet the pool closes at 9 p.m.. The pool, that is literally next to the gym with glass walls is closed before my 8 and 10 year old go to bed. I know I will get a ""company policy"" garbage response but it isn't like any hotel pool ever has a lifeguard? and let's be honest, any one of us are much more likely to hurt ourselves in the gym than at a pool! I am not upset that the pool isn't open 24 hours, it's that they don't clearly tell you ""pool hours are from 5 a.m to 9 p.m and the outdoor track is open sunrise to sunset and gym is open 24 hours"" when they greet you and tell you about their amenities.  They lead you to believe everything is open 24 hours.  Small issue, but needs attention.Moral: It is clean, comfortable, and very modern. Interesting lighting, fixtures, and decor. A con is that the noise of downtown is hard to avoid, but I would imagine most hotels downtown suffer the same noise rate. The cost is good for the area as we were easily within walking distance to 16th street, and we just left our vehicle in the attached parking garage when we went shopping (see note 1). Obviously the outdoor track is unique, but that too is only open during daylight hours since there is no outdoor lighting. The gym is actually pretty extensive and should fit most workout plans. The pool is good sized with a good depth range of 3 to 5 foot depth for our 8 and 10 year old kiddos.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,One of the loveliest hotels and staff,It was located in a great spot close to 16th mall street and can enjoy a lovely stroll in either direction. The room was so spacious and well thought out. Even the little lights that turn on automatically in the bathroom was a nice touch. Very clean and great quality finishing.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,consider others,"although the location and hotel were perfect, the problems we encountered with the front desk staff,  made the hotel experience, frustrating.  pay close attention when you check in, to be sure you get  what you booked.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel and amenities with one downfall...,This is a gorgeous hotel in a great location. We stayed in late May/early June and the location is perfect. Late night room service menu is good. Has rooftop tennis court and track. The only downfall would be the parking. I was there for 5 days and probably spent well over $150 in parking. Side note - It comes with the territory when staying at a 4 star hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Are you kidding me,Are you kidding me...I booked online no where on the websites does it say that they charge 46.00 a night for parking...are you kidding me...and the refrigerator is not actually a refrigerator it is a cooler that does not actually cool. I guess I should have gotten down on my knees and read the fine print before I place my items in the cooler. Unfortunately I still have 3 night here.,1

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great hotel,"The hotel is in a central location. It’s located off of 17th street, which means that you’re less than a 5-7 minute walk from the 16th street mall. The mall extended for several blocks on 16th street and includes shops like Walgreens, H&M, TJ Maxx, Sephora etc., it’s also about a mile from union station, which has a direct connection to the Denver international airport. The hotel itself is exceptionally beautiful and is what I would describe as a “luxury hotel”. Everything from the lobby to the room itself were refined and beautiful. Our room was serviced regularly around 3-4pm every day of our stay. The staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating. If I’m ever in Denver again, I would definitely come back!",5

I have an odd allergy and they immediately accommodated my request where some hotels would have been flippant about it (even though it's a fairly serious allergy). It was our first stay and it was only one night, but it's clear that it's a well run hotel who care about the guest experience.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great Hotel!,"I really enjoyed my stay. The room was clean, updated, and had motion sensored lights along the floor for those needing to get up in the middle of the night. The water pressure in the shower was awesome! I ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant, and they knocked it out of the park with the banana zucchini french toast. It was delicious and a big portion. The hotel was a short walk from the street (17th, I think)  that has a lot of great restaurants along it with a free bus ride. I’d definitely stay again.",5

The bathrooms are light and the showers are wonderful.Great staff who looked after your needs in a warm and professional manner.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Outsanding venue but expensive valet parking,"The venue, staff and attention to detail is epitomized by everyone. one thing that caused me to downgrade the rating is due to them charging you $46 per day for valet parking. Right around the corner you can park for $18 a day or $9 on the weekend. If they charge what is normal at other venues, which is roughly $25 or so, then no issue. But $46 is excessive",4

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,We intend to go again but The Club level is a must.,"We only had a quick overnight stay as we were passing through on a road trip through the west. We were so impressed with our stay at the Grand Hyatt, we plan on coming back to stay again for an extended stay. What sealed the deal was the Club Level. It had everything you really needed to have that ""stuff you have at home"" for simple comforts from an herbal tea with fresh lemon, to a nice selection of liquors, wines and beers.  An ample breakfast, decent quick snacks and treats throughout the afternoon and a hearty evening reception with a nice selection of liquors, wines and beers(honor bar style, very reasonable prices). If the Club wasn't included, I'd take a star off for the decor, its very fine but is IMO a tiny bit dated.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,A little disappointing ,"Came for a conference. The valet parking is very expensive and is very easy to self park in any one of the nearby parking garages or street parking lots (much cheaper, especially if you just leave the car there the whole time. Great location. Nice lobby. Nice room decor.  Staff is nice and helpful (but housekeeping, albeit very pleasant, not the best at cleaning). The disappointing points:They don’t use fitted sheets and the sheets are too big for the bed. No ceiling lights and lights are not connected to the entrance switch so must turn on individual lamps. Sink water was hard to adjust. Shower was great, and I liked the tub.",4

My room was spacious and comfortable with a nice view.  The bed was comfortable and housekeeping was good.  Staff were all helpful and friendly.  Overall a solid business hotel for a few days.  If I would have one area to suggest improvement it would be on-site dining.  I ordered the duck pot pie in the restaurant.  Not only did it not resemble a traditional pot pie, it was underwhelming at best.  Breakfast offerings in the Regency Club are also a bit below average.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Solid, perfect conference venue","The conference I attended here was made all the more solid by this location. The cleanliness of the rooms (conference and guest), the hospitality of the staff, and overall set up was comfortable and welcoming. The get together for attendees at the Pinnacle Club (38th floor) was breathtaking (quite literally!), and the food served in all locations was solid. Speaking of which, the hotel restaurant serves a Blanca flatbread dish which I could not stop eating (had it for lunch and didn’t eat again the rest of the day!).  Overall thanks to the Grand Hyatt For an excellent conference experience.",5

My room was clean and very comfortable. Location is fantastic. A very short walk to 16th street mall and several restaurants are even closer if you don’t want to go to the 16th street area. Did I mention they have a Starbucks on site!? The Pinnacle Club had phenomenal views of the mountains from the 38th floor, as well.",5

Staff is professional and efficient, including room service.  The rooms are clean and sized well, and there is a decent gym area.  I did not try the restaurant, but the lobby bar is nice, with good spaces to meet.The hotel is priced for business and location, so you would be well advised to check weekend prices, which drop considerably when the suits go home.   16th Street is a minute away, and there are many many restaurants to choose from, within walking distance.",4

Valet parking on-site.  We were always able to quickly call for our vehicle and never had to worry about parking. It also allowed for security and covered parking.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Mixed Review,"I have never had to call housekeeping before at any hotel.  The bathroom floor has not been swept or mopped from the previous guest.  Their hair was next to the bath towels on the bathroom shelf.  The staff quickly took care of the floor.  I probably should have asked them about the head board, which is fabric and has what appears to be dandruff and God knows what else on it.  Could not purchase a bottle water unless I paid cash or had it charged to my room.  I had no cash and I did not want my corporate card charged...  One of the staff gave me a free c UO p of water.  Staff are great and the housekeeping supervisor was very responsive and took care of the bathroom floor herself.",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Embarrassing to Family,"I invited my family along as I was staying there for a conference.Found previous guest's dirty socks, broken refrigerator (they claim it was meant to be a cooler (trashy)), and crabby bartender. UGHShortage of towels and washcloths (they left two of each for three people). Definitely overpriced. I'm still in shock that they would leave a broken refrigerator in the room and put a sticker on the front stating it's meant to be used as a cooler. That's just trashy of them.",1
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Perfect home base for our family vacation,"From start to finish, fantastic experience at this Grand Hyatt. Front desk staff was welcoming and always prepared with excellent restaurant recommendations. Hotel is very centrally located near the state capitol building, restaurants, museums and shopping. We loved the thoughtful lighting touches in the room (motion sensors, night lighting in the bathroom) and appreciated that the housekeeping was always timely. If you're a cookie fan, be sure to try the fresh baked ones from their cafe near the lobby. Definitely would stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great downtown location with excellent service,I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a combined business and personal trip.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great hotel, beautiful rooms, some issues with housekeeping ","I recently completed a 4 night stay at this hotel for a conference.  The hotel is very nice and I loved my room.  Loved the nice touches with the motion activated lights.  I however had a few encounters with housekeeping that made me think they seriously lack attention to detail.  Day 1 I had just checked into my room and 5 minutes later the house keeper busts into the room, no knocking, just boom there she is.  She apologizes immediately then proceeds to shout “Key! Key!” While shaking her set of keys at me and looking around.  I was confused about what was going on so I showed her my room key and she shook her head and proceeded showing me her keys and saying key, so I said did you lose a key? And she said yes and we looked around and didn’t find one and she apologized again and left.  Day 2 I come back from my conference and my room has been serviced and I immediately noticed that they’d left their spray bottle of cleaner in the room so I sat that out in the hall.  Then I go into the bathroom and notice that my wash clothes weren’t restocked but what bothered me was that I had left a few toiletries on the sink and they had all been rearranged and had a towel placed under them.  It honestly really bothered me that someone else had touched my toothbrush.  Maybe I’m weird but I didn’t leave things in a mess so I didn’t understand why they felt the need to move my things.  Day 3 I come in and a dirty cleaning rag had been left wadded up in a ball on the bathroom counter.  Day 4 my room was never serviced, I was in my room a little bit with my sign up so that’s probably my fault, but I called down for some towels and they never came.  Went out to dinner and called again and they came but they about an hour later I’d switched into my pjs and had my privacy please sign on the door and I get a knock on the door, then another, and someone has a robe they said I called down for that I didn’t. Now none of these things are HUGE deals, if just one of them had happened I’d probably not even bring it up but the fact that it was something EVERY day was bizarre to me.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Good stay, could use some decor change","Stayed 3 nights to attend a convention nearby. Fantastic location in Downtown Denver. Room is clean, although the decor could use some modern touch. The decor made me feel like I am transported back to the 60s - 70s. Staff are nice, friendly and very informative. You could do without ordering food to be delivered to your room. There’s so many good food around this hotel, and the food delivery service is not satisfactory in my opinion.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,This hotel is lovely and does not miss a beat.,"My family had 2 rooms here and we were extremely pleased with our choice.  Everything from the smooth and pain free check-in by friendly, capable employees to the fun location and comfortable sleep left us expecting to return.  This hotel runs very well as evidenced by the immediate greeting by the valet and the well executed service by all levels with whom we dealt.I can't think of anything negative to share.  In my opinion, you would be well served by choosing this option in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Amazing stay at the Hyatt,"In town to visit a friend for his birthday and wound up picking the Hyatt for the location downtown, close enough to walk to all the hustle, but far enough away from the bustle that it's quiet and relaxing. Clean, updated rooms, good internet (can be upgraded, though I never noticed a difference in speed even after upgrading), super comfortable beds (firmer side). The gym is well maintained and spacious, breakfast buffet is worth the price of $20/person, room service is tasty and reasonably priced and the hotel staff are warm and welcoming! Only mishap was the room was missed for servicing one day mid week as I returned to drop down some things at 4pm, it still wasn't done. A quick message to the front desk rectified that within 30 minutes while I just relaxed in the beautiful downstairs lobby and people watched. Overall an amazing stay and I will be back =)",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great value, another good stay. Minor areas for improvement.","This was the second time I have stayed at this hotel and it was, overall, another very good stay. The people have always been very pleasant and helpful. The rates have always been on the more affordable side - great for families.We paid a tad extra for a City View - only like $15 more I think - and I'd say that's about right. The views, at least from our room, weren't mindblowing given the location of the hotel in amongst all the other highrises, but it was nice to not be staring down at a parking lot or directly into the rooms of another building. Our view was open to the outdoor track and tennis court.Speaking of the outdoor space - it's one of my favorite parts of this hotel. An outdoor running track surrounds a tennis court with the addition of one or two more activities including shuffleboard. We also visited the indoor pool which was a decent size and not too busy at the time.Weekend parking is $5 for 24 hours if you use the parking garage directly across the street from the hotel entrance. Minor frustrations - 1) I found a couple pieces of small trash in our room when we arrived. A bottle cap and a small piece of a cracker. Not a big deal but they were in plain sight and easy things to clean up if done properly. It did make me wonder about the quality of cleaning in other not-so-obvious areas but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. 2) The shuffleboard discs are in need of replacement. More than half of them are broken or falling apart. Again, not a huge deal, but if it's going to be on offer, then it should be up to scratch like the rest of the facilities are.Would happily stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great value,"Hotel was centrally located. Rooms we super clean and we'll appointed. Thermostat was dead on, soft lights turned on as you moved thru room. Hotel had 2 small bars. Pool and gym I didn't visit. Just a block over from 16th St(bars, restaurants, and shops. Short walk to convention center.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Grand Stay at the Grand Hyatt Denver,Spent 4 days at the Grand Hyatt Denver and was not disappointed. The hotel is updated and we felt welcome throughout our stay. We ate in the hotel and the food was excellent. All the staff were great!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"An inexperienced front desk, a rehearsed ""supervisor"", and a top-notch staff for the daily breakfast","So on the day of arrival, we had parked across the street since we arrived early.  We lugged our bags across the street later in the day, and the young man at the desk said that we were going to be given a ""luxurious"" corner room on the fourth floor.  My printed receipt from my online booking from their website let me know that I would be in a room with a city view or a mountain view.  So we checked in, struggled with our bags, and proceeded to the fourth floor where the room was in close proximity to the swimming pool.  Oh, yeah.  So I was upset with the room, but I was more upset with the front desk who witnessed us struggling with the four bags.  Yes, we know that insurance doesn't allow us to use their carts and bellhops may be busy, but please let us know that eventually we can be assisted.  So I did call, and the ""supervisor"" eventually arrived to take our bags to our new floor on the 19th floor, and prior to this action we received a call asking that we not need a call from the manager.  I told the lady on the phone that the supervisor with the fake rehearsed apology would do.So we were happy with the new room.  And the housekeeping staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay was exceptional.  We were pleased every night when we returned.  And the last day when we tracked down a member of this staff, she was so friendly and attentive.  We were quite impressed.And impressions of this hotel are greatest when we consider our experiences in the restaurant that housed our free breakfast each day.  The friendly host, the attentive pleasant servers, the top-notch personable chef were the highlight of our stay.  This staff works well together, and I definitely hope that they will be recognized.Upon departure, we approached the desk to be greeted with a young nervous woman with a trainee pin.  The trainer had to spend a bit of time with her since they were having problems with the system.  Understandable, and it summed up our stay.  I do believe that most of the hotel has its act together, but perhaps the front desk is struggling a bit to make it work.  Unfortunately first impressions are lasting ones.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Beautiful hotel but not clean enough,I was here with my colleague for a conference.  The staff in the hotel are generally good. Some of course better than others.  Front desk personnel excellent so are the valet persons in the front of the hotel.  Also bellman generally noteable.  The biggest and really only complaint was thick dust on a vent in the bathroom  In room 611.  After all the work to try so hard to do a good job they miss this.,3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Living on Past Pefirmance.,"I am here on business. A 2 night stay.  After reading reviews before I booked, I am disappointed in the level of superior services.   The room service menu leaves a lot to be desired and lack a better variety of selections . Both nights has issues with the TV service, the hotel staff did respond, but were at the mercy of the Direct TV service. My room was clean and comfortable however showed signs of wear and tear.  If I compare this to other hotels with similar ratings that I have stayed, this one falls short, in my opinion.   Overall , not a bad choice but leaves one short of excellence.",3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Top notch,"Very clean and comfy room — and the staff seemed to go out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Very lovely and inviting ground floor space with marble, fires roaring, etc.  We didn’t use it, but they have 24 hour room service. The parking costs about $47/day. We parked in a garage right across the street and paid less. Nice hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Stop Over Before Heading Home,I booked this hotel as we were pulling into Denver.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The front desk was training new staff but were still very efficient even though they were taking a bit more time.  Our room was very clean and comfortable.  It is very close to the 16th St walking street and restaurants.  Very glad we chose to stay here after a long week of driving.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,They didn't even service our room...,"Spent there two nights.  Everything looked good - no complaints.  The next morning (it was a Sunday) we left the room before noon and came back around 3PM.  It hadn't been serviced.  We left the room around 5PM and caught the maid and asked her to service the room.  She promised she would.  We came back around 10PM - no change.We called the front desk who offered us to service the room at that time....  I had an early flight the next day so that wasn't an option.  They offered to change our towels.This is the kind of opportunities where an hotel management can change a bad customer experience to a great one by offering a partial credit, a bottle of wine, two cocktails in the bar, etc.Disappointed....",2
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Great staff, nice facilities, good location, great views ","Nice room, good meeting facilities, close to free bus transportation.

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Nice clean rooms,Great for meetings and located to many convenient restaurants and other attractions. Like my room a lot and the lobby bartenders are excellent. The service staff during our meetings were very attentive and catered to our many needs.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,solid downtown choice for business,"I stay here pretty frequently for work.  It was redone about 5 years ago or so, so relatively new/modern style décor rooms, but I did notice some of the rooms are starting to show some wear. Was pretty disappointed a few stays ago when I was told they did not have any phone chargers to borrow for the evening - seems like a pretty basic amenity at this point.  On the positive side,  I love the toe kick lights in the bedroom and bathrooms - great when you get up in the middle of the night.  The upgraded rooms at the end of the hall are also really nice. There is a good lobby bar with a great atmosphere, although the food options are pretty limited there.  the work out room is pretty good and there is a large indoor pool that does not seem to get much use in the mornings.  There is also an outdoor workout area that I have not used",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Good location, but was off just a bit ","I had a quick trip to Denver on short notice, and this property had a good rate for the weekend and positive reviews. Normally I’m a Marriott guy but this property had a much lower rate for the day I needed, so I decided to give them a try as I have some Hyatt benefits as well.  I must have showed up at a busy time, as I felt less than welcome when I checked in.  For starters I thought the check in area was poorly laid out I couldn’t tell who was in line or not.  The agent that did check me in was pretty short with me too.  I had called and added a club upgrade that I had on my account in advance, but it wasn’t in their system.  And the agent proceeded to lecture me about the upgrade like I was a small child.  However after bringing up my account and showing her that I did follow the process she lectured about she did give in, but stated she’d have to call and check about it.  Yikes, I did call Hyatt afterwards myself too and the phone agent was apologetic and much friendlier and confirmed that I did nothing wrong.Moving on, the hotel itself was what you expect from a Hyatt.  The rooms were a good size, and the hotel was in a good location.  I did take the train from the airport to union station, and then you can take the 16th Street free shuttle and the hotel was only 2-3 blocks from a 16th Street stop.  This was pretty cost effective ($9) and was about as fast as the Uber I took back in the morning.  There are good restaurants/bars within walking distance and a movie theater and bowling alley nearby as well.  The club lounge was nice, and I will give them good feedback for having excellent cookies.  I did think the bed was a little lumpy, but the room its self was ok.  I was on the 8th floor and did get a bit of noise, but in a city on the weekend I guess this is to be expected.I didn’t use the lobby bar as it seemed occupied with an event, but there were other good options nearby.  Thankfully the rest of my short stay was uneventful, I’ll give them break and give them 4 stars as maybe they were having an off day.  The club lounge cookies saved them from 3 stars.  I have stayed at the Four Seasons in Denver 5 times for conferences and they always provide a consistent personalized service that I thought this property lacked.  However this was a far better value, and for the rate was a solid hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Delightful Surprise - comfort, service and delicious food","Just had a great stay at the Grand Hyatt for a family event - and have to say I would not hesitate to chose it over the Four Seasons or the Art Hotel for my next trip.  The room had lots of small details that made it super comfortable for a multi-day stay:  most notably, motion sensor lighting that makes is easy to get up in the night without turning on all the lights (the small ones that light up are near the floor).    Blackout blinds and electronic controls are also a luxury detail.  But the real winner for me was the food.  Room service was reasonably priced and the options were delicious and healthy.  Being a gluten-free person, it made a big difference that every person that helped with food at some point understood food allergies and was well-prepared.  Added bonus: there is a starbucks just outside the valet area, and room service will add your custom Starbucks order to your delivery:)",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Valentine's trip,"From the time we stepped until we left we were treat exceptionally by the staff. Great food, clean spacious rooms, great locatoon in Downtown close to shopping and restaurants. Webt to a show and was able to walk right back on an amazing evening! Definitely a treat!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Clean room, good location!","Stayed here for a conference. It was conveniently located and had good eating options within walking distance. And blustery cold days, they had hot apple cider which was much appreciated! Starbucks right next to building.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Such a beautiful quiet hotel!,I was here on business and loved we could walk to great restaurants. The hotel staff was great and accommodating. The meeting spaces and lunch were lovely. I especially love the motion sensor lighting for middle of the night bathroom visits. Very quiet and clean. Also the makeup light was a nice touch!,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Great venue,Centrally located.  Great service. Live music in the lobby. Could use a restaurant on site instead of in the lobby. Rooms were clean and bed was comfortable. Will definitely stay here again when we visit Denver.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Modern Luxury in Great Location,"We really enjoyed our impromptu stay. The hotel is modern and inviting. The room was very beautiful and had really nice touches that made our stay enjoyable. The location was excellent - well within walking distance of nightlife, restaurants and shopping.  Quick tip: there is $5 parking across the street, and we could see our car from the room. A better option for us when compared to the hotel valet for $40 a night.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Get the park and perk!,"Stayed at Denver Grand Hyatt.  Awesome location. Across the street from Avis and 16 street Mall. Got the park and perk. Valet free ! 1/2 off at starbucks! Saved me a bunch of money. Fed a family of four for $10 every morning, Starbucks triple expresso macchiato, etc. Valet service was awesome. Entertainment in lobby every night. Price was perfect too!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Watch out for false parking charges!,Erroneously charged for parking. No replies to 2 emails. Took 2 calls to fix. Will choose elsewhere in the future when  in Denver. Hotel is otherwise fine.  It cannot recommend given suspicious charge and seeming unwillingness to fix.,3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,We always stay at the Hyatt!,I meet my sisters for a downtown Denver experience a couple times a year and we always stay at the Hyatt.  Great customer service.  The bar at the top of the tower gives one a great view of the city.  Service is great and food delicious.  Location is everything since one can hop on public transportation and travel for free in the downtown area.  The beds and bedding are wonderful. Valet service was very nice and attentive to our needs.,5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Excellent weekend venue in Denver!,"Nick in the club lounge was outstanding!  His attentiveness to our restrictive GF/DF diet was consistently amazing.  He remembered us from day to day, and even had special appetizers prepared for us.  The morning club staff were also very responsive and considerate.Overall, the staff was attentive and above par with what we've come to expect from Grand Hyatt, easily surpassing our experiences at other luxury hotels.  Special thanks to Teresa C. for her pre-arrival assistance.Overall, we are very pleased (again) with the Grand Hyatt, and happy to recommend it to anyone.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"Good location, nice hotel","I liked their automated messages that allowed me to check in via email as well as contact a team member personally if anything was needed. Staff is very friendly. Rooms are generic but very comfortable. If it matters to you, windows can be open. Location is great, very close to pedestrian zone and convention center. However, I am I do miss little things like shoe horn or the full mini-bar and daily supplies of vanity kits. They overcharge for water ($5 per bottle) unless you are a superior club member. I personally think that if someone is paying on average $200 per room, at least what you can do is provide a free bottle of water.",4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Best of Denver,"I live in Aspen and have been visiting Denver since 1996. I definitely have had loyalties to several hotels in town, until a few years ago when I found the Grand Hyatt. From Zack the bellman to Jim the manager everyone here tries to make it the best stay ever. When I check in by myself for business there is always someone around to help with anything I need. When I check in with my family they send cookies and milk for the kids. This isn’t your average hotel experience. Location, service, price. This place has it all.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Not what you expect from Grand Hyatt? Or is it,Generic rooms are comfortable and well presented.  We were on the club floor but had to be down graded to a lower floor as we wanted a room with a bath.  We were staying for a few days mid week.Returned at 2.30pm to find room had not been services despite a polite hello to the housekeeping in the next room when we left at 9.00 amThe club lounge doesn’t serve alcohol until 5 pm and the small bar doesn’t open until 4.00 so we were unable to get a wine or beer at 2.30There was no restaurant as it was closed for renovation for a few months so no where to get any food - we were not told this prior to arrival.We did get a couple of margueritas in the small bar at 6.00pm but they were expensive and served with a load of ice in a water  glass!!  I should not have accepted it but any port in a storm.For these negative points I only can give it 3 stars at most.,3
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,The best around!,"We love the grand Hyatt. The staff is amazing, the hotel is clean and well kept, and the restaurant and room service are great. All around amazing. We came down for my son’s birthday and they put cupcakes in our room for him, along with a big glass of milk. We love their attention to detail, how friendly and helpful the staff is, the downtown location, everything. Nothing bad to say about this place!!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Lovely Stay,"This hotel is in the perfect location, and staff made my check in extremely easy. You can walk to the 16th street mall or the capital with ease. The room was very clean and the view was great! I would definitely consider staying here again.",5

"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Made my solo business trip an enjoyable one,"This hotel is in a great location, walking distance from the 16th St. Mall. The staff are all very friendly and attentive. The gym and pool facilities are excellent. There is also a welcoming and nice atmosphere at the hotel bar in the evening and I enjoyed an evening of live music during my stay. I loved it. I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Housekeeping Fail,This was a wonderful hotel. The check-in was super fast. Loved it. The room was beautiful and modern. I liked the night lights that automatically came on when I got up during the night.The only issue was the housekeeping. I left the room at noon and asked the front desk to have housekeeping do my room. It never happened. And when sleeping in they were very noisy in the next room. They should notice the “do no disturb” signs on the door and try and keep it down.,4
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,"A great place, excellent service, nice rooms and convenient to downtown.","This is not a five-star hotel, but it was a great place to stay and doesn't charge five-star prices!  The lobby is comfortable - nice decor, but relaxed.  The service - check-in, bar, and bell persons - was great.  Rooms are large and were cleaned nicely every day.  We asked for a humidifier and were promptly brought one already filled up!  Gym and pool are nice. There is an outdoor track and a tennis court.  (We didn't play because we were there in February, but it looked nice.)  We had snacks in the bar one night and they were pretty good too and they had some great live music. Easy walk to downtown.  All around great experience!",5

The rooms were good sized with a great view of the mountains and downtown.  The beds were so nice I wanted to take it home with me!  From our business meetings, to the restaurants, every person I encountered was happy to help in any way needed.  I don't think I ever saw a single employee not smiling!  A quick walk to most places down town which is great.  I don't think most Gyms in my hometown are as nice as the one in this hotel. You will not be disappointed!",5
"Denver, CO",Grand Hyatt Denver Downtown,Favorite Denver hotel,"Always consistent with great service and rooms.  I don’t have the best luck at Hyatt’s even with Globalist status usually getting rooms that are subpar, but not here.  Location is a bit out of the way, but walkable to most locations.",5
