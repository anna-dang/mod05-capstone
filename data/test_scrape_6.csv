"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,great hotel but no airport transportation,I always enjoy staying here when I have to go to the airport. The shuttle is very convenient and should still be offered for guest considering its offered online. I may not be staying here much anymore since the airport in our town is starting flights again. Thank you BWPDIA,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Layover before heading to the mountains,"Our flight to Denver was a late arrival and this Best Western Plus provided a great night rest before we headed west into the mountains.  Located an easy drive from DIA, this hotel was clean and well taken care of inside and outside.   Each staff member we encountered demonstrated welcoming customer service, and helped make check-in/check-out effortless.   Our double-queen room was clean, comfortable and priced appropriately  at just shy of $100. With many hotel choices near DIA, Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites is a trusted choice.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Avoid this pot stench hotel,"Upon arrival, the gut-wrenching stink of pot greets you. The carpet has a liberal sprinkling of pot stems and leaf bits. The stink in the elevator made the short trip to the 3rd floor quite ugly. The hotel must be saving on bathroom paper costs, as the hotel put a near empty roll of toilet paper in my bathroom. one pee and one nose blowing used up all the t-paper and tissue. The hotel no longer has airport shuttle service, but front desk hands you a card of a guy who will shuttle you to the airport for $35. The front desk points out the bargain as other services charged $50-70 for the short trip. Lyft charged me almost $14. Skip the sugar-loaded ""breakfast"". Usually Best Western is a decent place to stay for a few nights. Not this best western. Pay a bit more for a clean room, no pot stench, and enough toilet paper for a 12 hour stop. Avoid this best wrstern.… no pot stench, and enough toilet paper for a 12 hour stop. Avoid this best wrstern.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Never again,"Checked in and was told pool was closed and no airport shuttle was running.  Fire alarm went off at 2:00am and called the front desk three times and no one answered.  They couldn't get it shut off and it was just a terrible experience. Should have got discounted rate.  Shower was clogged. If I were you, I'd pay extra to stay elsewhere.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent location near airport,I chose this hotel for the location near the airport. It was an easy drive before a morning flight. With covid breakfast is a take away option but the muffin was absolutely fabulous. There is tea and coffee in the lobby. The carpet and shower were a little outdated but for an airport hotel the price is consistent with the quality. A child was running around the halls at night keeping us up. After a call to the front desk the running stopped.,4

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Poor Customer Service, but Nice Hotel","Upon check in, the gentleman at the front desk couldn't be bothered to take his headphones out and help us. Was rude to his partner on the same shift right in front of us while training him. Ended up getting our reservation wrong. Only checking us in for 1 night when i had booked 4. Was on the way back to the hotel and received a call about this from the woman working. Throughout the stay the staff was very unprofessional making my vacation not enjoyable at all. The actual hotel was nice and clean, was given a completely new bed on our second day which was nice. Good breakfast, nice pool and hot tub. Overall happy with the hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Surprise surprise surprise,Waiting for a flight and in the mood for a burger. Smash burger has a good reputation so we went in. Burger was really good as were the fries but the reason I am reviewing a burger place is the staff. Beyond friendly and helpful. Could have hung out with them as friends. Had a great time in an airport !!!!!!!!,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Hotel,This hotel is located in a great area if you're needing the airport. The hotel has a shuttle that can get you to the airport in about 10 minutes.the only downside of that is it stops at another hotel next door to pick up other guest and that might cut into your time getting to the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Business review,"Very nice place. Staff are all friendly and grounds are clean. Rooms are comfortable and large. All the amenities you need, tv, fridge, micro, safe, large screen flat tv, iron n board, desk lounge chair, bed very comfortable and clean. Breakfast was nice. Large buffet with eggs, bacon, sausage,  gravy n biscuits,  bread n toast, cereal,  yogurt, coffee n tea etc. Place was quiet at night.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Great property for groups, business or leisure travelers!","This property went out of their way to accomodate our 9 rooms (25 travelers) last minute.  The Director of Sales, Renee, made sure that check-in went smoothly and vans were arranged for our very early airport depature.  Since it was too early for breakfast they even packed ""to go"" bags for the travelers.  The front desk staff was professional and prepared.  I will definitely be using this property for groups and leisure clients in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Location, location, location","This is a convenient choice if you are flying in / out of Denver International Airport with some nice perks that set it apart from other hotels in the area, such as a pool & hot tub. The shuttle bus was reliable, the free breakfast good, and the staff welcoming. There are some good restaurants within a short drive or +/- 10 minute walk - including fun Italian and Mexican options. The pool and hot tub are open 24 hours. Our studio was spacious and clean.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice stay with a free shuttle to and from the airport!,"We just stayed a night between flights and it was very convenient and friendly staff! The shuttle was very easy to find and we just asked the receptionist to book us a spot the next morning and it was no problem. The complimentary breakfast had biscuits and gravy which was delicious, but otherwise it was an average breakfast buffet with waffles, cereal selections, eggs and bacon, and granola and yogurt. The staff was pretty casual but no complaints! They were really friendly and gave us great recommendations restaurants nearby. The hotel location was great for just an overnight stay because it was near a variety of restaurants and a 7-11, all walking distance. No complaints about the room, it was nice and clean with a comfy bed.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good enough hotel,"Good hotel, beds are confortable, but old. Needs to be revempt. Carpets everywhere. Definetly the bathroom are obsolete, needs some upgrades there. Morning breakfast is continental, good enough with some fruits, cereals, yogurts, powder eggs, etc...Enjoy!",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Business visit,Hotel is very close to the airport and offers shuttle services. Staff very pleasant. The rooms are average and good for a quick overnight stay. Very close to shopping and restaurants only a few miles.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,DENVER,Great staff and hotel is very nice  Shuttle service was also great. I really appreciated the freindlyness of the front desk  they all go out of their way to be nice and very helpful.  You dont find that to often    Thanks,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Airport Pickup,"I stayed the night here so I was close to pick up friends at the airport. I was very impressed... the tv didn’t work very well, the coffee maker in the room was broken and the toilet had a really hard time flushing and I mean it didn’t flush. I stay at Best Westerns all over the place and this one was lacking.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Stay in one of the other close hotels!,"We booked two rooms for family of 5.  Left wake up call for both rooms for 4:00 am shuttle.  Neither room got the wake up call.  Luckily, one of us woke up.  Both rooms had cold showers.  Told front desk agent upon check out (1/4/20 at 4:00 am) and she didn’t even say sorry just said “something must be broke”.  Brilliant.  At checkin I asked for restaurant options close by and a place to wash the rental car and the guy checking us in said “lots of restaurants and probably a car wash somewhere close by”.  Again, brilliant.  Hire better, manage better and perform maintenance on your hotel.  Tons of hotel surround this hotel, pick one of those.  We will on our next trip through.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Value,"Everything I look for in a hotel..... Easy access to interstate or airport, easy check in and out, clean room with no unpleasant odors, safe location, great breakfast included, friendly staff.  And to top it off, very good price.  I would return next time I an in the area.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Inefficient,"We weren't allowed to request a shuttle until we checked in and then there was no shuttle available at the time we needed.  When we asked for a crib, we were told ""we'll check on that""...a simple yes or no would've worked.  Had it not been late at night when received this information, we would've found somewhere else to stay!",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great place lousy service,It’s a great place with the pool is working and the staff isn’t being lazy. Pay with cash if u need anything from their little shop there and watch the charges on ur account. The internet was down but I won’t complain it’s not their fault cause so one hit a big box in the area with their at knocking out all the internet and tv for blocks and blocks ..... but u can win them all 😃,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good airport hotel,Very nice. Started and ended with an efficient shuttle service. Room was comfortable and breakfast was outstanding. Need to fix a few things in the workout room. All else was very good. This is a good choice for an overnight stay at Denver Airport.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Yet another awesome stay,Yet another awesome stay with this fabulous hotel.  The price is amazing as always and the staff and the cleanliness is so amazing.  The staff is always right on top of everything and the breakfast they sever is always nice and hot and always plentiful on the items they have to offer.  The only thing I could suggest is to also offer sausage along with bacon as the bacon is always crispy and I can't have anything crispy.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Has Best Western changed pillows recently?,I stayed at two different Best Westerns this past weekend in different cities and the 3 people in my party all thought the pillows were very hard  to sleep with. We all had neck aches and slept horribly!,1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice hotel close to the airport,"I stayed one night and used the shuttle at 4:00am to get to my flight at the airport.  Shuttle reservation was easy and it left on time from the hotel and went directly to the airport.  Sometimes the shuttle bus covers several hotels, however, this one is exclusive to the Best Western.  The hotel was quiet.  No exterior noise.  I will use this hotel again if I have an early morning flight.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not quite up to the level of a Best Western Plus,"The location of this hotel is relatively convenient to Denver International Airport (DIA). We arrived after midnight to a sign accompanied by a radio at the front desk that said to call and someone would eventually come to check us in. Parking was nearly full mid-week of a non-holiday week.  The hotel rooms were well appointed feature-wise, but seemed more dated than we thought could be expected given the age of DIA. At 7 a.m. the hotel was out of milk(!), so cereal was out of the question. They did provide a nice coffee selection.  Overall our impression was that this hotel was not at the level of other Best Western Plus hotels where we have stayed before. We will look around some at other properties the next time we stay near DIA.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Fraudulently Charges Customers ,Working with this hotel has been one of my worst customer service experiences (and I've spent 90min on the phone with Comcast before so the bar is high). I stayed here in November and noticed shortly after that there was an additional charge to my card that I couldn't account for. I have since called multiple times and spoke to multiple people but the charge is still on my account despite multiple promises to reverse it. When I finally spoke to a manager about this she took no responsibility for the error and in fact blamed me for not reaching out to a manager sooner. Apparently I had been in the wrong to assume that I could trust the employees she manages and trains to appropriately refund charges when they fraudulently collect money from customers. Not only would I not…,1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very Nice and Comfortable!,"Our room was had a king-sized bed, a sleeper-sofa, and was very nice and spacious. The breakfast had a variety of items, all of which were fresh and delicious. The location is good. We would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Needs new beds!,"Replace the beds!  Our room had old, ripped carpet in it!  Check-in staff was good. Breakfast was regular Best Western Fare. Parking lot was fairly small to accommodate many cars. Several cars had snow on them like they hadn't been moved in days.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Most convenient,"Helpful, friendly and welcoming  staff at the front desk as well as in the hallways and breakfast area. A very nice and quiet stay in extreme weather conditions while traveling solo.  I would stay here again anytime.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,not what was advertised,"outdated handicap room. not user friendly.  VERY POOR interior lighting.  room 106 is very noisy all night long, very disappointed.   TV is old style with very difficult remote control.   No lighting in the coffee makeing area !!!!!   Very weired that their is no sink in the bathroom.  It's outside the bathroom, very awkard.  Hope this helps handicap people.   If having an early flight like before 6 am, there is not breakfast avaiable   :-(",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western Denver International Airport,"Excellent lodgings. Super friendly staff, great breakfast. Super comfy beds.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,My Mother always told me.......,"My Mother always told me that f you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Well, I am almost there.I  have to say the clerk in the morning was very nice. But beyond that, hhhhmmmm. I would recommend looking elsewhere for lodging in the area.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Coffee making machine out of order,Woke up jet lagged in night and decided to make a decadent coffee. Items needed were there but filter basket missing so no coffee.Rang reception and eventually got some coffee thanks to the night clerk but should not happen if room checked properly.The room wasn’t cheap so disappointing.Shuttle from hotel ok but shuttle from airport hit and miss. Breakfast ok but not enough tables available.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,I would stay again,"I understand that each property is independent to some extent. I am a Diamond member and used reward points for this stay. I understand that I didn't exactly pay for this stay but was kind of surprised that I wasn't offered at least a goodie bag on check-in. At a previous stay in Sacramento, I was given a goodie bag AND points even though I paid with points. Again, it is the policy here then I accept that. I returned to the desk and asked the receptionist about that and she said the only goodie bag she had were the free cookies on the desk. She was NOT unpleasant. Lastly, I was shocked that the charge for a soda and a bag of chips was $6.00! I should have left and gone to the convenience store next door. Otherwise, the stay was very nice. Nice large room and quiet. The…",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Much better options at similar price,"With all the new properties going up in this area, there are much better options at a similar price point. I have stayed at a lot of Best Westerns and this one is way down the list. I will say this the staff was super friendly and the bed was comfortable but the rest of the room was I bad shape. Also very concerning was the back door on the north side of the building was not closing...anybody could just walk right into the property. I didnt feel safe especially at night when there are people walking around the area.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Just a night before we fly out,"Hot soothing hot tub with good foot jets but rest not working. Pool clean but seemed a bit chilly so didn't swim. Front desk support was very nice, hubby loved cookies. Left too early for bkft. Bed and room comfortable. Would return. ",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very nice stay,"We arrived about 1 am and the hotel clerk was very helpful and got us checked in quickly.  They have a lot of parking and we found several empty spaces in the back even at that hour.  The room was very clean and comfortable, very nicely decorated.  Breakfast was pretty standard for Best Western: scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, fruit, pastry, yogurt, toast, etc.  Check out was very easy.  We would stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Outdated and dirty hotel,"The hotel is convenient to the airport, but the rooms and hotel are outdated and dirty.  The elevator was dirty and the smoked smell in it was almost too much to handle.   The hallways smell like pot.   The room was dirty and stains on the walls and in the bathroom shower were extreme.   ",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent Value,Friendly helpful staff.  Clean and appealing lobby and rooms.  Swimming and exercise options.  Plus full breakfast and shuttle service to the airport every one-half hour.  Worth the money for a short pre or post flight stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Booking was cancelled by hotel,"Weeks after securing this booking I made an enquiry about the fee for cancelling the booking. Within minutes I emailed them again and asked them to keep the booking for me and explained that I still wanted to keep the booking. They confirmed that they'd hold my reservation. However, 24 hours later my room was cancelled by Best Western. I emailed several times to enquire about the cancellation and attempted to rebook, however, they did not respond to any of my emails or messages. The room I required sold out almost instantly. I've rebooked with their competitor.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Average,"Not much of a handi-cap room. Very small. If you have a wheelchair, it is impossible to move around in the room. Also, they don't have many rooms on the first floor. There are more scattered around in the higher floors.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good Value and Convenient Location,"We arrived on a late flight and checked in after midnight.  Check-in was fast.  Our room was quiet and the bed was comfortable.  Breakfast was typical with hot and cold items.  We stayed 2 nights.  Should we need to be close to DIA, we would certainly stay here again.  Very convenient location.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great as always!,I stay here alot when I travel. Its always a great stay.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,necessary stay before flight,"try to avoid staying at Denver ""airport"" hotels when not driving yourself (a few km away from airport) You stay in a ghost town with few restaurants (Holiday has one with a record TV monitors in it and heavy metal music wanting you to leave as soon as possible; average food and expensive!",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Practical Place for a Sleep and Park Place,We are actually here for the second time though we have stayed at some of the neighbors as well. BW just offered the best price. Room was clean and comfy. We were given breakfast bags since we had to leave on the shuttle before the normal complimentary breakfast began. Shuttle has always been on time. Places like this that work like clockwork are highly regarded by frequent travelers like us. ,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Very nice, spacious rooms","Stayed here while flying out of DIA.  We had a king bed room, it was spacious and comfortable.  The front desk staff is not that great, kind of aloof and not particularly interested in being helpful.  The breakfast was good, the eggs were not rubbery.  The room was a little noisy, mainly because of the family above us with young kids that liked to run around the room until 11:00 pm.  I would not stay here again, would try a different hotel in this area.  The maintenace is a little lacking, spiderwebs in the room.  Haven't seen that before.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Overnight stay,"Maintenance man needs to check some fittings in rooms.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A very nice place with a good breakfast - but make sure you are in the right place at the airport to be picked up by van,"Nice place, good breakfast, a 7-11 right near by.

The front desk staff was very nice and the king bed was quite comfortable.  ",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Do not stay here for the shuttle or comfort,"Broken window screen, broken lock on window. Shuttle driver that worked 8/10 @5:30 am was very rude even though I signed up for airport shuttle.For $175 I would not stay here again. Save the $ and Uber or find a better hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Serious noise issues,"Stayed here for one night due to a late arriving flight.  The building looked pretty standard inside and out, checkin was quick - except for the huge problems with the first two rooms we were assigned - 303 and 206.  Both had STARTLINGLY loud and strange noises.  303 had booming and rattling - like the inside a machine - which you could also hear in the entire hallway (so all the nearby rooms probably noisy as well - not sure if any were occupied).  Had to change rooms - no way anyone could sleep with that racket. But the replacement, 206, turned out to have a non stop high pitched whine (It's above the laundry room but not sure if that's the reason).  At that point I was ready to give up and go to another hotel even though it was already past 1 am in the morning.  But finally the third room, 342, in a different part of the building was quiet - it was like a miracle.  Room decor here is basic and dated, without style. Bed comfortable enough although pillows too bouncy.  No sheers on the window (while the 2 previous rooms did). The forced aircon unit under the window blew right into the curtains when they were closed so they fluttered like sails in high wind all night long. I always thought that Best Westerns as motels go are not low end but I'd never encountered such serious noise issues anywhere else before.  One other problem for arriving late was we almost couldn't find a parking space.  While staff were helpful in making the room changes it's hard to believe they didn't know about the noise problems in the first place - these are not the kind of noises ANYONE can ignore.  Breakfast had hot dishes - scrambled eggs, fried potatoes cubes and bacon - so that's a plus.  Relative to the rooms, breakfast was surprisingly not bad - everything tasted like real food, bacon was crispy, eggs quite solid - not puffy like sponge, and potatoes tasty.  The breakfast room a bit small so at peak time - around 8 - you might have to wait for a table or take food back to your room.No bottled water in the room although we saw big packs of them at reception which were handed out to some guests but not all so not sure what the deal was with that.  The 2 star rating is an average of 3 for the last room we had and breakfast, and 1 for the first two rooms.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Helpful staff went the extra mile!,"As we were about to board our flight, we discovered that we had left an important medical device in the room. The front desk person, Ruby, went right away and retrieved it for us, and the manager, Samantha, carefully packaged it up so that UPS could just come and collect it. This kind of customer service is exceptional!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A place to put my head,First of all there is absolutely no signage on Tower Road for this hotel.  Second the front desk people need to look and act more professionalThis hotel leaves a lot to be desired.  I had a very early flight and just needed a place to sleep for a few hours.  I will say it is quiet though.  Seemed to be fairly busy.  We are still not sure but when I reserved 2 rooms they were in my name.  One for me and one for my co-worker.  When we checked in they could not split out the rooms and ended up switching us around.  Not sure.  The wake up call went to the wrong room and woke up my co-worker at 3AM.  She was not thrilled.  Which meant that my room did not get a call.  Glad I had my phone set for back up.  The shuttle though was not a fiasco as I had feared based on other reviews.  The sink did not drain---well it did but it almost overflowed from just washing my face.  The front desk people do not look or dress professionally at all.  Maybe I am just use to other hotel chains where their employees are more professional.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Airport Shuttle not available,"I booked thru Priceline and relied on their representation that a free Airport Shuttle was available and included in my price paid. Upon arrival the hotel staff told me the shuttle was already all reserved for the next morning and I would have to make other arrangements. I complained to Priceline and their agent says he called the hotel and ""I contacted the hotel and spoke to Amanda from the Front desk they confirmed that they provide free shuttle..."" They didn't provide a free shuttle for me from the hotel to the airport that morning.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Convenient location but poorly designed property,Great location for airport but very poorly designed property.  Very little parking close to lobby entrance.  We had lots of luggage and had to park in the rear. The only access to the rear parking lot is literally through the pool area and down a set of steps. Pool was way cold and the hot tub smelled like a urinal. ,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,This hotel is not on par with the BW brand,"Stayed in room 105 overnight on Jul 17, 2019.  Room emitted a stale mildew odor, with the strongest scent coming from the bathroom.  Upon entering the bathroom, it was discovered that the bathtub had mole growth around the fixtures, and it started to grow on the bath walls.  My impression of management in up keeping of this facility was not on par with the High Standards of the BW brand.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western Tower Road,I wanted a place close to where I was working and this was the closest one. I think the rooms rate was a little high for the room. Everone I talked to where nice and like the breakfast. There are a few places to eat close you can walk to. The parking is a little tight I would stay again.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Not Best Western Plus standards, but it tries","Had an o'dark thirty flight so decided to stay here for the night. Hotel is a bit hard to find, parking is terrible, pool and spa closed, room was ok...not 100% clean but not dirty either. With all the hotels in the area you can find better, but for a few hours it isn't bad.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Stay somewhere else - dirty fitness room not cleaned for at least 3 days,"Dirty fitness room not cleaned for 3 days during my stay and it was gross.   Background: Stayed 3 days 2 nights at Denver Airport Best Western Plus on business while I attended a conference nearby.   Good and adequate items: Free breakfast was quite good. The person serving in the breakfast room was very nice and accommodating. Front desk personnel were friendly and tried to be helpful. Shuttle to and from the airport useful and hotel is convenient to airport. Room was adequate although bed was a bit too hard for my taste. WiFi was easy and fast.   Problem with fitness room: I used the fitness room 3 times during my stay. It contained a treadmill, an elliptical machine, a recumbant bike, a weight machine and a water cooler. As I was about to use it on day 1, I  noticed some used…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Just right,"We stayed here on a rainy night, headed out to the airport in the morning.  The place is very nice, it’s clean and comfortable, the staff does a good job. The rooms are adequate, and quiet so we had a good nights sleep. The in house breakfast is all we needed.  We’ve stayed here before and will stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not a BW Plus,"I estimate that this hotel barely made it into the Best Western class and should not have made it to BW Plus.  I have stayed at BW Plus in the past and was impressed.  This hotel's rooms were small w/ no double sink and poorly maintained.  The toilet was not attached to the floor, so moved every time I sat on it!  There was an oval toilet seat on the round toilet!  The breakfast was mediocre.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good enough hotel for an overnight stay ,"We stayed at this hotel with our two young children at the end of our vacation. I was concerned when I saw the outside of the hotel because it looks older than all of the other hotels in the area. The inside of the hotel, however, looks much better (modern) and has been updated to some degree. Our room (king suite) was pretty big and efficient with a much-appreciated dividing half-wall between our bed and the kids' bed (sofa bed). The room was spacious and the beds were comfortable enough. The breakfast buffet was also pretty good, although everything was depleted by 9:45am. Get there early if you want more food options. The housecleaners were very nice and also went out of their way to get our kids' sofa bed setup despite the front desk saying that they were out of pillows. I recommend checking in as early as possible during the high tourist season since they were very busy and running out of things by our checkin at 4pm.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very average,"Lovely friendly welcome. Nice sized rooms although a little dated as with all the BW's I've stayed at. There's the lingering smell of smoke in places too. NB for manager baths need to be retreated for non slip, they're very slippy. Breakfast area is far to small and single use plastic cutlery is disgraceful these days.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Perfectly good for business,"This was my second time staying at this hotel when traveling for business.  The hotel is ok, food was good, location is good, internet was excellent.  The TV takes forever to change channels, the toilet needed two flushes every time as there was something wrong with it (I didn't bother complaining as it always worked on the second flush!), and there was hair in the shower and mini-fridge.  I did not use the pool or hot tub during my stay.  A/C worked quite well and was needed as it was hot the week of my visit.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Stay near airport,"The room was filthy, there was hair in the tub and and on the floor.  The rugs were not vacuumed (you could see the dust). The floor was sticky. It smelled musty and unclean.  We arrived very late with family in tow and it  was not until after that we noticed the place wasn't clean. There were no sheets for the fold out and we had to call twice to get them.   Asked for a pillow, and was told there were no more pillows, but they did find one. No sink in bathroom, but there were two (2) in the hall.  One across from the bathroom and one about 2 feet down.   The coffeepot was there.    On the plus side, the shuttle was prompt to the airport.  The sheets and the beds seemed to be clean, as well as I could see when I checked them in the poor lighting.",1

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Smoky room,"I had a handicapped room on the 2nd floor.  I noticed that my room started to smell of cigarette smoke.  I discovered, after a lot of searching, that my room was above the outside smoking area at the front entrance.  I called the front desk to complain and they stated they would ask the smokers to move.  Later, not only did no one move, there were more smokers.  I complained again with no results.  I turned off my vent and tried to sleep, but could hear every conversation going on from the sidewalk smokers.  I finally fell asleep and later awakened by the warm temperature of the room.  At that time, I tried to turn on the air conditioning to find out, it had somehow been disabled.    The unit was on, and the fan worked, without benefit of any cooling or venting.  I am…",1

The shuttle service is free and picks up at Island 3 on the west side of the airport. It will run 24 hours a day and every 30 minutes at the slow time. I actually shuttled to the airport to take the train downtown. Too far to walk to the next station about 2 miles away.Breakfast was very busy, lots of families so tight for a seat.I did walk over to Vince’s and  Tower for dinner, take tower, better food mix and great staff.",4

Lack of decent signs in terminal which isn’t hotel’s fault. Their confirmation should indicate this information. Room was okay but I followed signs to ice machine on floor 2 only to find there was NONE. When I Asked the slovenly desk clerk ( with the personality of a potato) she grunted that the ice machine is on floor 3. Question: why have signs pointing to a nonexistent ice machine?

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice place,Everything was as expected with a friendly front desk staff.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Did not credit advertised ""free night""","I stayed at this hotel twice in early March - Best Western was advertising a free night with 2 stays.  I never received that free night -- Best Western customer service blamed the hotel for not putting it into the system right either stay.  Have spent multiple times on the phone with 4 different customer service agents, and it is still wrong -- all because (they all insist) this hotel didn't know what they were doing.The hotel was under renovation when I was there, which was inconvenient but needed to be done and I'm sure will improve the hotel.  Outside of multiple people at check in apparently botching the BW rewards program, it was fine.I am a gold member in BW's rewards program, stay at BW's all the time, but this whole experience has left a very very bad taste in my mouth.",1

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Clean, friendly and convenient",We had an 11 hour layover and were exhausted. We thought we were going to go see the city but decided that rest would be so much better. This was basically a same day reservation. They allowed us to check in at 7:30 am and we stayed until 3pm. Got some great breakfast and wonderful sleep and took the shuttle to the airport. It all worked out great.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,It’s ok,Stayed here for a night while on business. I was looking for a hotel close to the airport. This one works for that but there are a bunch of other hotels right in this same area that I’ll probably choose from next time. This hotel was fine. A little dark and could stand to be updated. It’s also a little hard to find as it sits behind some of the others. Suitable for a night but I don’t think it’s worth the price you pay.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great stay for family,This hotel was great for a family of 5. We had enough space for us and our luggage. The beds were comfy.

Check in was done quickly and efficiently. The drinks vending machine was half empty, with there being NO water whatsoever.  I asked at reception if they had any water available and was told there was not.  At breakfast the following morning, I asked the staff serving breakfast if there was any water and was given two bottles!  How is it there is water available at breakfast, but none in the vending machine?  There was also a broken vacuum cleaner left in the hallway over night, and the swimming pool was closed.",3

Many of the fixtures could use an update, but for a night before a flight it’s fine. Our first floor window would not lock, so I felt a bit insecure. There was transport to the airport, but we did not use it. DIA is WAY outside of town, so location of hotel way away from everything except a few restaurants and a gas station. Great front desk staff!",4

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Saved us in a pinch with 6 kids!,"I don't normally write reviews but Linda and Sabrina at this hotel went above and so far beyond for my family. We were flying to Orlando with our 6 children and were stranded at the Denver airport due to inclement weather in Washington State. We missed our connection. Our children are aged 14years down to 3 months old. Needless to say, we were exhausted, frustrated, and worried about where we were going to stay with all of our kids at the last minute WITHOUT LUGGAGE. I was near tears and the kids were so disappointed we would be late to meet Mickey. I called Linda and she immediately arranged a shuttle to pick us up to bring us to the hotel. When we got there, she had all the essentials waiting for us, brought in extra pillows and blankets, made sure all of our kids were fed. She completely took care of us. We are so very grateful for the kindness we were shown in such a stressful situation. Before we left that next early morning, she even had little breakfast packages waiting for us downstairs even though she wasn't working that morning. I would say amazing service but that doesn't express how thankful we are. Amazing people taking care of people. Thank you Linda and Sabrina, we made it to Disney and the kids had the time of their lives!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great place and location,"It was my first time staying at this Best western, but everything was great and the room was very nice.

So, I looked for the easiest and most reliable hotel in the area with the help of Expedia. Very friendly staff and room was clean and tidy, and rather huge. I was glad to arrive after a long trip of over 18hrs and gutted at losing my connection. Breakfast was Ok! Nice shuttle service to the airport in the morning, can't thank them enough for looking after me in an emergency situation and at a relatively cheap price.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Outstanding,"I stayed here only for 1 night on 16 February and was really surprised with the offered comfort. From check in to check out all was perfect. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. At check in I was provided with a complimentary bag containing 2 bottles of water and some cereal bars. I found another same bag in my room. Not sure if this is standard. I was maybe just lucky? The room was very clean and the bed comfortable. Coffee/tea also complimentary as well as the convenience of a microwave and spacious refrigerator. The complimentary breakfast buffet was outstanding. Several hot items like scrambled eggs, turkey sausage patties, hot waffles, biscuits with gravy. Free coffee, tea, hot chocolate all day. The complete service, including free parking, makes me considering to choose Best Western Plus more often in the future rather than the 4/5 star hotels such as Hilton and Sheraton at airports which are often overpriced.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice value for the money,"After a canceled flight and a very stressful time at the airport, it was so nice to arrive at the hotel to be greeted by a very friendly and helpful receptionist. The breakfast was good. The room is a bit noisy and you can here people slamming their doors all night. But overall, it was a convenient and nice. Tip- the airport shuttle only picks up on the 15 and 45 so plan accordingly",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,All was clean except...,"Nice place to stay that’s close to the airport. The guy up front clearly doesn’t love his job and preferred to be on his cell phone instead of working. My room was clean except the bathroom. Luckily, I always wipe down my rooms before settling in but the shower walls were definitely not wiped down. There was soap scum on the walls. The fridge wasn’t very clean either. Other than those two things, it was fine.",3

We have stayed there before and always were very satisfied with the staff and rooms.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Convenient,"The location of the hotel is convenient to the airport, since they provide a shuttle. Be sure you allow plenty of time to catch your shuttle to the airport. There is not always seating  and they did run late for pick up. Our room was quite noisy so not a restful night. The pillows are huge and uncomfortable or us. The breakfast was hot, good and many choices. The rooms are a little dated and the air was very hard to control.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great overnight at the airport,"A clean comfortable stay.  King bed was very comfortable, room was spacious for the price.  The airport shuttle runs every half hour - make a reservation at the desk to be sure you have a seat -   only a 10-15 minute ride to the airport.  We stayed here for an early morning flight out.  Returned our rental car the night before to save time, then used the shuttles.  Restaurant in a nearby hotel (TOWER Restaurant) was good and an easy walk.  Breakfast?  We left too early, but there was coffee and yogurt available, and they had 'to go' bags with fruit and granola bars.  Thoughtful!",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"nice room, decent breakfast, everything you'd need for a week stay.","I stayed here for a week during a training at DIA.  The room was clean, with a couple nicks and dents here and there.  The housekeeping staff did a good job, although my room was not serviced on the second to last day.  The breakfast was very good, and the breakfast attendant was very nice and friendly. Good location, nice pool and hot tub, good wi-fi.  The only other complaint I had was the tub faucet annoyingly dripped my whole stay.  Shouldn't maintenance fix that?  Overall a great stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Stay!,"Really enjoyed my stay at this Best Western. The breakfast is really nice for a free continental breakfast, and the front desk staff is friendly. Rooms were clean and nice. My only complaint is that the 3rd floor smelled like marijuanna. Obviously we are in CO, but it was still a no smoking section. However, I understand it might be difficult for the hotel to completely control this. Would recommend if you need a place to stay in Denver",4

Pool is amazing, salt water pool with warm temps during the winter months. Was a great way to relax after being out in the snow. Rooms are comfortable and clean.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Front desk staff AMAZING!,"Our flight was rebooked and we needed a place to stay near DIA. We are a family of four with two young boys.   The woman working the front desk was friendly,  efficient,  and very professional.   I wish I had gotten her name to give her credit.  Our room was clean and comfortable.   Breakfast was good.  Many hot options as well as all the traditional items.   We called for more towels and had them within 10min.  Overall great stay and any time we are flying out of DIA this will be our home.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,What a mistake!,"Had a layover in Denver and thought 6 hours overnight is better spent in hotel than airport.  After this, wish I would have stayed in airport.  Started with the shuttle.  After a little wait, the shuttle arrived.  We walked up to the rear of the shuttle, the driver completely ignored us and loaded everyone’s luggage around and behind us.  We thought perhaps he knew we would be dropped off first and that’s why he intentionally did what he he did.  Nope we were last to drop so he had to load and unload our bags at each stop.  Morning shuttle driver was much nicer.  Also of note no working seat belt on evening shuttle and my daughter got stuck in seat belt on morning shuttle.  Transport shuttle reminds me of second world transportation.    Check was smooth.  Once at our room we…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Airport Hotel,"Above average for an airport hotel.  Very close, clean, comfortable bed, and a decent price.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Hotel location was nice but not impressed with airport shuttle!,The hotel and the staff were great! Some of the things in the room were dated but I was just there for a few hours of asleep before a 6am flight out of Denver.  We opted for the airport shuttle which shuttles from multiple hotels in the area until it is full and then dumped us off on the opposite side of the airport from our gate.  I was less than impressed at 3:30am in the morning  I've used many airport shuttles prior to this and they've always dropped me at my gate it was like this driver was in a rush to get back and pick up more people.  I was disappointed I gave him a tip before I realized my gate was on the other side of the airport.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Clean with attentive staff.   Funishings are dated, but for the price, a comfortable stay","The front desk was very welcoming, and offered a goodie bag of water and snacks (I am a member).    They also called me an hour after checking in, to make sure everything was okay.   The room was very clean, and the bed was comfortable.   There was a desk, microwave, and refrigerator.   Sink area was new.   Bathroom, and bedroom were dated, but clean and well maintained.   For the price, as well as convenience to airport and car return (4 miles), this was a good deal for an airport hotel. I would stay again.",4

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Save your miney,"This hotel is not as its advertised. Their ‘food’ consists of a sketchy breakfast bar ( powdered eggs, etc).

No one answers the phone when you call down to the office.The tv is wonky. It’s not worth it.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Terrible,"Hotel was very disheveled. Elevator was broken. All fire doors were propped open. Bathroom ceiling was peeling into shower. Found toenails on the floor. Closed captioning didn’t work, called maintenance and they couldn’t fix it and said oh well...not good for my wife who is deaf. We waited in the lobby for 3 hours while they tried to find our reservation we made online. This was at 3 am. When they found our reservation they informed us we couldn’t check in until 3 pm or they had to charge us for an extra day.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Excellent, Attentive Staff","This hotel is a BW Plus, so it is nicer than some of the other Best Westerns.

Room was comfortable   Continental Breakfast was pretty standard",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very Convenient,"This was a great place to stay very close to DIA. The rooms were clean, and staff was very welcoming.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Easy Access to Denver International Airport,"The hotel is well located for travelers who needs to be close to the airport. Shuttle services to the airport works very well and also the breakfast is very good. I did not feel safe as there was not a safe in the room to store my belongings. I also found the pillows very small and the sheets were wrinkled (without ironing). The room seems to be a little bit dark, specially at the entrance corridor of the room.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not up to BW Plus standards,"Dirty socks in room. Bathroom not clean. Asked for a quiet room—assigned ground level next to exterior side door and sharing a wall with the fitness room. Fitness room has motion activated lights—that don’t detect movement on the treadmill, so after 10 minutes I ran in the dark. Shuttle service to airport was late, requiring us to use an Uber to avoid being late to our flight. We have stayed in this hotel numerous times over the years and over the last year it seems to be going downhill. ",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western Plus Denver International Airport,he hotel is ideal if your are arriving or leaving the Denver Airport.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Clean, Friendly Staff & Convenient to Airport",This is a nice hotel near the airport.   They have a complimentary airport shuttle.  Nearby restaurants.  The staff was always friendly and helpful.  This was my 2nd time to stay at the Best Western Plus near DIA.  I will definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Affordable but misleading,"We booked this room after doing a search for hotels in the area that have free shuttle service to DIA AND free parking while you are gone. The free shuttle service worked great to and from but the free parking is only for the night you actually stay with them. After that, it is $12 a night which is much more than what the surrounding park and ride services charge.  We were very disappointed that we had to pay an additional $36 to leave our car parked on their property.  Another reason we would rate this hotel stay as average is when we awoke at 3:00 a.m. to catch an early flight, we discovered we were only given two washcloths and two hand towels and nothing more.  My husband had to go down to the front desk to get two bath towels.  This was a first for us. Not the kind of early…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very convenient,Nice clean place to stay near Denver airport. Easy to get to from the ballpark.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Cleanliness was substandard,"The first room we were assigned to was dirty - hairs in the bed - sheet weren't changed, or so it appeared.

The front desk woman was really helpful and very busy, yet was unflappable and professional. Our room was spacious, clean and quiet! We didn’t hear an airplane until we left at 7:00 am. Breakfast offered lots of choices, from hard boiled eggs to waffles with a small omelet in the middle. Enjoyed the pumpkin spice coffee creamer, too! Have to mention the price was fair, too, since we didn’t have reservations!",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Just what was needed,Had a one night stay here when heading to the airport next day and found it very comfortable and easily matched what I expected.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Beautiful views!,"Great hotel, easy to get to many places. We also rented a car and that was a piece of cake, just a long line. Be aware you are in a state that allows marijuana. We were inundated by the smell coming out of a room around the corner. My hubby works for a company where he can/will be let go if there are any foreign substances found. We couldn't open our balcony doors. It was seriously ""smoky"". The hotel itself was really nice though.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,One night in best western,We stayed our last night in Best westerns plus IA INn & suites.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Vehicles are commonly stolen here,"DO NOT STAY HERE. First off, my vehicle was stolen from the parking lot, (They have no security cameras). Then come to find out this is a common occurrence. When I asked for help and information to find out what happened they were extremely rude and not helpful at all. On top of all of this our room was dirty, there was blood on the sheets. Everything was falling apart and they didn't give us any extra blankets. We had reserved to be on a shuttle at 4am. They kicked us off that shuttle saying there was no room, this was the same time we discovered my stolen vehicle. Causing me to miss my flight and spend an additional 3 hours in the lobby trying to solve the problem. Then we reserved to be on the 9am shuttle to the airport. We get on the shuttle and the shuttle guy claims we…",1

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good hotel and service for the price.,We flew in late to the Denver airport and needed a close hotel for a one night stay before leaving the next day for Silverthone.  The customer service was excellent and the room was good but the bed was a little old.  It definitely served our purposes and I would stay there again for the price.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice hotel,As always Best Western hotels provide what you want.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good Location,"This hotel is in a great location for quick and easy access to the airport. There's a shuttle with a regular schedule. The hotel is not fancy, but met all of my basic requirements; including clean and quiet room, breakfast and good service.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worst start to a honeymoon!,"We booked two months ago and arrived at 8:30pm. We were told our room was given away. We were leaving the next morning at 4pm and wanted this solved tonight. Unfortunately, we literally have to wait a week to speak to the manager. I’m so upset with this miscommunication, and really angry they gave our king suite room away. Would not recommend. Your room you pay for is not secure. They gave us a Queen and no discount tonight.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not happy,This hotel was not up tp best western plus hotels.we arrived there before taking our rental car back and ask if we could store our luggage there while we returned the car the girl at the desk said they didn’t do that but said we could leave it in the lobby when we got back to the hotel and in the room on there information sheet of the hotel is SHORT TURM LUGGAGE STORED BUT NOT LONG TURM. We ask about 3 or 4 times when the shuttle would pick us up in the morning all she said was ever 30 minuets when we waited for 45 minuets at the air port to go back to hotel .W ask what time it would be there in the morning again all she would say every 30 minuets would not give us an answer .we ask for a wake up call never came when went down to take shuttle to air port at 20 after 5 am with…,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice Hotel,"Very nice hotel, staff were very friendly and accommodating to us.  Good, hot breakfast each morning.  The location was perfect, very close to Denver International Airport.  The indoor pool was nice as we were able to use it when the weather was bad.  Had a small problem with the shower drain but it was fixed rather quickly.  Room could have been a little cleaner, there was some dirt behind the nightstand and bed, but nothing you could see openly....definitely more clean than my house.  ",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Comfortable stay,"Stayed overnight before flying out of DIA. Bed was comfortable, room was sufficient and breakfast was good. Can't go wrong with waffles and glad to see there were 2 waffle makers rather than only 1. Toilet in bathroom was quite loud when flushed. Staff was helpful and friendly. Definitely recommend.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very good value,"The hotel is very neat.  The breakfast was good.  The shuttle van to the airport was on time.  The staff was friendly.  The pillows were not that comfortable.  I am a Diamond member and they upgraded me upon check-in, which was nice.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Hotel needs an overhaul,"Its a basic hotel and good for the Denver Airport area, but not for tourists that need to go downtown each day - its a long way on the LightRail (while convenient at the airport) each way after doing long tours each day.  Overall, the hotel seems to need an update/refresh.  Customer service seemed lacking and acted like people were a bother - that was my overall impression of Denver itself, so not sure if its just the area or what the issue is.  Key cards didn't work and had to be re-keyed each day.  Housekeeping came very early when most people are just getting up.  Breakfast was good when I was there for it, but there were no places to sit.  Shuttle service is very prompt - make sure you are there early.  In the future, I will probably pay a little more for an updated hotel…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very dissatisfied with housekeeping ,Exceptionally nice reception and check in  but the bathroom was really disgusting. Air vent was filthy and full of dust and obviously had not been cleaned in a long time and a dirty wash cloth was left over the shower head. Also in a room rented for 4 people only 2 towels were provided.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Ragged towel!,"For $215 one should expect better.  Only two bath towels (that's ok) but one was ragged to the point it had strings!  Also, prior guest's piece of clothing left on window ledge behind the sheer curtain.  And a big spider in the bathroom. And the TV takes 3 seconds to change channels...much too slow for any channel surfer.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Fraudulent Manager,The manager of this property also manages the Days Inn next door and I had forgotten my pillow at the Days Inn July 27th I called her several times and she agreed to send my item 2 weeks ago ago. It has yet to arrive and no communication what so ever.,1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Yellowstone Vacation,"We stayed here at the end of our Yellowstone vacation to be near the Denver airport.  Check-in was easy.  The room was very large and clean, which was good to repack for the trip home.  The breakfast was good with eggs and waffles (except two blueberry waffle choices instead of one being plain waffles).  We returned the rental car to the airport the night before flying and they picked us up.  The next morning they took us to the airport, but we were not told that the drop-off would be at the arrival area instead of the departure area (airport rules???).  It was a long and difficult move to the departure area with luggage.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Wow!  Excellent service made this stay even better.,"We were a family of 5, so our room had two queen beds and a sofa bed.  It was clean and large. The mini fridge was very nice to have.  We did use the pool and hot tub and found both to be clean and in good working order.  Once there were no towels at the pool, but we notified the front desk staff and that was rectified.  We also used the shuttle service to get to the airport.  The shuttle picked us up at 3 am and we were at the airport in no time.  I'd also like to give a special thank you to April who seemed to be at the front desk every time we needed something.  No towels?  April got them.  Our card keys don't work?  April fixed them.  Our shuttle reservation was incorrect?  April corrected it.  She is a great asset to the organization and was a big help to us during our stay.  So, thank you, April!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Outdated room but good service,"The room we had, a two queen bed suite, is in serious need of an update. Sofa bed was unusable – the mattress had no padding, felt the springs all the way through. Had to sleep on the floor instead. Expected better from a BW Plus. Regular beds were comfortable, staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast was good and the shuttle was on time.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Can't say enough good things,"I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. Everything from the staff, to the shuttle service, to the free breakfast, to the room itself exceeded my expectations. For the price, you really cannot go wrong. The shuttle arrives at every 15 and 45 of the hour. By far, the most reliable hotel shuttle service I have used. We arrived a bit earlier than check-in time. While there were no rooms available at that specific time, the lady at the front desk made sure we would get one within 30 minutes. Unfortunately, I did not get her name, but she was absolutely lovely. She had shoulder length blonde hair and was of a petite frame. She said that we could wait in the lobby. The lobby itself is very small, but they do a great job with what they have. It feels welcoming and cozy. There is even a water jug with lemons in it that you can sip on while you wait. We soon made our way to the room and found it to be exactly what we needed. Nothing of a five-star room, but again, for the price it really was nicely furnished and spacious. Our room had a big desk, a view of the parking lot, a fridge, a microwave, and a coffeepot. The beds were comfortable and well made. The only con to the rooms whatsoever is that the key card was difficult to use, it took us multiple tries to get the hang of it, this could've just been a personal experience, but it was the slightest bit annoying. On our way up to the room we did note that there was an indoor pool and saw a couple people using the facility, however, we did not take advantage of it during our stay. The hotel also had washer/dryer units that were made available to use which we found really convenient. We also made use of the small two computer ""business center"" to print out our flight tickets. While small, it was useful. The room was quiet and it was easy to get a great night sleep. In the morning, we took advantage of the free breakfast and were extremely impressed with the spread. Hot fried potatoes, sausage, eggs, waffles, yogurts, bagels, donuts and more. We were on a two-week long venture across the states and found this hotel to have the best free breakfast. They even had three different coffee dispensers at different strengths. If the free breakfast does not satisfy you, there is also a 7/11 within walking distance. All in all, I cannot recommend this hotel more. It has made a lasting impression on me, and I will gladly stay here every time I happen to be in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Vacation,"Fast check in, very friendly staff, lobby was very clean. Room was amazing and homey feeling. The hotel was clean and smelled fresh. The breakfast was amazing also. The entire stay was awesome. Will stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not a Great Stay,"We arrived on July 19th for one overnight after a long days driving from the Black Hills.  We choose this location because of its proximity to the airport.  I will say the shuttle service was efficient and polite.  We had booked two rooms for 7 people.  Each room only had 2 towels and we had to go downstairs ourselves and get more towels.  The air conditioner in our room was broken and the hallway AC was also out.  After multiple discussions with the front desk they sent a maintenance man who cleaned some coils and said it was fixed.  It was not fixed and it was over 80 in the room.  They said they were booked and could not change our room.  My husband waited downstairs at the front desk trying to get some help when they said they had a cancellation, he spoke up and was able to get us moved to another room with AC.  The pool was dirty and they were completely out of pool towels.  Also the elevator was broken for the majority of the time we were there, it did get fixed but it was a hassle taking the stairs.   My overall impression was staff that was overwhelmed and could not keep up.  The hotel needs maintenance.",2

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Accommodations okay but poor customer service ,"We called to verify that the hotel had an airport shuttle available 24hours a day. After waiting on hold for 45 minuets a very rude front desk agent answered and put us on hold for another 30 min. By the time we finally talked to someone we were told we could ask one question. Assuming we just got a bad employee we kept the reservation, Big Mistake! The abuses continued on arrival along with many’ other unfulfilled commitments like providing a crib (which was requested at the time of the reservation and again upon arrival). What a mess.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Okay hotel,"Okay hotel, shuttle service was excellent, staff were friendly. Door to bathroom needed a hard pull and toilet flushed noisily. Breakfast was adequate. Short walk to Tower Tap and Grill, where the food was good and the service poor.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,This hotel double charges,"So disappointed with Best Western, which I thought was a reputable company. They took my credit card details on check in and I advised I wished to pay cash. I was told I could do this on check out, which I did.  Arriving back in New Zealand I checked my credit card account and found that they had also charged my Visa, $366.23NZD. I then emailed, twice, and they have not refunded my money or responded to either of my emails. I now have to go through the process of getting a charge back on my Visa, which is time consuming. I’m totally disgusted with Best Western, absolutely appalling customer service.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Stayed 1 night to catch early flight the next day,"The hotel was easy to find and close to Denver International.  We arrived early, and the friendly gal at the desk checked us right in.  My wife asked for a couple extra towels and she was told they were running low and would be alittle while but we'd get them.  We didn't need them right away so no big deal, but thought that was strange that they were running low.  I used their computer and printer to access and print our boarding passes.  This hotel offers a hot breakfast and shuttle to the airport, neither of which we used due to our early flight and the fact we already had a rental car.  Our room was very clean and fresh.  The pool area was clean, as was the rest of the hotel.  We would stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great hotel,Visited here at the end of our holiday.  Lovely room and really liked the pool.  Good breakfast but disappointed by the restaurant.  Menu ok for a lunch but not for a dinner and certainly not for our end of holiday meal!,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worst Experience Ever,"This was our first stay at Best Western and it was a big disappointment.  There were so many issues the one night we stayed there.The bag left on the door handle included a letter thanking us for selecting Best Western and it was made out to another guest.  The carpet hadn’t been vacuumed and the beds looked like they were just thrown together.  The bedding didn’t look clean and when the bedding was pulled down to get into bed, there was black stuff on both beds and hair, probably from the previous guests.   When I informed the front desk, first the man brought up a few sheets for one bed.  I told the man that both beds needed new bedding not just the sheets.  Then he brought what seemed like whatever he just grabbed from their linen closet.  Then I (not the staff) had to strip and make the beds myself.  The man told me to call the front desk when I was finished so he can come back up for the bedding I removed from the beds.  I had to call three times within 40 minutes before someone finally answered the phone.  The first two times it rang about 10 times with no answer.  The third time, it rang over five times before someone finally answered.  They didn’t pick it the bedding until about 30 minutes later.Called the front desk to request bath towels and was told that they do not have any bath towels but they do have hand towels and that I would have to go down and get them myself.The front desk staff was awful.  No customer service skills at all.  They were not very helpful and seemed to have no desire to provide customer service to their guests.  Just seemed to be there to say they were there to get a paycheck.  The hotel seemed outdated and had an “icky, gross” feeling about it.  The furniture and curtains were old and the cleanliness was not up the standards of other hotels/inns.  When you flushed the toilet, felt like the pipes were going to come up through the floor.  The shower curtain had snags on it.  There was a repair done in the shower area and just plastered over.  The bathroom floor needed to be swept and mopped.  Carpet needed to be vacuumed and bedding definitely needed to be changed.I would not recommend this location to anyone.  I will definitely not be staying here again.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Just for one night connecting in DEN,Good place 150$ for a night with 2 adults and 2 kids. Late checkout and small indoor pool. Quite ok but breakfast place too small with a lot of traffic and difficult to keep it tidy and stuffed and shuttle service is shared and not as reliable as per the automatic message state while calling the hotel.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,close to airport,We stayed here the night before we flew home.average hotel located in an area of many hotels.quick trip to get to the airport....... that was what we wanted.room was spacious and clean.buffet breakfast was on the ordinary side .not in a big space so seats were limited.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Disappointed ,"We have trusted Best Western hotels for a very long time.  This hotel has caused some doubts.  Upon arrival, the front desk was understaffed so we gave the clerk a “bye”.Got to our room, unpacked (staying 6 nights).  Found the bathroom with long black hair in the tub and all over floor- see pic.We had received a letter upon arrival asking that any issues by brought to the attention of the manager via email.  We promptly emailed the manager not wanting to disturb the overworked clerk.  Called to ask for towels and were asked to come get them!!!  We were gone the next day only to return with same issue in bathroom!  Trash not emptied and room looked like it had not been cleaned with the exception of the bed being messily thrown together. Still no word from the manager.Cristina, the head housekeeper came to check out the room and cleaned up the hair.  She promised the room would be thoroughly cleaned the next day.  It was.Today, it was cleaned, but not well.  Spots on faucets- not vacuumed- not usual standards for BW!The hotel is old looking.  The bed is comfortable.  The breakfast is good, however there is not enough seating. We’re not at all comfortable with cleaning.  We feel “icky”.   I would never recommend staying here.4th day and still no reply to my email.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great front desk staff,"People at check in where great, room was nice and clean, however, we had a late check out and house keeping came into room and removed all our personal items, we had to chase down cleaners to retrieve our items. not cool.  excellent shuttle service",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"SLAM, SLAM, the door would not close...","Best part of the hotel is the distance to the airport – less than 10 minutes away.  That is probably the only good part.  Also it is quietAvoid room 142.  1) there is a light shining on a tree right outside the window that will keep you up all night as the curtains will not close on the one side to block it out.  2) the door to the room is near impossible to close.  When we first approached the room, we noticed the door was not shut.  We checked the room and it was empty so we entered.  But then we realized the only way to shut the door was to slam it as hard as you could.  I went to the front desk to get a new room but they would not exchange for us.  Instead the person told me that all the rooms were that way, lift up on the door handle.  Ah, what?  I checked and once in the room, we could open the door just fine, so there was no danger of exiting if needed. The only problem was in closing the door.  Sorry to any of our neighbors as we slammed and slammed the door everytime we came or went.  We only needed one night before flying out so we stayed.Breakfast was just ok.  It seems BW breakfast has gone downhill in recent years.  The eggs were fine.  Waffle mix was too thick so the waffles didn’t cook right.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very convenient and quiet,"Since we had an early morning flight, we stayed here the night before. We left prior to the provided breakfast, but were given Grab and Go bags to tide us over which was unexpected and quite sufficient. The shuttle was very convenient and accommodating. There were restaurants within walking distance for our evening meal the night before. Friendly and helpful staff too!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,OK hotel for a couple of nights.,Very friendly welcome on the two times we stayed here. Once on arrival in Denver and then before flying back to Chicago. It was a very adequate hotel for the type of trip we were on. Good all round. Got an early check in the second time. That was a great help.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Pay the extra and stay at Hyatt House,"Old, dated and dirty. Wardrobe doesn’t even have a door, it’s a curtain. Bed is hard, shower is brutal- can’t adjust the setting so it’s blasts you. Toilet and shower are in a cupboard and the sink is in the room. Shuttle is old and dirty. Breakfast area is small and basic.Hyatt is around the corner and is new and only about $40 more.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Awful, old, smelly hotel that charged us for parking","Given how new the Denver airport area is, I had (stupidly) assumed that all hotels in the area were fairly new and updated.   Well, folks, this Best Western looked like it was right out of the 1980's.   And that's putting a positive spin on it.  Hallway carpets and room furniture were old, old, old.  Pillows were matted and lumpy. And to really top off the terrible experience, the clerk at check-in forced us to pay for parking, despite the fact that the Best Western reservation clearly said parking was free for the night.So...buyer beware.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western Denver Apt,"After flying in to Denver we wanted a hotel near by for the night. Had read reviews about this hotel so booked to stay one night before moving on. The hotel was very nice, clean and very comfortable after a long journey. The staff were really nice and helpful.  Exceptionally quiet considering it was a couple of miles from the international airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Denver airport,Only problem we had was that the shuttle to the airport booked up before we got there so we had to do UBER.  Pool and exercise room open 24 hrs which was a plus.  Staff extremely friendly and helpful  Bathroom is a little tiny and tub extremely slippery when getting into the shower.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Trip to honor my deceased son,"To start off, the second we stepped off the elevator the smell of marijuana was so strong I could’ve gotten a contact buzz. I know marijuana is legal in Colorado, but this was supposed to be a smoke free hotel. I experienced this throughout my stay! I thought the front desk staff was really nice, however, the pool... It was green, and I wanted to swim! The walls were so thin you could literally hear two babies next door crying throughout the night, not to mention the people outside; we were three floors up! The shower pressure was good, but the curtain wouldn’t stay closed on either end; causing anything in the bathroom to get wet! Housekeeping picked up our dirty towels and replenished them, but when we returned to our room that evening from a long day at seven falls we had…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Almost there,Only thing was for a hotel less than 2 years old bathroom had the ceiling peeling from the shower area. Otherwise very close to airport and restaurants walking distance many other small 3 star hotels in area too.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great spot after a long flight,The hotel was within 5 miles from the car hire at the airport so just a short easy drive after a long flight. It's position also makes it very popular so book well ahead. Check in was quick and they were friendly.   We stayed in a king room that was fairly spacious. The only issue was the plugholes smelt bad and this in turn made the room smell. We asked reception if we could change rooms but they were full. Keeping the plugs down helped a bit. We had a comfy nights sleep and it was fairly quiet too. Would stay again if in the area.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Just Fine,"Clean, very helpful staff and a very good breakfast.  The shuttle worked well and the hotel was helpful in keeping our luggage all day.  My only complaint was a very noisy refrigerator in our room.  The desk man recommended a nearby restaurant that was pretty good.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,RETIRED EDUCATOR,"The hotel was at a good location, not many affordable restaurants nearby, some were too high,and had to drive down Tower Road 3 miles to find a shopping market and affordable eateries.Some folks like to see entertainment centers nearby as well as shopping malls where they may purchase necessary items for what ever sightseeing they are doing.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Geat Spot by the airport!,We stayed here one night because it is only a few minutes from the airport!! The room was large and the beds were comfortable! The breakfast was great! We departed early but if you plan to sleep in and the sun is out get a room facing the West!,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not the expected quality of a BW+,"Check in was slow; placed in a room adjoining a room with very very loud people.  They were loud until past my bedtime and up again at 5am, waking me as well.  Bathroom floor had long dark hairs so not sure how well it had been cleaned.  Bed was ok and linens appeared to be clean.  Limited channels on the TV.  Ok for the price but not what I have come to expect from BW+.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Did not disappoint ,"Very nice hotel near the airport. Staff was helpful. The breakfast included bacon, eggs, and country potatoes. Free airport shuttle. Rooms clean and fresh. The price is reasonable for travelers.  Parked by free. Gas station within yards to top off your tank before turning in your rental car.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Can't go wrong!!,Amazing stay! Staff was pleasant. We got iin after a long flight was able to check in without any problems... Breakfast was really good my 7y enjoyed the make your own waffles! I would recommend to anyone traveling with children!!,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good stay,Last minute booking for us but I'm very pleased with what I chose. Reasonable room rate with excellent stay experience. I will definitely stay here again if coming to this area. The only problem is this review require so long writing 200 character at least :),5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Last minute,Friendly and efficient. Had a change in my plans. I called to see if they had rooms. They made room for me for the night. I was pleased with the cleanliness of the room and the friendliness of the staff. Breakfast was better than what I have at at other places. Thank you.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,So-so experience,TV didn't work and they didn't have anyone on hand to fix it. I asked at the front desk but the service people had gone home for the day. This doesn't seem like a lot to ask to have a functional TV. Right?,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Great Location, Great Price, Great Hotel","Quick In&Out - arrived late room was ready and per my request when I booked - high floor, away from elevator, out early - wife left before breakfast service started but they offered a carry out bag of an orange and something else which pleased her.  Thank you.    Everything was better than expected.  I will stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Very Accommodating, Clean, Great Shuttle","I had a very long layover at Denver airport.  Decided to stay here in order to get a few hours sleep.  Only had to wait a few minutes at the airport for the airport shuttle to show.  Needed a 5 am shuttle for the next morning and although that time was already booked, they squeezed me in.  Several of us were leaving before the free breakfast offered but the hotel had Grab and Go sacks packed for us so we would have something to snack on way to the airport. The room was clean, the staff helpful and nice. Would stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Great Value, Great Staff","I was just in town for 1 night and picked this BW based on other ratings.  I was more than satisfied with my room and the hotel.  Value for the rate is very high.   The staff made the difference, especially at the front desk.  If the rest of Colorado has this level of professionalism then no wonder Denver is growing so much.   .",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Comfortable & clean,Josh at the front desk was very helpful.  He steered us towards a place to eat which was within walking distance & gave us a coupon for 10% off.  Not quite sure what made this a Best Western Plus since it seemed like a regular best Western to me.   The sink is outside the bathroom toilet/shower area.  There were comfortable & everything was very clean.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not Impressed,"It wasn't easy to select a hotel for a simple overnight prior to our flight out of Denver --- so many have inconsistent reviews, this one included. We were less than thrilled. The photos are very misleading as everything had a rather worn and exhausted look about it; my guess is that some of the damage in the rooms is do to ski equipment. What was more annoying was that we made arrangements with the front desk for a 7:30am shuttle to the airport and when we arrived the next morning they insisted we were scheduled for the earlier shuttle and they now had no space for us. Seriously?! That's the entire point of staying near the hotel. We had to wait for the next scheduled shuttle which had space and this just added to the stress of making our flight on time.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice place to stay,Very helpful front desk people.  Well situated to the airport with plenty of dining available nearby.  Breakfast was well supplied.  Wish there was more than just one ice machine other than one located only on the 3rd floor,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Wonderful comfortable hotel,"We have just stayed in this lovely hotel for three nights. The room we had was so comfortable and the staff welcoming. The breakfast was delicious and plenty of choice. The hotel was quite a way out of Denver but convenient for our visit to Rocky Mountain National Park, and Red Rock. I would say an excellent hotel to use when arriving or leaving as it is so close to the airport. It also has an airport shuttle which is good to know.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Never again,"Our flight was delayed, due to one of the 4 nor'easters to hit the northeast this winter.  We chose to stay in Denver overnight to catch the early morning flight and save 200 miles of driving.  Pulled this hotel off bookings.com - had decent, positive reviews and it was mid range on price.  I wasn't expecting the Broadmoor but this place was just awful.  Squeaky floor right outside the bathroom, a shower curtain closing the ""closet"", pilly sheets, torn and threadbare towels, smelly hallway exacerbated by an employee who stood outside the exit door smoking cigarettes.  Yuck!",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Family of 5,We stayed here before and after our trip to  Europe. Staff was very friendly both times. The shuttle service was great and we were able to keep our car parked there while we were gone. The pullout sofa is not very comfortable but most sofas aren't comfortable anyway.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not quite sure what to say. This is the lowest rating I’ve ever given.,"We booked and paid for this hotel in December for a trip in March. When we arrived we were told the room we were going to get could not be accessed because the door handle was broken and they couldn’t open it and they had no other rooms. The young lady at the desk said they had made reservations next door at a sister hotel for us, when my wife inquired about the price difference she got on the phone and spoke to that hotel and we were told a price considerably lower than this hotel but we would have to pay that rate and get the difference back from booking.com. We said that is not acceptable and she changed her mind and said that there was 1 party that had not checked in yet and we would get that room. Ok, great. When we got to the room there was a rust stained towel on the counter next to the sink that we learned was there because the faucet leaked and water pooled and then ran around the sink onto the floor. I don’t I have ever stayed in a room with a floor that squeaked so badly, which only bothered us as the room was directly over the front entrance and no one below could hear. What we heard though, all night long, was the electric, motion sensored door opening and closing, over and over. We checked in at midnight and checked out at 6am to catch our next flight. Needless to say we didn’t get much sleep. The room should be a storage room, it should never have been made to sleep in!! We do not recommend staying here.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent location close to airport,Very up to date property with friendly and efficient staff. We were impressed with cleanliness of our room and the public areas. Would have given it a five except for noisy HVAC unit that did not have a low fan setting.  The Internet access was excellent.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Fab short stay!,We were very happy with our comfy stay here. Nice big room very good bed and bathroom. We were so happy as the staff left a gift for us for retirement... how lovely. The breakfast is generous and great ... anyone who is not satisfied must be so fussy!!!! The airport shuttle service is punctual and fantastic. You can get a train into the city for a spare day. Would highly recommend this hotel without a doubt!!  Good eating at the tower bar and grill too.  Thanks so much.... very happy!!,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,BEST AT THE AIPPORT,I would like to tell people not to believe these false reviews I stay at this hotel all the time and the satff is amazing and on point all the time. The shuttle drivers are friendly and very informative of your pick up and drop off points. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is always hot and always stocked to perfection. I am the General Manager of a major resort in Colorado and these bad reviews are senseless and without merit. This hotel and staff nevers get it wrong and are always so polite and helpful. People need to check themselves before trying to bash others and if your having a bad day yourself don't take it out on people trying to help you and doing the best they can. I hope people that write these reviews and think that they are perfect look back and take a deep…,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,I liked this Place,"Friendly, professional, well dressed staff. Clean large rooms that are well designed and decorated.   Was not a fan of all the small size pillows. I am more of a one to to pillow person.   Just a real nice comfortable, safe, clean place to stay near the airport at a fair price.  ",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Horrible experience.,"We spent one night in the Best Western Plus - Denver Airport. We never will again. We had an early morning flight the next day, so we thought it would be easier to stay at the hotel, get some sleep and wake up at 4am to get to the airport. How wrong were we.  It was such a noisy hotel. We were on the 2nd floor and the sound of furniture being moved around was all we could hear once we arrived. We tried to sleep from about 9pm, but the constant sound of something heavy being moved around every few seconds drove us mad. We complained to the front desk that someone was moving furniture or something. They investigated, but found nothing. We called the front desk at least 5 times to complain throughout the night, but they said they could do nothing about it and we just had to deal…",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good place for one night,We spent our first night after flying to america there. It is a very nice hotel with very nice people. We loved the big cofortable rooms and the nice soft beds. You cant hear anything of cars or planes around.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Filthy!,"Best Western should pull their name from this property.  The first impression was of the shuttle driver who spoke very little English.  The second impression was the fithy carpet in the lobby and breakfast room area.  I had just come from a Third World country where they spoke better English.  Our reserved room had been smoked in.  The second room was shabby and dingy with worn sheets and thin towels and for the first time ever at a Best Western I pulled back the covers to see if the sheets were washed.  It was after 11 pm and the hotel was noisy, including a mother who spent some time berating her children in Spanish. The kitchen was not clean, the carpet had not been vacuumed from the night before so we did not have breakfast.  This experience has made me think twice about the Best Western brand of which I am a member.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Nice for Park, Sleep and Fly","We are from Colorado Springs, but chose to overnight here before our flight out the next day because my husband had a late business commitment in Denver on the evening before our departure. Our room was clean and fairly quiet. I could hear airplanes during the night, but we were near the airport after all. It didn't keep me awake. The free breakfast had a nice variety of items to choose from. The shuttle service worked great. We were booked on the 9:30 am shuttle. It does go to 3-4 other close hotels, so keep that in mind as you book your time. In all, we were at the airport in about 15-20 minutes. On the return, we only waited a few minutes for the shuttle to arrive to take us back to our hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Helped with broken bags!,"Had a quick overnight at this hotel, and discovered our ski bag was broken.Despite being late in the eve, they called their maintenance, and the maintenance Dept provided us with duct tape delivered to our room, and front desk let us use scissors to modify our ski bag zipper, and with scissors and duct tape we got it packaged together for the next morning flight.Thanks so much for being so helpful I. Our luggage time of need! Nice to have a front desk and maintenance Dept that are so helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Read the reviews...,"...and plan accordingly.I'm not sure why people complain when they should know going in what to expect.Only a fool (or maybe a gambler) would stay at this hotel if they needed airport shuttle service - enough!  The reviews have warned you not to do it.Other reviews make clear that room selection is critical because of noise.I was offered a 1st floor room near the elevator, but asked for a 3rd floor room as far from it as I could get.  I was rewarded with a quiet room and a good night's sleep.And I checked for bedbugs (like I do at all hotels) before I climbed in bed.Accordingly, I was well satisfied with this establishment.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Disappointed,This was a first disappointing experience for me with Best Western. BW is my go to for short trips. The room I was given was noisy - next to an elevator. Humming sound was bothersome. Then another room I was given had cobwebs. Step up your game. BWs in CA are excellent! No problem at all!,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Poor shuttle service,"""Free Shuttle and Free Breakfast"" fine print- only during specific hours and when we tell you. We asked for a hotel shuttle to take us back to the airport and were told the shuttle only runs every half hour and the times we wanted were all ""booked"". We were told that we could take a shuttle two hours earlier than we needed, only available spots. I asked why the shuttles only run every half hour and book up- maybe you need to offer more shuttles! When we boarded our shuttle, there were 5 empty seats despite the manager telling another customer he had to wait for his scheduled shuttle because this one was full!",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean & Affordable.  Nice Staff.  A bit noisy.,"We really have never had any issues staying in a Best Western.  It is an affordable place to stay, and we don't expect much more than it to be clean and comfortable.  It met our expectations.  Not a lot of places to eat close, we had to drive a little way to get to something but not terribly bad.    The only thing I would mention it was loud at times.  It sounded like elephants running up and down the hall above us and we could hear the people next to us pretty well. This hotel must have very thin walls and wood floors under the carpet.  Not a good setup for sound barrier.   We did not complain because by the time we went to bed around 10pm the noise stopped.  It would have been pretty bad had we needed to sleep as soon as we got to the hotel though.  There is no way we could…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worst hotel I've stayed at,"There are so many choices when it comes to finding a hotel near the airport.  This time I chose to stay at Best Western because they offered a stay and park option.  I was quoted $8 per night to park when I asked about the service over the phone.  Arriving at the hotel, I found the room was dirty.  The towels had black stains all over them like they were used to change car oil and then thrown in the washing machine and put in my room.  We used the pull out sofa which was not made. I had to call the front desk to get a blanket and sheets for the bed.  No mattress pad, just a thin stained sheet and a blanket.  I also understand that it is hard to vacuum under a sofa, but there was so much food, empty water bottles, and tissues under the sofa, its easy to say that it has NEVER been…",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Was good for the price BUT,We were reasonably impressed with the room when we arrived. Whilst it was older it was in reasonable condition and was a good price compared to other hotels that close to the airport. The checkin staff were very pleasant.  We were in room 214 that was located directly abouve the sliding doors at the hotel entrance. It turned out that the sliding doors worked day and night! As well as being noisy they caused the bed to shake every time the doors opened. We should have asked for a room changed but thought it would stop. We were wrong and we had a very disrupted sleep.  Unfortunately the checkout staffin the morning was not interested in our complaint.  If you request a room on the upper floor this would not be a problem.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Ok for one night. ,"I used my points for a free room the night before I flew out of DIA. I had a nice letter and welcome bag waiting in my room. I discovered the thermostat was not responding so I went down to the front desk. The young lady called for maintenance right away. Being after hours, a guy from an adjacent hotel responded.  He ended up wiring up the wall unit to bypass the tstat all together. I appreciated his quick fix. The room was clean but the bed and pillows should be replaced.  The hotel was clean, its just older. I had an early flight so I didnt use any of the facilities or partake in breakfast. It was fine for one night but I wouldn't stay again.  ",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Bed Bugs,"My daughters stayed at this hotel for one night and found bed bugs. To say the least, they were absolutely terrified and felt disgusting afterwards.  I would not recommend this hotel at this time.  Always check your beds before laying your head down to rest.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,DONT STAY if you have early flight!,"We booked this BW because of its proximity to the airport (we had a 6am flight) and that it advertised a 24 hour running shuttle that could get us there quickly.  It did NOT advertise that it also provided this service to the other multitude of hotels in the area. We were arriving to Denver by a shuttle from Breckenridge Ski resort.  The shuttle delivered us to the airport and from there we picked up the BW shuttle.  We then had to drive to four other hotels before being dropped off at BW.  We were then told that we couldn't get a shuttle for 4:30am back to the airport the following morning because they were booked up.  We had to take a 3:30am shuttle, because again, it was picking up at all the other hotels.  In summary, if I had known this was the process (if it had been more…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,They must renovate rooms and physical plant,The quality of the product for the price is very poor. Staff must be better trained to handle elite members of the brand. The rooms are very inadequate It is one of the few hotels in the chain that need to reformulate.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great For Park & Fly,"Hotel is a little older, but very clean with comfortable beds.  Front desk employee was extremely nice as well as efficient.  The breakfast was great and it was nice having fresh, hot waffles!  They offer park and fly which was convenient.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,An Acceptable Hotel With Issues,"My family and I were staying for a single night while on our trip to Colorado for a holiday visit. As my family lives in rural Colorado, it made sense to spend the night near the airport so we could catch an early flight home. I thought this hotel would fit the bill as an inexpensive hotel located near the airport with a 24 hour per day shuttle. I've stayed at Best Westerns before and expected a no-frills reasonable hotel experience.   When we checked in the ladies working the front desk seemed short and a little overwhelmed. During the check-in process, we requested a wake-up call and tried to make a reservation for the shuttle the following morning. We were told both of these were all set but did not see the concierge write anything down. Later in the afternoon, my wife went…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Satisfactory, but not as good as other BW properties","We had an overnight stay which was satisfactory. The room was clean, but not as up to date as other BW properties we have stayed at recently. The staff were friendly. Although we did redeem reward points for our stay, we were not thanked for being members and did not receive the usual bottled water and snack. Not a biggie, however it was noteworthy having just stayed at a BW in Lincoln, Nebraska where we were made to feel extra special.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Hotel - Close to Denver International Airport,This Best Western Hotel is a great place to stay as it is close to the Denver International Airport.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great comfy airport hotel ,"I stay here several times a year when I have an early morning flight. Large rooms with comfy beds. They have an excellent parking package so you can catch the van in the morning to the airport. Just make sure you make a van reservation when you check in. Staff is friendly and helpful. I usually leave before breakfast, but they have the usual “free” breakfast fare. Rates are usually lower than the other immediate hotels.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western at Denver Airport,"This hotel is conveniently located close to Denver International airport.  It has typical amenities with a 24-hour pool, good buffet breakfast and free shuttle service and is a good deal for the price.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Was ok,The room was cold and dirty when I walked in. I had to catch a flight early so I went right to bed. The sheets are terrible and had me itching all night. When I woke up for my flight at 4 am I found that I had no towels in the room. Had no time to call and ask for more so I was SOL. Guess it’s not the worst thing ever but for over 100 bucks I night I want my towels and a clean room.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,An overnight at Best Western Plus Denver Airport,"I needed an overnight stay, near the Denver Airport with shuttle to and from the airport included in the stay and the ability to leave my car at the Hotel while away. This Best Western Plus included it all. In addition, the room was very nice with microwave and refrigerator and all the other items a person likes. The pool and hot tub were just down the hall. The breakfast offered looked good, but I had a very early flight...so they gave me a ""bag breakfast"". It wasn't a lot, but enough to get my day going, plus there was fresh coffee available so early in the am and I was able to also grad a roll to go with what was given. The wake-up call came on time and the shuttle to the airport was without any problems. Upon return, the shuttle was right there and got me back to the hotel and my car with no trouble. It was all very good.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent staff,"Room was not completely ready when I arrived. Spoke with front desk clerk (Tatyana).

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Stay with Airport Shuttle!,I was surprised how nice the Best Western was in Denver near the airport. There are about 10 different hotels to choose from in this one block.  Super nice hotel for the price! The airport shuttle was easy. Enjoyed the whirlpool as well. Our flight was too early to enjoy breakfast but smelled amazing. The staff was friendly and the shuttle driver gave great information on where to go once in the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Night before our flight,"We checked in about 8 PM on a Sunday night, were warmly greeted by the lady at check in, I had questions about where to gas up the rental car, where to eat, get snacks and she gave good recommendations. I booked this room weeks prior and asked for a quiet room and the room they prepared for us gave us a good quiet nights sleep. We had to leave before the breakfast was put out the next morning, and they had a paper sack prepared for us with a bottle of water, an apple and a granola bar type snack. Had a nice hot shower in the morning and were off to the car rental return. The location is great, there is a 7-11 next to the hotel for snacks and a gas station to fill up before turning the rental in.",5

So helpful and happy!  I’ve stayed here three times now and will always stay there when traveling to Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not bad but could be a better value,People are great. Sevice was good. We got a suite and the hotel had bedding for the extra bed but did not have any extra pillows. It was a good thing that we had a few extra from the road trip. Room was clean but in need of a remodel very soon.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A cold city with a warm hotel,The hotel was adequate for my needs.  The lady at the desk was great when she checked me in and had recommendations for the little tavern/restaurant next door.  I had the ribs and it was amazing.  They were very helpful and I was appreciative of their efficiency during check in.  I often go do Denver on business and when I can stay the night I will definitely go back.,4

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great location if you are flying out of Denver,Close to the airport - not too loud (even on the third floor).

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Multiple issues upon check in,When I first arrived I was placed in a room that had a broken air conditioner. I discussed with the staff and they stated maintenance would com look at the issue. While waiting on the maintenance department I noticed there was not a remote for the tv. I again went to the front desk and was given a replacement remote. When I went back to the room the replacement remote that was given to me did not have batteries. I then went back to the front desk where a different room was offered. When I went the new room (after dragging my luggage to a different floor) the key card that was given to me did not work.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good choice near DIA,"A good hotel choice if you need to catch an early flight out of DIA. None of the hotels on Tower Road are excellent, but I actually prefer this one to the Marriot choices across the road.  It is quieter, although the parking is very limited!",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Efficient and very courteous,Beautiful. Clean.  Fantastic amenities. CLEAN! Did I mention clean?!

Front desk staff were excellent.A couple of items needed cleaning attention - the gym equipment and bar fridge (easy fix's really).",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Always Reliable,"The BW brand has been interesting for years and the added ""Plus"" promises a bit more than the basics.  For a one night stay before a morning flight this property is excellent value for money.  The Tower Road location is closer to the airport, so shuttle times are shorter than from other locations.  BW shares shuttles with three other properties, so times are scheduled which makes for easy planning at both ends.  As the weather gets colder, it's nice to know when the shuttle will be coming rather than standing outside waiting and hoping.  Rooms are relatively spacious, breakfast includes all the regulars, and the staff is very helpful and pleasant.  While this is not a luxurious, high-end property,  it does provide all the services we need. We did not need the air conditioner, but it was turned on and very noisy when we arrived.  In hot weather the AC noise would keep me from sleeping.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,VACATION AND/OR WORK,"When traveling the country you should always be able to count on good service and conditions.  BW is a big plus...whether you need just a room, count on the first meal of the day, a good price, or help getting around the area you're in.   I always look for BW before considering anything else.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice stay close to the Denver airport,"From the shuttle pick-up to the friendly staff, this Best Western Plus represents a good value for the money if you need to stay in close vicinity to the Denver International Airport.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"New Best Western, very nice",The room was modern and very comfortable.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice Hotel- Easy Airport Access,"Nice stay at this hotel.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Another  good Best Western Experience!,"The hotel offers all that I would expect in a Best Western Plus hotel.  Liked the spacious room in the King Suite.  Room was very clean!  Like having a microwave, the wet bar sink, and refrigerator in the room.  Also liked having a bathroom sink separate from the toilet shower area!  Parking is very limited at the hotel.  The front desk clerk told us to part at either of the adjacent hotel parking lots.  My guess about the limited parking available is due to the fact that the hotel offers a Park 'N Fly option that many people take advantage of.  Very convenient to the airport!",4

Our room was clean and well appointed.  The bed was comfortable and the shower was hot.  The TV worked fine.  As for the other room amenities, such as a microwave, coffee maker, etc., we don't normally use them so I don't check to see if any of them work.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent choice for an overnight prior to flight,We booked the Best Western Plus in order to relax and have a good night's sleep prior to our flight the next morning. The reservation clerk recommended an outstanding restaurant within walking distance called DiCicco's and also arranged for our shuttle to the airport.  It was a great experience!,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Be warned,"I suggest you stay at a different hotel. Despite reserving a room with 2 queen beds we were given a room with 1 king bed and told there was nothing else available. Our room was extremely noisy all night since it was directly above the main entry electric sliding door. Essentially sounded like a piano being moved every two minutes all night. And we were charged $20 more than stated in our reservation confirmation. Fortunately, the staff agreed to waive the room charge in the morning. But we did not sleep the entire night.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,If You Like Room Keys Issued Without ID Confirmation & Parking 3 Blocks from Hotel...,"PROS: stain free, very clean…mostly, free toiletries, comfortable bed, effort to accommodate early risers via bagged breakfast (which includes water, yogurt bar & fruit), suite style room complete with: desk, sofa, tables, coffee maker, microwave, fridge, easy clean tv remoteCONS: GUEST SECURITY, ABYSMAL PARKING SITUATION, loud fridge, hair on tub stopper, dated décor (not material to me but may be to some), crappy room keysMAJOR DEAL BREAKER 1: Poor guest security.  I returned on the 2nd day of my stay to find that neither of my room keys worked.  As soon as I headed towards the front desk, the clerk, Ruby, immediately stated “Can’t get in?” (as though this was something that happens frequently.)  I nodded.  She then asks only for my room number and immediately uses it to reactivate the key.  She doesn’t verify in ANY WAY that the room number given is actually correct or that I am the actual occupant.  She doesn’t ask for my name, ID, NOTHING.  I could have been someone in possession of an old room key from a previous stay.  I could have been a guest in another room up to something nefarious or I could have simply been someone who had actually mixed up/forgotten my room number.This is scary to me - that it’s THAT EASY to get a key to pretty much any room number I decided to give.  So much for guest security!Even if they try to claim Ruby recognized me, she obviously didn’t recognize me that well as she didn’t know my name or my room number.MAJOR DEAL BREAKER 2:  Abysmal Parking.If you’ve ever said to yourself: “Gee. I think I’d like to park 3 downtown blocks away from my hotel and across the street.” This hotel is for you.Let me preface this section by saying that this hotel is located in a huge almost shopping center of multiple hotels – each with their own parking that is NOT clearly marked and tow signs galore.  This means that if you park in the wrong space, you can and WILL be towed (which has apparently happened to guests in the past according to other guests and Ruby).So I get to this hotel, without any knowledge or warning that I will NOT be able to park at my hotel.  It takes me driving around about 10 minutes in disbelief – thinking I MUST somehow be missing SOMETHING as there is no way that there is no parking garage or SOMETHING.  After 10 minutes, I pause in the front and go in to ask them What the fudge?!  I’ve heard of there being limited parking at an establishment or even only 1 space available for each room but this is INSANE.  There are literally only enough spaces to wrap around the base of the building AND THAT’S IT.	Our friend Ruby at the front desk informs me that I have to park at Days Inn (which has the same parking set up by the way AND OF COURSE NO SPACES AS WELL) or one of the 2 Holiday Inns (as they are “sister properties owned by the same company”)…except if I see a cone.  If there is a cone, even at the “authorized” parking locations, I may still be towed.  (Note: there were cones all about the Holiday Inn parking lots).  When I asked for verification in writing that I can park in one of these other lots (due to tow signage), I was told I could not have it….so I decided to record her saying so instead…just in case.I ended up both nights having to park what amounted to 3 city blocks and across the street from my hotel.  If I would have known about this prior to booking, I 1000% would not have booked this hotel.Two words Best Western: Parking Garage.  Or, at least, if all else fails, better signage stating where overflow parking is, notification of the state of the parking there in your room listings so that consumers can make informed decisions AND email notification of the parking situation with the option to cancel the room.It’s like they assumed that with their proximity to the airport, no one would bother driving.  Well, I have news for you Best Western, there are a myriad number of reasons people choose an airport hotel including late/early flights.  It’s not just because they wanted only to experience the airport area of their locations and therefore would be happy with just the hotel/airport shuttle.  Plan parking accordingly.I will add that though I was out before dawn and back pretty late at night, I felt ok making the walk – as in safe enough not as in being ok with this ridiculous situation.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean and Comfortable,"We also did the Park & Ride, and found this inn to be clean, comfortable and quiet. Not fancy but very adequate. The shuttle worked like a charm and the front desk person was very helpful.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great service but in need of a rehab,"We always stay here when we fly out of Denver.  It is very close to airport, has a great shuttle service and they let you leave your car at the hotel.  It is in need of some repairs and upgrades.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good,"Very nice.  Our desk clerk was super helpful and friendly. Except for the parking.  You need to know where NOT to park.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great airport pick up,We waited no more than 5 minutes at the airport before the driver came up and asked us where we were staying and took us to the van.  The location was just what we needed. The front desk person told me about enterprise leasing so we didn't have to rent a car at the airport.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great  place to stay.,"Great place to stay and hotel clerk who checked us in went out of her way to accommodate us and was very efficient.

Would stay again,when we fly out of DIA.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,This airport hotel is not well equiped for tired travelers.,"This Best Western Hotel is located in a neighbourhood full of similar airport hotels. A traveler who has just arrived from overseas wants only one thing: some food, some drinks and a good night of sleep. The hotel does not offer food or drinks, other than a machine with many types of coca cola. The only restaurant, two blocks away, is loaded with people, so one has to wait for a table. No go, when you are tired. Hotels in the US usually lack bar and restaurant fascilities, but an airport hotel should do better. The good night of sleep was not a great succes either, since the airco in the rooms is quite noisy. We had to switch it off.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good value for the dollar ,"Overall pleased with our 3- night stay.   Room was roomy,  nice amenities.   Pool was a little cook, but stopped no one in or party from enjoying it.   Hot tub was delicious.   Biggest complaint was difficulty getting coffee replaced.   Every day I had to request coffee to be refilled.   Not a huge deal,  but with a king  suite,  I expected a bit more service. ",4

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very good staff poor property,"The staff were helpful, friendly, and responsive. The hotel itself, not so much. The corridors were uncomfortably warm. The bed was the least comfortable hotel bed that  I have been in, perhaps ever. The pillows felt like wood blocks. The climate controls in the room were difficult to set. I have stayed at several hotels near DIA; this was far from the cheapest, but definitely the pleasant.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Less than expected,"After many pleasant and rewarding recent stays at Best Western hotels by my wife and child, our stay at this hotel was a totally underwhelming experience.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good place to stay for airport,"the location and service to the airport was good.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Convenient and Amenable,This hotel was convenient to the airport for our late arrival one night and early departure two days later.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,AS EXPECTED,Stayed here at start and end of holiday. Convenient for the airport. Reception staff very pleasant. The rooms are as you'd expect. Very clean with all of the standard furnishings. It has a pool and outside seating area. Parking area did seem small but we had no problems. Ate at Vinneys over Tower Road which we had used before. Think it's the best in the immeadiate area. This hotel is as good as any if you are using the airport.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,convenient for airport,Friendly staff and helpful .I was able to check-in online and print my boarding passes from the hotel. There was free parking and close to car rental returns. Beds were comfortable and breakfast was good. We ate at Ruby Tuesdays a short walk away and it was excellent value.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent night before fly-out stay,"Had absolutely no complaints about this hotel.  The only drawback is that it is hard to find.  Address is Tower, however it is behind another hotel which is on Tower.  It has an excellent airport shuttle (which we did not use.)  We had a car rental return in the morning.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western Hotel where you feel at home,"This hotel was clean, quiet and had the best beds and pillows which made you feel like home. They offered a large breakfast that many folks took advantage of. The ladies at the desk were very polite and went out of their way to accomodate the guests. We had a late check in and early check out and both experiences went very smoothly. The hotel is close to the airport, approximately 4 miles away. Even though there were a large amount of guests you did not have to wait for breakfast, or for help from the desk. We highly reccomend this hotel for traveling for business or pleasure.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Denver International Airport Hotel,Looked for a convenient hotel at DIA with a shuttle to the airport for our last night before heading home.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,R,"The room had an offensive odor. The furniture and carpet were old and dated. The room lighting was very poor and inadequate, the hair dryer was discovered hidden under an ironing board in the closet. The tub had no skid protection and it was very slippery to stand on.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A good deal if booked in advance.,"We got this hotel at $74 per night for two nights by booking as soon as we knew our flight plan. We stayed in thenearby Airport La Quinta four tears ago which was a superior hote, but significantly more expensive. The rooms at this Best Western were good enough though for the price paid. Breakfast was reasonably varied with bacon provided on the second day. I noticed in a number of hotels this summer that bacon is uncommon and if a hot breakfast is provided it is often just eggs or perhaps those pretend sausages as was the case on the first day. It is possible to walk (about 30 mins) to the nearest train stattion into Downtown which is more convenient than waiting for the free shuttle that the hotel provides in conjunction with others in the area. With that in mind it should be noted that booking in advance is essential as it does pick up from several places and for both our journeys (after the flight arrived and to get the hire car) people were left behind as the shuttle was full.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Dirty Hotel And Needs Repair ,"The best western plus at Denver international airport was very disappointing. I will start off with the hotel room itself. The room is tiring and I need of renovation. We had a suite room with jacuzzi and there was no working water for the jacuzzi. Luckily the hotel staff moved us to another room with a working jacuzzi but it wasn't the greatest. The breakfast area was very un organized and very cramped. They had tables up to close to the buffet line which made it very difficult to maneuver thru the line without trampling over top of someone. As for the pool area it was very nasty. The pool good use a very good cleaning. The water literally had no chlorine or shock treatment and it was like swimming in somebody's dirty bath water. You could actually see dirt sitting at the bottom of the pool. Hot tub next to the pool did not work. Overall very disappointed and I will not be staying at this hotel again, not worth the money you pay",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice hotel!,"Everything was nice, but the refrigerator in our room was ancient and barely worked and definitely needed replacing.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Conveniently close to airport when arriving late,Conveniently close to the airport. The breakfast was.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Last night's in town,"Great staff, clean, helpful.  Easy to find, shuttle bus to airport. Typical hotel with good morning breakfast but, this large hotel has a very small parking lot we had to park in the neighboring hotels lot and walk to our hotel. Also a hotel of this size needs a larger place for its guess to eat. People were getting their food and had no place to sit down and eat. Very bad planning on both points.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Needs some TLC,"I was disappointed.  I have always had good things to say about Best Western, but not this time. There were stains on the bedspread, just little, like something may have splattered, but they should have been washed.  If its a permanent stain, they should not be used. There was also dust on the floor around the baseboards.  A chair was sitting by the elevator, not sure why, but it had a large ink? stain on a corner of the seat.  We were on a long vacation, stayed in a total of 11 hotels. This is the only one I have written a bad review for.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Works if you are stuck at DEN,Hotel is sufficient for an airport hotel but is not very luxurious.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not so good....,"Upon our check in, I looked over to the pool area and a workman was lying on the deck with a big wrench in the water. I asked if the spa area was working and I was told yes. The breakfast area was awfully small. People on top of people and the rush had already ended by that time 09:00. Food was standard at best. Our king room was small and the older style with the sink outside the tub/shower area. We did not find the bed very comfortable. It was an old room but clean. We had rode in from Oklahoma and I needed a hot tub for my sore back. Went to the spa area and the hot tub was cold and not working!!! I was upset. I went to the front desk and the girl working said well I can't fix it!! I asked for a little compensation for the inconvenience and she said well go next door to the Holiday Inn, we own that property too. I went out the door by our room, which was beside the dumpster. I crossed the street went up a hill, my flip flops got stuck in the mud. By now it was dark. I had a wonderful hot tub at the Holiday inn and went back to our hotel. Very disappointed to say the least. Not sure how they ever got a plus from BW. maybe connections?? Next time this property and the Holiday Inn airport are off my list. Not because the HI wasn't good. It's the principle. If they can run 1, how do they run 3. We're headed to the canyon lands BW in Moab. Can't wait, it lives up to the plus.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Efficient hotel near the airport,"OK bedrooms, OK pool.  The hotel is in area with hotels, hotels and hotels.

The only minus is the amount of waste you produce with cardboard cups, plates and plastic cutlery.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good Access to Airport and I-70,We chose to stay at the Best Western near the airport for it's convenience to downtown (an evening game at Coors Field) to I-70 (a day trip into the mountains) and the airport (a very early flight).

Restaurant next to the hotel made dinner with the kids easy.  Room was spacious for our family of 5, and clean.  One negative comment - the bathtub/shower was old and dirty.  There was black mildew in different places and the walls and floor were dirty.  My son refused to shower in it (he's 7) because it was so dirty.  The bathroom as a whole definitely could use remodeling, as the rest of the room was very nice.  The beds were great!  The pool was nice but not very warm.   Staff was super friendly and very helpful.  I only gave a 3 rating because of the bathroom. …",3

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Clean, friendly and helpful","The hotel was clean and inviting.  The staff were very helpful especially after a long flight.    We stayed there the first and last night of out a 10 day trip.  Free bus transfer to airport took only 10 mins so very suitable.  One recommendation would be to request a bed with your mattress choice.  Room 208 has nice hard mattress however, 231 is very soft which my fellow traveler couldn't sleep on.  Breakfast was very good with a large selection of food.  There was a very nice lady ensuring all the food was available.  However there was limited number of tables which had some people sitting in the lobby with plates on their knees on our return stay.  The choice would be to bring food up to room or time your breakfast early.",4

Comfy beds and absolutely fine for one night. we did realise in the night however that as we were very close to the lift it was quite noisy - however with our flying we did sleep pretty well although we were out and on the road by 7am.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Nice stay, but beware extra charges","We stayed here because we had an early flight and didn't want to drive into Denver early in the morning.  We used the Park-and-Fly option, which worked out well for us.  The room was comfortable and all was well, but the hotel charged $25 ""for amenities"" which they said did not go through, but my friend's credit card said it did.  The woman working at the desk was helpful and polite, but she was limited in what she could do.  He's going to have a rough time sorting this out.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very ood place to climatize to altitude,"Very close (a shuttle away) to the airport.  Also, if you're renting a car, it's pretty close to the car rentals too.  Lots of hotel along Tower Road and restaurants.  The Tower Tap and Grill is right across the street for good food and drinks.  The hotel is clean and friendly.  Free WiFi and a large room fridge.  No safe though.  The rooms are spacious and they even fit in a sofa for added comfort.  The only knock would be the size of the pillows, they are small, square sofa cushion size but fairly thick.  You get 4 of them on a King Bed.  They don't have anything bigger, we asked.  There's also a small indoor pool and hot tub, unfortunately we didn't get a chance to use them.  The morning breakfast nook is very cozy and well stocked.  Waffle mix to make your own waffle if you want to.  There's also bagels, English muffins, bread, cereal, hardboiled eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon, yogurt, fruit, juice, coffee, tea, etc.  Very convenient and good place to start your CO vacay.  Avoid Rm 133 if you can, the view is the dumpster in the parking lot.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,GREAT HOTEL for Early Flights,Stayed here on the last night of our vacation - had to fly out very early the next morning.  Actually has coin-operated laundry so we went home with clean clothes!  Very nice hotel - bathroom was a little outdated but clean.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A great place to stay near DIA,What I like about staying at a Best Western is the consistency from one hotel to the other. I know what I'm going to get from checking to check out. This hotel did not disappoint and the free  shuttle to airport was an added bonus. ,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Review of Best Western on Tower Road in CO,The staff at the desk and breakfast area were very polite and helpful.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not the best Best Western,"Experienced a number of problems which were not usual. No tissues in room, really small room, elevator button for my floor broken and loose wires in elevator. All in all, this hotel needs some maintenance and staff training",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Avoid Room 221 (and 321?),"This is more a commentary on a specific room, #221 (and probably #321) and not on the whole inn. Overall, the inn seems about what you would expect for a near-airport-spend-one-night-and-leave place. We were put in room 221, for some reason a handicap room (which we did not request). The room was right next to the elevator shaft, and every time someone used the elevator we heard the grinding sound as it went by. It was tolerable in the late evening but then started up at 3:30 am and hit a crescendo from 5:00 am to 6:30. Along with the elevator, the shaft seems to also serve as a water main, so when the elevator was not running we had the rush of water as people flushed toilets. The window ac did help drown out some of the noise, but it also turned off and on through the night.…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good place to stay one night,"A very correct place to spend one night when you have been flying for more than twenty hours. Unfortunatly, breakfast is included just until 9 in the morning, which is very early for the travellers who had arrived the nigth before",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Wester Plus,"It was a great stay, I am very please to have stayed at Best Western. The Hotel staff was very informative and very helpful to all my need and questions. Love the fact that It has a pool that my kids can enjoy and have fun",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worse than expected,"Had to wait about 7 minutes at front desk before attendant arrived to take care of 3 arriving customers waiting for attendant to show up.  Attendant stated had been trying to find luggage carts upstairs in the hotel.  Email sent to Best Western:  ""We only stayed in the room a couple of hours though we had planned to spend the night.  Called front desk.   Couldn't get anyone to fix the air conditioning and the room was too hot!  AC unit was only blowing out small amount of minimally cool air.  The refrigerator had mold in it and I cleaned out a good portion of the mold.  There was no knob on the dial to control the temperature of the refirgerator and I think it was too warm -- the freezer area was watery, not icey.     My son washed some stains off the shower floor when he…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very Comforting,A very clean and organized hotel. The staff was very friendly and it was helpful to know there was a shuttle to the airport every 30 minutes. The rooms had lots of space and were very comfortable. Definitely would stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very Good Best Western,I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a very clean accommodation. All staff where very friendly and very helpful. Breakfast is the traditional BW breakfast and was very good. Close to airport and shuttle service provided. Eating establishments very close.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,No sleep,Room was above the lobby so there was constant noise from guests and the opening and closing of the main entrance door.  Air conditioning was extremely loud and didn't cool to the desired temperature.  We were trying to get a few hours sleep before an early morning flight.  It didn't happen.  ,1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"serviceable in a foul, unwelcoming airport","First, Denver Airport is in the middle of a cornfield 25 miles from downtown.  There is ONE wildly expensive hotel which is part of the airport itself.  A group of less expensive hotel huddle 5 1/2 miles away.  This is one of those.  It is acceptable and reasonably priced.  Nothing here to write home about however; you might as well be in the middle of North Dakota driving endlessly across country.  I would/will stay here again out of necessity, but will avoid Denver airport which is chaotic, badly organized, filled with sort of claustrophobic-making decorations everywhere. It really has some of the worst, most unpleasant TSA staff people in the country.  I'm fed up with the place; Phoenix or DFW or ORD are much better transfer points.   This review of the Best Western is very…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Dingy room, stained linens","Typically like BW but this location was disappointing. Room not vacuumed, bed appeared broken and not 'maid' well. Staff never looked up from phone during departure. Linens were stained. Elevator creaking, concerning. ",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Western Trip 2017,This hotel location is very close to the Denver Airport.  We chose it because we had a morning flight out.  It is grouped in an area where there is a selection of restaurants to  chose from.  If you turn your rental in early they have shuttle service to the airport.  The staff are friendly and the hotel is fairly new.  Great value for the price,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good convenient stay,"Needed a place for 5 to stay close to the airport for a Colorado trip.  Booked about 6 months in advance (cancelable rate) and paid around $100 for the room.  Well worth it.    Arrived at DIA and called for the shuttle.  Told it came at 15 and 45 after.  We missed the 15 after, and we were in the wrong spot for the 45 after.  I knew I needed door 512, didn't realize there was an east and west side.  Once I looked at a DIA map I realized what we did.  Shuttle dropped off at a few other hotels in the area.  Heather at check in was very friendly.  Unfortunately we were assigned a room that was yet to be cleaned.  We went back down and they held our luggage and directed us to the Tower Bar and Grille (10% discount when staying at BW) which was close since we didn't have…",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Disappointing,We've stayed at BW's before and they were better than this.  Would not stay here again.  Rooms should be assumed non-smoking unless specified.  Ick.  A/C not working properly.  Just overall disappointed.  I know it's a cheaper hotel but that should equate to gross.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,This is a great hotel with an extremely useful shuttle to the airport.,The shuttle drivers were especially courteous and helpful with bags and directions. The breakfast was delicious. The hotel staff were helpful and very polite. I absolutely will stay there again. Good price for great service. Value for money. ,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Excellent Staff, Large Rooms","The front desk staff was outstanding on check-in on the afternoon of July 11th, but not very friendly when checking out at 6:00 AM on July 12th.  The room was quite large, the beds were comfortable, and the A/C worked very well on a hot day.  The airport shuttle left on time.    Note that the sink is in the room rather than in the bathroom.     My only complaint is that some inconsiderate person in another room was smoking, and the smoke permeated into the hallway and into our room.  After I complained to the front desk, it did not recur.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean hotel,We stopped here on our way to Colorado Springs.  This hotel was great.  Clean rooms and the staff was excellent.  Check in was quick and the staff called to make sure that our room was in perfect condition and if we needed anything.  They suggested a restaurant close by within walking distance of the hotel and it was great.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Top Rate,"Computer was down at check in, but the desk people were outstanding in taking care of us.  Even ran up to the third floor and got us ice.  Very helpful with extra towels and a roll away bed that we hadn't reserved.  Excellent place to stay.  We have stayed here several times and each time was enjoyable.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great place to stay,"This was a great hotel experience.  Used the pool and hot tub, soft towels, great smelling room, comfy bed.  Would stay there again!  Breakfast was great as well!  Great location if you are using the airport or if you don't mind driving.  Happy staff which is the energy that passed on to me as the client.  Thank you for a great nights sleep and great place which we will return to!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not a very good choice.,"Our TV didn't work; they definitely need new beds - bed sunk into middle so that we neither one could stay out of the ""ditch"".  Not a good night's sleep needless to say.  Also, the reason we booked here was the shuttle to the airport.  Upon check in we find that the ""shuttle is full so not available"".  Staff gave us local taxi phone numbers to make our own way to airport - taxi costs us $25.00.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Denver DIA,"Great experience, very helpful and clean. I was able to check in early and the room was already cooled off when entering and front desk staff got us scheduled for airport shuttle service for the next day ",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"A pleasant, relaxing stay","The Best Western Plus DIA Inn & Suites at 7020 Tower Rd was a superb choice for our family stay the night before a flight.  The hotel's staff was pleasant, gracious, efficient and professional in all areas.  The fitness room and swimming pool were open extended hours, and breakfast was served beginning at 6:00 a.m.   We couldn't have made a more comfortable, inviting choice, only five miles from the airport, with a shuttle service to boot!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Clean, convenient to DIA, and efficient","We stayed for two days on layover and the hotel was great - clean, neat, and fairly new looking.  The staff was friendly and courteous and mad us feel welcome. Note that there are not a lot of food options nearby if you are without a car.  If you are looking for something inexpensive to eat, your choices are the hotel concoction or the nearby gas station.   The shuttle was quick and easy to use.  Laundry room needs some help - some of the dryers don't dry well and there is no change machine.  We ended up having to go to the gas station to get quarters because the front desk was out.",4

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good spot for overnight stay close to the airport,We stayed at the hotel one night shorten our trip from the Colorado mountains to Independence Missouri.  Our son and his wife were flying in  from Oregon to the Denver airport and the free shuttle got them to the hotel quickly and efficiently.  That was greatly appreciated given that their flight  had been delayed in takeoff and they arrived in the wee hours of the morning.  Room and breakfast area were very clean and well maintained.  Breakfast selection was good and kept fresh for the late risers. All in all a good experience.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Be wary...,"I booked through a third party and when arrived at the hotel they required to see a bank card (even though I was paying by cash). They charge a holding fee. After showing my bank card, my account was hacked.Bed was comfy, but the Jacuzzi in our room didn't work.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,You can do better,"We paid a lot for this hotel and we were expecting a great value for the price, but unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. The room was clean, but the bathroom had products that weren't ideal. The little 'goodie bag' they gave us (since we couldn't have breakfast due to when we had to catch our flight) was an orange (not easy to eat quickly), a bottle of water, and a small fruit bar. A nice thought, but not practical at all. Just felt a little ripped off.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great service from staff,"I checked in late and left early and the check-in person was sooooo helpful.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Nice, comfortable room and good service.",The person behind the counter at arrival was very helpful and courteous.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very pleasant stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Hotel was very clean. Recently painted, as the smell of fresh paint was still in the air. Comfortable and roomy enough. The staff was great and very helpful with suggestions of where to eat.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Stay,"Clean, attractive and the staff was very friendly.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean inside and usually helpful staff.,"Very nice hotel and convenient to Denver airport.  Staff not always available at reception desk for assistance; you have to call out to them for help.  Also, be very careful with your reservations.  If you add another night for a reservation, make sure they also keep your original night reservation.  I added a night, and they canceled my night before my flight and told me it was there.  I lucked out that they had a room.  Trash was overflowing in the morning in the trash receptacle outside the front door.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Perfect 1 night stay,"Staff was friendly and helpful. Airport shuttle ran on time and the drivers were friendly and efficient. Room was clean. We did not stay for breakfast, but it was being set out on time. We only stayed one night, but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The rooms were a bit more expensive than what we usually pay, but seemed about right compared to the surrounding hotel prices.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,It Served It's Purpose,"We stayed here overnight so we wouldn't have to drive up from Colorado Springs for our morning flight out.  We had room 329 (I had requested top floor/quiet room).  It was pretty clean and spacious with a great view of the field and DIA in the distance.  The room configuration is 2 queens and a sofa bed.  Great breakfast and easy transportation to DIA by shuttle in the morning.  The worst part was bad neighbors.  They got in late and it sounded like they were having a wrestling match next door so none of us got much sleep.  In all, I'd stay there again and hope for better neighbors.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean and convenient ,"This was a very efficiently run and clean hotel. The shuttle was punctual.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Don't use the fold - out couch bed!,"The fold-out couch bed was terribly uncomfortable! It was difficult to get any sleep and I felt every spring as it dug into me. Also, the restroom by the pool had several problems. The men's was out of order, the women's had no light the first day, and the second day the women's had a door where the lock did not work. My daughter and I both had men walk in on us while we were using the restroom. However, the receptionists were all wonderful.",2

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,It's fine,I've stayed here a few times when flying out of DIA.  There's nothing wrong with the place that I've ever found except...there is no reason to pay as much as you do for as old as this hotel is. It's not too run down but it just has that 1980s feel to it. It is convenient for the it's location just overpriced.,3

As usual, the breakfast included varied items that enticed the kids and the adults.  Above all, the staff was accommodating and friendly.

Many times I am getting in late and just leaving in the morning.  I want somewhere safe, clean and comfortable.  Price for value will often lead me to BW+.  I always forget how great it is.  Often times I am impressed with how nice the properties are and the staff and rooms are always way better then I anticipate.  I ask myself, why do I stay at those other places....Usually because I have to get a ton of stays to be treated like a customer instead of a passer by ;-(.  Good job BW+ it is always a pleasure",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Above average for a BW,"Staff was very nice, kind and courteous, even when busy. Room was about average for a BW.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Just Average,"Very clean.  Friendly staff for the most part.  Convenient location to the Denver airport.  Several restaurants nearby.  Rather noisy.  Lots of noise from kids running around the room upstairs and lots of noise from the hall.  My room was across from the guest laundry.  That could have been noisy, too, but I don't think anyone used it the one night I was there.  Breakfast looked okay, not great, just okay, but someone (staff? another guest?) threw my food out when I went back to the buffet to pick something up.  Bizarre.  Have never had that happen before.  Desk staff apologized, but by then the shuttle was arriving and it was too late to get more food.    Airport shuttle is convenient.  Bed was hard.",3

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Pleasant Stay!,"Stayed one night at Best Western Plus at the Denver Airport in a suite.  It was very convenient in that they provided a shuttle every 30 minutes (on the 15 and 45 minutes of each hour) from the airport.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The breakfast bar had a good variety - carbs, eggs, sausage, hot and cold cereal, fruit, and juices. The cost for the suite was very reasonable and we would definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,May 2017,Awesome beds.  Fantastic staff.  Close to the airport.  Only problem is that the signage for the hotel is non-existent.  The hotel sits back from the main road and their sign is way too small to see.  I had to call for directions.  But do NOT let that hold you back from staying at this hotel.  Well worth the money.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best in the West,"I originally had a reservation for the Estes Park property.  The weather altered our plan of seeing the Rocky Mountain NP.  The snow storm closed the entire park.  No eastern roads were open.  We booked online with Kenneth, who was very helpful with my cancellation problem.  It was resolved to my satisfaction, and we booked the BW closest to the airport.  My stay was very relaxing and simple to get to the car rental return.  Two thumbs up.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Horrible ,Definitely not worth our family trip down here. We checked in and the hot tub was drained and unusable. The pool is supposedly heatedbut definitely not. Ruby at front desk said we could go use holiday inn express's hot tub. We got over there and she was pretty upset that we were told that we could do that. Its a big insurance/liability issue. I am very disappointed since our family night out was a bust. I was told management wouldn't be in until Monday. They will definitely be hearing from me.,2

Since the hotel was fully booked, they could not change it. I heard noise in the hallway (people leaving/coming) and above me. The staff is friendly and helpful. the shuttle bus is very convenient (although finding the proper stop/time table for it at the airport was a challenge). There is a 7-11 nearby. I did not take breakfast so I cannot judge that. all in all, I'd stay here again for the convenience and comfort.",4

Six months later when we were up and ready to head to the airport at 3:30 AM, I was told that the hotel's parking policy had changed and that we would need to find somewhere else to park for the week, as it wasn't prepaid at the time of booking!

When we arrived, we were exhausted and went right to sleep. Once I woke up, I found pieces of bacon in my bed....which I definitely didn't put there. The floor had clearly not been vacuumed, and as I walked around I kept getting crumbs and bits stuck to my feet. If it's your only option, it's definitely doable.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not up to the Normal BW Standards,"We stayed here the night before our early morning flight due to an incoming snow storm.   We had previously stayed at the Best Western Plus in Castle Rock, Colorado and had a wonderful experience.   Because of that experience we chose this hotel because it was a good rate and close to the airport so that we wouldn't have to drive 40+ minutes in the snow.  To start off, parking around the hotel is horrible.  We were told while checking in that several hotels share the parking and to ""just find a place"" which ended up being pretty far away from the hotel so my poor husband had to walk through the cold and snow to get back to the hotel.  The room is very dark, the only light switches close to the entrance door is to the bathroom and to the light over the vanity.  You can't turn on the lights near the bed except manually and even with those on it is dark.  The vanity is next the sleeping area outside the bathroom.  When we went to take a shower there were no wash clothes in the bathroom but next to the sink in the sleeping area so my husband called out to check to see if I could locate wash clothes. I personally do not like this set up because when you have an early riser who likes to shave and needs light, the other person who may want to sleep can't due to the noise and light.  The light over the sink needed new bulbs because it was very dark and hard to see to put on makeup.  The bathroom had a vent in the ceiling but either did not work when the light was turned on or there was no switch that turned it on separately.   A vent would certainly help with bathroom odors which other hotels we have stayed in all had vents to help eliminate odors.   The toilet was the lowest toilet I have ever used.  I recently had a knee replacement and had a hard time bending my knee enough to sit down, it also rocked so it needs to be screwed to the floor.  There was mildew everywhere in the bathroom, around the baseboards and along the grout in the tub.  It is something a little extra housecleaning would take care of, it was disgusting.    Also the bathroom floors could stand to be cleaned better.  We had a king bed with 4 pillows and none of the pillows were even the size of a standard pillow.   They were so worn that the inside of the pillows were bumpy and felt like small balls, not comfortable at all. Considering it was 30 degrees outside our room was hot!  We turned on the A/C but still had to sleep on top of the covers!   I imagine most of the issue with circulating air was due to the heavy curtains flowing out over the A/C and trapping the cooler air behind them.  The only way to prevent that would have not to close the curtains but then you have the lights in the parking lot streaming through the window.  To top everything off, the electricity went off 3 separate times from about 11:00 pm to 11:30 pm.  Each time it went off and came back on our phones would ding since we were charging them and the A/C would turn off and on.  No clue what that was about but it woke both of us up.  Breakfast was ok but because there were so many people we had to take it back to our room to eat because there was nowhere to sit.  I would recommend checking out the other hotels in the area.  I didn't expect all the issues that we had especially since we had just spent several days at the BW Plus in Castle Rock and it was beautiful - it was like staying at a Four Seasons and then a 1 star hotel!",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Vacation!,"Best Western Plus in Denver was a great place to stay!  The location was convenient (near the airport), they had free shuttle service, and the staff were extremely nice!  My husband and I arrived early, and Abbie let us go ahead and check in!  We would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Wasted my Rewards points,"Where do I start, how about with check in since that started my stay. The front desk clerk was less than friendly, almost rude. In fact when I returned the luggage cart she was arguing with the shuttle driver over a personal matter.  At breakfast the next morning the staff worker who was taking care of the food was also handling cleaning chemicals AND the food at the same time, how is that OK?  This is a BW Plus, supposed to be a higher standard than a regular BW but it is the worst one I have stayed at. I am a regular at one that is 50 years old and staffed by a much friendlier staff and in much better shape.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel with good service. The rooms were comfy and clean. It would have been nice to know that the hot tub was down, because after a long day on the road it's something to look forward to. And you have to be prepared for noisy people at the morning hours. I was woken up around 5. Also while in the shower I hit my head off the bar!  Nice for handicapped but not for those who can't see well!Otherwise a nice stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good value,"We were bumped from our fight in Denver and had to find a place to stay.  We looked on the internet and chose Best Western because it had a 24 hour shuttle to the airport, and a buffet breakfast.  Detailed directions on how to find the shuttle were given in an automated message. The shuttle was easy to find; the room was very spacious and comfortable and had both a fridge and a microwave..  The breakfast was fine though the eggs were a little runny and the juices were a little watered down.  There was a waffle maker.and plenty of other choices.  The desk clerk gave us free toothpaste samples when we asked.  The shuttle was on time in the morning and took us to the airport within 10 minutes.  The price came to about $124.00  Very good value.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best deal around!,"The staff is friendly and the rooms are clean.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Just ""okay"" - there are better 3-star hotels in the area.","Room - clean. Beds--made my daughter sneeze for some reason. Pool - needs cleaning--doesn't look clean--doesn't have that nice ""clear blue"" look.   Good lighting in the room. TV - too small and remote not user friendly.  Front Desk - very helpful and friendly.  Room service - good.  Shower - very low water pressure, perhaps that has to do with being on the third floor...?  Bathroom looked and felt ""clean"". Suggestion for bathroom: Can there please be a hanging hook on the back of the bathroom doors to hang a towel or housecoat? Thin walls - I was continuously exposed to hallway ""jibber-jabber"" as well as next door and adjacent room ""jibber-jabber"", which, was nothing more than folks simply talking.  Elevator frequently wet due to pool traffic - this is a potential safety hazard.  Not just this hotel, but it's time for all hotels to offer some gluten-free items in their breakfast buffet considering the fact that wheat and gluten are becoming common allergens.",3

""I don't know, we're pretty full"" she said.  Excuse me?  One of the main reasons I booked here was because it was close to the airport and had a shuttle service.  Since I was traveling later in the morning, it was OK.  But keep that in mind if you book here and need an early morning shuttle.  Now for the room.  I unpacked a few things, got into my pajamas and wanted to wash my face and go to bed.  But, no washcloths in the room.  I had to use a hand towel.

The suite had a queen size bed and a Huge jacuzzi in the middle of the room!  We went to hotel staff to see if we could get 2 rooms with 2 beds.  The hotel was booked and we were unable to get 2 rooms with 2 beds, but managed to get one room. We really wanted a good night sleep as we were planning to hit the slopes the next day.  The hotel staff was polite and tried to accommodate us.   The indoor pool and hot tub were both green.  We did not participate in the complimentary breakfast.  It was crowded and quite a mess.…",2

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Terrible stay,"My sister, my husband and I bought several itens on-line and sent them to the hotel before our arrival.When we got there, we notice one of them was missing so we asked the front desk attendant to check where it was. Sellers website was informing one of the employees had signed off the delivery, but nobody could locate the package. They said it was probably locked inside a room and the only person with the key, the manager, had already left and would only be back the next day, at 8am. As the item was my sister's and she was leaving to Brazil the next day at 6:30am, we ask them to call the manager and explain the situation so we can open the door sooner. They said they could do nothing because it was to late to make a call (10pm). Then we reenforced that my sister couldn't leave her item behind and they said they were sorry!!! That's it!Alternatively, I sad I would be checking out the next day at 9am, so I could take the package with me. I only needed to make sure it was inside the locked room, because they kept saying me they had already given us all the delivered packages. Nobody was able to ensure the package was there, not even the person who had signed off the delivery. The only thing they did was trying to reach the manager by email.The next day, the manager was late and unavailable. We were offered a discount on the price of the night we had spent there, but the entire reservation was worth about 4 times less then the item locked up. Surprisingly the only solution they had at that point was to leave the package behind anyway and be happy with a discount!!The manager finally got there at 9:40, opened the door and didn't say anything us, not even an apology. We were already late for our flight, so we left in a rush taking the package.I don't recommend anyone to stay at this hotel. They are not prepared to deal with the trouble they criate to their guests. They failed taking the package to our room, and failed badly finding a solution to the problem they have criated. They had about 12 hours to manage openning a simple door and didn't actually do anything about it. It was preposterous!",1

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Terrible stay,"This hotel was awful.  The bathroom was not very clean (hairs on the floor, shoe marks, etc).  We had a room with a whirlpool tub and I would never step foot in the tub - it looked really old and just gross.  Now to move on to the actual worst part about this hotel...We came to vacation and explore Colorado and figured we'd stay near the airport.  We checked in and went up to our room to relax from our super early flight.  Not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES someone successfully entered our room without knocking.  Thankfully we had the top lock secured so whoever was trying to enter our room was not able to get far.  There was no ""Do Not Disturb"" sign to place on the door - we looked everywhere for one. The first two times we yelled out ""Hello?"" and no answer.  We called the front desk to make them aware and they said they would monitor it.  The third time I was near the door getting ready and opened it to see who it was.  Housekeeping.  She apologized and said she'd bring a DND sign. That same day we checked in, we realized that there was no hot water in the shower.  As we were leaving for the evening we let front desk know and the assistant manager assured us that she would have it fixed by the time we got back.We got back around 9pm and talked to front desk to confirm the hot water was fixed.The next morning, we tried to take a shower and realized there was no hot water.  The front desk told us they wouldnt have someone there to fix it until 8PM!  At this point, we have been unable to have a hot shower for over 24 hours.  We packed up  and decided to leave. I was able to find a nearby hotel with vacancy. We had to wait for the assistant manager to arrive that morning otherwise the front desk gentleman wanted to charge us for the night's stay.The one compliment on this hotel is that the assistant manager was super helpful and respectful.  She didnt have us pay for the night, apologized and offered a room to shower and freshen up.",1

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Poor hotel near Denver airport,The hotel does not have rooms that are suites. The rooms are too tight for a family of 5. 2 Dould beds and a pull out couch does not make the room a suite. Also the rooms are too loud. The HVAC system needs to be fixed. ,2

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great for Early Flight,"The property is located close to the airport, and they provide a shuttle to get you there.  They also pickup at the airport. We stayed the night before our very early flight to avoid the 25 mile drive to the airport.  Our room was clean and comfortable--nicely decorated but not overwhelming.  My husband especially appreciated the hot tub.  We were able to have an included quick breakfast before boarding the shuttle.  We would definitely stay again for airport access.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great location and super clean.,We had a layover and stayed at this hotel twice.  Great location with several restaurants within walking distance.  Super clean and quiet without a lot of airport noise.  The girls at the counter went out of their way to send me tips for finding the shuttle and making sure are stay was not stressful at all. The breakfast was decent and made my day start out great.  Good Job.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice Hotel people in need of training,We were checked out by the desk one day early.This caused us to get locked out of our room and our room was not cleaned. We only had two wash clothes in the room. When the cleaning gal came to the room after we complained. She acted as if she was being put out leaving what she was doing to come and clean our room.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Airport travel hotel,"Perfectly adequate for short pre and post flight stays. Clean, comfortable and convenient. Great price relative to competition. Wish I'd booked earlier for the park and fly option. Would have saved $70 in airport parking for two day trip.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Early morning flight options,"Best Western + offers a Park and Fly option for those needing to catch a seriously early flight from DIA; the parking is valid for 2 weeks, so for vacationers this can be a real savings over off-site or airport parking.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Business trip to Denver,"Was looking for something near the airport because of late arrival and early departure times. Although it's far from the city center, it's perfect if you want something near the airport at an affordable rate. Free shuttle service to and from the airport all day. Definitely no frills but was clean and adequate for my needs.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Super fantastic friendly staff!  Loved my quick stay!,"Great stay just overnight for a flight out.  Room was really comfy and nice, had everything I needed.  Good shuttle service to airport.  The real highlight was the staff--two ladies checked me in--super friendly, seemed genuine, free upgrade (i'm a member of their plan) and a coupon for a local restaurant.  Hard to find genuine staff who convince you they actually care!  Sorry i did not get their names as they both exceeded my expectations!  (Even asked about my  travel the following week and asked if I was looking at a BW at my destination--not selling just a nice business touch).  Would definitely return.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Cold Weather Vacay,"This hotel was newly remodeled, very clean, VERY convenient to the airport.  The shuttle drive was very friendly, especially for a 5a shuttle drive to catch our 7a departure.  The hotel we near a few restaurants that were within walking distance - which was great since we had dropped our rental off the day prior to flying out.  The staff were VERY helpful, VERY friendly and happy to help us with any questions we had.  The bathroom had a few spots that needed repairing, but overall, we had a good experience.  I would stay here again, and I'm a germaphobic. ;o)",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Easy and convenient,"Everything about this stay was convenient and easy. I arrived at the hotel to find available parking, even late night, close to the entrance of the hotel. When I went into the lobby, nobody was there to check me in, which I understood at the late hour. After about 10 minutes, the employee came to the counter and apologized for not being there. He already had my check-in processed and I was in my room in under 60 seconds. The room was fine. The bed was comfortable enough. The shower had good temperature and decent pressure. The amenities in the bathroom were fine. I got a decent amount of sleep and was off to the airport in the morning.Overall, this hotel served its purpose as a convenient, clean, and safe hotel close to the airport. I would return.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,It was a great location near airport,The staff at the front desk was very pleasant and friendly. The breakfast items can improve with more yogurt and fruit offerings. But overall the service was very good and good value for the very low rate I received.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Horrible experience,"This hotel needs to be updated and cleaned up.  Their room cleaning staff needs to be fired.  Our bathroom had pink mildew and whoever had the room before us must have been smokers because they had wrapped a towel around the smoke detector,  I do not see how the staff could have missed this when they cleaned because it was the first thing we noticed when we walked in.  There were black stains on the sheets and there were pills on the floor from the previous occupants.  The wind whistled through the windows and we got absolutely no sleep.  The toilets were so low to the floor that a persons knees were practically dragging on the floor.  If we only would have spent $100 we would have been less disappointed but the bill came to over $200 which was very expensive for this disgusting…",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good park n fly location,"We stayed before flying out of DIA and left our car there for a little over a week.  The hotel rooms were clean, beds were comfortable, parking was available.  The kids enjoyed the swimming pool.  The only slight glitch was that they told us when we booked our shuttle for 4:30am that they would have grab and go breakfasts available.  When we got down about 10-15 minutes before the shuttle time there was 1 grab and go breakfast left - we had six people in our group!  Perhaps if they intend to offer grab and go breakfasts to shuttle guests, they should keep them behind the counter and make enough for all shuttle passengers, rather than leaving them in the lobby and telling guests that there is one left.  We had our kids split it - not a very impressive breakfast anyway - 1 apple,…",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Good price, good breakfast",Stayed here in Dec. for 2 nights. Got a real good price through AAA. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. The breakfast was good and they also gave you a discount coupon for dinner at Tower restaurant down the street. Free airport shuttle. I would stay here again.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,We will definitely stay again!,"We made a last minute reservation due to weather and early departure from Denver International Airport. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. Our stay was brief but couldn't have been more seamless. Our flight left at 6 AM, prior to complimentary breakfast. There were snack bags prepared for each of the guests taking the airport shuttle for early flights. Thank you Best Western DIA for exceptional customer service.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Convenient, reasonably priced airport hotel","Sheets were worn and pillowcases were pilly.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Great service, good price",Last minute reservations were very easy to set up. Conveniently located by DIA with shuttle service to the airport and short term parking on site. Also close to restruants and very easy to get to from the interstate. ,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Stopover hotel,This is a great hotel if looking for a brief stopover. This is only because of its location. It is set amongst a number of other hotels close to Denver International Airport and there is nothing else there.  It was quite tricky to find as it is set back off the road with only the name Best Western Plus.  I arrived later than planned - about 2:30am - and the girl on the desk was great. I was only staying for one night before heading for Fort Collins. Although checkout was not until 12 noon the girl told me she would extend that until 2pm just in case I needed it for no extra charge. The room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was a basic buffet but was all good. The fruit juice machine was pouring out sludge though which although reported a number of times by customers was…,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great value and staff,Great quick shuttle acces ro and from the Denver International airport.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Poor service, breakfast not good!",elevator not working but no help was offered to hep me carry a crib to 3rd floor considering that it is so obvious that i have injury in my hand. Not much selection for breakfast. Room is acceptable but could use better lightning,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Overall Convenient and Affordable ,This hotel is located very close to the airport and there is a shuttle that will take you there and back. We were also able to park our car at the hotel for a reasonable price. The staff was very friendly and my husband and I had a great night! The only criticism I have is that the bathroom (specifically the bathtub) was a little less clean then I would like it to be. I'm sure not all of the bathrooms were like that though because overall the hotel was very clean. ,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,easy access to airport.,"Trips to and from the airport convenient, rooms could be cleaner, staff at breakfast should take off the head phones and keep the place clean and stocked. Okay but room was not really clean when we arrived and we were not offered any compensation or option when staff was alerted.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Early flight sleepover,An excellent place to stay to catch an early flight out of DIA. Very accommodating regarding scheduling shuttle rides to the airport in the morning. Friendly and helpful staff.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Overnight Stay,We were very pleased with the price as well as the location of the hotel.  Since we were flying in and out it helped us cut down time to airport.  Breakfast the next morning was great and we were able to walk to a restaurant the evening before. We were traveling in/out so it was quick and easy.  The staff was helpful and rooms were acceptable.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a quality,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Where to stay DIA COLORADO,"The Best Western Plus has a Fabulous Staff and amenities in an excellent area to get to DIA via shuttle. Their ""Stay and Fly"" program is super. WE have stayed at this hotel several times and highly recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Great for value, hotel shuttle was an added bonus","Not much going on in the area will need uber\lyft or rental to get to down town area,which is about 30-45 min drive. The bar\_restaurant across the street was not good, but it was the only thing in the area open late.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Awesome!,Great staff and overall an amazing experience. Best place to stay ever!!! I stayed at other properties but this one is absolutely the best. I try and stay at best western properties every chance I can for the best service. My personal favorite of chain hotels!!,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western Minus,"We chose this hotel based on good reviews, but we were somewhat disappointed.  There was a power outage when we checked in (not the hotel's fault), which meant that we had to haul our bags up three flights to our room.  The furnishings seemed to be of lower quality than at other Best Westerns, and the bathroom reminded us of cheaper airport hotels (e.g., Super 8) that we've stayed at in the past.  The breakfast room was very small, so we had to share a large table with another family (whiny kids first thing in the morning--ugh!).  Another complaint is that the hotel was hard to find from Tower Road; since there's no sign, we had to drive around behind other hotels until we found it.  There are plenty of other hotels on Tower Road, and we'd definitely choose a different place next time.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great place near the airport,We had a very late flight and got into the airport and got our rental car by 1:30 am.  They was someone at the front desk who was awake and alert and nice to talk to for checking us in.  Hotel is nice enough and no complaints.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Experience,"Shower was hot (a priority for me), shuttle timely and driver polite and helpful. 15 minutes to DIA; good nearby restaurants. Room clean, comfortable king bed with sleeper sofa. Room rate plus extended parking cheaper than airport parking services.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Atmosphere,"After a long trip driving with our family of six I was exhausted and tired. The front desk greeted me very nicely and informed me that our original request was not met, however they were able to accommodate us to the best of their ability. This was a wonderful feeling. All of the staff was very pleasant and went out of the way to make sure everything was taken care of. This was the second time staying at this hotel and it is always a pleasant experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great find,"Not far from the airport.  It is basically part of a hotel farm... with eight hotels in a row.  The area is suburban, but its not too long of a drive to downtown Denver.  Breakfast was fairly good.  The manager left a customized letter upon arrival... as I am a rewards member.  Stayed in a suite room, which was very nice.   Housekeeping was excellent.  The pool was a little cold, but the hot tub was nice.  Both are open 24/7.  I stayed for a week... and the laundry facility was a nice bonus.  Free airport shuttle was also a plus.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great nights sleep!,"Due to a not so pleasant experience at another facility at the beginning of our trip we got a room here on the return trip. I'm so glad we did, checking in was a breeze and the front desk gentleman was beyond helpful. Facility was clean, beds were comfy and a bonus - free WIFI.  Also, if this is something that might be helpful to you with the legalization of marijuana in Colorado - this facility has a zero tolerance for smoking in the rooms and they ask that you will call the front desk if you smell it and charge a hefty fee for anyone caught smoking in their room. Our last motel was awful and we could hardly breath or stay in our room due to the heavy pot smoking.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great airport hotel,"We were picked up from Denver airport by the hotel shuttle and dropped at the door. Check-in was smooth and fast, the room was great, spacious, clean (we had one with the hot tub). Great overnight location. We only stayed one night with an early morning shuttle getting us to the airport for our flight out.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Close to Airport... Free Shuttle,"This is close to the airport off Tower Road with easy airport access by free shuttle. I noticed a lot of airline crews use the hotels in this area. The Best Western is very average and what you would expect at this type of price point. Clean, comfortable and basic. Not as nice as the the nearby Fairfield Inn but I would not let that stop you from staying here. You can also walk to a nearby bar and grill. Breakfast included. I found the staff very polite and helpful. They were able to assist me in charging my phone which was a big plus. I would stay here again if I needed to and would recommend this hotel if you need to stay by the airport for any reason.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,great place,"Best Western Plus was a very nice place to stay.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great place to stay for connecting flights,"I spent the night here on Monday as part of an ""adjustment' Frontier made to my trip itinerary.  They have nice beds and pillows, a friendly guest services desk and there was not a thing I could complain about. The breakfast was as expected with fruit and boiled eggs too.  24 hour lemon infused cold water was quite refreshing after the flight and a welcome treat. The shuttle was right on time and was a deciding factor in making my decision to stay at this hotel. I've come to appreciate the Best Western brand and will look for more.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very comfortable,"We always enjoy staying at Best western Hotels.  The beds are so comfortable, and the rooms are nice and usually roomy, compared to some hotels where there is not much room to move around the bed, or between bed and TV.  The Breakfasts are always good, even if we do not like all of the choices, there are many things to choose from to be able to have a very good breakfast before leaving for the day.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice Hotel,"There was construction in the parking lots all around this hotel and the others nearby when we were there--that wasn't easy to get around.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Second time stay, two years later","My daughter and I chose this hotel because it had the free regular shuttle service from the airport and free breakfast, plus we stayed here two years ago for one night and it was fine.  Our flight arrived late evening so it was good to get the shuttle.  I had rung the hotel before we flew to Denver and they told us which airport exit door and which shuttle stand, so it was easy to find where to go to pick up our hotel shuttle. The reception staff were friendly and our room was clean and comfortable. I was impressed with the lady who prepared the breakfast buffet - there seemed to be only one cook but she was on top of it all, not letting anything run out, plus clearing tables when people finished. Breakfast buffet had the waffle machine which we liked, too. Coffee was good. I…",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"First time stay here, booked for 2 stays...","Friendly staff, rooms are not really all that large as the table seems to be rather big for the rooms.  The bathrooms do not have fans in them which is not a good idea on their part.  Looks like they had them at one time but for some reason they have been disabled.  Auto storage is available @ $8.00 per day, shuttle pick up is on the 15 and the 45.  They do serve a hot breakfast.  If an issue arrises they are promt to address it.  Easy access to Tower Road and close to several places to eat or have a drink if you prefer.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Shuttle service for an early morning flight- perfect,"This is a great little find, inexpensive BW with a very reliable shuttle service operating 24 hours a day.  Easy check in, nice room, clean and comfortable. I was staying in Colo Springs, but with a 6:00 am flight out of DIA,  I wanted a stress free plan to get to the airport. Perfect  for what I was looking for. Upon registering, sign up for the shuttle departure time that works for you.  Runs every half hour.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Some issues, but staff was friendly","Dated hotel that needs a larger parking lot, but at least the street was well-lit.  Convenient location if you want to be close to the airport.  The place seemed clean enough, but the carpets need to be replaced and one of our beds was terribly lumpy.  The staff was nice at check-in.  But when we had problems accessing our room due to the door being jammed, we went back down to the main floor where they told us to try lifting the handle a different way.  We trudged back upstairs, but it was still jammed.  I made my way a third time when finally one of the ladies agreed to come with me to open the door.  She agreed that it was totally stuck, but then slammed her body against the door, which finally opened.  Okayyyyy.  We’ll be doing that at 1AM to pick up my family!   …",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A good alternative for an overnight stay near Denver International Airport,"We selected this hotel based on 4 factors: it had good reviews on the travel sites I prefer, it is close to the airport, it offered reasonable rates, and it offered a complimentary hotel shuttle.   We (2 adults, 2 children (ages 11 & 7)) flew into Denver as a jumping-off point for a road trip to explore National Parks in the west. Our flight landed at around 11 p.m. local time, so it was 11:30 p.m. or so by the time we had claimed our bags and headed out to catch the hotel shuttle.  As other reviewers have noted, the hotel shuttle worked flawlessly.  The shuttle picks up on Level 5, Island 3, in front of door 512 on the West side of the terminal.  Our only objective for that day of our trip was to get safely to the hotel and get a good night's sleep, as our trip was to begin in…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Average at best,"Stayed at this property for one night prior to flying out of Denver Intl Airport. It was the least expensive lodging anywhere close to the airport, and as always, you get what you pay for. The hotel was on the loud side, bed was uncomfortable. Being on the first floor, we did not feel secure as there was non-stop traffic all night long. I wouldn't consider this a Best Western Plus, kind of more like a Motel 6 feel. I won't stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent and Easy,"We would not have changed a thing for our overnight stay. The staff was efficient and helpful. The breakfast was hot and tasty. The ease of checking in and out was nice. The hotel was clean. There was not a lot of parking; we had to park on the street. But the whole area was very well-lit. The hotel was easy to get to, very well-marked, and in a great location - close to the airport and major roads.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Mice in Rooms,"We had a mouse in our room and when we called the front desk, they apologized and said they would tell housekeeping.  We insisted they move us to another room which they did.  In the middle of the night we heard rustling on the desk only to discover another mouse.  Obviously this hotel has a rodent problem.  Needless to say, we did not stay there the night before left to come home",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,a Place that goes above and beyond,"Awesone place nice room, great jaccuzzi   front desk clerk went out of his way to take us to the airport in his personal vehicle when the shuttle didn't have room for us. would definitely recommend  Best Western Plus to friends and family",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great place pre or post flight,Stayed one night prior to early morning flight.

When we came in late at night Andrew was more than accommodating!

We will continue stay here when traveling to and from DIA.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Review,Location was great. The cook did not show up the first day of the visit so very little to eat at breakfast. Air conditioner and TV took a long time to  work. We had to update our card keys about three times. We did not have them near our cell phones but they deactivated them every time. We were there for five  nights. Hot tub did not work as far as the Jets. Personnel were friendly.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,vacation to Denver and south Dak.,Very enjoyable and worry free. smooth seamless service . close to airport and major highways. they need a larger parking area and better signage to make them more clearly seen  from the road. other than that I would recommend them to anyone.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not recommended,after ten days traveling through Colorado this was last spot before flight out at 3am. First room I go to not even cleaned. So I  go down to front desk they give me another room.  I decide to take shower surprise no towels in room.  Once again call to get towels.  They are being  washed. Finally I  get them. Bed is lumpy looking with pillows so tiny good for a toddler maybe.  Holes in pillow cases.  Sorry I  can not recommend.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Lords of the Flies,"DO NOT stay here if you are turned off by fly infestation. We were here in late September and could not believe the devastatingly high number of flies competing for out food. The lobby doubles as the setting for the breakfast area here, but a pair of double doors did not keep them away. They were hanging out all over the ceiling. Staff informed us that management was aware of the problem, but seemingly did nothing to correct it.   In addition, there is a sinkhole-sized pothole near the front entrance.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Stay,"I'm impressed with most everyone that worked there.  Especially Tara.

We were in a corner, so instead of a great view facing east, we faced a wall and had a peek a boo view of the West driveway.    The hot tub jets were down.  That is my wife's favorite amenity.    For a three day stay, our card lasted one day.  I had to have it reprogrammed.  We returned late on our second day to find towels on the floor and an unmade bed.    We've stayed in a lot of Best Western's.  The shower head in our room was very non-standard. It was like the Bargain shower head from a big box store.   The front desk staff is quite friendly. They helped us resolve the towel issue and card key glitch seamlessly.    This hotel has an airport shuttle.  It is close to a number of…",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Denver Airport,"Clean, convenient to airport. A few amenities did not function like the guest printer and spa switch. A good place to stay for the price. Breakfast was very enjoyable. Several other hotels adjacent  so if parking becomes a problem you can always find a spot nearby.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,HOTEL NEAR DENVER AIRPORT,"This is one of several hotels near the Denver Airport. We could not find it initially as it is behind several Hotels on the front of the street. This BW provided a nice breakfast and was in a group of airport hotels 5 miles from the airport. Only problem we had was that in the morning, the elevator was out of order and no one from BW put a sign on the upper floor that they were out of order.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great people lousy facility.,"Every person involved was helpful and friendly; all of the tech services were poor--television, wifi, elevators etc...wifi overloaded as rooms filled, elevator door rumbled all night long even though room was some distance from it, printer did not work for printing boarding passes, breakfast was shut down early, tv was small with very poor and basic channel selections.       The girls at the desk when out of their way to solve issues--including a very early check-in, printing my boarding pass, getting an airport shuttle etc...their names were Tara and Tatyana and there were others--(head of room cleaning for example) who when out of their way.",3

I am an RN...so I KNOW what that means and entails.  YOU WILL NOT get that here.  Don't waste  your money.  Book at Hampton Inn. Like I should have.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,excellent deal,This Best Western Plus is very clean and the rooms were very comfortable.  It has great access to the airport and a nearby restaurant.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  I would definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A quick stop,Arrived in the dark for a one night stay before going to the airport  Hardest thing was just finding the place with road construction in area as well as fact that hotel property is hidden behind other buildings. Check in was easy though we had to carry our bags up several stairs to get to our first floor room.  Able to get our boarding passes printed.  Breakfast was served early enough to get everything we wanted.  Room itself was very nice with two queen beds and space in bathroom to get everything done; shower worked fine with hot water around 10pm available.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Hugely disappointing,"I chose this hotel as we have stayed at similar hotels in the area the past three years.  This was a huge disappointment...first of all check in.  The clerk appeared to not be able to find our reservation form...she kept thumbing through the pile after pulling one...it was ours.  Keeps thumbing several more times..finally stops and picks up the one she had laid out.  She then seemed to have difficulty in getting the key card machine to work. Finally we are given our room assignment and keys.  I asked about parking as there was none out front..I am told to park behind or at one of the other near by hotels.  So, no parking in back...I lucked into ONE spot left at a neighboring hotel.   We lug all our crap up to repack for our flight...and the key does NOT work in the door...and we find out as someone Opens the door that the room was occupied.  So...take all our stuff back down to the desk where we find out that the room with two queens is sold out, even though we have had a reservation paid in advance for several months.  We are ""upgraded"" to a suite with ONE king and a pull out.  So we take it, it is late and we have an early flight.  Additionally at the front of the hotel there is a group of men standing around outside drinking and smoking all during this.  Next am, we head down for breakfast...it is as if a cyclone has hit the room...and the trash outside is overflowing and scattered all around. Cereal is spilled, chairs are askew all over the lobby. I attempted to print our boarding passes on two separate computers and neither will print..plenty of paper, and printer will print test page, but has lost comm with computers. I go to front desk where I wait for 10 minutes while the only clerk tells a caller repeatedly she cannot ok a discount on a room. I finally walk away.  I would definitely to elsewhere.  Oh, and glad I didn't need the iron as it was jammed into place",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great location,"We found the Best Western to suit our needs while we're were in the Denver area. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is good. Eggs/sausage /bacon, cereals, waffles , yogurt. The location works great to get to the airport. I70, 25, etc.  Staff was friendly and helpful.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not clean and too disappointing,"This place needs thorough vacuuming.  There's dust in the halls and the room was not clean. We used the Do Not Disturb sign until 10am because we arrived from overseas and the room maid did not come to our room at all to replace, tidy or clean anything. The bed linen was crumbled and hasn't been ironed in a long, long time. On arrival the receptionist couldn't have been more bored if she tried.Breakfast was okay with simple food, but things weren't replaced (like coffee) for those who arrived after 8am. There are so many other hotels in the immediate area, so we cancelled another 2 night stay we had booked in 4 week's time and booked a room at a much cleaner, more up-to-date premises.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Skip it,"This was a disappointing experience.  I selected this hotel for two reasons:Free airport shuttle:  Here’s the catch – the hotel shares the shuttle with four other hotels, so there is limited space on each shuttle.  I wanted a shuttle at 7 am, but those were all full when I checked in, so I had to take a 3:30 am shuttle.  That defeated the entire purpose of staying at an airport hotel for me.Pool:  I thought the pool would be a good option for my kids to burn off some energy between two long travel days.  When I saw it though, I thought NO WAY.  It was very milky and murky and I wouldn’t put a human in there under any circumstances.Once at the hotel, I found the rooms nasty and the front desk staff too busy chatting with the shuttle driver to care for guests.Take my advice:  Skip the Best Western Denver Airport and find another option.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Standard Airport hotel ,Pretty much what you would expect from an airport hotel. Room was adequate without being anything special. Not impressed by the breakfast offering eggs and sausage USA style is not enough of a choice for me.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Crash Pad,"As a general rule I like Best Western Plus, but this location ranked far below the normal standard. It already looks, feels and smells old. They did accommodate the requests I had made when I had placed my Reservation, thank you, hence the 3 rating. Hey if your only looking for a crash pad close to the airport it's ok, but over priced. Instead of having a door for the closet they had a curtain. The ironing pad had seen better days. The room was very poorly lit, only having wall scones in the actual room. The pullout couch had a terrible sag in the middle. I thought the mini fridge was a dishwasher at first. It was black with white accents, like mix matched repairs not on purpose. The freezer was in bad need of a good thawing. I was checking out before they started serving breakfast so I planned on using the fridge to have a little something to eat before I hit the road. I waited for airport food instead. The parking lot was a joke. I couldn't tell if the little area in front was the lobby or not. All the parking was taken in front by 7pm on a Saturday. There really wasn't any place for a guest to park so they could register. When I inquired as to where to park I was told I could park in the back coming in through the pool area, or access the building through a side door. None of these options made me feel very safe as I was traveling alone. The front desk ladies were nice enough, didn't have time to make you feel comfortable as they seemed to be trying to figure things out themselves. Thankfully I wasn't staying but one night. I did feel the need to strip the bed to make sure the sheets looked ok. I won't be back to this location.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not worthy of Best Western Plus rating,"We were very disappointed with this hotel. Upon checking in, we had to wait to wait for our room to be cleaned. The desk staff seemed to be more interested in chatting among themselves than providing service to customers. The knob on one of the sinks was loose and came off in my hand rendering inoperable. The guest guide stated that HBO was available to travelers. Not so - no HBO at all nor any other premium channels. The guide also stated that the laundry charge was $1.00 for the dryer. Not so - $2.00. The hotel should not be a BW Plus; it should, if anythig, be a straight Best Western. VEry disappointing.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Quick overnight,We arrived by BW shuttle very late at night.  Room clean and fresh. Beds comfortable.  Breakfast was very good.  Rode BW shuttle back to airport next day to pick up rental car.  All went smoothly. Would stay there again.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,The only reason to stay here is the location.,"The hotel was noisy.  The air conditioner wall unit was broken and there were tiny black bugs.  The wall paper was peeling off the wall in the bathroom and there was mold around the tub caulking, The breakfast was even below hotel chain average.  Only stay here if you want to be close tot he airport and you have no other choices",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Late Arrival Reservation For Handicapped Problem,"What a nightmare. We checked in late and did not get the handicap room we needed for my mother-in-law. The room only had 1 washcloth and 1 handtowel. We couldn't get the front desk to answer to bring up another set. All of this at 10:30pm at night. We couldn't even take a shower because it was a tub and we couldn't get into it. The next morning the breakfast was missing bananas, milk, creamer, yogurt and the staff was not replacing the missing items. It wasn't even close to the end of the breakfast time. We didn't get a discount for the messed up reservation and we made it directly with them not Expedia or something. Never again will I use their hotels. Corporate will not stand behind their hotels at all.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Bottom of the barrel ,"To start with, I would give 0 stars if it was an option. As a family of 9 (6 adults 3 children-3,8,10 years of age) landing at DIA, we reserved  3 rooms for an overnight stay on our way to a stay in Estes Park and then a family reunion in Colorado Springs. After an exhausting flight and picking up our rental cars we headed for our hotel and a chance to unwind and get the kids settled down. When we tried to check in we were told we did not have a reservation. And then we were told they had no rooms available. I have no idea and the desk clerk had no idea how or why it was cancelled, but now we have no place to stay. The clerk did make phone calls to nearby hotels with no success. And while asking for availability she kept saying WE cancelled which was very aggravating since WE…",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Very good hotel, but pool water has too much urine odor","Overall this is very good hotel. Lobby, hallway, and guest rooms are all very clean.  However, the water in swimming pool was kinda disappointing. It had a bad urine odor. Its color was not completely clean. I suggest to at least completely replace the portion of the water in the pool every week, instead of keeping recycling the same water over and over again. Beside this disappointment, I will say the hotel overall is pretty good",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Ghastly!,"We had a 7:55AM flight and needed to return a car rental in time so an airport overnight seemed a good idea. Yes, the car rental return was a 5 min drive from the hotel.   Pro:  proximity to airport; water pressure for shower.  That's it.   Con:  too depressing to list so I'll just say I have never stayed at a hotel that offered--literally!--square 8x8 couch pillows for slumber. Yes, each adult in the king size bed got TWO of these....one for each arm?  My head could bounce off the lumpy polyester fill ensacked. It was only due to extreme fatigue (looooong drive from Tellurude) and having an argument with my hubs that prevented me from contacting hotel mgt, mostly believing this was only solveable by going to another hotel which there are at least 6 of these within a stone's…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Disappointing Breakfast - Great Location!,"Stayed overnight for the last day of our vacation to Colorado, because of this site's proximity to the airport.  That worked out well. We reserved a shuttle (included with the reservation) for the morning of our departure.  It arrived on-time and got us to the airport as scheduled.  Left for the airport with an 8:30 pick-up. The breakfast area was packed at that time. Disappointingly, several food items were out-of-stock (coffee and sausage, most notably). Maybe it was a blessing because when the (reported) sausage arrived, it was anemic, at best. It seemed as if the breakfast program was understaffed, so allow some extra time, if you want to be assured of a ""full"" assortment. Room was clean and quiet. A convenience store is next door, which was obviously ""convenient."" Staff was…",3

Beds were very comfy  - too bad we couldn't actually sleep due to the noisy doors.,2

I like the people, very friendly, and helpful. Nice gym and indoor pool. Big breakfast area and easy to use business center/printers (thanks!). The location is right off the main street and close to the airport (I was also 10 minutes away from my business meetings).",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not up to usual Best Western standards,"It is used, above all, obviously, by most people coming in to or leaving Denver Airport; and there are several nearby alternative hotels. The design and construction of this building are not up to normal Best Western standards. The staff, on arrival and departure, were competent but did not give the impression of being committed to their job. I had a couple of minor problems in one short overnight stay. The coffee-maker in the room did not work; and the breakfast area in the morning was too small for the peak-time rush. The standard of the breakfast food is very poor. Overall, it was not disastrous; but not up to BW standards.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,VERY good check-in experience and convenient location to airport.,"We ended up with a king room with a spacious bathroom designed for persons with disabilities.  Some people don't want a room with those facilities but we appreciate the extra space and ease of use.  This is a nice, very clean hotel in a cluster of ""airport"" hotels.  The young woman who checked us in was friendly and professional - it was, in fact, the smoothest check-in we had during a 2-week trip to CO.  There is a rather extensive complimentary breakfast that was pretty tasty as ""free"" breakfasts go.  It's about a 15 minute drive to the airport, maybe a little longer if traffic is bad.  The only downside is that parking can be tough - there are a lot of hotels in a small space and parking spaces are at a premium; some hotels require a dashboard permit and have threatening…",4

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not hugely impressed but staff made a difference,"When we got our room we were puzzled by an intermittent but annoying rumbling sound. Upon investigation I realised that we had the room directly above the two pairs of automatic front doors. We didn't want to listen to that through the night (people come and go at all hours in airport hotel). The young lady at reception was very helpful when we asked to be moved, so we were relocated to a fairly ordinary room on ground floor which is what they had available. At least it was quiet😊 The staff here were very busy but very pleasant and helpful at all times during our stay, well done!",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Strange that the comforters did not match each other in the room.,"I thought the decor was strange. One comforter was plain and one was quilted. Looked odd. But the beds were good. The room was not completely clean, there were papers on floor that I picked up. And the second day the internet and TV went off and I reported it at 10 AM and it was still off when we left at 2PM. They never tired to fix it. They did let us have a late check out at 2. I never did understand what the PLUS stood for. There is nothing Plus about it. It was a great location to the airport and it was very quiet. The staff does not speak English so it was hard to communicate that our room was not made up that they gave us and they were cleaning it still. She did not understand they gave us the room before she got to it. So we just went to the desk an asked for a new one. No big deal. I think they should try to help them know some English. I think they are understaffed and that is what the problem was. The first staff check in person was so nice and helpful and I appreciated that.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not impressed at all,"Check into hotel to find out I have to pay for parking, the wifi is broken down so no internet access, and to top it all off the hot tub is also out of order!!!Since this is a business related trip not having internet access is A REAL BIG DEAL. I CANT DO THE WORK I NEED TO DO NOR CAN I SIT IN THE HOT TUB TO RELAX!!! And I have to pay to park my car here...... All I can say at this point is I will not be back and give this establishment my business. Then I cut my finger on the thermostat because it has no cover!",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean room but service needs improvement,"We were a late check-in so not surprised we had to park on a back dead-end street.  The room was clean and comfy but trying to find staff was next to impossible! In the morning there was no front desk clerk (sign said she stepped away) - I waited 20 minutes then gave up.  The breakfast was completely depleted (no cutlery, no coffee, no bacon or sausage, a few sad muffins) at 8 am and no one in sight to refill anything.If you don't care about breakfast and don't have any needs/requests then this hotel is fine.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,GREAT ROOMS,Stayed at the BW Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites this hotel is very near restaurants plus you plenty of selections to choose from.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Dirty,"This is not a good hotel. The carpets in the hallway were gross, the chair in the room had a big stain in the middle and the shower had no water pressure. It felt very seedy. The highlight was the breakfast. The bacon the served was very crispy , the way I like it. I won't be back to this hotel. It's  a little to rough.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Dissappointed ,"We received a call the day we were to check in that the hotel had flooded, but they had set us up in a nearby hotel.  We double checked the fact that it was a suite because we had 6 people.  When we arrived it was not a suite and no other rooms were available.  Neither hotel could accommodate us.  The customer service was horrendous.  So it cost us double the toll fees because no hotel near DIA had rooms and also cost us parking because we had planned to use the park and fly option through Best Western.  We didn't even get a simple apology, just an ""oh well things happen""  We will never stay here!",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Overnight Stay,"At the last minute my son and I needed a hotel room late in the evening and everything was smooth going with Best Western. The service was excellent, easy to make the reservation and check in and check out.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Nice room, problems with breakfast","Stayed here 2 nights before flying home. Room nice and large. Staff was helpful when we arrived. We needed an airport shuttle so we registered a day before which is a must. We had a challenge finding parking for the rental car. Pool was cool and enjoyable. Breakfast was packed and messy. We arrived before 8:30 and there was no eggs, bacon or sausage. They started cleaning up at 8:45 and removing food even though breakfast wasn't over until 9. We never got eggs because they didn't refill them. If breakfast goes until 9, then you need to have it stocked until then. Manager was on a call and would not talk to us.",3

All in all, it was a good decent place.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Overnight Stay,"Very accommodating, with transpiration service to the airport running two and from a total of 4 times an hour.  Bed was fine but not great, room was quiet.  Hospitality at 4 am was remarkable as they put out cold pastries, fruit and coffee for the early plane-catchers!  I didn't expect that and it was appreciated as we couldn't take advantage of the free breakfast.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Decent- Did the Job,Overall it was a decent stay- Free shuttle from the airport which was nice.couple of minor issues which were all corrected quickly. We reserved two rooms as we were on family vacation. One of the keys for one rooms kept sticking and wouldn't open the door. They had to issue new keys 2 times. The wifi was spotty which is not an overnight fix but hopefully management knows. The rooms were clean and the AC was great ( it was super hot) The price was reasonable and having the expectation that its not a 5 star resort it was a fine stay and did the job! Stayed two nights.,3

Hotel feels older, in need of updating. Had to ask front desk for sheets for the sofa bed, but they had no pillows.  Free breakfast was typical low-budget stuff (powdered eggs, a sausage option, a couple cereals, etc). Parking was atrocious, with far too few spaces, forcing many to park down the street. Only plus is close proximity to Denver airport. Would look for other nearby hotel options next time.",2

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Stop over,"Very average hotel. Nothing to particularly complain about. Reasonably comfortable sofa bed and okay sized room, if a bit dated. It was clean and tidy, even if hotel reception was a little worn and untidy, lot of guests there. Air conditioner noisy and could hear noise from other rooms during night.  Pool was dirty and again untidy, therefore did not allow kids to go to it (pool is small). Only one on reception who was a bit overworked, but was perfectly accommodating when finally got attention.  Overall if need hotel close to airport for flight, then okay. Wouldn't recommend for any other reason.",3

I flew into Denver and when booking my hotel I requested to check in early, even if I had to pay more since I was landing,so early. I walked into the hotel lobby and before I say anything the front desk girl Jamie puts her hand up and says ""WERE SOLD OUT"".   I go... ""let's start over... i'm ____ and are here to check in."" Jamie was very confused why I was there at 10am when check in is at 3pm. I explained to her to look up my reservation and she just said ""well it doesn't matter, we don't have any rooms ready"".   I asked Jamie what I was suppose to do, even though on my confirmation it said I was to check in early... she just said ""I don't know...

Got invaded by a party of kids had to move to another room to get away from the noise at 9:00 o'clock. In room hot tub took forever o fill and the on off switch worked intermittently. Bathroom door had been patched and painted instead of replaced. This is supposed to be a place for business people traveling but the wifi kept cutting out.

After dealing with some other guests, she left the desk to personally check on some rooms and came back with an offer of another room. Even offered to cut the rate a few bucks. I was so pleased, and can't say thanks enough, except through this review.  Also, I left very early on the shuttle to the airport (5:30 am), but the morning clerk made a point of having food and drink available for the early travelers.

Was not informed that the shuttle only comes to one side of the airport instead of making a loop around the airport. Waited 45 minutes before getting that information. When checking in, only room left was a king and sofa bed for my husband and 2 teens. 3 months earlier had booked a 2 queen bed room. Given linens by front desk to make up the sofa bed, ourselves. Overall not a good experience.  Only positive was the front desk clerk (gentlemen), who was very nice.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Horrible Experience - Beware of Room 214,"I came in late, around 11 pm on Saturday July 9th, 2016, after a long drive from the mountains and a horrific traffic jam on I-70. The employee at the front desk was out front smoking a cigarette with a friend when I arrived. I was placed in room 214, which is directly above the front entrance. I readied for bed and as I tried to sleep I noticed a loud whoosh, whoosh, whoosh noise. It came about ever 5-10 minutes, sometimes with more frequency. I would sleep for the time between the noise and would wake when it would return. It finally occurred to me about 2 am that it was the front door sliding open. It was horrible. Finally at 4 am I gave up and cancelled my 4:30 am wake-up call. When I spoke with the front desk clerk (the same fellow from check-in) and mentioned the door…",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,vending machines,"Although the price of a soft drink in a vending machine at a hotel is usually higher than at a store. no vending machines and 3 dollars for a bottled coke is beyond any hotel I've ever stayed at.  I understand that some distributors raise their prices due to lack of sales, etc.  But no vending machines and hence pushing guests to the 7-11 next door seems self deprecating to me.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Would not stay here again,Our room did not meet our expectations....there was urine on the toilet seat so apparently it had not been cleaned...thank goodness we had our own Clorox wipes!The carpet was torn and the shower rod was coming out of the wall on one end. The floor squeaked and the room just felt dirty. The front desk attendant was outside smoking with other people when we checked out. I am glad we were only there one night and will not stay there again.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Decent for a night's stay,"No frills stay, ok for a night. However, the lady at the counter forgot my request for a shuttle the following morning. Fortunately, the man on duty the next day was able to get me a spot on the desired shuttle. Phew! Be sure to come down early to double-check!",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Helpful staff,"The staff were all very helpful and friendly.  Ask about parking when you arrive and be sure not to park across the street. The people across the street at the red lion Inn are horrible!!!!  Never stay there!  The ladies at the front desk, the sales manager, and the general manager all went out of their way to help me. ",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,First hotel on 11 trip,"All I can say is ""Don't!""  The reviews before we went we not bad; however the management sucks!  The check in wasn't smooth.  The hotel took our payment and then asked for a payment when we left!  The taxes because it's on airport property are high. Ran out of food by 8an--also no plates, limited milk and cereal containers that didn't work.  Children were starting!  Hard boiled eggs were pickled:(   No real apologies to everyone there...called to speak to the GM--got his machine so I asked him to call me back and it's 7/8/16 and no response!  Way overpriced and very, very poor service standards! Book elsewhere--Best Western should remove their name from this location!!!!",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not a Plus,"This was a Best Western Plus, but it in no way was better than a Best Western.  The bathroom was separated into two areas- the toilet and shower with a door, the sink without one.  The shower curtain did not cover the whole tub.  The room looked like it needed a lot of work.   The closet was covered with a drape.  The bed had pillows too small for a king bed.  Breakfast would have been good but several items were delivered late.  We finished our breakfast at 8 am and then they put bananas out, for example.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Billed for a day we didn't even stay,"Don't take this hotels verbal agreements for anything.  Our softball team had booked a block a rooms for a day longer than my daughter was going to be there and we were told by the front desk that they would remove the last night, but after we checked out and got a receipt that accurately reflected the proper stay, the hotel billed my credit card for the additional night.  Also seemed very overpriced for the quality of the hotel and the breakfast was was poorly managed.  I would not recommend this property and personally will avoid Best Westerns whenever possible.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A quick overnight from the airport- shuttle disappointment,"Our flight got into the Denver Airport at around 1030pm. We got our luggage and made our way up to catch the shuttle. We found a kiosk phone that had a direct line to the hotel. After three phone calls where it kept looping back to the hotel front desk with no answer, we went out to Island 3 where all of the hotel shuttles were. After waiting 30min with no BW shuttle but seeing every other hotel shuttle, we tried calling again and there was no answer. I got in touch with someone from reservations and tried to explain the situation and he tried to assist by calling the hotel. He told me that I was supposed to be at Island 3 and the shuttle should be there every 30min at quarter to and quarter after the hour. We waited again and still no shuttle. We called back and finally someone…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Limited parking,"Stayed here after late flight from Europe.  Finding a parking space after 10:00 was a nightmare.  Front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful when we checked in but the young guy who manned the desk in the morning was very snotty and rude.  Just before we arrived at the breakfast room, some woman had just loaded up two plates full of sausages and eggs, leaving none for anyone else.  Coffee urn had run dry and someone asked the young man if it could be re-filled and he replied (under his breath) that the breakfast WAS complimentary, after all.  Ha - not free, included in the price of the room more like it.  Anyway, probably wouldn't stay here again, if for nothing else, the parking situation.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not as close to airport as you might think ,I booked here because it's marketed as close to the airport. It's not that close. It'll take me at least 20 minutes to get to the rental return from here. Other then that not very many restaurant near by either.  Hotel is nice. Clean. Staff friendly. ,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Not Bad, Not Great","I stayed at the hotel for one night as the hotel is less than 10 minutes from the airport and I had an early flight the next morning. The hotel is old and a bit worn out, definitely in need of an update, The parking situation was terrible, I pulled up to check in an there was no place to park anywhere near the entrance to the hotel, When I asked, I was told to park in the back of the hotel--not convenient after a week long vacation and a lot of luggage to take to the room. The check in staff were very friendly and helpful. I returned my rental car the night before my flight and the staff arranged for complimentary transportation to the airport the next morning. I did have to take a shuttle much earlier than necessary as all the later shuttles were full so call ahead and make your arrangements as soon as you can.  The rooms had a very odd layout and were in need of an overall update. Same with the hallways as the carpets were stained and walls scratched. Considering the place was near capacity, it was very quiet. I would stay again only for another short stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,UNSAFE UNCLEAN RUDE,"I left a long review at the beginning of the survey. Overall I left feeling extremely unsafe, not taken care of, room unclean & rude staff. I don't want to stay here again & will tell everyone I know not to stay here either it was HORRIBLE! & extremely over priced for non helpful staff.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,One night stopover,"Hotel good, transport shocking - over an hour waiting for hotel bus which was small and scruffy, cramped with people sitting on each others laps as not enough seats.  Overall fairly satisfied, We only needed an overnight stay in order to catch a connecting flight early in the morning at Denver I A",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Marginal at best,"We stayed one night during a layover.  It was one of the most inexpensive options with queen beds.  The hotel was quiet, checkin was good, but the linens were not clean.  Bath was worn (caulking around tub).  An OK stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good Hotel with free Shuttle to Airport,"We pre booked a standard room with 2 beds at the end of our vacation and when we went to reception the lady there was friendly and efficient and gave us our keys. When we got to the room we found we had been upgraded to a suite but the maid hadn't quite finished the room. We waited 30 minutes and as we had to drop the rental back that afternoon we asked reception if the cleaning would be finished soon. She immediately apologised and gave us a new room. This room was as originally ordered but that was OK. When we got back from the rental company she stopped us, apologised as she had put us back into a normal room and refunded us about 20% of the fee. WOW. SERVICE! Anyway the room had Fridge, Phone, Microwave and T.V. Good room, clean and tidy. The only let down was the staff at Breakfast who were slow to refill the trays. There was no Gluten free cereal but there was yoghurts and eggs so no problem. Shuttle runs every 30 minutes and we dropped the rental off the day before we left Denver but they still happily picked us up and took us no problem.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Close to the airport so it's OK for one night...ONLY!,"PROS: We were greeted warmly at the check-in counter by Jeremiah who is, without question, one of the nicest people I have ever encountered at a hotel. He actually smiled and seemed to like his job! I was impressed with the entire front desk staff! The room looked exactly like the on-line pictures…also often times very rare! The hotel runs LOTS of shuttles all around the area, so if you are here without transportation, you are not stuck in your room! The room was mostly clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The location is very close to the airport, and convenient for that use.CONS: This is a park and fly hotel, so there is NO PARKING! I cannot understand why the hotel management would not assign a designated area for people to park and fly. That would free up some parking for the people who are staying at the hotel, and walking in during rainfall.  The room was terribly lit. Very dark and depressing. I suppose they save a few pennies that way, but I absolutely cannot stand it. A light near the microwave/refrigerator area would have been a nice, much needed addition. The room was not clean. I found a grey sweatshirt behind the chair! The light over the sink area was entirely inadequate for my wife to put on her makeup. The bathroom could use some attention. The toilet is too low for nearly anyone to use it comfortably. I am short at 5’ 7”, and the stool was too low for me. Anyone over 6 feet tall would feel they are squatting on a soup can! I also thought it was unfortunate that the bathroom fan did not work. There is no possible way that housekeeping should have missed the fact that the fan did not operate. There is only one switch to operate both the fan and light, and so there is no way it should have been overlooked. The refrigerator is a tiny, college dorm-room sized fridge, with a typically useless freezer. The most egregious oversight for me is the fact that the wireless “security” is simply the hotel’s phone number!!! I am sure no hacker would ever think to try that! Come on Best Western…at least pretend to care about your guest’s cyber-security. I would recommend this hotel for a one-night stay only. The darkness of the room wore on me over a four day stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Last night of a long journey,"From check in through the stay I've got to say there were a few disappointments . But read all way through, it's not all bad. Proximity to airport , excellentPrice fair. Within walking distance to dining, handy not having to get back in the car, Front desk staff plenty friendly, but I had to ask where's best place to park, no explanation about check out, shuttle, Continental breakfast, pool, a map on where our room would be , etc Property seems a little dated, no stopper in the tub. Bed is very comfy, water pressure good, plenty of hot water, AC is exceptional. Fridg, microwave, iron, all good amenities.Two mirrors for 2 ladies to do hair and makeup, that's a huge plus.I would stay here again and recommend.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,nice hotel,"Parking was limited, there are several hotels in a complex and parking minimal, lots of people parked in the street.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice Hotel,"Very convenient to airport, A shuttle is available. The room was spacious and very comfortable. Regrettably, there are very few restaurants in the immediate area. Also, the hotel does not offer breakfast until 6 AM. Thus, if you have a flight before 9 AM. forget about having breakfast at the hotel. Nothing was available! How can a hotel call itself an airport hotel and not offer breakfast until 6 AM?????",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Bad Breakfast Spoiled It,"I stay at Best Western Plus often.  The amenities are always adequate and the properties are fresh and comfortable.  This is a good airport hotel but during my stay the breakfast, which is included, was awful.  Front desk staff was very helpful.  Service directed to me, individually, was excellent.  Breakfast was not.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Accomadating and clean,"Check in was fast and professional. The staff person was attentive and patient. The hotel is very convenient and close to airport. The airport shuttle is very helpful and the staff was good about staying in contact about our 3:30 a.m. shuttle with a reminder call twenty minutes before it left. The staff person was on hand and tuned in to all of us who were boarding the predawn shuttle, so not missing in action, very available to us all. He also handed us all a granola bar and water bottle which was a very welcomed early morning surprise.Room was clean and comfortable and hotel is well kept for the price!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Nice room and front desk staff, but parking and breakfast are terrible","We stayed overnight at the Best Western because of it's proximity to the airport and the reasonable price. Our room was really great - nicely decorated and clean. The front desk clerk that checked us in was very funny and helpful. As far as parking your car overnight - forget it. They let folks park in their lot while they are out of town, which means there no place - I mean NO PLACE TO PARK. We parked on the street and were lucky enough to find a place fairly close to the building. The hotel is located near a half-dozen hotels, so good luck finding anyplace to park. Why can't they designate parking spots away from the front door for the folks out of town, and let the rest of us park in the same zip code? The breakfast on Saturday morning was terrible. They were out of food,…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice hotel," this hotel is very nice.  The hot tub and the pool is open 24hrs and the front desk is just wonderful I think her name is Meghan, really made us feel welcome and made us like we just walked in somewhere where everyone knew us.  We will miss breakfast in the morning because of our flight but they have bags made up to go with yogurt and different breakfast things in it.  We will be staying in this hotel our next trip into Denver complementary coffee and juices in the lobby very nice set up ",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Denver Airport,"This was my second time to stay here at the motel. I was just as pleased with my stay this time as I was the first time. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and offered me an upgrade for my Platinum status. I got a room with a whirlpool tub. It was great and relaxing! The breakfast was good. I will be returning to this motel the next time around.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Solid airport hotel that does the basics very well,"My wife and I were flying to the east coast out of DIA. We needed a hotel where we could leave our car for several days while we traveled. Really, when I need a hotel for a night either before or after a flight, I don't need anything fancy, I just need someplace that is clean, has a good shower, and a comfortable bed. The Best Western at DIA had all of that. They did the basics very well. Clean room. Excellent shower. Reliable, easy to understand shuttle service to and from DIA. I read some of the reviews regarding the staff and found them to be extremely helpful and courteous -- any rude behavior I saw came from guests who wanted ridiculous and impossible things. A little kindness and respect toward staff goes a long way, and it seems to be especially true here. Everyone I…",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Try another hotel...there are many to choose from,"We were flying out of Denver early so we decided to stay at the Best Western near the airport so that it would be an easy start. Parking was difficult...we were able to squeeze in to a space as someone was leaving. The wifi was so slow I couldn't use it. I called down to the front desk and they explained that there were two connections to choose from and that I should ""choose the other one"". Neither one was fast...I couldn't even check my emails. You would not be able to conduct business or stream. The room was not clean. The closet was never opened to be vacuumed and there were candy wrappers and popcorn on the floor inside. The is a strict no smoking policy yet I found a half smoked joint in the window sill. It obviously had dropped in there and the person that dropped it was…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,All right for the price,"Stayed here before our flight out of Denver after a terrible vacation. We were exhausted and glad to be near the airport and our toddler stayed comfortably with us in this room. Pretty sure we could have stayed in a barn that night and we would have slept like babies, but our only complaint is that the mattress had about a half-dozen blood stains on it that were nickel sized diameter or larger. While it was clear that they had been there for some time, it was gross to be able to see the bloodstains through the clean sheets. We had nowhere else to stay and our toddler was on his very last legs, so changing rooms wasn't an option either. We asked for an extra sheet set and layered it over the stained part of the bed. Hotel management: mattress covers are a must!",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great stay,"Stayed here the night before my flight. Great location for catching a flight but parking does get filled in the evening. They have a shuttle to the airport available as well. Room was nice, clean and spacious. I didn't used the pool but you could see it was a bit green. It is a non smoking property of all types.🍁 Breakfast was good but the orange juice machine needs attention both juices where warm.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Overall, very nice",The room/small suite was very clean with adequate amenities.  Breakfast was okay.  Desk staff was mostly good except for one woman on day of check out who was really put out with me for asking for a simple letter to be mailed.  I needed a stamp and offered her $5.00 to mail a simple first class letter.  She finally she would do it but who knows; her attitude was not good.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,New but Understaffed,"Clean and nice.  Spa was almost warm, room not stocked with basic items.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great for catching a flight,"Not spectacular, but very good for getting on an airplane.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Average room,"The room was average.  Closet door was a curtain. Small bathroom.  Front desk staff night manager, Andrew was rude and argumentative. The shuttle is unreliable.

Never again,  the other hotels offer much more pleasant staffing and rooms.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean with Comfy Bed,"This Best Western has big suites with comfortable beds.

Didn't receive a wi-fi password on check-in and never got an answer when calling the desk the next morning (person outside smoking). Otherwise, nice room and close to the lobby.  Bathroom a little run-down looking. Paid a daily charge for parking while on flight - hadn't seen that when booking.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great hotel with the worst parking in the state. ,"This best Western is wonderful. It is centrally located next to several other hotels offer spacious rooms are reasonable rates and includes a buffet breakfast. However, there is absolutely zero parking at any of the nearby hotels.   The best western offers a pay and fly program so people use the hotel parking lot as extra airport parking, take flights and then leave their cars in the parking lot; so actual guest of the hotel have no parking. The staff offers no alternatives of where to park the cars for paid guest of the hotel and we were stuck driving around for 47 minutes in the middle of the night upon arrival trying to find a safe place for two single girls to walk in the dark back to their room.   My room was clean it was spacious the bathroom was wonderful the breakfast…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Nice and clean, comfortable, but parking sucks!","We stayed the night before an early morning flight.  Hotel was clean and comfortable. Although the guy next door apparently needed his TV on to sleep..  But the parking in this area sucks.  These hotels allow a ""Park n Fly"" so people that are staying at the hotel, if they are lucky, may find a parking spot within walking distance. We had to park at the Holiday Inn Express across the street.   You can park at either hotel to the side of the BW, but not across the street at the Red Lion.     So for guests staying, parking is a major issue and I'm not sure I would do this option again. Or I'd stay somewhere else, maybe back up by I70 & Penya.  But Tower Road hotels (some), have very limited parking because a lot of the cars are there because of the $8/day charge to leave the car. …",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Took the grandkids to spend the night and swim.,"Room was excellent, very clean, pool was a bit of a challenge for the little kids, the ladder into and out of the pool was very short and there are no walk in steps.  Salt-water pool was very nice, little cool, but refreshing.  The hot tub was small, but comfortable and ez for the kids to get in and out of.  Convenient to local pubs and restaurants. Negatives:  PARKING, although I found some every time I needed, it's a good case for help needed!   Breakfast.  Not near enough seats and tables for all the customers.  I gave up trying to get to the breakfast buffet due to the line!  Most folks appeared to be waiting for the hot waffle iron, but at six deep and no where to sit for our family of 5, decided to go out.",4

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great stay!,The hotel had a great location to the Denver airport.  We had a quick check-in.  The person who checked us in was very polite and helpful.  I don't remember his name.  He gave us directions and made arrangements for us to have transportation to the airport the next morning.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Denver trip,I stayed one night and found the room to be clean.  The shower worked well and was updated.  The coffee pot was a Keurig which we find a step above.  The mattress was very comfortable.  The noise level was also low.  I wish hotels could find a way that the doors could not be slammed closed.  There are a lot of inconsiderate people who allow the doors to slam behind them.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Will NOT Stay here Again!,"So many complaints that I have and I am usually not a complaining person. Arrived to room to find it wasn't ready! Had to wait outside the room for a few minutes until they were finished. Upon arriving I noticed that there was no vent fan in the bathroom, which makes for an unusually damp and moist bathroom after a shower! Also, the sheets were not completely clean! NO towels at the hot tub, the water fountain was not working as well as the phone to call the front desk to tell them there was no towels. The coffee maker had apparently not been touched as there was a dirty coffee filter inside where you pour the water!! This hotel needs some serious attention to detail in order to compete with some of the surrounding hotels!",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Acceptable,"Very nice when you get into the hotel, recommend book online, felt telephone staff were abrupt. No parking places usually, had to park down the street, on the street. Room was very comfortable & large. The bed was extremely soft & comfortable.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,NO PARKING!,"Will not stay there again.  Parking lot was full when we checked in at 3:30 PM.  Had to park on the street.  Was lucky to find a place to park and was afraid to go out to dinner and chance losing the spot.  Hotel made no effort to control parking and didn't even ask for the tag number.  Room was OK, breakfast was good and shuttle service was on time so OK if you don't have a car but avoid the whole complex of motels if you do.   WiFi was weak but worked better if you got closer to the hall.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Check bedding and Towels,"The bedding was for the pullout bed was filthy.  Had huge brown stains.   The top sheet on one of the beds was pushed down to the bottom of the bed BEFORE we got in it.  The top cover of the other queen bed was missing. They did not give us any towels.  It was really fun noticing this AFTER I got out of the shower.  Old food left under the Pullout.  The reservation was made in advance so it isn't like they didn't have time to prepare the room for us.  When these issues were reported we got the head nod and  ""That is interesting, we will have to look into this""",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Price - Wonderful room.  ,"We stayed for three nights at the BW at DIA.  It was a very good Best Western Plus property.  As longtime BW members, we were upgraded to a suite facing the airport.  Upon check-in we were welcomed by Jerimiah.  He checked us in and provided a quick overview of the hotel and the local parking options. Our room was clean and fresh.  Apparently, one of the the last guests in our room was a marijuana tourist.  They left unused lighters behind from an organic grower.  The lighters were hidden between the couch and wall. They fell out when I sat down. I passed them to the front desk team.  That was rather amusing.  :-). We had come to Denver for the Nine Health Fair.  It was worth the drive from Idaho.  Details:Clean pool and hot tubExercise equipmentbreakfast was included with eggs and meatSnacks and liquids are available at the front desk.Thick towels and quality toiletries. Coffee pot and wet bar in the suite. The back of the couch was very, very firm. The BW is located near a Days Inn, Holiday Inn and Red lion. Parking can be a challenge. It is shared between the Days Inn, BW and Holiday Inn. A lot of cars are left behind by airline travelers. There are several restaurants located nearby.  We are sure we will return to this hotel when in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Outstanding Value and a great spot.,"This is close to the airport, has free parking and WiFi - great breakfast - awesome staff! Well worth a visit. GPS gets a little confused - this hotel is being the Holiday Inn. Beds were great and it is a new hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Just a hotel.,"A fight to find parking. Show up early for breakfast or deal with not finding a place to sit and eat or get any fresh fruit. Its a pretty average hotel for the rating and price. Shower was good and hot. Pillows on the king size bed looked pretty funny though being these little half sized pillows and having 4 of them. (Seriously, pillow was about the same size of my head.)  The pro to this hotel is that it is close to the airport and has some consistent shuttle service for it.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Convenient to Denver Airport,"The staff was very friendly; the bed was comfortable; the wake-up call was right on time; the location is very close to Denver Airport; we made our 5:30am flight with ease. The a/c unit initially did not seem to cool, but the maintenance person checked it out within 30 minutes of our call, and we had no further problems.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not Impressed,"Quick one night stay and was not impressed with the beds.  Might as well just have laid on a cardboard box.  Floors were squeaky every time you walk across the floor it would wake someone up.  Close to the airport and free shuttle to the airport was nice.  No vending machines, expensive selection next to the front desk, take a few steps and save yourself some money and go to the 7-11 in the parking lot nearby.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good for DIA Travel,"We stayed here for 1 night before our last vacation since we had a very early flight the next morning. When I checked in, the staff was great! While I had accidently booked a handicap accessible room via hotels.com although we didn't need that type of room, he (Jeremiah, possibly was his name?) was able to change us to a regular room.  The hotel smelled clean and the room was nice & clean, with a comfy bed and good shower water pressure. We didn't use their pool or get to check out their breakfast but those things were offered. We did use their gym which was small but was fine for what we needed. I also was expecting to have to pay for parking, but we weren't charged which was an added bonus. The check-out staff in the early morning was also great even though another customer had tried to cause some hate & discontent. Overall this is a good stay for the money, especially if you're traveling to/from the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not the greatest,"I love Best Westerns.  I feel very loyal to them, but this is one I will not be staying at again.  The front desk was very nice, but it just wasn't your typical, good Best Western.  It wasn't as clean and nice as I am use to.  The main reason we did not have a good stay is because it was so loud.  Our room was right next to the elevator and you could hear it everytime it went up and down.  This is not good when you have an infant trying to sleep.  I could also hear our next door neighbors very well.  It was like the walls weren't thick enough.  Also when someone started taking a shower early in the morning the water running through the pipes was so loud!",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Check in not the Best,This hotel does not recognize Gold Crown Diamond member. made reservation...requested ground floor...was given upper floor. It was late..counter person did not want to make the change. The best thing about this hotel is that it is close to the airport.,3

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,good hotel,"The staff was exceptional. Check in was fast and efficient. They went above and beyond to get us restaurant deals. The room was just fine. Nothing too fancy, but the place was clean, and the beds comfortable. The shuttle is great, the food is pretty good. Out flight was early, but breakfast was ready before 6 am. Pickup at the airport was quick as well. The hot tub and pool is open 24 hours. It was ok... A little dated but it did the job! This is a good value. Not fancy, but I slept through it...",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice hotel. ,We stayed one night at this hotel after a late flight into Denver. Pick up by shuttle was on time. They stop at several hotels but was very easy and friendly driver. The check in was strange! Was never asked for id or verification of credit card. Front desk clerk didn't want to mess with computer when I said I had coupon for discount fro BW so gave me a discount on room which saved us money. I shared my concerns with management next morning and they were very professional and said my concerns would be addressed. Our ride came so I wasn't able to tell them the sheet needed replaced due to old stains. The sheet had been washed(I hope) but should not have been put back on a bed. The room was large. Bathroom clean. Wish there had been couple more towels but after trying to get ice…,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good room no parking ,Nice room for airport hotel. Upgraded to suite.  You can leave car for up to 2 weeks with 1 night stay problem is hard to find parking spot. No hangers or tv listing in the room. Stayed here several times shuttle is always prompt. Good access to airport. ,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,very good airport hotel!,"Have already booked next stay at this reasonably-priced airport hotel in convenient location with comfy bed and indoor pool.  Free airport shuttle, breakfast and wifi make this a bargain at this clean and convenient hotel!",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Good price, clean room, great service.","We stayed here during the recent blizzard in Denver.  We were supposed to stay one night, but ended up staying two because of cancelled flights.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating even though this was obviously a stressful time with many people unable to reach the hotel and many, many more stranded trying to find a place to stay.   The room was clean and the bed comfortable, everything we expected.  The breakfast was standard fare, pasties, a few hot items, etc.  However, it is worth noting that the breakfast was much appreciated as it was nearly impossible to get anywhere because of the blizzard.  I am sure this was the only food many people got that day.  The location is great.  The proximity to DIA with the shuttle makes it a great place to stay when flying. …",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Noisy hotel with no parking,"Noisy hotel with no parking.  Do not stay at this hotel.  The staff was nice, but the hotel product is sub-par.  Took 20 minutes to find parking in the area.  And was afraid I might get towed.  There are many other hotel options in the area, so no need to book a reservation at this one.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Breakfast not available,The cook did not show up for breakfast.  There was dry cereal only.  We had to leave early and go to the airport for breakfast.  Therefore we weren't able to use the shuttle either.  Overall it was a very poor experience.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Thank you Best Western!,"We stayed at this hotel the night of the recent March blizzard after staying the previous night at The Best Western's sister hotel the Day's Inn (next door).  The Day's Inn was booked up, and it was made clear to us that we would have to find other accomodations, even though there was a blizzard.  The Best Western welcomed us warmly.  We luckily knew some people who had been able to extend their stay there, and we slept on the couch/floor of their room.  The Best Western staff was awesome, and went out of their way to make us comfortable.  They brought us extra sheets/blankets/towels.  They set us up with two different wake up calls, along with two separate shuttles to the airport.  I was able to sit in the breakfast room and get some business done over the complementary wifi. …",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,perfect end to long flight,"not too long a ride from the airport via free shuttle :) very friendly and accommodating staff. great bed and shower! hot tub was a godsend!  good wifi connection. wide variety of breakfast choices. room did need a little tlc like there was no light above the coffee making facilities and the phone in my room wouldn't dial out but, otherwise, wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Parking for airport makes it worth it,"We wanted to stay the night prior to our flight near the airport, since we're more than 100 miles from there.  We're Best Western Rewards members, so it was our first choice.  It's decent for the price and breakfast, though never spectacular, is a big time-saver for us. It was great to be able to park there for our vacation for a flat rate and get a shuttle to the airport.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Option for DEN Airport at Lower Cost,"Needed a one-night stay as close as possible to DEN airport for early am departure next day.  Was surprised at how expensive my regular chain hotels were ... all over $150.  Saw this hotel as an option at a much more competitive price, but worried overall quality would be an issue.  Actually no concern at all.  Room was great.  Very clean, everything in order, and staff were great.  Only issue at check-in was the rate shown  at check in was about $25 above what I reserved ... simply showed my resv confirmation and the price was corrected.  Shuttle was great both directions.  Had a king suite.  Appreciated the fridge and microwave as I only wanted a light dinner so walked to the 7-11 about 1 block away and picked up some items.  Could have gone over to the restaurant also nearby.…",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Arrived at Airport a day to soon...YEAH!,"We were so stressed we accidentally arrived at DIA one day earlier than our flight. So we just went and stayed close by at this Hotel. I now RECOMMEND doing this every time we are getting ready to leave for a vacation. Instead of trucking out of our home at o-dark thirty we just grab this hotel and spend the night there. They have a clean and lovely pool and hot tub area. This was so nice for a de-stresser. And it allowed us to enjoy a wonderful night's sleep after using facilities. We enjoyed a quick and free breakfast. And then we didn't realize this hotel has a free airport shuttle service for their quests as well. This meant we got picked up in front of the hotel and dropped directly in front of the airlines door. And when we returned we caught the shuttle right back to or awaiting vehicle at the hotel. Not only did we not have to stress about where to park and the additional cost of parking. All of this was included in the cost of the hotel. The hotel was clean and all staff was extremely courteous and helpful. They made suggestions for close by dinners within walking distance. So for my Husband and I who are so STRESSED because we are business owners and never get away, this was a very sweet beginning to a nice vacation. Actually like one additional vaca day ahead of schedule. Thank you for the amazing service Best Western DIA Service!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,OK for an overnight stay near DEN. This time BW messed up,"I usually fly into DEN late, find a close place to stay for an early drive to the mountains. This time, I was to meet 2 other ski buddies, and chose a suite with 2 queens and a pull out sofa. When my 2 other buddies arrived before me, the receptionist told them that all they had was a regular room with 2 queen beds, and that Booking.com had not asked for a suite.I called Booking from my plane. before take off, and the agent, Sam, was extremely helpful and clearly said a suite had been ordered. He made arrangements at 2 other hotels, but my plane took off and I could not inform my buddies.When I arrived, my buddies had already moved into the room. The next day I talked to the manager, who reluctantly agreed that it was BW's fault and gave us a #20 discount. It didn't make up for not having a third bed and suite that we had clearly reserved.I've stayed at the Red Lion next door, which is quite similar, and the Country Inn, which was a little more, and maybe not even as clean ( at least our room that one time). I usually stay at Woolley's when I return from the mountains, and take advantage of happy hour, great breakfasts, and great comfort. The extra expense is worth the luxury.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Comfy beds,Slept well here. The beds were comfortable and the hotel was pretty quiet even though it was pretty busy there. The hot tub was small but hot! A pool maintenance guy came in to service the pool and hot tub while we were in the pool; just myself and my daughter in the room at the time. He was very friendly and accommodating while we were swimming and he was attempting to accomplish his task.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,good comfort for short stay near airport,Was good value for money and very comfortable. We were traveling as a family and was convenient as starting and meeting point. Staff were every helpful to our needs.  Highly recommended for those who would like a short stay near airport before traveling onwards,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean place to stay,"Clean, comfy king sized bed, and it was located around everywhere we wanted to visit while there. Pet friendly so thats always a plus for me. The breakfast was really awesome the first morning we were there! Biscuits and gravy with eggs and plenty more. We are picky on our hotel breakfast and this didn't disappoint. Now the second morning did disappoint and thats all I'll say on that.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great stay,"The hotel room was clean and well put together. Beds where very comfy though they need more pillows on the beds. The restroom was very clean and roomy. Close by to restaurants, the breakfast was very good. They serve scrambled egg, potatoes , and other good things.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worst Best Western experience I have ever had,"We booked a room for 5 people. It had 2 queen beds and a pull out sofa. When we checked in there was not any linen for the pull out. When we called the front desk to request linen we were told to come to the front desk to pick it up. The linen should have already been in the room.They also advertised and wrote to us in an email before our arrival that they provided shuttle service from the airport to the hotel and back. We were staying only overnight for an AM departure the next day. The shuttle was later than advertised and actually covered 4 different hotels. The shuttle was not big enough to hold all of the people who were waiting for a ride. We got on but many did not.The email from the hotel also advised that the shuttle leaves every 30 minutes for the airport. Again they did not advise that it was ""space available"" and first come first serve. So with a late arrival at the hotel the shuttle was booked for the two best options, time wise, for our transport to the airport. We had to get a 5:30 AM shuttle even though our flight was not scheduled to leave until 8:30 AM and the shuttle drive is all of 15 minutes. And the free hot breakfast they also advertised, and another reason for booking this hotel, did not start service until 6 AM--so no breakfast!",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean ,We were only here to sleep as we had an early morning flight out. The hotel was clean and updated. Comfortable beds. Coffee was brewed even though it was the middle of the night. The shuttle was on time and got us to the airport quickly. The shuttle only allots the hotel a certain number of passengers so make sure you reserve a spot early.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Park and Fly,"I needed a place where I could leave my car for a few days.  The Park and Fly option made sense for me to be close to the airport and not worry about parking and getting an early flight.  They allow up to 14 days free with a park and fly rate.  The room was more expensive, but the parking made it worthwhile.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice rooms,"We had came here to stay to visit family  and had a great experience clean room,comfortable beds and love having shuttle take us to  the airport . Housekeeping were very friendly and helpful . They helped us take our luggage to room and welcomed us . I would definitely stay here again",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Room OK but several lapses in organization,"We booked a room here before an early morning flight out of Denver International Airport.  The room itself was OK, clean (except for a couple of hairs in the tub) and large enough to visit with family staying in another room.  The wind did howl a bit through the window, not a big deal for us but some might be annoyed.  Parking was tight but we found a spot.  Drawbacks - the front desk staff did not know if our room was ready, when we arrived more than 1 hour after the hotel's 3PM check-in time.  The printer in the business center did not work, odd for an airport hotel where guests need to print their boarding passes.  ",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Quick Trip to Dnever,"Inexpensive place to stay near the Denver International airport. The location was behind the Red Lion Inn and at night, it was  not easy to see from Tower Rd which was listed as its address.  My daughter and I had a late night check-in (after 10 pm) and our room was held for us.  The decor was well worn and needed an update but the room was clean and quiet.  The full free breakfast was very good and offered a great deal of choice.  The hotel had shuttle service to/from the airport available which we did not use but it is a useful service. The beds were comfortable. We only stayed one night but we were pleased with the value.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best value near DIA,"I stayed after a long day of travel and was very pleased to find a premium room for the price of an ordinary room at other hotels.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Stay here,This was a great hotel.  Good deal and nice staff.  Shuttle to the airport was great and well organized.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Perfectly fine.,"I had two different rooms. I changed after arrival because the heat appeared to be not working in the first room. The second room had a window that needed repair by maintenance, but the room was otherwise fine.  This hotel is fine for a quick overnight stay if you get a good price. I would not choose to spend more time than necessary there.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,take it or leave it.,"Never ever again. Not enough parking on property. Bathroom did not work. Staff told me we should stay in room because they would have to rent it to someone else. No maintenance people on staff, I was told. Never saw or spoke to a manager.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE!,"The night desk clerk was very, very helpful and very friendly.  SHUTTLE SERVICE GUY WAS A LITTLE CRABBY AT 6AM.  Excellent value for the price & close to the airport with free shuttle service.  Good bed to get a short night of rest.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,great customer service,Very pleased with our stay! The receptionist Tara S. had great customer service and was very accommodating when our confirmed reservation was not in the system. My boyfriend was quick to become agitated but Tara was very understanding and found us another room. She even matched our previous price which we were very thankful for!  The 24/7 shuttle service is also a huge bonus! We will definitely stay here again. ,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Overall all good stay,"Best western  , was value for price. But not that good quality hotel i stay in my past experience. overall its good experience for one  night stay. as i wanted to catch my flight next day. Good part is shuttle service and near by denver airport in colorado. Food quality would have been better. Room may be better.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"BW airport hotel, Denver","We like to stay at Best Westerns, and this hotel was very convenient with airport shuttle. Breakfast was included, and there were several restaurants in the area within walking distance. Abbie at the front desk was very helpful, and we enjoyed our short stay. Since Denver is quite a distance away, we would mainly recommend this hotel before or after a flight.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Room Size,"The room size was perfect for a party of three including a wheel chair. Close enough to the airport (as a visitor I did not realize how far from downtown Denver the airport was.) There was one issue concerning the person in the wheelchair, which is not applicable to others unless they have knee issues (the toilet was very close to the floor.)",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Over all, a good experience","The bed was hard, so sleep was not the best, but I got sleep. Staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast selection is not huge, but totally sufficient. Diabetes narrows down my choices. Price seemed plenty, but in today's world, I guess respectable. AAA discount helped. Bottom line: I would stay here, again.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice no frills hotel. Great breakfast.  Super close to DIA.,"We stayed here upon arriving to Denver to go skiing and for our flight out after driving down the mountains.  (So we stayed in and out) The staff was great and the room was clean.  I watched over our stay the staff dealing rude guests and they (the staff) were very professional.One other thing, if you get a King bed room you also get a fold-out single couch which is great for your child.  You do not see that if you book online or in person.  Ask for extra sheets and a pillow and a blanket when you check in.  They are happy to give it to you.Best thing is the breakfast.  It is well beyond a ""continental breakfast"" as you get eggs, sausage, bacon, and lots more.  For myself and wife and child I would value the breakfast alone at $25.00.In the lobby they offer microwave meal and drinks as well if you get in late and the rooms have microwaves and coffee makers.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,You get what you pay for,"Not that comfortable sofa bed for the kids.  The pool was green.  The hand tap fell off.

The room was also short on linens and towels even though there was a personal welcome letter to the 4 of us registered to the room.  front desk staff polite and attentive.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Some good points ...some not so good,"The hotel is very convenient (5miles) to the airport terminal in Denver..which  is still within the airport complex (big airport).  Immediate impressions were not good ...parking was impossible ...there are basically 4 hotels together and it is not obvious who owns which car park...I initially found a spot  in the car park immediately opposite the front door of the hotel ,only to be informed by the person (after seeking advice) on reception that if  I parked there I risked being towed.  I then parked round the corner on a side road and proceeded worry about it for the rest of the night ...eventually getting up at 4am and moving the car to a ""better"" place.  Room was very good and clean.  Service at reception was friendly if basic ....but perfectly acceptable.  Breakfast was…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not as advertised,"We reserved the King Suite, on-line it shows a separate living room with a sofa sleeper, desk and a kitchen area then a bedroom area with the Jacuzzi. We got a small one room area with a bed, Jacuzzi that you had to hold the drain shut until it partially filled first, 1 upholstered chair, and 1 desk chair with the desk right next to the Jacuzzi, NO sofa at all. The room was #321 right next to the Elevator. This was a surprise for my wife for Valentines day. I sat in the desk chair while she sat in the other chair to watch a movie. No tv channel guide on the tv  to know what was on just a paper telling you what channel was what station. When I got home I found out that they overcharged me for the room by $25.00 but gave me a receipt showing the right price. Called the Hotel and…",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Terrific customer service !!,"Kudos to Best Western  Plus DIA. I arrived to the hotel  only to find out that Booking.com  never completed my reservation. Tara at the front desk couldn't have been more professional and understanding.  Without me even asking she said she would give me the room I had reserved  and match the booking.com rate.  I felt so relieved to have someone like her behind the desk.  Simply put, Best Western Plus is a comfortable, modern hotel with stellar employees. Thank you.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Pretty good for an airport hotel,"The good-The hotel was nice enough to provide a mini crib which is a step up from the typical pack n play. Breakfast choices weren't bad and better than a continental breakfast. Even slightly better than the usual Best Western Plus breakfasts that I've had. We didn't stay too long but for the time we were there it was pleasant and convenient.  The bad-The area has a problem with parking. Therefore, you kind of have to share parking space with the other surrounding hotels. Our flight arrived late at night so there wasn't alot of parking so that was kind of annoying in the winter. Rooms could use updating, and for some reason the sink is not in the bathroom but in the hallway of the room where there is carpet. Not a dealbreaker but just hard to get used to.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,WORST BEDS EVER,I have stayed in motels and hotels all over the US. This Motel had the worst bed I have ever tried to sleep in. If the next day is going to be busy dont stay here. The rooms seemed over priced for an evening stay.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Close to DIA with Free Shuttle,The Best Western DIA is a very nice hotel and convenient to the airport.  The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable. The shuttle runs 24/7. Be sure to book your seat the night before because the shuttle picks up at several of the local hotels. Be sure to call when you land to make sure there is a shuttle waiting. I was advised differently and had to call and wait.  The night front desk employee (Andrew) was super helpful. He answered my questions and got the shuttle turned around to pick me up. One thing that could be improved upon is the parking. Late night arrivals will have few options to park. One thing you can do is park behind the hotel on the street. It's not a busy pass-through street but one that runs behind all the hotels so your vehicle is safe. It's well lit from the street lights and viewable from the east side rooms. Overall a good stay and close to the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worst shuttle service on the planet Earth!!,"Arrived at DEN with a reservation at BW Denver Airport, booked and confirmed through their own website.  Waited for the shuttle at hotel pick-up ground transportation (east side), and when no shuttle arrived after 20 minutes, called the hotel direct line, but no answer.  Called again ... and again ... and again.  After four attempts someone picked up, and we're told the shuttle only picks up on the west side of Denver airport (of course, we were on the east side).  Was told the next shuttle would be by in 30 minutes (having stood outside already for 30 minutes).  I don't like to be made a fool of, so I read, and re-read, and re-read again the hotel confirmation, confirming that NO WHERE does the BW Denver state that shuttle pick-up is ONLY from the west side.  UGH.  Head over to the west side, and sure enough, a shuttle finally trudges along after 30 minutes.  Get to the hotel, and the front desk is not staffed.  Wait, and wait, and wait.  Clap, yell ... no one.  No wonder it took four attempts to get someone on the phone.  After 10 minutes, the clerk comes out of the back to check us in.  I must say, she was not phased by our displeasure in BW (she really didn't care).  She also confirmed that, yes, we were not crazy, the confirmations make no mention that shuttle pick-ups are ONLY from the west side. The astounding thing is that she also confirmed that we were the first humans on the planet that had EVER made mention of the east vs. west side pick-up fiasco.  Really fellow travelers??  Is everyone else as dense as this clerk, or are we really that much more cognizant than everyone else?  DO NOT STAY HERE.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice and decent,"We had to stay here because our flight got cancelled it was last minute but the hotel was very nice, clean and staff was very helpful.

Breakfast was really good and plenty of options.",4

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,2 night stay,Room was in great shape and clean. I have stayed at this location before and I have always been extremely happy with the quality of service and the rooms.  The only thing I missed was the complimentary water bottles that I have always been used to when staying here but not a deal breaker whatsoever.  I will definitely stay again.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Sleep & Fly,We stayed two nights at the hotel.  We did the sleep and fly package and left our vehicle for 5 nights.  The shuttle service worked well and our vehicle was safe and waiting for us at the hotel when we returned.  The bed was super comfortable.  The rooms are not updated but clean and very acceptable.  The staff was super helpful and friendly.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Convenient but lacks customer service ,"We stayed here because it was close to the airport. The room was fine, a little worn but for one night it was good. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. BUT the hallways were dirty. The front desk staff seemed bothered to help us. We arrived at breakfast early and they had already run out of items and didn't replace them. All in all, we were satisfied with the room but disappointed with the service. I wouldn't stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Offsite Parking Lot with Rooms,Totally agree with previous reviews on lack of parking.  The park and fly cars take up many of the available spaces.  Late arriving overnight guests are likely to have to park on dimly lit streets or in the lot of an adjacent hotel.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good hotel near AirPort,We stayed two nights in this hotel and found all OK. Near by AppleBees and easy accesos to the AirPort. But no to well marked streets. The AirPort shuttle  helped since we returned the car a day before our flight. The AirPort is huge and generally well run.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,No hot water and no where to park,I stayed one night before my flight.    I had to park a block away because the lot was filled by park and fly customers who had completely used up the parking lot.    Then the next morning there was no hot water.   The hotel staff were completely unwilling to help.  My advice is try the Hyatt near by.   They know how to treat customers,1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,would not stay here again...too many issues,"Had an early flight out of Denver so chose this motel close to DIA.  Have stayed in a Best Western previously and had a good experience.  However, this was not a pleasant experience.  The room smelled like a used clothing store, i.e. thrift store.  The bedding smelled, needed to be laundered.  The alarm clock could not be set.  Shower apparently had not been used for some time as the control knob to switch from tub to shower was very difficult to operate, stuck in the tub position.  We could hear voices/footsteps in the room above.  A very bad experience.    We used Mileage Plus airline points to reserve this room.  Not sure if they have specific rooms designated when reserved with airline points but that may be the case; I can't imagine Best Western offering this to cash…",1

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Average,"Stayed here for one night prior to flying home. The hotel is just average. The room had plenty of space for 2 people. We enjoyed having a king size bed and a sofa. The lady at the front desk was nice and very helpful! The bathroom in our room could have been a little cleaner though. Housekeeping left hairs in the bathtub and on the toilet, and there were a few toenail clippings on the floor. I cleaned it up myself with sanitization wipes. Housekeepers, remember to double check for stuff like that. The tub surround could also be replaced.  The worst thing about this hotel was definitely the parking.

It is about 10 minutes to the hotel via the free shuttle.  The only draw back to the free shuttle is that they drop you off in the shuttle zone and you must walk across 3 rows of traffic, then walk up 2 levels to check.  Since I was flying Southwest, this is about as far as possible to walk as possible.  Hotel staff was helpful but again, the shuttle service early in the am takes the front desk staff away from the desk to coordinate with the shuttle between the 3 hotels sharing the same parking area.  Parking is limited and a lot of people complained they could not park next to the hotel.  Room was big, clean and a nice bathroom.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Fair value for the price,"You will be fine as long as you do not expect too much from a Best Western. The location is quiet but there is NO available parking anywhere. You will end up parking on sidewalks, open fields, and other odd places if at all. It looks like they allow long-term parking while you travel hence zero parking for other guests. The shuttle is OK a bit smelly though and the drivers drive way too fast.  The amenities are fine, breakfast is plentiful (coffee is extremely weak), the pool was relatively clean open 24 hrs but there are no towels so bring your own, the room was clean as well (microwave and fridge included) with adequate supplies (coffee, shampoo, soap and such) and free Wi-Fi. Negatives: the TV works oddly: delayed commands, freezes, makes weird loud noises, and stations are hard to find. The walls are thin so be prepared to hear loud neighbors (we had to put up with a room full of people who yelled and laughed until 1:00 a.m. and kids running up and down the hallways slamming doors). The front desk staff is efficient but not friendly at all. I asked for a map of the area and was told I should have taken one at the airport...they also do not give out any basic information on breakfast hours, check-out time, places to eat... unless you ask which makes for a speedy check in: I walked in, gave my last name and was handed the card keys. Make sure you reserve your departure shuttle (again they will not tell you, you have to figure it out and read the sign) the day before as it gets full. Overall our stay was fine and a decent deal for the price considering how expensive hotels can be in Denver...",3

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Disappointing to Tired Travelers,"We arrived at the Best Western Plus Denver International Airport after a long, exhausting trip (around 2 am).  We had pre-booked our trip and called to let them know we were going to be late. We arrived in the cold and snow only to find ZERO parking available.  When we asked the man at the front desk about parking suggestions, he basically said ""good luck"". After driving around for 10 minutes he settled on the back side of a gas station (which was still a hike in the snow away).  We went to our room (while waiting for my husband to park we had discovered that people were being turned away because the hotel had been overbooked.  When we finally got to our room, it was filthy.

But there were some small ones. During the night, the air conditioner wouldn't go on waking us up more than once because of the heat. We finally opened the window, turned on the AC fan and got back to sleep. Not sure what happened there because when we checked in the AC was ice cold! Also, parking was a bit of an issue if you got in late. Breakfast is not bad, just regular. Staff seemed pretty helpful.",2

There was trash on the floor.  Hair in both beds that we found when pulling back the covers.  The ceiling in the bathroom was really gross. Hair and brown stuff on it. The shower curtain had something on it also.  There was no trash can liners, only 1/4 roll of toilet paper.  We will never stay in this hotel again. ",1

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,great hotel,I picked this hotel because it was a three star and the price was the same or a little less than the other two star hotels I was looking at. they let me leave my vehicle there for a week while I was away and offered free shuttle service to and from the airport which is a weight off of my mind. my vehicle was in the same shape as when I left it. I would stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good value,AAA discount. Rooms clean. Good breakfast. Good price.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Pick a different place.,"There are way too many choices in the area to pick this place. It was cold everywhere in the building, especially the hallways. Food service was bad, towels, soaps, etc. are cheap and low quality. Rooms look like they were decorated in 1960. Overall, it's a poor motel.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Convenient to the airport and Denver,"We had a pleasant stay.  The hotel is located in a cluster of hotels near the airport.  While there was no restaurant on site, there were several within walking distance.  However, there was nothing else in the vicinity if one wanted to go shopping or site-seeing.  The full breakfast was consistently well done.  We had to ask the staff for several extras, which is unusual for us, but we found the staff to be courteous and helpful in most cases.  We did speak to the manager about one incident where we made a request that was not followed through, and we felt the manager addressed the issue adequately.  We even asked for, and they supplied, a snow shovel to dig out our rental car!  Our room was comfortable, but we were surprised by the lack of window insulation.  One would have thought that would have been standard considering the climate.  Room rates were considerably lower at this hotel than the other surrounding hotels.  We received very good value for the money spent.  I would not have expected much difference in service at the other more expensive places.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Hotel. Great staff. Great breakfast.,We were heading to a conference and needed a good night's sleep the night before.  We decided to stay at the Best Western Plus because we always have a great experience with these hotels.  This hotel did not disappoint us.

It only runs every 30 minutes, but the next morning leaving the van was an hour late with no explanation so leave in plenty of time to catch your flight. The bed was very comfortable, but the refrigerator made noise all night. The inroom coffee maker was nice and the morning breakfast hours were only until 9am. Standard breakfast fare. I did like that the breakfast was unlimited and they had my favorite fruit!",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Exceptional Staff & Customer Service,"The staff made the check-in and check-out experience a pleasure. The Front Desk Supervisor was attentive and provided us with an incentive to return - by noticing the room occupancy load and finding a nicer room for us than we had expected. We had no expectation and this was such a nice touch - we'll be back.  Could not ask for better front desk service, location near airport -  and the hotel was clean, bright, inviting and professional.  TOP SHELF. Thank YOU.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western always a good choice!,"You can depend on a Best Western for offering a clean and comfortable room, providing a good rest; a welcoming staff, ready to meet any needs you might have; a good, complete breakfast, to start your day off right; and normally, shuttle service to a nearby airport, which is so appreciated.  We have never been disappointed.",5

There was still urine in the toilet, coffee stains in the sink, dirty spoons on the floor and the ice machine was broken.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Limited parking is a big issue,Similar to other Best Westerns in amenities and quality of rooms. Didn't hear airplane noises. We did get upgraded to a suite which was a nice surprise. We stayed a Friday night and the parking was very limited. It looks to be a problem with all the other hotels on the Tower Road area of the airport. We were lucky to get a parking space but didn't dare take our car out to go to a restaurant for dinner and had to settle for sandwiches from the 7 Eleven. If you are taking the free shuttle to the airport no problem with recommending. If parking your own car or rental you may want to try a different hotel. Price was good for location.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice and clean,"We had a stopover in Denver and enjoyed our stay.

People who appeared to be staff walked out of the hotel as we walked in hauling our luggage. Note on counter said, ""be back in 5 minutes."" Waited 15 & called the Holiday Inn next door to get a room. Holiday Inn was less expensive, too. If they had not seen us, I would not have been so irritated. ",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent value,"Staff went out of their way to help me get to the airport on time.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Good hotel, great and spacious room","This hotel along with a few other in the vicinity are about 15 minutes drive from the airport which itself is about 40-45 minutes from Denver or Boulder cities. The hotel has a free airport shuttle which is decent. The rooms are extremely comfortable spacious. The parking in the evening looked pretty full, so guys looking for parking would well be there earlier to book your slots. Breakfast options weren't too many. I wanted to check a few other rooms as the USB drive on one of the TVs wasn't working with the remote. The front desk was more than willing to show me a few. Would recommend this place.",4

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good Visit,"My wife and I stayed here the night before our flight to Maryland.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Place,Great hotel and great place close to Denver International Airport.  Many places to eat right around the hotel as well and the shuttle service was great both days I stayed there. Highly recommend for both business and pleasure.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Parking problems,They do not provide enough parking.  Cars were parked all over including the street and then filled a dirt lot.  I had no choice but to park in the dirt lot myself after driving thru the parking lots 3 times looking for a parking space.  I received a flat tire due to your hotel not providing anywhere near enough parking.  The cost and inconvenience not to mention the lost 3 hours for the tire change and then repair and travel impact was unacceptable.  When I told the clerk at the desk about the flat they didn't care and from what I learned I was not the first.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Wish we had more time at the Hotel.,"Very nice! Close to the Airport with on time shuttle. Comfortable bed and bedding.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent experience,"I arrived near midnight and still found the desk clerk really cheerful. He had my reservation and room key ready to go, so I was able to retire in jig time. The suite was clean, the bed very comfortable. Breakfast was a treat. I'm a meat and eggs guy, and the sight of actual scrambled eggs (not the rubbery cheese omelets that seem to be so popular these days) got my day off to a great start. Certainly worth your consideration for a pleasant stay.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Typical airport hotel, overall quality was better than expected","We were moved here from the Days Inn opposite who had no WiFi due to a problem, which we discovered after checking in. Both hotels owned by same people. Comfortable bed, food acceptable. Free hot breakfast which we never sampled as we left early in the morning, looked good though.",4

We were given an upgraded room at check in and they were honored our request for a quiet room on the top floor. Room was spacious, functional and very clean. Breakfast, although a bit crowded due to a tour group that was staying at the hotel, was very well presented, clean, bright, with many choices. Staff were very friendly and professional.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice Airport Hotel,I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and found it clean and the staff very friendly . The room was large with a comfortable bed and lots pillows . A real plus is that you can leave your car for a fee [ cheaper than airport ] and the shuttle is very convenient . Ask for a room in the back and 3 rd floor . Room 331 is nice .,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Things to know before you go,"There are a few things one should know before staying at this hotel.  First, it is in a great location - near the airport and away from busy streets but not too far from restaurants, etc.  The breakfast is great with scrambled eggs, breads, yogurt, etc.  But, there are a couple of things about the rooms that make the hotel less than desirable.    The lighting at the sink area (and only area for putting on makeup) is poor.  I tried turning on the bathroom light and leaving the door open to try and get more light.  That was not helpful at all.  The lighting is so poor that it is difficult to see to apply makeup.  Also, the blow dryer is tiny with little power.  Visitors might consider bringing their own blow dryer.  We used the stairs quite a bit and the stairwells are smelly but…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Review of Hotel,"Positive, sharp, clean and very accomadating, would do it again.  Very happy with Best Western Hotels.  I needed a hotel close to the airport.  Next time I will call directly to the hotel instead of 3rd party.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Save Your Money,"Hotel was dingy, in need of maintenance and staffed by people who view you as an interruption. Light blubs out in room, bathroom dirty and poorly lit, room arrangement put the sink in the bedroom - poor design. With all the choices at this location, why pay for a poor experience.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Bug nightmare,"There were toenail clippings of previous guest left on desk and chair.  Bugs of various varieties crawled around the room. There was hair on  the toilet and in the bed. Floors were not vacuumed very good.  The best thing was the location of the room, it was far from the elevator.  The eggs at the breakfast were not edible. Staff didn't seem to care.  When asked a bacon, I was told there wasn't any as she turned her back to continue her breakfast.  Staff was not friendly or respectful, Only the general manager.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Deplorable breakfast presentation,"Unresponsive staff. Substandard breakfast setup and staffing. Many items left in back room., and normally would be available. Server staff ignored patron requests, while socializing with non-staff friend.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean comfortable rooms close to the airport.,"We stayed at the Best Western Plus at DIA for a night before flying out the next morning.  The room was clean and comfortable, as was the rest of the hotel.  It was located within minutes of the airport, including the rental car drop off.  We did not use the shuttle, so we can't comment on it's efficiency.  There are a few restaurants nearby, but none seamed to appealing to us.  We ended up eating in a restaurant located in a neighboring hotel, that was not that good.  The lack of food in the area should not really be a strike against the Best Western, but when we look for an airport hotel, we rather not have to leave the immediate area for dinner.   We would probably spend a night a little further from the airport next time, so we could have morning dining options.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Overnight,An ideal place to stay if arriving at the airport late in the day.  Tucked behind some of the other hotels so minimal noise but a bit harder to find.  Good breakfast to set up for a day of travelling. Would stay again.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Ok for overnight,"We only wanted a one night stay so that we could start out early on our road trip. It is a 10 minute drive from the airport, it's a badly lit area comprised of a series of chain hotels and a small handful of restaurants.  The car park was full and we ended up parking a distance away and dragging our bags in. Check in was quick and we decided to buy a snack rather than go out again. There is a microwave and fridge in the room, but no crockery or cutlery!  The beds were comfortable, they were clean but the covers had old stains on them. The bathroom was not nice, needed some work and a really good clean there were pubic hair in the bath nasty!  It's nice to have an iron and board, coffee machine and a flat screen TV.  Breakfast is included and looked like it could have been really…",3

It is very affordable and felt like a luxury hotel.  We will recommend to our family and friends about the quality of your hotel.  It cannot be beat.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Aiming for ""Okay"" and missing","This facility is one of maybe a dozen chain hotel/motels clustered on a complex off of Tower Road near DIA. It is completely a matter of ""hide-and-seek"" to find your particular hotel among this array of similar sleep-boxes. There is one restaurant within walking distance, but getting there is life-threatening, as the notion of people walking from one place to another is not in the vocabulary of the planners for this area.  We like ""Best Western"" motels generally, as they are low-key, friendly, good value facilities for the most part. This one needs some TLC, though - some maintenance, some repair, some signage, some more parking, and some attention to detail. It isn't bad, but it doesn't live up to the standard of goodness that we expect of Best Western hotel/motels. The staff…",3

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Disappointed,"We often stay at Best Western Plus Hotels but we were very disappointed with this one. The service was fine and the room OK. But we could not get the room temperature to be comfortable. It was either too cool or too warm no matter how we adjusted the thermostat. And even when the temp was cool, the air felt humid and heavy. In addition, the carpet by the air conditioner was very damp. Just not a pleasant experience.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Best Western, you have issues.","Perhaps the most important service an airport hotel can offer is prompt and reliable airport shuttle service. It should not be rocket science, and yet Best Western fails miserably. The hotel insists on its shuttle service picking up arriving guests at the westside terminal and not the eastside, although a great majority of other hotels provide shuttle service on the eastside terminal as well. To make matters worse, Best Western does NOT consistently communicate this bizarre policy with guests when they make reservations.  If you have your heart on staying at Best Western, just remember to wait for the shuttle on the WESTside. Keep this in mind when looking for the shuttle van outside the WESTside terminal. I have included photos of the van so you'll know what to look for. Did I…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A very welcome place to stay,"Received detailed text instructions on how to find the free hotel shuttle bus which was very welcome and an excellent idea. Our room was large, very clean, comfortable and a pleasure to stay in. There was a complimentary hot and cold buffet breakfast available which was much appreciated.  The only downside was the small area was very busy and there was not enough tables and chairs available. Otherwise everything was fine.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,clean room,we really appreciate the clean room with great amenities in it.  The only disappointing experience we had was the lack of detailed direction for shuttle pick up area at the airport.  No explanation for first time customer that they will only come to west side terminal of airport.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Hotel needs caring management,"We stayed in room 326 which is on the top floor above the reception area. The room has two queen-size beds, a writing table & chair, small chest of drawers, small TV, microwave, refrigerator & coffee maker. The sink is outside the bathroom area. The room had nice carpeting instead of plastic-like flooring which you can easily slip on if wet. There were no luggage racks as was the case in another Best Western we stayed in so we had to put two luggage on the desk, so no desk area & the other luggage on a coffee table so no place to put coffee. There was only one roll of toilet paper, but there was room for two. Hotels should always have an extra roll of toilet paper. A full breakfast starts at 6:00 a.m. & an airport shuttle runs every 30 minutes 24/7. The breakfast had many selections including real eggs, instead of powdered & bacon.  There was no Gideon Bible in the room which many people like to read. The room colors were dark brown & moss green - way too dark & the furniture looked cheap. I think they could do much better at maintaining this hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel as close to where my daughter is living, very friendly staff couldn't do enough for us, gave us lots of tips of places to visit & sortedball the leaflets out for us.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Just a few minutes from the Denver Airport,"There are a number of hotels located just off Interstate 70 on Pena Blvd ( the road to the airport), but also, there are a group of hotels closer to the airport off Pena Blvd on Tower Road. It is a relatively new area, and lots of hotels. We have stayed in a number of them over the last couple of years. This Best Western hotel was a nice comfortable hotel to stay in . The rooms are comfortable and clean and bright. There is a restaurant close by (walking distance), and the hotel offers a morning breakfast. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. It is a good hotel to stay in before you fly out of DIA>",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,BestWestern DIA,Would recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay near the Denver airport.  Easy access to restaurants whether you have a car or not.  Shuttle was on time.  Staff was excellent. Rooms and public areas were very clean. Breakfast was the usual BW fare.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,worth it,"clean quiet safe.  would definitely go back,  close to airport but no noise from airport at all,  only 15-20 minutes from the main tourist area,  great staff comfy bed easy to find,  I will be going back there next time i am in denver",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice quick stay before going to the airport,"This hotel was a nice place to stay before having to leave for the airport in the morning. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The hotel has a free shuttle to the airport that gets you there quickly and efficiently. I did see some places to eat that were close by, but decided to walk to the 7-11 for dinner. The 7-11 was across the street from the hotel. I would stay at this hotel again in the future.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worst stay anywhere,"Staff were carefree and unhelpful. Not enough bedding in the room. Staff never corrected that properly, and sheets given to us were wet!  Cold room and could not change AC unit, stuck on. Many other people walking around with same comments and dirty rooms. And it is not a cheap hotel!!!",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Park, Sleep & Fly","I chose this hotel because I have a Best Western Rewards program and it offered park, sleep & fly.  The location was great and the shuttle to the airport arrived as advertised, both going and coming. The desk staff was personable and professional. Our first room, #122, was clean and comfortable, however the door was difficult to open. Because we had to leave on the 6 am shuttle to the airport, we did not get to take advantage of the breakfast, which started at 6 am. When we returned from our trip, the first room assigned to us, #100, smelled like sewer with room freshener trying to cover it up. We requested to be moved and were reassigned to the room we had stayed in before our trip, #122, which was OK.  We checked on our car which we left in the parking lot and it was fine. The next morning at 6 am we headed for the breakfast area. This area needs improvement. The eggs were out & hot, but the meat didn't show up until we were finished, about 6:25. There was no cold water to drink.  The dispenser for the apple and orange juice was not labeled as to which spigot was which. There was no syrup for the waffles. There were only a couple of yogurt cups in the container.  The floor was dirty and the garbage was full. I would have given a better rating if there had not been breakfast issues.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Better than the Average Airport Hotel,"The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.  The hotel is quiet and there is no airplane noise.  The breakfast could be improved by offering fresh fruit, but had enough choices otherwise.  Breakfast is only served until 9:00 AM and should be extended later.  The hotel lacks any kind of outdoor seating so there is no way to enjoy the warm evenings and no seating when waiting for the shuttle.  It is a very busy hotel, but the service was prompt and professional.  I would recommend.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Airport Stay,"We stayed @ the BW Denver Int'l Airport the night before our early morning flight.  It was clean & comfortable but best of all, close to the airport with a free shuttle which made getting to the airport a pleasure.  The shuttle was on time & clean.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A challenging hotel for a very welcoming staff!,"Hotel were very generous in offering me a free upgrade, staff were friendly and very welcoming! I wish I could give a better grade... Unfortunately, the cleanliness of my room was not perfect. I found an empty bottle between the bed and the night table. Also, the walls of the shower were stained. Breakfast area is too small for the amount of guests and became overcrowded, customers step on each other feet.  There was no yogourt offer which is an essential item of any breakfast.  In conclusion, despite the best effort of the staff, the satisfaction of customers would be jeopardize unless the hotel goes into a major facelift. I heard that it used to be a Ramada Inn and the operator of the hotel and Best Western should make the effort of going into renovations so it doesn't look like the old Ramada.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very good,"Clean. Great Breakfast.  Great staff.  Convenient to airport.  Only complaint, thin walls.  Could hear any movement in hallway and in the room above us.  We had an early flight, needed to get to sleep.  Would recommend bringing a noise maker if you stay here to put by your bed.  Other than that, it was great.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"No wifi, weak service, no vacuum","Beds were comfortable, breakfast was decent.  Wifi didn't have strong enough signal to use in room or lobby.  Was told to go to a neighboring ""sister property"" hotel to try there.    Our room was average but the floor was unclean.  Morning desk person lacking customer service.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,An unfortunate experience,"We stayed here for one night at the end of our vacation before flying home. We weren't expecting luxury, as it's just an airport hotel, but we were expecting things to be functional. Unfortunately, our experience at this hotel actually made the end of our trip actively unpleasant, rather than just ""fine"". We waited for 40 minutes at the airport for the free shuttle to arrive, seeing many other hotel shuttles come around twice. The hotel shares its shuttle with three other hotels, so by the time it did arrive, there was a mad rush to get to the van, and even though we had been waiting far, far longer than everyone else, we weren't able to get a seat and had to pay for a taxi. When we got to our room, the toilet wasn't flushing at all, and we had to switch rooms. We had trouble with the keycards in both rooms. When we finally settled down, we had decided to pay for delivery dinner -- there are no dinner options in the actual hotel, but there are a few restaurants in the area. The restaurant closest to the hotel didn't have a working phone (it connects you to an answering machine, and then it's nigh impossible to leave an actual message), and the Internet connection in the hotel was so poor that we were unable to continue our search for other restaurant options -- meaning we had to go to the restaurant and wait for 50 minutes for our takeout order, when we were feeling gross from our travels and extremely uncomfortable. The only saving grace was that the two people working at the front desk were extremely kind and apologetic, which put our minds a little more at ease. They gave us money for the cab, almost without us asking, which makes me think that the problems with the van have happened before. In short, an airport hotel is never going to be the high point of a vacation, but apparently it's possible for it to be an active stressor. Would not recommend.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Value,We stayed for one night after 24 hours of international travel.  The transfer from the airport was comfortable and easy to catch  We had a very comfortable stay and were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful breakfast selections that were included with the  price of the room.,5

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very satisfied!,"Was not disappointed at all! Called to make reservations because we had to go to the children's hospital and they were on the hospitals list for giving discount rates.They were the 4th hotel I called and the first to honor the rate from the hospital! We have to drive 7 hours to get to Denver. The hotel was a little out of the way sense its out towards the airport, but not bad to the children's hospital. Great location if your going to DIA! Very nice rooms, clean, continental breakfast (chocolate chip waffles!), pool was open 24 hours (kids loved that!), nice beds, good size mini fridge and microwave. Had awesome customer service, very friendly staff! We stayed 2 nights. Did hear that the wifi wasn't to fast, but there was a lot of people there and they did have a business center…",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great hotel near airport,The hotel has clean comfortable rooms. A free breakfast is provided as well as speed checkout! The hotel is close to other rstaurants and convenience stores. Very convenient to the airport with free shuttle service. Management takes customers feedback seriously. An overall excellent experience.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,OK hotel.  Not great customer service.,"Room was about what you'd expect for a Best Western.  Location is good if you're arriving late (or departing early) from the airport - it's a very short drive.  I don't recall having any issues with noises of arriving/departing jets.  The rooms had WiFi but the connection was s-l-o-w.The service was a little disappointing.  We were there two nights and several of the outlets in the breakfast room weren't working; that meant several of the breakfast items needing electricity weren't available (juice machine, toaster, warming trays for eggs/sausage, etc.).  I mentioned this to the front desk employee the first morning.  He essentially said it wasn't his problem.  I picked up the toaster and moved it to another working outlet in the breakfast area myself - so that guests and I could at least use that.  They hadn't fixed the electrical issue by the next morning.  I suggested an extension cord might at least permit them to get some other stuff working again - by plugging things into working outlets that were a few feet away.  The same front desk rep. said that wasn't really his job or anything he could help with.  The staff member stocking food in the breakfast area seemed to start a little later than the advertised breakfast opening time and seemed to be hoarding stuff.  For example, there was the standard tray with ice for yoghurts.  She never put any in during the two days we were there.  You had to go to the kitchen area door and ask her for one.  She would then open a fridge full of them, hand you one, and then put the box back in the fridge.  Odd.We reserved the room a family of four - but there were only two towels in the bathroom.  I called the front desk and was told I was welcome to come down to the front desk and pick some up.  A Best Western is not a Ritz Carlton - and I didn't expect some liveried staff to rush warm towels up to our room - but if you've got a reservation for four (or even two), put four of your small towels in the room - or show at least a little remorse when asking your paying customer to trot down to the front desk to get something that should have been in the room in the first place.It's been a while since I stayed in a Best Western.  While the room quality was similar to other chains in the class, the service was pretty underwhelming - and I think one's probably better off trying one of the other hotels in the Tower Rd area.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nice hotel with efficient airport shuttle,"Before our arrival, the hotel sent an email with detailed information on how to find the shuttle at Denver Airport.  The directions were right on and check-in was easy.  I had asked for a quiet room and our room on the first floor at the back of the hotel was quiet.  We had a one room suite which was clean with everything in working order. There are several restaurants nearby but some of them are across a busy 4 lane road.  There is a small selection of food items for purchase in the lobby.    Breakfast was nice and the salsa, cheese, and ham to add to the scrambled eggs was a nice touch.  Our shuttle back to the airport in the morning was right on time.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,poor housekeeping,"Stayed at hotel for 6 days.  Upon arrival we noticed that a chair was missing, had no luggage rack, and only had two towel set ups for three people even though we booked for three adults.  Went to front desk about luggage rack only to be told they don't put them in any rooms.  On third day of our stay we left the room at 10:30, and came back at 2:00, our room was not made up, spoke to desk clerk, she called housekeeping but informed us that when you have extended stay they don't make up the room.  On the fourth day we left at 9:00 and came back at 1:30, our room was not made up, spoke to manager and he told us to let them know when we left the next morning and our room would be made up. We left at 7:00, came back at 1:30, and our room was still not made up.  When the maid came it was like we were putting her out.  What was so annoying is that housekeeping was across from our room, so we couldn't understand what was going on.  We were not the only people to complain about this.  Everything else was fine at this hotel, but will not stay there next year.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Close to airport and car rentals,"Good hotel; close to Denver airport and car rentals; restaurants close to hotel.

There were restaurants, stores, and a gas station all very close by.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nonstop Failures,"My biggest complaint here was the staff.  It started two nights before I arrived, sadly.  I received an email welcoming all of the VIPs arriving the night I was arriving.  Since everyone's email address was put in the ""To"" field, I could see that it was just everyone that was arriving that night, not some fictitious VIP list.  Not that I'm judging them for that, what I'm judging them for is sending everyone's email in plain text to every other arriving guest that night.  That is just tacky and shows they have no respect for our personal information.  I decided to let that go and just move forward.  When I arrived at the hotel (well before check-in), I asked if I could use the laundry.  The woman at the desk treated me like some random person walking in off the street (I told her…",1

They do have laundry service, just make sure if you use it to put it on ""Perm Press"" otherwise your clothes will not dry. It is $2.00 for dry and $2.00 for wash cycle. They have dryer sheets and laundry detergent for sale at $2.00 per box.   Wi-Fi is free and unfortunately slow.

The location was great, the breakfast buffet was full, and the room had a ton of outlets for charging electronics. The room was spacious with two beds and a separate living area with a pull out sofa bed. The section of the room with two beds was a bit tight as one bed was flush with the wall. It worked out well for having a young child who might fall out of bed, but if a teenager or adult was sharing the bed it would have been annoying to crawl over someone to get out of the bed.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,SUPER STRONG POT SMELL!!!  HORRIBLE-SICKENING!!!,"We were on the third floor.  The whole hall reeked of pot.  I reported it to all shifts at the front desk, but nothing was done.  The standard answer was. ""They sign a no-smoking agreement and we charge them $200 if they smoke.  There is nothing else we can do.""  I covered the cracks in the door with towels, the ironing board, the closet curtain and hung up the coffee bags to keep the smell out of our room.  That did work.  When my children and I went into the hall, we used towels to cover our nose and mouth.  The smell made me sick to my stomach.  HORRIBLE!!!  The fire alarm went off at about 11:45pm.  There was smoke in the hall and some of the hotel guests evacuated the building.  The staff made no attempt to account for the guests and guests even went in and out as they pleased although firefighters had entered in full gear with hoses.  It turned out to be only a trash can fire, but nobody knew that at the time.  I think the staff acted very irresponsibly in all aspects.  I would NEVER stay here again!!   We had a wonderful spring break but it ended here on a horrible note.  The only good is that the beds were comfortable and there is an airport shuttle every 30 minutes.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Park-Stay-Fly package - Real Deal,Our flight leaves at 6AM and we leave 80 miles from Airport..

Parking is hard to find so if you get a spot you are lucky but they let you also park at there sister hotels next door. Saving on Parking almost pays for the Hotel Room and shuttle to and from were on-time. Room was clean and bed was very comfy. Our only problem which is not hotels fault is the ceiling and walls are a little thin and we need to go to bed super early due to a 3:30AM wake up time. So kids upstairs were very loud.. but i woke up later in the night and hotel was super quiet. It would be nice if the hotel provided a breakfast to-go bag for customers leaving before meal is served.. Just be extra sweet.,4

No one offered help to elderly guests who had trouble gathering items and getting them to tables. The pool and hot tub did not look clean, we did not use. We  were given just one bath towel each, both days.  We were out and about after our breakfast, slept well and were helped by the morning staff with directions to area attractions.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Had issues,"Pillows very small, hard to sleep on. Bathtub very slippery, had to hold on rail. Air would not shut off. Towel rack above toilet to close to head when getting up. This was not the quality I expected from Best Western. A very nice looking motel, but not a place I would want to go back to very soon. I will go back to Best Western as this is my really first poor experience with the chain.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Disappoinnting,"I arrived at Denver International Airport on Thursday evening and checked in to this Hotel to await my daughter's arrival at DIA the next morning to go to V ail. As a Gold Elite member I was given an upgrade to a suite. They do not always have an upgrade room available, so that was appreciated.   I also found a letter in my room from the Assistant Manager advising that:    - in addition to the room upgrade, I would receive an additional 250 bonus points ""for staying with us"".    - that they would send a survey after checkout to get my reaction to their hotel and would award an additional 250 points on completion.Neither of these was necessary of course, but the letter made me feel good and their desire to get feedback spoke well of the intention to provide the best stay possible for all guests.But, although I got the room upgrade, neither of the other two promises were fulfilled. I received neither the first 250 bonus points, not the promised survey for completion (and so not the 250 points for completing it either). It would not have been an issue if neither of these things were done, if the letter had not stated they would be done. However, if you say you will do something, it reflects poorly on the hotel if it is not done, regardless of how minor.I also used a $100 Best Western Travel Card voucher in partial payment of my bill. It seemed that it was inconvenient for the evening desk clerk when I produced this. It was credited, but when I saw my bill in the morning the $100 credit had been reversed by an additional $100 room charge. It was all straightened out later in the morning and I received the correct credit, but it seemed odd.Other issues:    - there is very little parking. The Holiday Inn Express next door is owned by the same management company and I was told to use their lot, but it was almost full as well. Parking can be a problem, but there is no charge.    - There was a missing hanger on the back of the bathroom door - that is, there was a place where a hanger used to be, but it was gone. This is where I hang my toilet kit, so it was inconvenient not to have the hanger.    - slippery bathtub with no safety rubber mat and no bath mat on the tile floor. Stepping one to the other was a slippery exercise.Not a bad hotel certainly, but not really more than what I would call average.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Low price, always clean and good breakfast","I have been staying at this hotel years after years for the first night before a ski trip.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Great Location, Great Staff",We needed a hotel last minute. Our international flight landed MUCH later than excepted. I jumped on a travel website and found hotels to be very expensive. I called Best Western DIA and Brian took great care of me! We just needed a place to sleep and I got more than that. The hotel is located near the airport. Easy to get to. Beds were comfy. We ate at the hotel's free breakfast. It was good. Easy check in and check out! We will be back!,5

Same at check out; the clerk didn't bother to ask us how our stay was. We handed in the key and all we received was a :"" thank you, that's all I need.""

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Uninspired,"We arrived and was greeted by a dismissive checking assistance as we started to check in she started picking up the phone and answering telephone calls & was quite dismissive to a person on the phone telling them just to come down to reception & get it yourself. So cold small convenience store did not have much variety & i personally think a bit expensive. The room was basic i would have expected a better room for the money instead we got a ( I think cheap ) end of the market room we stayed in other hotels along tower road paid less & better service & a much nicer room, in the room i dropped my cell phone on the floor looked under the bed & there was some debris/ rubbish under the bed also found some loose change lying around on the floor so did they even bother vacuuming it makes you wonder. Also had trouble with the ac unit is unable to turn it off so we pulled the plug out and then there was some other guests with children who seem to think the children we're allowed to run up the corridor screaming & yelling like the wild life in colorado.  We have stayed in best western hotels throughout colorado & have a much better time something has clearly gone wrong at this one next time we come here unfortunately we will look at other hotels . we have stayed in best western hotels throughout colorado and have a much better time something has  clearly gone wrong at this one .",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent hotel near the airport,"This hotel is great.

We will probably stay here every time we are in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Decent hotel,The outside lighting was not working for some reason so the hotel was a bit bard to find. What's that all about.

This was our least favorite...it was not bad, but probably what you could call Average for a hotel airport midprice...desk attendant was barely with it, wearing a goofy hat...the pool was not clean enough to use, and the pillows were sub-par.  Not bad, but not good.  By the way...always ask for Manager's Special, and get a lower price than they first quote...sometimes lower than even appears on Tripadvisor.  ",3

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Watch out for slippery bath tubs!!,We took the shuttle from the airport to the motel. The driver had serious attitude and was borderline rude.  Checkin was easy.  The rooms were clean...but.... The bathtub was like a skating rink. Very slick and one person in our party fell. All of us slipped and slid when entering the tub.  We told the front desk and they did not seem to care. They said they had complaints in the past but there was nothing they could do.  We had stayed there the week before and our rooms were on a different floor. The tubs were fine.  So beware!  Can you imagine if it was my mother that fell?  It could have been horrible !,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Denver Airport Stay,"The hotel was very convenient to the airport.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Stayed here before flight out, everything good","Stayed here Friday night March 6th before flying home.    Doing this let me return the rental car a day early.    The shuttle picks up at the airport at 15 and 45 minutes past the hour.   It's a good idea to call the front desk and ask for a pick up, island 3, door number 306 on the west side only.   Call this number 1-303-373-1600.   If you can see the mountains, then you are on the west side.    For the return back to the airport, sign up the night before at the front desk.   The shuttle picks up at the top and 30 minutes past the hour.     Stayed in room 125, everything was good.   Didn't eat the breakfast because we left at 04:30am, but the shuttle was on time.    We caught flights out first thing in the morning, they left on time, and were not crowded.    Early morning flights at 6am are a good idea, even if you don't get to eat the breakfast at the hotel.  Daughter's flight left at 06:05am, we took the 04:30am shuttle and arrived with 20 minutes to spare after going through security.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very happy,We had a wonderful stay! We were pleasantly upgraded to a great suite upon checking in.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great find for Denver airport hotels,"This was the first time staying at the Best Western Plus on Tower Road and I was extremely pleased with the staff and the hotel.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Excellent service, friendly staff","We were stranded in Denver overnight due to weather while traveling home from Mexico.  When we learned our flight was cancelled I began calling airport hotels and was told by Eric at the BW front desk that they only had a suite left, and the price was increased due to weather.  I admit I was rather testy with him when I informed him I was unimpressed with that policy and I hung up.  After I called at least 15 other hotels, all sold out, I called Eric back with my tail between my legs.  Suddenly $200 doesn't seem so bad when the alternative is sleeping in the airport!  Eric certainly could have been snarky with me when I called back, but he wasn't--he politely told me the price and let me book the room, and gave me shuttle instructions.  In my travel fatigue induced spaciness, I had to call back at least 3 times to get shuttle info (and have him repeat the name of the hotel at least twice) and with each call he was patient and friendly.  Once we met the shuttle, we were also impressed by the professionalism of the driver; there was a family with small children in the shuttle and he dropped them off first, which I thought was very polite.  He navigated the crappy roads safely as well.  Eric checked us into our room, and continued to be friendly and patient with us; loading us up with toiletries without batting an eye, as our bags were in the airport.  Right at the end of the check in process another (rather rude) young couple came in, demanding a room.  Eric stepped over to the other desk to deal with them, which was fine with us, as we were in no hurry.  The other couple seemed determined to make Eric find them a room, so he called a few places for them--over and above what he needed to do, as there were obviously no rooms to be had anywhere near the airport. Ruby finished up our check in process for us while Eric dealt with the other couple, and she was also just as courteous as Eric.  As for the room itself, it was clean and comfortable, and we had a really good night's rest.  Breakfast in the morning was really excellent and the return shuttle driver just as nice.  All in all we hope to never get stranded in Denver again, but if we do, this is where we will stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Not the best, but not that bad.","Older hotel, clean... More or less.  Breakfast was not too impressive but it provided a warm cup of coffee.  Free shuttle to and from airport was a nice treat-- quick and efficient!  Only about a 15 minute drive from the airport. Shuttle comes every half hour at door 506, island 3, only the west terminal.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Fix your shuttle service,"If you need a hotel with reliable transportation to/from DIA...this is NOT your choice. Waited 45 minutes in the cold at 9:30pm for a pick up at DIA and then the only option to DIA in the morning was three hours before we needed it. Perhaps increasing the number of shuttles, especially during busy times, might be an option here folks! We ended up paying for a cab in the morning. The breakfast needed items refilled so wasn't able to eat what I wanted, but what I did have was ok.  The quality of all of the hotels in that area is the same...average...so it's really all about the service like shuttle and breakfast, and Best Western Plus DIA failed on both accounts since we had to pay for a cab to DIA and breakfast when we arrived there.  Staff in the morning and at night were both unapologetic for shuttle hassles.",2

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Poor staff,"We stayed one night for an early morning flight.  We requested a first floor room at the time we reserved the room, several months in advance. When we arrived, the clerk was unfriendly, unsmiling and acted totally disinterested in us as guests.  She played around with the computer as if our arrival was a supprise.  We were early so we were told to come back at 3:00 pm, which we did.  We were assigned a room and when we walked in the room, we found two people sleeping in the two beds.  We complained back at the front desk and our clerk then assembled three other employees.  The four of them began fussing over the computer trying to figure out what had happened for 10 minutes.  A supervisor then went down to the room to confirm that there were people already in the room, as if we…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Make sure you wait for the shuttle bus in the right place!,"The hotel room was average, it seemed to be one of the older ones in the area.  We got a good deal with a Groupon, so it was good for the price we'd paid.  Breakfast was ok - waffles, pastries, eggs etc.  We were going to use the pool, but it looked very dirty.  There are several restaurants located nearby, some of which offer a delivery service.  Our stay was completely satisfactory, with one exception, the hotel has recently changed it's shuttle bus pick-up point, something that airport information didn't seem to have been informed of, so we waited for almost an hour on the wrong side of the terminal, before finding the correct shuttle location.  Not ideal after a full day travelling, but the receptionist did say she was going to let the airport know the right location.",3

What a nice Holiday surprise!  We got so comfy in our awesome room, we decided not to leave and just order in since we had to be up so early for our flight!

The breakfast was both good and ample. If you wanted to make your own waffles, the batter was ready for you. A good-sized pool and a separate, well-equipped exercize room were available for the free use of hotel guests. There are a number of other hotels and a few bars and restaurants in this hotel cluster.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Will stay somewhere else next time,"We needed to book an Denver airport area hotel due to an early morning flight out on January 10.  We saw that a Best Western was available, so we booked it without considering other hotels since we were familiar with the Best Western value and brand.  We have stayed at Best Westerns in other locations and have always been happy with the value as a moderately priced hotel. However, we were very disappointed in the poor customer service, apathy and lack of attention to detail at this particular location.   There are quite a few hotels clustered together in this area---google ""Denver Airport Tower Road hotels"" and you can see what other options are available other than this hotel.  We arrived early Friday evening, and there was absolutely no parking.  We did the continuous circle…",2

Very Friendly & helpful checkin with ""Ryan"",even at though it was quite late (last flight). Room was exceptionally clean, especially the bedding, and I'm picky about that. The lobby seemed updated, and breakfast was adequate. My only suggestion is being an airport hotel, food should be ready earlier, my return flight was very early, and I missed the great omelets. ",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"If you need wifi, it's hit or miss here.","We could not connect to the hotel wifi on any of our devices. The guy at the front desk told us that the rooms down the hallway can have difficulty connecting. We were in room 307, so if you need to use wifi, avoid that room. If you get in really late and need your sleep, you will definitely miss breakfast. They stop at 9, earlier than most places. Limited dining options within walking distance.  You can either go to Village Inn or Ruby Tuesday, which are both under a mile away. If you don't like either of those,  you're out of luck.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Disappointing experience,"Overall this place was clean and relatively quiet, but we downgraded it substantially for the following reasons:  1.  Hidden costs--they bill this as an all-inclusive ""park and ride"" hotel, but when we actually checked in, they informed us they bill you separately an extra $8/day for the parking.  That's the same rate that the airport does, so why bother to get a hotel room?  It's cheaper to book a later morning flight, save the hotel cost and pay the airport to park.  Most irritating is that they don't tell you this on their website, nor do any of the other online booking options mention this.  By the time you show up to check in, it's too late to make other reasonable arrangements.  And as an additional ""salt in the wound"" they make you park around back and threaten to tow you…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,great location for early plane travel & parking,"Overall this location was pretty good.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worst customer service,"The hotel's location is nice and the hotel itself is fair.  What I didn't like is the front desk worker.  If not for the worker I'd give this hotel a higher rating.  If you ever go to this hotel and have to deal with Ruby, then good luck!  She's not nice at all, never cracks a smile, and please, by all means don't even think of asking her for help or she'll probably blow a gasket.  She was extremely Rude!  Her name should be more like Rudee!!!  Even today she leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  When I got in to my room I was disappointed that it wasn't what I reserved.  I had bought a suite (2 queens with a pull out sofa).  There were five of us and I wanted to make sure everybody had a bed. It was not a suite, but just 2 queens.  I called Rudee downstairs and she insisted that I had reserved 2 queens.  I checked my records and found that I did indeed reserve a suite.  I go downstairs to show her and there is nobody at the front desk.  I look behind and there is Rudee sitting at the breakfast table talking on her cell obviously taking a personal call.  So unprofessional!!!  So I show her my receipt and she has the audacity to say, ""Oh, the suites are overbooked"".  So pissed that she lied to me the first time.  She wasn't going to do anything to make things right so I told her that I'm not going to pay for 2 queens at a suite rate.  She says she'd give me a $10 discount.  RUDE, RUDEE!!!!  If I didn't say anything she'd leave me hanging.  Felt bad for my kid who had to sleep on the dirty hard ground!!!!",1

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Better choices on Tower Road,Inattentive front desk upon arrival and in the evening of our stay.  Room was short towels and linens for the pull-out sofa.  We had to go to the front desk to pick these up.  The first set of linens for the pull-out sofa were damp and had hairs in the bag - gross! The second set was better.  The mattress was stained - also gross.The layout of the room was a bit strange - it was a suite but the sink for the bathroom was in the area where the pull-out sofa was located - so much for privacy.  We've stayed at other hotels on Tower Road with a better experience.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Frustrating,"Our neighbors had stayed here before and made reservations for us going to and returning from an overseas vacation. They are regular BW customers and were using points and a voucher for their lodging. For whatever reason, they experienced one impediment after another in trying to check in. Instead of trying to assist our neighbors, the clerk was a hinderance. I've rarely witnessed such a lack of customer service. We encountered a minor hassle checking in as our neighbor reserved our room under his name, and this seemed to cause some confusion. Then on our return stay, it was deja vu all over again. The clerk wanted our neighbor to produce some sort of paperwork which he searched for in all of their luggage including a bag stored in the vehicle which necessitated us going outside in freezing, snowy weather for a futile search of the bag. After all of this, which took at least half an hour, the clerk finally allowed our neighbors to check in. The rooms were okay except my wife upon stepping into the shower the next morning, discovered no shower curtain. Never encountered that before. Our neighbors thought they had no trash can but finally discovered one hidden away in a corner of the bathroom. We thought that would be the end of our frustrations, but not so fast. At home the next day, the BW called saying we had not paid for one of our nights and charged our room to our neighbor's card. Our credit card had been charged correctly for each night, but our neighbor still had to make two calls to BW customer service to resolve the situation. Our neighbors said this was the first such experience they had had at a BW, but for us, we would not recommend a stay at this BW. I'm not sure if this was just a problem clerk or clerks, but sometimes problems and attitudes such as we experienced originate with the management.",3

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Don't Park 'N Fly Here,"As usual, we booked a hotel at the airport the night prior to our departure, using the Park 'N Fly program.  This is the first time we stayed at the Best Western under the program.  Upon check-in we confirmed that we were staying one night and we'd be back the following week for our car.  We were told at the front desk that the hotel shuttle runs 24/7 on the half-hour, so we took an early shuttle to the airport the next morning and expected to pick up a shuttle at the hotel shuttle island upon return.  We arrived home to sub-zero weather and waited 45 minutes at the shuttle island, finally giving up and taking a cab to the hotel.  The explanation was, ""you're supposed to call - the shuttle only runs on demand."" This should have been explained before we left! Best Western hotel rooms are pleasant and sufficient for our purposes - but we'll never stay at this one again. Poor customer service trumps all else.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Good stay, but no WOW factor to this BW+ Hotel","I think the best term for this 2 day stay is; Lack of Attention to Detail. First off, bad location, hidden behind a Red Lion Hotel, it just needs a sign. Main drive was plowed of snow, but handicap parking spaces needed plowing and salt treatment for heavy ice buildup. Lawsuit waiting to happen. The hotel was clean & very presentable. The main Internet was down for easily 18 - 24 hours, building wide. When fixed it was quick & fast. Modem probably needed rebooting, which I hinted to main desk PERSON. She was working very hard, fast & steady, she needed a partner, desperately. Room wise, Toilet paper & tissues needed replacing first day. The tub had no stopper for a bubble bath, repaired the next day, fairly quickly when brought up a second time. The room door has been jimmied (broken into) leaving door frame bent, door closed properly but we were unable to bolt the door due to the door frame damage. Now, The Positive side of life; the room was clean, beds firm, comfortable & clean. The staff was kind, polite, caring & professional. Cable TV worked fine the entire time also. A tad more attention to detail, this stay would have been an easy 4 Star rating for our stay. One more very minor thing, & it occurs at many Hotels, not enough complementary shampoo, conditioner, & hand lotion for a two person room. Lastly, the only ice machine was on the third floor of a three floor hotel, in the back forty of the floor to boot. A very long walk for a small bucket of ice. The hotel also doesn't use trash bags for its trash cans. The replacement cost of the trash cans must on the high side. Also, another BIG Plus, as close to DIA as we were it was a very quiet stay.",3

The room was clean and the breakfast was okay.  It is a convenient location with a prompt shuttle to the airport.  Parking appear safe.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Disappointment at Denver hotel,"Returning from Central America we had a 12 hour late night layover in Denver and opted for the Best Western Plus on Tower Road near the airport. That was a bad decision as the hotel disappointed in most services and failed outright in a couple of critical areas. On arrival we called for the shuttle. After it arrived instead of the two minute stop to load passengers and bags the driver wandered up and down the waiting area, visiting with people waiting for other shuttles, and providing directions to some. After a 20 minute wait we departed for the hotel. Despite having called twice from the airport the desk clerk was not prepared for our check-in. Then during that process, and after giving him a credit card, he took a telephone call that lasted several minutes and appeared to be of a personal nature. But for the late hour and my card being held hostage by the clerk I would have departed to find another hotel. Eventually he provided a key and we went to the room. Hotel staff had left the room thermostat set at 41 degrees, and although the room was not that cold, it took time to get it up to a reasonable temperature. While unpacking I tried to lock the room door but the deadbolt would not set because the striker plate had been installed upside down, a serious security concern. Although the tub had an accessibility bar installed on the wall, there was no traction mat to put down in the tub and it was dangerously slippery. At least the beds were very comfortable, wifi worked great, and the breakfast was adequate. And the shuttle driver (Koy) the following morning was outstanding. He was courteous, efficient and helpful with directions for getting around the airport. Overall this hotel was a disappointment, quite surprising for a Best Western which is often my first choice in hotels. But next time with a long layover at Denver we will look for another lodging option.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellent value for a short stopover,"We decided to spend a night in Denver after arrival at DIA from the UK.  This hotel has all the facilities and amenities needed for a short stay traveler. Checkin is fast, friendly and efficient. Room has a comfortable bed with a sofa, a writing table, fridge, TV and a microwave. There's even a proper coffee maker. Hotel is convenient located near a 7/11 garage and restaurants. Opens till late. Breakfast is sumptuous - typical continental breakfast help yourself items, and  a waffle maker. Overall, an excellent value hotel.  Will be back this winter.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Unacceptable,"Dirty underwear in one bed and bed bugs in the other bed. I wish I could attach pictures to this review as proof. Make your own decision. I could not stay there and had to go toanother hotel for the night. Needless to say, I will not be going back to this hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great location; comfortable accomodations,"Arrived shortly after 3 pm on check in date; room was clean and ready. Requested additional linens for the sofa bed and they arrived within 10 minutes. Although our room was near the elevator, we were not disturbed by any noise during our one night stay. Breakfast was ready on time (as we were very punctual, due to an early morning flight) and the shuttle arrived on time to get us to the airport. Our only regret was that we did not bring any swimming attire as the indoor pool and hot tub looked very inviting!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Poor room and Poor services,This hotel offered a room is no bathtub and they offer the room is near by elevator. It is very noise room. Me and my wife can't sleep all night. We spoak to front desk and they won't change the room for us. We will not never and ever go this hotel again.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Airport stay in Denver,"Avoided snow delays getting to the Denver airport by staying at the Best Western. Best thing about it is the proximity to the airport. Rooms are clean and comfortable + when you open a window on a snowy night in Colorado, they tend to cool quickly. They billed me for 2 night instead of 1 and I am waiting for this to be credited. Left before breakfast so....no comments there, But Coffee would have been nice.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Park and flew for this review!,"This is the most convenient and efficient park, fly and stay we have had in the Denver area. The shuttle was running regularly. The car was safe and the room and hotel were real nice. Friendly and efficient staff made the whole thing go off without a hitch. Good breakfast. Nice indoor pool. Tough to beat.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Need to Step It Up,"I typically have good experiences at Best Western facilities, but this particular stay needs a comment.  I arrived late after missing my connection at the airport.  Didn't notice anything amiss until I got up the next morning to find that the bathroom had no fresh bath towels.  There was a used one hanging on the back of the door.  It was 7:30 in the morning, a busy time, I'm sure, for the front desk.  I opted not to call for some as I had a shuttle to catch.  I had a clean bath mat and a couple hand towels.  Didn't travel with a blow dryer and the room's blow dryer didn't work, so I had to leave with wet hair on a cold morning.  I had 30 minutes until my shuttle arrived so sat down with coffee to watch the morning news.  That's when I saw the mouse dart across my room and run…",1

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western Hotels are Tanking,"We stayed at the Best Western at Denver International Airport.  The front desk at that time of nite appeared to be too bothered to help us with internet or extra blankets, but ended up bringing us blankets anyway.   There were bugs on the floor, in the blankets and in our bath towels  It was nasty.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good room and easy access to Denver Intl Airport,Friendly front desk and nice room. Good included continental breakfast. Very easy to get from here to airport quickly. No restaurant but several nearby. Newer property hidden behind another hotel when we were trying to find it off Tower Road.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean Comfortable & Cozy,"We made reservations and stayed at this Best Western for one night on our way to Laramie, Wyoming.  We stayed in a king suite and the room was super spacious very clean and the temperature was perfect.  The insulation was so good that we never heard room noise or airport noise and we had one of the best night's sleep especially for such a busy hotel.  We arrived late on a Thursday night and were weary from working all day and traveling all evening/night.  The gentleman at the front counter was quick and efficient to get us checked into our room so we could relax.  The next morning we had a good breakfast and took a really nice long walk down the back street of the hotel which is a well-paved area and very clean and quiet.  Just an overall good location and great place to stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Nothing spectacular, but quiet and comfortable","Located in the ""hotel area"" you need to catch the shuttle. Our room was a good size, beds were very comfortable and it was clean and quiet - not sure what else you could want really!. Oh, and there was a good shower. Typical 'American' breakfast of sweet rolls, coffee and cereal, nothing hot. No bar or restaurant so we went to another hotel across the road.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Poor service,"I believe the receptionist at the front desk would have avoided us altogether if another employee hadn't been standing there.  She was combing her hair when we walked in and continued to fuss with her hair and talk with the other employee.  The lighting in the room was bad, and one of the fixtures had bugs in it.  The breakfast room is so poorly designed, people were constantly in each other's way.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,DO NOT STAY HERE,Staff was very disorganized and could not find my hotel reservation. I was charged for parking even though I rode the airport shuttle to and from the hotel and I had to inform hotel staff in order to do that. I was charged three separate times by this hotel and called to find out why and they couldn't explain it to me. They were supposed to refund me after the first two incorrect charges and then I was told the third charge was a result of the staff not correctly preforming the refund. I received no apology for the inconvenience and no explanation except staff incompetence.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great start to our road trip,Very close to the airport & fairly easy to find. Large clean room and a fantastic breakfast included in the price which made it good value for money. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were hard. There's a convenience store and a couple restaurants within walking distance. I'd book this hotel again.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Denver Airport Hotel,"This hotel is ideal if you are arriving or departing fro DEN.  I chose to drop off my rental car a day early and use the shuttle to the airport.  Perfect for that scenario.  The rooms are good sized, comfortable and clean.  There are problems however.  Limited dining options close by; there is a small grocery but has limited offerings; this hotel does not offer dining.  The biggest problem I experiences was the limited internet access.  I had no internet in the two rooms I was offered.  After that they said I should use the business center which I did, BUT only One computer was functional.  So great location if you are flying but not so good for anything else.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Stay away from Room 214,"Room 214 is directly over the automatic entrance doors to the hotel.  This room should not be assigned to any customer, as the constant vibration every time someone enters or leaves the hotel shakes the bed and floor of this room, which will keep you awake all night long.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Book your Shuttle in Advance,nowhere on the website or in the booking process did it state that you had limited availability on the shuttles.  we wanted a 8 am shuttle and was told it was already full.  7:30 and 8:30 also full so we could go an extra hour early or an hour late so we took 7am.  ridiculous.  no where did it warn us to book our shuttle res in advance to be assured of a seat.  it only stated 24 hour shuttle service.  very inconvenient.  awful way to start the trip.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,bad mistake,"we had a 6 am flight and wanted to stay closed to airport. we found all other hotels booked and found 1 so called room at this hotel but it was a ""suite"" and cost more. we asked for a 3:30 am wake up call which never happened, the bathroom tub didn't drain and the driver of the ""courtsey shuttle"" was very rude and dropped us at the wrong terminal and told us to get there on our own.  while the rest of our stay was great this put a bitter taste to end it.  We tried to call the front desk and ask why they didn't call but the phone didn't work which is why we didn't get the wake up call. when we asked the front desk about the phone all he said was that he thought we were on the phone. for more than 30 mins.? who would we be calling at 3:30 am. when we told him that there was no…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Needs some attention,"The staff is great, but management apparently doesn't care about some of the amenities.  AAA says this motel/hotel is upgrading (from 2013) if they're done, don't bother staying here for the price.  The requirement to have 200  characters for a review is ridiculous,",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Better Than Expected,"I stayed here on short-notice after needing a place to stay for an early flight out the next day.  The lobby professional was polite and able to get me a clean room quickly.  The wireless and amenities were good.  I usually stay at another chain and usually regard Best Western as more of a budget facility; However, the lodging was better than expected in that I would recommend it over others in the same price range.  My only concern was when I left early (4:30am) the following morning, the lobby front desk was covered with billing material and articles of what either was school homework or maybe just the night shift's reading material.  I was told that I could not get a reciept since the books or audit (?) was not complete.  I am hoping this person providing this information was…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good Experience,"We were traveling and stayed the night to fly out the next day. It is very good location if you need a quick stay and flight out the next day because it's very close to Denver Int'l Airport. Also, if you need a place to eat, there are some local restaurants across the street from the hotel plus Brighton and other communities are within a reasonable distance. Service is great, the breakfast wondeful, and the hot tub very relaxing.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Disappointed!,"We stayed for one night last night.  The toilet didn't flush properly, the room deodorizer was sickening.  Additionally, there was little for breakfast; bagels, waffles, donuts, toast.  Not exactly a waist friendly selection.  The eggs and sausage were gone and we tried to eat there twice this morning.  Had to go to the airport for breakfast.  Best Western Plus needs to up their game before we will try it again anywhere!",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Preparation for return to London,A good location close to airport for an early flight 06;45 the following morning. Able to drop the hire car off the night before & use the half hourly shuttle back to the hotel. Shuttle needs to be booked from the hotel to the airport. Various bars and grills are within walking distant of the hotel. The room was comfortable and clean and was in a quiet location to allow an early night paid $160 for a twin room,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,As Expected,"A typical Best Western, no surprises.  Comfortable beds, a window that opens and all the other benefits that others have described:  nearby restaurants, close to airport, good internet.  We did have trouble finding the hotel; it is behind another one, not right on Tower Road.  Not the greatest soundproofing.  We could hear people walking above us, toilets flushing, etc.  Would prefer more options for pillows; found the ones offered quite hard.  No hot water at 8:00 a.m. for a shower.  Called reception who advised that it should be restored within ten minutes (no apology) and by 8:30 there was lots of hot water.  Had a lovely dinner at Di Cicco's and ate typical diner breakfast at Moonlight Diner.  There is a gas station next door with reasonable prices for filling up before…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good value,"We found this hotel to be a good value. We didn't have the breakfast on site, the Moonlight Diner down the street is very good and was recommended so we went there. The only drawbacks to the hotel we found was that the doors didn't operate very well, we had to double check that our room door closed, and there is no outdoor seating or trash receptacles. This was particularly annoying as we do smoke but even more so because other smokers had left their butts all over the place. Other than that, the amenities are what you would expect for a value chain and the experience was pleasant.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Ok,"It's good choice when you arrive late to Denver. Close to airport. Clean. Coffee maker in the room. It was hard to find it among many hotels on Tower Road, as no sign present on the road. Parking available.i",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Never again,"Started calling for a shuttle at 10:30 pm from DEN.   The phone would ring for 1 minute, then go to busy signal.  After 20 minutes of this, (a dozen tries). I called the B/W 800 number and the nice man also tried to call the hotel with no luck.  Too late to cancel so at 11pm,  I tried  the hotel again.  On the second attempt someone answered.  I was told the shuttle would be there in 10 minutes.  It was 30...  At the hotel, the 2 folks at the counter struggled with computers and paperwork.  Lots of very tired, disgruntled folks waiting, including me.  Finally, at just before midnight,  I got to my room.  Went to bed, but had to get shortly thereafter as the room was near 80.  I set the thermostat to 72 and went back to bed.  At one a.m., I got up again as the room was too hot to…",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Typical pre-written response about room ,We stayed on the second floor above the automatic doors going into the lobby. We could hear them open and close for our entire visit overnite.  I called the managers phone number 3 times as requested in his canned response letter. Never called me back. Very disappointed in BW management ,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good Night Stay,"I wasn't able to make a connecting flight so I need to stay overnight in Denver. Beat Western is almost always my first choice. Since there is always room for improvement, I usually rate services as a 9 rather than a 10 but the stay was pleasant and I will continue to use Best Western Hotels as my home away from home.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Works we'll for the airport,"One of a number of hotels a few miles away from the airport. We were able to check in early and change room to one with two beds rather than a bed and sleep on sofa. Upon arrival we were asked if we wanted a shuttle spot....yes I can understand how unhappy I would be if I couldn't get the slot I wanted. I took our hire car back to the airport and was easily able to get the shuttle back to the hotel. Breakfast was fine, but to be honest at 6am, coffee and a muffin is all I can eat.  Strange that no mention of additional taxes was made at check in....",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,positive experience,"Had a very good stay at this b.w.p. Room was spotless, Check in was hassle free, Check out just as easy. Took the free shuttle to the airport in the morning. they even accommodated me changing shuttle times at the last minute. Multiple restaurants within walking distance; also gas station/convenience store in front of parking lot. I recommend this Best Western Plus and would stay there again if I come back to town for business.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Our stay was good,"My wife and I stayed in this BW Plus prior to departing from the Denver International Airport.  The hotel is located in a complex of hotels, restaurants, and gas station located close to the airport.  There are shuttles that run between the hotels and the airport.  There were no problems with the room.  The internet service was fine.  The front desk seemed to be a bit understaffed, but we had no delays or major issues in getting checked in.  Parking is a bit limited, but we were able to find a spot.  We were able to walk to one of the nearby restaurants for dinner.  The shuttle worked out fine for us.  We had an early morning flight and had made a shuttle reservation.  Did not get to stay for breakfast.  Price was reasonable.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good choice near airport,"This hotel was clean and pleasant with a pool, hot tub, fitness center and restaurants within a short walking distance.  The airport is about 10 minutes away. The staff was helpful in setting up a rollaway bed for our son.   The breakfast was OK-- nothing special --but they did have little mini cheese omelets which were nice.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Kinda weird,"Pros: spacious room, convenient to Airport, decent facility, fast wi-fi  Cons (mainly customer service):   1) Limited number of spots on airport shuttle -- book early!!  My flight was 8am, but couldn't get 6am shuffle and couldn't risk taking the later 6:30am shuttle, so had to go (way too!) early on the 5:30am.   2) Got a receipt after paying extra to leave my car in the hotel parking lot while I'm gone -- their parking receipt had my name and card info, but some dude's address from Chicago!  -- when I asked about it, they wouldn't explain or reprint the receipt with my address, just crossed it out and said it doesn't matter!  Hello??!! (BTW, there's no one else in the USA with my name, so it wasn't a confusion over someone with the same name)  3) They didn't give Rewards…",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,dunno,Not enough Parking.  Not too helpful staff.  Room smells strongly of fragrance to cover up smells.  Taxes way too high.  clean. mattress way to uncomfortable - bought a mattress pad.   How many more characters do I need to make it to 200?,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not a good experience,"Upon arrival the desk clerk was too busy with her personal phone to greet me.  When she did she had a hard time finding my reservation which I had booked on Bestwestern.com as usual.  Can not book more directly than their own website.  Worst part is we got to our room and mostly unpacked before one of us went into the shower/toilet room (vanity/sink in different area).  There was a wet washcloth in shower, used haircare products and a used bath mat was hanging over tub. Cannot believe this room was signed off on.  Went to desk clerk for new towels and she offered us new room but we were already unpacked and rest of room appeared clean.  I will say room was nice and a good size.  Parking was also very sparse.  Was very apprehensive about leaving rental car on street.  Also there…",2

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Located in a hotel wasteland,"We spent 2 nights at this hotel while taking one family member to the airport and then waiting for our flight. Check in was quick but curt.  The rooms were great-most comfy bed of our trip and we had enough space for 2 adults, 2 teens and 1 child.  Pool was very basic-only 4 seats poolside and never any towels.  Be warned that the hotel is in the middle of an estate of hotels.  Not much choice for food and as we had handed in our hire car, quite a taxi ride into Denver.  Good experience with the shuttle to and from airport-Coy the driver was especially helpful and friendly.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Pretty standard airport hotel....,Clean and very orderly; Easy in and out. Front staff very competent and helpful.  Room was clean and comfortable and bed very nice. Eating area small and parking looked tight but could always find a spot.  Very nice hotel for airport goings and comings. Only thing....I have stayed in regular and premier Best Westerns and not sure where the 'plus' styles fits in....,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Quick Overnight Stay,"My family stayed here for 1 night.  We booked this hotel due to the fact that it was close to the airport with shuttle service and it was cheaper than some other hotels nearby.  This is NOT a ""Plus"" hotel.  It is very standard and I would put it in the lower Best Western tier category.  With that said, we checked in at around 10:30pm. The lady that checked us out did not offer a welcome. She went through the normal check in procedures and was finished.  We went to our room and tried for a few minutes to get in.  The door would not budge.  When we went back down to ask the front desk clerk about our door not opening she said you had to pull UP on the handle to get into the room. (You might want to mention that during the check in process). Our room had 2 queen beds and a pull out couch.  The room was crowded for 5 people (3 adults, 2 kids).  The room was clean and the beds were comfortable.  There is a small kitchenette with mini fridge, microwave, sink and coffee pot.  The bathroom is standard with a good shower head and the usual bath amenities.  They have a small snack area downstairs to purchase drinks and microwave meals.  The breakfast was Continental only which included waffles, muffins, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, coffee and tea and other assorted juices.  I really didn't enjoy the breakfast at all. There is a sign at the front desk that says you need to book the shuttle in advance.  There is only 9 seats in the shuttle so if the space fills up you have to book another time for that day. We booked the return shuttle to the airport upon check in for the next morning. The shuttle picked us up and returned us to the airport with no problems.  Tip: when you go to baggage claim there are courtesy phones for the hotels.  Pick up the phone and call the hotel prior to getting your luggage. When your luggage comes the shuttle should be right there waiting outside the baggage claim doors.  Overall the entire experience was average.  There is nothing overly fancy about the property so for an overnight stay it was adequate.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Convenient to Denver International Airport,"Didn't get to spend too many hours in this hotel because of a late arrival and subsequent early departure, but my experience was good given it was a summer Saturday night. As usual, the place was full of kids running up and down the hall, but for the reasonable price paid, what's a person to do. I was able to get a reasonable length of sleep and a reasonable breakfast. There was no parking.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,clean but slow,"Advanced reservations helped, and the hotel is very nicely located near the airport. When we arrived we called to be sure of the place to wait for the shuttle.  It came after 45 min and was full. We waited another 15 min and finally got to the hotel.  The hotel is clean, friendly, and adequate. The staff quick to repair the toilet--that was nice.  On our return trip, we again stayed here and this time the shuttle was on the dot on time, and all went more smoothly.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Terrifically Bad,"We booked this hotel because it was close to the airport and offered complimentary shuttle to the airport. It was dark when we arrived and we had a difficult time finding the place as there were no exterior lights on. Upon checking in we were told that the shuttle took only 3-5 people at a time and was booked. We could however take the 3:00 AM shuttle for our 7:00 AM flight if we desired. We booked a cab. Why we would pay for a night's stay only to leave in the middle of the night?  We got into our room which was clean enough but after settling in, we found the A/C didn't work. This hotel is very over priced for the services received. In this case we certainly didn't get what we paid for and our expectations were not high to start with.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,You have limits when it come to hotels close to the airport.,"Having such a small select group of hotels to choose from outside the airport with out going into Denver means you shop fast. If you suddenly have a large flight cancel, it sales out fast.Yes, you will get a room but you might end up anywhere in Denver. So Best Western Plus at DEN is a great choice.The girl on the   7 to 3 shift is really kind.  Cant say enough good things about her.  The over night shift is when the days accountings are closed out and the new days business begins. Now some hotels have a certain time. Most just go through the process at ones pace.  So if you don't see any front desk staff for a half hour or so......he will eventually show up.  So if you want a great room. good price. nice pool. awesome breakfast. BOOK IT",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,ugh. unpleasant airport hotel.,"a ground floor room is never a good thing, maybe up higher was better.  there was nothing to recommend this hotel, the price was high for  a painfully plain, tight little room with a tiny bathroom that looked like it was from the 60's.  The lobby was small and sad looking.  The ""market"" area had a few bags of junk food.  The whole thing was unforgivable in a busy urban airport setting",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Close to airport,"We had a nice clean room.  The desk staff was very friendly.  Walking distance to restaurants.  The breakfast was horrible and not stalked with enough food.  The lady working there was very rude, she was not happy with her job!!",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Boo!,The hotel did not have the promised parking....we were on the street at 2 am.   There was a curly black hair in one of the beds and the doors slammed all night long.   The only good thing is that it was relatively easy to locate.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Average Room Close to airport,"Very close to Denver airport.  Beds were comfortable, had AC, and was clean. Hot breakfast is included and was better than average.  The room had a microwave, refrigerator, sink for family use.  Aurora Co was near and had many shopping, restaurants close by.  Room was too small, had odor, toilet clogged and did not have a plunger to fix it. Pool was closed for a while.  Sofa bed was average, we had to ask for sheets for the sofa bed since they were not in the room.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good Value,Convenient location to the airport and dining services on the same street.  Easy access to airport.  We did have a rent a car which we had to return before leaving Denver.  Gas station close to the hotel.  As this is a new area of town to the airport it is still being designed.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good functional hotel,"Proximity to the airport and price are the biggest plus points. It is nothing special, but for the price was very good and has a pool which is open 24 hours a day.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Don't Stay Here!,"Dirty rooms, unchanged bedding, lousy desk clerks, poorly kept up facility overall. Poor value for a high price to stay for less than 10 hours. The staff don't care if you had a poor experience, in the least. And not a decent place to eat within walking distance.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very close to the airport but slightly overpriced,"This Best Western was above average price and was let down by offhand management. When we told reception on arrrival that the water in the room was cold it took a while for action to be taken. The hot water came on about 2 and a half hours after we reported this problem, which was widespread across the hotel and not just on the ground floor.The room was clean and well equipped, and the breakfast of an above average standard.Won't be hard to improve the situation - better tained saff, or better staff!",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Quiet, comfortable stopover","This is a newer property and the most expensive place I stayed on cross-county trip.  I guess you get what you pay for, at $150/night this is a pretty nice property as Best Westerns go.  Clean, quiet (no airport or interstate noise), good breakfast and wifi.  Bed had a depression in the middle.  Chain restaurants nearby and the area felt safe.  Check-in experience was slow and impersonal, but everything else was good.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,BUSINESS TRAVELER,"Very good overall service by hotel staff & the appearance of hotel was top rate. Location of the hotel to the Denver International Airport made it a ""perfect"" choice for our service tech to spend the night while flying out of Denver, CO",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,price little high,I think the price of the room for this location is set to high. Military and Government rate was set to the same price as going to Kayak.com. The stay over all  was ok It's a bed. $135.00 a night is just crazy to sleep in an ok bed.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great location,"Great stay!  Located close to the airport for our departing flight the next day.  We dropped off our rental car the night before and the BW shuttle came to pick us up and bring us back to the hotel the night before.  We got on a shuttle to the airport in the morning from the BW.  Too easy, no stress and helpful staff.  Restaurants close by.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Among the Best,"The staff at the Best Western at Denver International Airport is as helpful and knowledgeable as we have ever experienced.  Among other things, they led us to the best restaurant in the area to have our Anniversary Dinner. They made us feel as if we had been friends for a long time, even though we were only there for one night.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,bad check in experience,Average Best Western hotel and significant up charge for park and fly. Check in person was slow and took 20 minuets to check in a group of 22 that had their reservation for over a year. Couldn't figure out to look up and see if the other two of us might have an express check in. She was really slow. Typical limited not very healthy breakfast options.,3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Average, could improve with some TLC","When I arrived I was impressed with size of room, location and bed was very comfortable. Quiet location. It was next day ... Poor housekeeping ... Dirty dishes, dirty towels, and overall lack of attention. Staff is very nice and courteous.  Nice gym facilities and pool.  Breakfast was ok. Did the job.  Don't think I would return. Good wifi.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worst WIFI,"This is my third visit to this property. I won't return. The staff and property is is fine. Breakfast is the standard (very basic) stuff. And the breakfast area is pretty crowded  WIFI is at least as bad as any I've experienced in years. On each of my stays I've had to resort to using my I-phone as a hot spot. Some times I can get an extremely slow connection from the hotel WIFI but it's usually so slow that I can't access ANYTHING. When my I-phone hot spot works MUCH better through the cell phone network, you know the WIFI is REALLY bad. I've tried to get a WIFI reception in the lobby and on the 2nd and third floors. None of their routers offer reasonable service. Parking is very limited (the place is always full). Sound insulation is marginal at best. If you get a room near the elevator or any other high traffic area you will hear everything.",2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Average price, average place","Staff friendly; rm decent. Breakfast almost 30 mins late, which meant we got very little before boarding airport shuttle.  Return shuttle took 1 hr to find us even tho we kept calling. Saved $$ but lost time...",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Place to Relax,"From the time I checked in to the time I check out there was not one thing that I could find wrong. In all my business travels this hotel certainly is on par to hotels that have much greater rates. The desk staff did a great job managing many guests at the same time getting them all checked in to the hotel quickly and efficiently. The hot tub was just what I needed after the long drive. The pool area on the whole was clean, neat, and very accommodating. The hotel is a little tucked in several others but is well worth the search.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Its a motel so what do you expect,"Its a basic motel so dont expect any sophistication. The car park was full on arrival which was not the best welcome but at least shows the hotel is popular. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. The room was very basic and the bed frankly looked as though it had been slept in before, we were so tired however we just crashed out anyway. Its convenient for the airport but its not a place I would stay in again when there are better options just over the road Courtyard by Marriott for example.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Better Than I Had Hoped For,"I reserved this hotel early in the spring and the ratings at that time were OK.  The week before our trip, I looked at the ratings again and it made me kind of nervous but everything in the area was booked due to the Memorial Day holiday.  We arrived at the hotel at check-in time, 3 PM, and check-in went smoothly.  Parking was spotty but we were told we could park on the yellow in the 'street' and we had no problem with that.We got to our room and it was clean and spacious.  After a bit, there was a knock on the door and it was a lady who wanted to know if we needed towels.  Apparently they realized that they had not left towels when the room was cleaned which we had not yet noticed. Later in the evening we noticed that we didn't have a bath mat so I went to the desk.  There was a line of people waiting to check in and when it was my turn, the clerk told me they were out of bath mats but offered another bath towel which worked fine.  I noticed when she went to the back to get it that there were two large dryers filled with what appeared to be towels so they must have been behind on laundry.We were going to the airport to pickup our grandchildren early the next morning and because traffic was light we decided to go with short term parking rather than take the shuttle so I can't comment on that.  I also can't comment on the breakfast because we left before it started at 6 AM.  Bottom line is that we were satisfied and had no issues.  I would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,So-so,"Get you in and out kind of a place. Busy, but care and details overlooked. Toilet barely flushed, breakfast was kind of pathetic, particularly in relation to how many people it was supposed to serve (hotel was full), coffee was weak, towels were stained, moths trapped in the room, no tv channel guide. Otherwise, just what you'd expect. beds were comfy enough, etc.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,average but close to the airport,"Booked a suite for one night. Hotel is close to the international airport. Our room was a bit dated, but clean. We had a quiet night and overall a good night sleep. Beds were just ok. Breakfast starts at 06:00 and was a bit poor as was the breakfast area. No smile at checking in. Rate was fair. Parking was not a problem. There are many airport hotels nearby and some restaurants as well.We asked for top floor, but got a suite on the second floor. Did not use the shuttlebus, we had a rentalcar. Maybe we will try another hotel next time, but the manager is really helpfull and friendly.To bad our room had this cheap feeling.",3

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,We have never been treated SO badly!,"My husband and I were returning to SLC from a trip to NYC.  Our flight from LaGuardia to Denver was delayed due to snow.  Upon arrival in Denver, we were told that our connecting flight from Denver to SLC had been missed and that we would not be able to fly out until the following afternoon.  Frontier Airlines gave us a voucher with a 1-800 number to use in order to find an area hotel.  My husband called the number and was told that the Best Western on Tower Road had a room and instructed him on where we needed to wait for the shuttle.  After arriving at the hotel, we were told by a woman named Nellie, who was working at the desk, that she could not give us a room if she didn't have a room and that we were out of luck.  She was extremely rude, very loud and obviously did not care about us or our situation.  She went on about her work, never minding that we stood there in front of her, stuck in Denver during a snowstorm with no place to go.  I understand that there was a misunderstanding between my husband and the operator at the 1-800 number and that we should have then called the Best Western to verify.  What I DON'T understand is that someone who is supposedly working in customer service, has such horrible customer service skills.  I guess the days are gone where an employee would apologize for the misunderstanding and offer to call around to nearby hotels in order to help travelers out who have no place to go.  I was greatly offended by Nellie and the way she treated us.  I hope that the manager, Kendall Beymer, sees this review and speaks with Nellie.  Mr. Beymer, I have always been a fan of Best Western, but after this, I will take my money elsewhere.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very Poor Experience Here - Avoid,"Booked the room over the phone for best rate.  Prior to arrival I called the hotel twice for directions, which were vague and no street number could be supplied for GPS system.  This is a basic question and should be on a card next to telephone.  Fail. Check-In Experience:  I was given my room key, went to room, unlocked door and found it occupied by a sleeping person at 5:45 PM. MAJOR FAIL!!!!  Desk clerk mildly apologetic, mostly apathetic about mistake.  Given new key and new room number.  Told I would receive my bill slipped under door.  My new room was clean but not all that nice.  Was woken up by the sound of snoring occupant in next room; thin walls lack of sound proofing. CHECK-OUT  No bill under door!  FAIL.  Picked up from night desk clerk who emerged from back after a few moment wait at desk.  Slovenly appearance. long greasy hair, and an almost 1 inch thumb nail which was very apparent as he thumbed through the bills looking for my receipt.  I am sorry but I expect a friendly greeting in the morning by someone who looks clean and tidy and PROFESSIONAL.  This was certainly not the case.  I am a BW Corporate Business member and found this experience to be so alarming that I will mostly likely not book into a BW again unless it's the very last resort.  Franchisees have an obligation to live up to and a brand standard to maintain, this was not the case at BW-DIA.  I am sorry I cannot recommend this brand any longer after this experience.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Lying Prince gougers,"I am writing this review out of complete disdain for my experience I had booking a room here with a front desk clerk named Rudy.  I had a confirmed booking through bookings.com and called the hotel to add my girlfriend to the booking.  Rudy told me there where no rooms and she couldn't check her in.  She then told me she couldn't check anyone in all day, to which I asked how she was sold out if she couldn't check anyone in?  That's when she hung up on me.  Bookings.com called the hotel and affirmed it's a fishy story and the hotels should have alerted bookings.com immediately if they were sold out and not waited all day.  DIA was shut down and I believe they were selling rooms at a higher rate and didn't want to honor the online price.  Taking advantage of stranded travelers is deplorable.  This hotel staff is deplorable.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not up to Plus standards,"This is a tired property. Common areas were in need of cleaning. Room furniture was scratched, caulking around bathtub was peeling, black marks on some walls. I was scheduled to stay 3 nights; checked out after one.",2

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Unexpected stay,"This trip was due to the necessity of taking my son to the airport on the same day I had to be somewhere else for minor surgery.  We needed a place to stay close to the airport that offered a shuttle for him, but was close enough to where we needed to be very early in the morning.  We were able to use my points and got all of our needs met as well.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Good location, good value","Stayed here on a  stop over through Denver Airport.  Convenient location, clean room and breakfast to get you going. A couple of queries to staff had indifferent answers. Business Centre printer not working, staff was aware and just instructed to go use at hotel next door. Question in morning that I had was to be directed to Manager, No Manager on and staff I talked to wasn't sure when they would be. Shuttle to airport was on time and great driver giving directions once at airport.  With the selection of hotels along Tower Road, I would likely consider another chain.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western - Denver Intl Airport,Worst hotel ever! Was given a dirty room which appeared the housekeeper just made the beds with the dirty sheets.  Hair was everywhere on sheets. Was then told it hadn't been cleaned yet? Why were we checked into an un-cleaned room?  When addressing the issue with the manager she said it was our fault because we checked in at 2pm and check in time was 3pm????? Was given another room that was also unfinished although it was just missing towels.  Was advised by mgmt. this happened the day before as well. I told her if it was me and this happened two days in a row I would fire the housekeeper or their supervisor for allowing rooms to be passed off like this. Nothing was done by management to make our stay better. Will not use this hotel chain again.,1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Cold reception,"After being on the road 10+ hours and checking in near 1a.m., we found the desk person to be short, curt. He was wearing a trench coat; no visible shirt, no uniform. His accent made it very difficult to understand him. His irritation with my asking him to repeat himself was very evident. He held that irritation while checking us in. We were offered no info on ammenities available to us We went to the front desk twice (toilet not working properly and no towels in the pool area) and he was not to be found. A simple smile would have gone a long way.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Poor quality,"The public bathrooms in the lobby where disgusting.  Once in the room it was not that clean but too tired to do anything about it, could use some new beds I felt a spring in my back all night.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Close to the airport,"The hotel is conveniently located to DIA and located in close proximity to the other hotels and off airport parking lots. We did have a couple of minor complaints the room we had rm 337 had a 1/2"" gap between the windows and due to strong gusting winds this particular evening the window was whistling considerably. I talked to the front desk clerk Ruby (who was most helpful) if there was another room we could move to. She was able to accommodate us and we were moved to another room. We were traveling with another couple and they indicated their toilet was making strange  sounds thru out the night. One of my girls used the bathroom in the first room and she said it was making noise as well. As an overall rating I would rate this hotel a 2 1/2. This hotel isn't that old to have as…",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,A Good night's sleep at a great value,"We made our way East during the course of the week to be within a few minutes of the DEN airport for an early Easter Sunday flight to EWR.  We booked this BW PLUS the night before at a very good rate.  The 2 queen room was large with a pleasant, silent eastern view of the sunrise.  The room was clean.  The staff was friendly.  The breakfast was adequate though the setup and presentation was poor as the coffee station was buried in a tight corner allowing only one guest to get coffee during a busy breakfast at a time.  It was 4/20 which meant the world was near the DEN airport to take part in the first ever state-legal weed smoking festivities.  Every airport hotel was full so we were surprised to get a large room at a great rate, but parking (although free) was extremely…",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Close to DIA,"Great to see the sunrise looking over the eastern plains.  The parking lot was almost full, but well lit.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Free isn't free,Beware when booking this hotel. Their free parking with airport shuttle is not free. The website says 14 days free but there is a catch. You have to pay extra for your room. If you use any discount you will pay $8 for parking.,1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Clean and new, but not much parking","I was overall pleased with this hotel, but the front desk staff were very slow and admitted they struggled with names that aren't russian.  It took 20 minutes just to get checked in!  And, there is very limited parking.  I had to park on public streets each night of my stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Stress free and Convenient,We always stay at this hotel whenever we fly.  The staff is friendly and the rooms are clean.  The worry of driving to Denver during rush-hour traffic is eliminated and you are assured you will be on time with the shuttle service and parking convenience.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great place & great price,"We lucked out & got a room here for $58, but the room is worth more in our opinion. The desk worker was very nice & helpful. The room was huge and very clean. One tip- the thermostat for the heat/cool is on the wall which we found out after asking. The pool looked nice but we didn't use it. The hot breakfast was very adequate & the workers kept it stocked for the guests. The walls are a bit thin, but all hotels seem to be like that these days. Great nights sleep before we had to fly home. Also, right next to a gas station so we could fill the rental car for cheaper.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Missed Flight. One Night.,I missed my flight and had to stay in a hotel. This hotel was clean and was nice to stay in. Their breakfast was decent. The beds are very comfortable. They have good water pressure.   I like the fact that they have a free airport shuttle. It was really easy and convenient.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Additional fees for Shuttle/Parking,"While the hotel served the purpose for an overnight stay with clean accommodations, and their parking/shuttle services were available, but only at an additional cost.  Be sure to call beforehand to get the information first-hand, because their website doesn't indicate any additional fees for parking/shuttle services and they must apply to random groups.  A family member recommended this Best Western because they stayed one month earlier than me, paid only $89 total and the parking/shuttle was included.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western close to airport,This looks like a newer hotel. The appearance was good. There is not much parking at the hotel but you can park on the street. It is a safe place. The bed was very comphortable and the room was clean. Not sure if all the rooms are suites but mine was and I don't even think I booked a suite. Extreamly pleased with my stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very convenient,The front desk staff is helpful.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Wonderful and Convenient,"Loved this hotel and all its amenities.  Great breakfast, nice guest laundry that I used.  Pool and fitness center that I didn't use.  Only problem was a slight bill discrepancy that I hope to get resolved.  Was supposed to be a free night with rewards but I was charged $30.  Was told it would be reversed but two days later it is not reversed yet, but still hopeful.  There was no phone in my room so no wake up call, but I used the alarm clock.  The coffeemaker was inoperable due to a missing filter holder but I had coffee at breakfast.  These were not big issues, considering what a beautiful and comfortable room I had with great wifi.  Would definitely stay here again if the need arose.  The shuttle service to and from airport was phenomenal!  Great visit!",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Bad Service, No Free Parking, No Wake Up Call, Lack of Breakfast Good","We chose this hotel off the internet because it was close the airport and had free parking. I called to verify that we could leave our car on our trip. We got to the hotel around 12:30 a.m. after driving 4.5 hours and the hotel clerk was in the other room watching TV. He was gruff but our reservation was there and he put us down accurately for the wake up call and the shuttle. The next morning we woke late because our wake up cal never happened, we quickly got dressed and went down to breakfast. The bread items were depleted as were the eggs, bacon and sausage.

I was fortunate to take advantage of a Groupon offer that made the price even less. The shuttle service worked effectively, both directions. The hotel has a nice appearance and is located close to some casual dining resturants. The rooms are very clean and comfortable with nice amenities. It is always nice to have a comfortable seat to relax in the evening. The staff on site were pleasant, but were not always efficient. The breakfast is an expanded continental.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good Hotel For The Price,"Considering the hotels around the Denver Airport, this one is a good place to stay for the price. You get a comforable desk chair but just a table to work from, a desk type table would be better for working from. Bed is comfortable and the shower has good pressure. The rooms are clean and well lit with chair and couch so it is comfortable to relax and watch TV as well. The breakfast is OK didn't eat there had time to kill in the morning so went out for a full breakfast. There are a couple of resturants in walking distance and several others in the area that offer good choices. Improvement would have been to have coffee out in the breakfast area before 6:00 AM.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Serves its purpose,After a day of skiing we stayed here in order to catch an early morning flight. This hotel is in a neighbourhood of hotels and restaurant chains though this hotel is a few unpleasant long blocks from restaurants if that's a consideration. Some hotels are right next door to eateries. They sell frozen burritos and other unappetizing foods from a fridge in the lobby.   The staff are super kind and friendly. Check in was a breeze. I had booked online and it took 2 seconds to get my key. Here's the kicker. I really needed a bath and couldn't believe that the room we had on the first floor did not have a bathtub plug. It was even mentioned in an earlier Tripadvisor review and I figured they'd have gone to a hardware store and bought some plugs by now. The front desk lady kindly gave…,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good between Flights,"This motel as about 12-15 minutes by free shuttle from DEN.  My room was clean and quiet. The motel provides an okay complimentary breakfast.  Although it does not have a restaurant, there is one within about a 5 minute walk.  I would stay here again. ",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Could be more updated,We stayed at the Best Western Plus DIA that was very close to the airport.  The floor in the room seemed to be soft or soggy and bowed when stepped on and the floor was wet by the refrigerator.  The fan in the bathroom did not seem to exhaust the steam from taking a shower.  The room could be more updated.  It was nice to have a free shuttle to take us to the airport.,2
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Convenient hotel,"Until they build the new hotel at DIA, Tower road is the best place to stay if you want to be near the airport.  I chose this hotel, as the price was good and the reviews were decent.    The rooms are a little dated, but generally clean.  Not sure if all rooms are suites, but I had one and it was very spacious.  Could use some better lighting though. When I called the front desk from my room, they rarely answered.  I suspect this is because I usually only saw one person at the desk, and they must have been busy.  Can get food at Sporting News Grill, 2 minute walk across the parking lot.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Could be cleaner but great park and fly option,"We stayed at the Best Western Plus DIA the night before our cruise vacation because the weather forecast was for snow and icy roads the next morning and we didn't want to deal with icy roads at 4am.  The park and fly option includes 1 night lodging, free breakfast and free shuttle service to and from the airport.   We paid $105 for 1 night plus free parking while we were gone.  A great value since parking at any of the park and ride locations would have been $120.  I can't comment on the breakfast because we caught the shuttle at 5:30am and breakfast started at 6.  There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance as well as a short drive.  Our room was clean however I found a long dark hair on the upper corner on the bottom sheet by the headboard. The rest of the sheets,…",3

Cheaper then parking at the airport and door to door service.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Not bad for overnight,We stayed over night on an interrupted trip from Canada to Florida.  Hotel is about 15 minutes away by free shuttle and offers the basics.  We had a king room with sleeper couch which was just good enough for 2 small kids.  No plug for the bath and upon enquiry was told there are no plugs.  So we showered :) Rooms are large and overall comfortable enough for an overnight.  Very reasonable.  Breakfast was traditional Best Western fare and WiFi fast and free.,3

The work out room had an odd smell, so I decided to not use. Has a small pool which I did not try.  Both are 24 hours.   Nice bed, quiet.  WiFi worked perfectly. All-in-all for an overnight layover, it is very good. Free airport shuttle (call for pickup when you get off plane,as pickup does take about 25-30 minutes) and free breakfast too.  Recommended.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Everything but the pillows,"I love Best Western! This one is very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was great. Plenty of tables, unlike some BW breakfast areas. Only thing I recommend is that you take your own pillow. Theirs were too big/hard. Not really hard, but too big to get flat. 4 stars because I couldn't sleep well on their fat pillows. My wife had hers...slept like a baby.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Great Stay,The accommodations were excellent and the staff made check in and out quick and easy.

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,My expeirence at Best Western,From front desk check in to check out. Was amazing stay. Clean rooms as well as lobby. Pool was amazing as well. Breakfast was Delicious! There is plenty of parking. A free shuttle will take you to and from the Denver International airport which is why we choose always your hotel. This makes it easy not to drive in traffic and road closures due to construction,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Average BW but convient for early flight at DIA,"Would advise not doing the pay and park. Shuttle services many hotels, leaving hotel is fine, but from DIA the wait can be very long as several shuttles can be full at your stop. Also, Airline personnel have priority, so even if they arrive after you they will be put ahead of you in line.",3

"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Management made it a top location for me,My wife and I just spent 2  nights.it is easily the best property. We did spend some shopping + dining.  The service at the Best Western was outstanding all around...everyone went out of their way to make sure we were very happy. Kendall had one of their staff tell me about the location. We would highly recommend using this hotel. Their driver took to and from the airport. We especially appreciated housekeeping keeping our room spotless. Management was amazing and friendly top notch.,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good hotel near airport,"I stayed at the Best Western for a couple of nights while attending a football game at the University of Colorado.  The hotel is located close to the airport on Tower Rd.  It is about 10 minutes to the airport given the traffic conditions with the construction, probably quicker when everything is back to normal.  There is also a free shuttle to and from the airport.  When you arrive at the airport you will need to call for the shuttle.  Expect to wait up to 30 minutes for its arrival.  Also, make sure to reserve your return trip as soon as possible.  It fills up quickly with all of the other hotels and the van isn't that big.  I arrived late at night and was warmly greeted by the receptionist.  He provided details of the hotel to include the complimentary breakfast in the…",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Clean rooms,"We were pleasantly surprised at how spotless and clean the room/bathroom were. The bed was very comfortable and while near the airport, there wasn't any outside noise disturbing us.  We will stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good basic accommodations near DEN,"This BW seemed new, as all the hardware, furniture and finishes were fresh - so fresh the carpet was still off-gassing. It is among a cluster of hotels just off the airport property. Probably the newest BW I've ever experienced.  As always, the BW offers basic accommodations at reasonable prices. There is a complimentary breakfast with a waffle-maker, although I left so early that it was just opening. The complimentary airport shuttle runs every half hour if I remember correctly.  Nothing much in the way of food nearby. There is a restaurant a couple of blocks away, a 7-11 nearby with drinks and snacks and some of the nearby hotels probably have a bar or restaurant.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Nothing special,"We chose this hotel because it had a shuttle service as was close to the Denver airport.  Although we left early in the morning, I was hoping for an apple or muffin to take with us, but there were none.  We had hoped to go to the pool, but the pool light was burned out and the one desk clerk could not replace.  The hot tub was cold.",3
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Nice, convenient airport hotel","Our experience at this Denver hotel was very pleasant. We stayed here the night before our flight home. The shuttle service made it easy to return our car the night before and not have to deal with it the morning of our flight. You can tell the hotel has been recently renovated. Rooms are clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. The staff was very helpful. Our original room was beside the vending machines and when we requested another room we were pleasantly and easily accommodated.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,"Charged for parking, reservation messed up","I called and made the reservation to the hotel directly.  I had a free night, also had reserved a room my elderly in-laws. I talked to the woman on the phone about a upgaraded room with my free night.  She told me it would not be a problem.  It was a extra $35.00 charge.  I told her that would be great.  We wanted a sofa in the room because it was Monday Night Football and my father-in-law could come in and watch the game with us.  I also asked about the parking.  Best Western told us no charge, as it was part of the Stay & Fly program. Also the internet says ""no charge""  After we arrived, no upgrade was available.  The woman at the front desk said it was not possible and told my husband we had to pay $5.00 a day to park the car, which was $35.00.  She said it is up to each Best Western as to what is charged.  Not, if you would like return customers, is what I think.  The Hampton and the Embassy do not charge me and they are in the same area.  I went back to the front desk to ask for another key.  While standing in line for 20 mins. found out there was a upgraded room available.  The guy in front of me in line got that room.  He was a student and  he was in need of a room because his home had been in the  Longmont flood. She did not give him a discount of any kind, plus it was the last room in the hotel.  When I got up to the desk and visited with her, she argued that she was working the night that I talked to her and she did not give me a upgraded room.  A few more minutes of discussing the conversation on the phone, she did start to remember.  But, needless to say she won, because I was in the regular room.  The next problem was being  picked up by the shuttle.  We had to wait with my 80 year old parents for 1 3/4  hours for a shuttle.  I am not exaggerting.  We called for the shuttle, when we got to baggage at the airport and asked how long it would be.  The hotel said 10 minutes.  We got right out there.  The airport helped our elderly parents with the wheelchairs and then we waited and waited.  When the shuttle got to United stop, it had 2 seats left.  We had 5 people, 2 eighty year olds, 12 old granddaughter, a Service dog and my husband and me.  My husband and I am angry about the whole situation.  We have stayed in many Best Western's and never had a problem.  I will think twice about staying at Best Western Hotels next time I travel. And we won't return this Best Western. I have never wrote a review, but this time has bothered me for 2 weeks.  I did not appreciate the woman at the desk telling me, she did not say what she said.  Then after telling her exactly what the person on the phone said a couple of nights before, she started to remember the conversation.  She was rude and wrong.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Enjoyable stay,"Love the remodel!  I found my room to be very comfortable and clean.  One of the better Best Westerns I have stayed at over the years.  The fitness room, although small, had quality equipment and seemed to handle the needs of the hotel (there was only one other guest using the room at the same time as myself).  The staff was excellent!  They were very efficient and polite during a busy check-in time.  The shuttle to the airport was excellent, both departing and returning.  I also parked my vehicle at the hotel during my travels and had no issues upon returning.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,First Class Service!,"My brother was traveling thru Denver and I wanted to purchase him a room for the night. I was out of state and the hotel personnel Stephanie, Brittany, Michelle, and Ruby all treated me and my brother with top notch professionalism. It was a bit difficult at first because I had the credit card in California and my brother didnt have one. Stephanie took the reigns and faxed me all necessary paperwork to make the reservation happen. She was always available by phone and attentive to my needs with utter kindness and patience. Great job everyone! Thank you! Oh, and my brother said ""super clean comfy rooms"". Recommend highly.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Terrible Hotel,"At first site this hotel seemed to be nice, however once inside went down hill fast had to wait 10 minutes for somone to come check me in, no ice machines work they have ice at the front desk in garbage bags tied in a knot, none of the jet tubs work in the entire hotel(false advertisement) hair not just one strand but lots of hair in ice bucket in room, last but not least lots of flies flying around in the continental breakfast area NO WAY STAY",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Awesome!,"The beds in this hotel are more comfortable then my Tempurpedic at home.  The Lady that checked me in had me to my room to rest in less then 5 minutes without being even a little pushy.  She was gracious, polite and professional, while being fast and efficient. I was impressed and appreciative,  Good ht breakfast, and a convenient location to the airport.  Just what I needed.",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Excellant Place,We missed our connecting flight due to weather and found that the Best Western Plus had rooms for us. After two weeks in a lousy hotel it was sure nice to have a very nice well maintained room with all the accommodations that you could ask for. This is a great hotel!!!,5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Convenience and helpfulness,"The hotel is convenient to the Denver Airport. The shuttle is a great accommodation.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is within reasonable distance to different types of restaurants.  Since the hotel is one block off the main road, there is a minimum of traffic passing nearby.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Thoughts about the hotel.,Very good but not exceptional. Lacked the extra service of the more expensive hotels. Not having a hotel fax machine working was definitely a negative because I needed it and having to go to another hotel to do my laundry was not great. The hotel did not have a lift so had to cart my luggage upstairs. Some of the staff did not have uniforms so it was difficult to discern who was a worker and who was not. I had to change rooms as my hotel room air-conditioning was not working and their was very poor ventilation in the fitness centre.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Good value,"The hotel is conveniently located next to the airport, and is a shuttle service is available and works pretty well.  The rooms are comfortable, and the breakfast is the kind of typical for Best Western, no complaints. Altogether, good value. ",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,very good in Denver,Very friendly staff both evening and morning.  Stayed there on the way back to California. Also had two cats with us.  Breakfast was delicious.  Environment was relaxing.  Easy check in and out.   Plenty of restaurants available around to order or eat at.,4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Closed--Don't waste your time booking there,"So, I arrived in Denver on a Thursday night late after work and had booked this hotel online months prior my business meeting and trip. It was very difficult to locate the hotel due to airport construction, the settings on my GPS and the fact that it was dark and late a night. It was a pretty scary ride getting there. When I arrived, I found there to be no parking available. After eventually finding a spot and unloading my luggage, I was greated at the entrance by a security guard who told me there was no way I was staying there because they were closed for several months. He suggested I try the Days Inn next door as he thought they were affiliated. So I took everything back to the car and tried to find a parking space closer to the Days Inn. Luckily they did have a reservation…",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worst experience in 40 years!,"We made reservations at this hotel 4 months prior to our arrival date, got an email confirmation, plus I called to confirm the reservation one week before our trip. The day of our scheduled arrival I got a phone call from a friend who was scheduled to stay at the same property (based upon my recommendation). The friend had arrived at the hotel on an airport shuttle only to find that the hotel was closed up, with caution tape and fencing around the perimeter and huge yellow hoses coming out of some of the upper floor windows. The shuttle driver told our friend that he did not know anything other than that the Inn had had a water damage problem. She then called the 800 number and was told to go to the Days Inn nearby. My husband then called the 800 number to ask about the problem.…",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,This hotel is closed!,"I booked a room at this hotel, apparently after it had been shut down for flooding.  No one bothered to tell me that this hotel was in fact closed.  When I arrived after a long day of traveling, the hotel was completely surrounded by caution tape and fencing.  I called the number on my reservation confirmation, and was told to go to the Days' Inn next door.  The hotel still doesn't want to admit that it is closed for significant repairs for the foreseeable future, and it still looks like one can book a room in it.  This is not true.  And the Days' Inn is not as expensive as the Best Western, so don't pay in advance!  This is a first-hand experience, so stop shutting this review down and telling me it isn't.  I will be glad to send you a copy of my reservation confirmation.",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Best Western Airport - Denver,"When I went to check in, there were huge fans connected to the building.  They had a sprinkler system break in the attic that caused a flood in the hotel.  The staff was very apologetic.  They had already arranged for us to stay at another property next door.  All this said, I would schedule a stay there again. ",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Denver was great!,"Love the new hotel ... rooms are very roomy ... all worked well!  I have found Best Western hotels are new, modern and very comfortable.  Good value for the money as well!  I look forward to returning soon!       ",5
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Very nice and clean hotel. Super friendly staff. Can't beat the location.,"This Best Western is right next to the Denver International Airport. The location is therefore excellent for air travelers. The hotel is basic, but clean and well cared for. The rooms, we had a two queen room, are standard but comfortable. The beds are soft and the linens made with nice quality material. There is a coffee maker with condiments in the room, as well as soaps, shampoo, lotion and a shower cap. Plenty of towels and upon request we received extra blankets as well as toothbrushes and toothpaste. Overall our experience at this hotel was excellent and I would highly recommend it to anybody who just needs a good night of sleep close to the airport. We did not use the breakfast buffet since our flight left early the next day.",4
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Worst BW ever!,"I cannot believe that this motel is rated as a BW Plus!  We used BW Rewards points to book the reservation, but the front desk girl insisted that we produce a voucher.  She wanted to argue with us over the lack of a voucher (Rewards points does not generate a voucher) instead of just doing her job. The motel sereptitiously let us know that they did not want any feedback when they did not put any pens or paper in the room.  So I guess they're happy with their lack of knowledge. We got up at 4:00 the next morning for an early flight, only to find out that the water was barely lukewarm and the water pressure was almost nonexistent.  Obviously, we did not have enough time before our flight to wait for their maintenance people to show up and fix this problem. There are many other…",1
"Denver, CO",Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,Happy accident,"We ended up here due to an unexpected layover in Denver and a fiasco with the first Tower Road hotel that we booked.  I'm so glad that we stayed here instead!  The late night clerk and early morning clerk were both very friendly, helpful, and accomodating.  Our room was quiet, clean, and spacious, with very good mattresses, pillows, and linens.  Just what we needed after a stressful day/night of travelling.    The breakfast selections were good with a solid choice of hot and cold items.  The airport shuttle driver was friendly and professional.  Would stay here again if stranded overnight in Denver. :)",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very unhappy,My husband and I had to put our truck in the shop to get worked on... we stayed here until our truck got out of the shop and the whole time(3 days we stayed here) we were here we are very unhappy about the housekeeping service they have here. The whole time we were here I had to take our own garbage and towels out. The HOUSEKEEPING SUCKS HERE I even called down to front desk 4x still no service,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY HERE!,"DO NOT STAY HERE!! I traveled to Denver from Houston with my boyfriend and one other couple. We had reservations to stay here for 3 days. Check in is at 3pm but we arrived early at like 2:30..so we sent the boys in to see if the room was available yet. When they walked in they stood at the front desk for a while and did not get greeted by the 2 girls at the front desk (2 latinas with dark hair, wouldn’t give me their names and wasn’t wearing a name tag). They just acted as if they didn’t see them at all so when they approached the desk they were very rude, and disrespectful. They told us that if we wanted to check in early then we’d have to $10 to check in 30 MINUTES EARLY, we only paid $60 per night so why would that be policy? So the boys came back out and told us so I went back in to talk to them because the rooms were in my name and again they were ignoring us when we talked to them, when we told them that we felt like they were being very rude and giving us terrible service one of the girls said that her manager told her she doesn’t have to smile or be nice and that we need to leave. We did nothing wrong! At all, but because we have questions around this made up policy she wanted to kick us out. Idk if it was because we were black but we are educated, black professionals who know how to conduct business and this is not the way! We were forced to find another hotel at the last minute and for much more than we were expected to pay. The way we were treated was completely unreasonable and I don’t recommend that anyone stay here EVER!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst hotel ever.,This doesn’t even deserve a one star. It was the worst and nastiest hotel I’ve ever stayed at. There’s travel lodges that have better rooms than this. We came to have a wonderful vacation and this ruined it for us. Our room was unbelievably hot and when asked to change to a different room they didn’t help. We made the decision to leave and Cody at the front desk said he would cancel it and promised a refund only to find out he lied to my face and then said that he said no such thing. Worst customer service and hotel ever. Don’t waste your time and money here. Stay at the Hyatt regency convention center. That’s where we ended up going after. Best decision yet.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hamid H. stands for Horrible Customer service,Do not stay at this hotel if you like to be treated honestly and fairly.  I booked a room in March and had to cancel due to Covid.  A refund was not offered so I moved the reservation to September 20 and apparently the hotel will not honor it.   I contacted the property and had to deal with Hamid H. who rudely told me that I had no reservation and then actually hung up on me!  Even the Priceline rep who was helping me was amazed at his incompetence and impolite manner when he tried to deal with this man.Do yourself a favor and avoid being defrauded by this hotel.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clean Room and Friendly Staff,Great location close to downtown especially for a business trip to the area. Loved the stay. Everything was easy and no fuss the second I checked in. Would recommend as a great option in the Denver area.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"""Change is Good""","I know the management teams personally from prior to present. I must say the remodeling, service enhancements (such as car rental services), food store, and message / nail care center are a crowd pleaser.I see Chris (new owner) step up to the counter and jump right in to register guest. He personally greets guest asking ""So what brings you to town."" And ""where are you from"" He shows a personal interest for his guest.I've also seen him walk the property picking up trash and cigarette butts on the grounds. Most business owners would assign that task to staff because they are above doing that type of work. I know he is genuine in keeping the guest stay clean, safe and enjoyable.I can't wait to see what he has planned for the dining room and menu once the Covid restrictions are lifted. Oh and by the way, lots of service counter surface, elevator controls panels, door handles, hand washing, etc cleaning/cleaning/cleaning going on without anyone being told. Way to go.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clean,"Been coming down for our visits. Helpful front desk staff. Refrigerator and microwave in room, great for my family and I. Close to the Stock Show & Downtown. Off I-70 & Pecos. Will definitely come back.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Close to downtown,"Location was great. Very close to downtown area. The room was very clean, staff were so friendly, and it was overall great stay for me and my family! Highly recommend to all staying in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,THE WORST HOTEL EVER!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The hotel is disgusting, the staff is beyond rude and there was no AC in our room! Got my stay refunded but have an extra charge on my account that they refuse to help me with. Won't answer my calls or call me back. The front desk staff cops an attitude with me everytime I call! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! There are drug dealers outside, people are high out of their minds walking around there and staying at the hotel, there are hookers, and people will snoop around your car. DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING VALUABLE IN YOUR CAR IT WILL BE STOLEN!!! Windows at this hotel are busted. I did not feel safe even pulling up into the parking lot. There were cops there constantly. We had our German Shepherd with us and she was the only source of protection we felt. No one seemed to come near us because they were scared of her. Even though she is the sweetest. Complaining to the front desk didn't do crap, the manager is nonexistent. Apparently they have new management are dealing with other people who have also been charged a random amount they didn't authorize. Do wast your time or money on this hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Horrible,"Hotel was disgustingly dirty.  Staff was rude. Only 1 luggage trolley available for guests.  Expected our family of 4 to share 2 bath towels.   No wash cloths in room.    Front desk staff argumentative and was reluctant to give me more towels/wash cloths.  Blood stain on comforter.  Grimy smudges all over bathroom door.  Stinky hallways and loitering,  lots of it,  taking place right outside of front door for many hours.   I will never stay here again and would never recommend it to anyone.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Beware!!!!!!,"Hi, my boyfriend have been using choice hotels through our trip because usually they are comfortable and affordable. We arrived at the Clarion Denver  after booking on booking.com. We were staying here from 26th-30th. We pulled up and there are windows of the hotel with box fans and sketchy people outside checking car doors. I didn't want to pass judgement because again I have great experience in choice hotels with their cleanliness comfort and service. We got into our room with the ""King"" sized bed and my boyfriend goes to sit on the edge of it and the whole bed seasaws off the frame. We went to check it and it was two beds pushed together. We call the front desk and they immediately gave us another room. I walk into the new room and there is dirty qtips in the hallway in front of our door, the Air is noisey and doesn't work, blood on the walls, poop marks on clean towels and all the lamp shades are broken. Meanwhile My boyfriend goes to get the new room keys, takes a elevator back to the room and the elevator starts shaking and the woman who is on the Elevator  with him says she has been living here for two month and the elevator breaks all the time and no one would believe what goes on in this hotel. I call the front desk and their is no manager. So, we call choice hotels and customer service works out a resolution where we would be refunded the rest of our stay and moved to Quailty Inn. I was told I have to check our of Clairon prior to them booking our new stay. I go down to the desk check out while on the phone with choice hotels. After I'm all checked out Choice hotels was able to book my stay. It's now July 13th, and I still haven't gotten a refund from Clarion. We called Clarion and Jasmin told us they didn't have a manager and that in the system says we stayed there all four days and they couldn't give is a refund. she hung up on my boyfriend when he asked to talk to someone who owns the place.  So we called choice hotels and 3 hours  they said they can't do anything about it even when it's in their system we checked out. I got hung up on by their customer service manager Amanda because I asked who should be held accountable for stealing my money?  No one can help us and this horrible hotel has $300 of our money. Choice hotels have no control over their chains. Do not book Choice Hotels!!!!!!! Definitely don't book at this Clarion, don't let the price sway you in.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,AWFUL!!!!,"Location is not great, which is something I could overlook, however, I observed drug use and deals happening right outside the lobby, prostitutes in the lobby and around the building, daughter tried to use the lobby bathroom and instead found a woman who had set up camp there with all her belongings. You are advised to not leave any valuables in your car, but there are no baggage trolly available, so we had to make multiple trips to bring in all of our luggage. The room smelled of vomit and cigarettes, burn hole in bedding, duct tape holding down the carpet at the threshold to the bathroom, and damage to the furniture in the room. AC did nothing to cool down the room.  Overall did not feel like a safe, clean place to stay with my family. Very disappointed with the misleading rating here and on booking.com",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,acceptable basic accommodations,"Its in a kind of industrial area, super dark at night and a bit of noise from freeway traffic. The front desk staff was nice enough at check in but I had problems opening the door to my room and had to go back down. They told me you have to pull it a certain way. I got it to work after a few tries but it seemed kind of weird. Once I got into the room everything was basic but clean. I slept fine and checkout was uneventful.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,HVAC and staff,"Stayed at this hotel for two decades. It has never caught up to its promises. Cleaning is so-so. Newly remodeled? That happened years ago. Not enough people at front desk during peak times. Rude and uninformed people at the front desk. Promised during several stays to receive a fan or a heater, never got one and never got a return call from the front desk about it.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nothing to recommend it,"This is a property that says it’s newly renovated but I doubt it.  No hot buffet due to COVID, but virtually nobody including staff was wearing masks despite multiple signs and no hand sanitizer at front desk or in the room.  Most of the guests were a bit on the rough side and there were several arguments going on outside the front door.  They ran out of washcloths so a hand towel was pressed into service.The room was spacious and clean.  The bed was soft, but was not flush with the wall which is weird.  The whole place just looked worn out.  There was significant noise from the interstate.  Disappointing for a Clarion property.One other small warning.  Access to or leaving will probably involve a traffic circle at Pecos St which is an accident waiting to happen.  Be careful!",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don’t stay,"Smelled of smoke of both kinds no matter where you walk inside. The first room the shower and the curtains were broke. The bed linens were stained and dirty! They moved us and that room had stains all over the desk, missing drawers and a tv that was broke. I do not recommend. Only stayed for a few hours before having to travel again. Find a different hotel !",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Soft Bed,"My favorite part of our stay was that the bed was so soft and comfy, I did not want to get up. The room was clean, the Delux king had a large bed, microwave, fridge, and the bathroom was good too. However, the door does not go back all the way because of the bathroom installation which is rather annoying. I thought the staff was friendly, accomodating, and the elevators worked well. I would have appreciated vending machines on the fifth floor.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel was disgusting!! Not newly remodeled! Stay Away!,"The front desk staff was unfriendly and didnt care about anything. The 'non-smoking' hotel reeked of smoke. We even saw people smoking weed. When we got to our non-smoking room,it hadn't even been cleaned!! It also reeked of smoke. The whole hotel was very run down. Definitely  not remodeled. I asked for a full refund and my family walked out.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Completely Disgusting ,"We booked 2 rooms, both filthy, dirty bed linens, dirty refolded towels, broken televisions, broken shower curtain rod, torn and stained draperies, carpeting filthy worn to underfloor in some traffic areas. Showers filled with filth and hair in one shower, in addition what appeared to be urine in the other. Filth around toilets and edges of bathroom layeted with filth reminiscent of old school gas station restrooms. Everything in rooms and halls reeked of cigarette and cannabis smoke. Check in staff was incredibly rude, took over an hour and our having to call our booking agency to find our prepaid reservation. Shuttle was the selling point of the hotel yet completely unreliable, not being available to leave when promised and stranded us downtown for hours blaming other employees and continuously telling us that they were ""on the way."" I could go on and on, this place is astonishingly horrible. Fair warning, do not stay here!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel from Hell!!!!,"This place is the absolute pits!!!!  Stay away at all costs.  It is run down, outdated and dirty!  Staff does nothing about the smoking issues!  All rooms are no smoking but we had some jerk smoking next to us probably to cover up the smell of weed!  We cancelled our last night and moved to a different hotel which was clean and had fresh air!!!!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not 420 Freindly,"Hotel is old, in the industrial area, noisy, Section 8 vouchers for the homeless.People hanging out in the parking lot selling more than weed, broken lights and electric sockets not working in the room, the desk chair was unusable. Overall I would not recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to have 420 experience. The desk clerk told me I could vape outside,as soon as I started 3 people came up asking if I would share,(sure why not let 3 strangers put their mouths on my mouthpiece with coronavirus spreading accross the USA",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disaster,"Only one elevator worked which made for a 20 minute wait to get on a jam packed elevator. That elevator had dog food spilled in the corner, a pack of cigarettes, and a bottle of liquor in it. When we got in the room 3/4 light bulbs above the mirror were burned out. No hot water whatsoever on the second day. I went to turn a lamp off and it shocked me so bad my arm hurt all the way to my shoulder for half an hour. When I went down the last day to get breakfast I was asked literally 4 times if I was checking out. Finally I got tired of it and decided to check out early to see if that would help. It did not. He asked again. The only good thing was the staff member that checked me in was friendly even though we had to try several computers before we could check in. There were also no luggage racks and no one to help with any luggage as the poor girl at check in was running all over trying to multitask to take care of everything herself. This place was a complete disaster. The stairs weren’t even an option as they had fire alarms on them.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great stay,First night had no heat we went to front desk they gave us an upgraded room.the breakfast was really good enjoyed the stay you guys rock thank you for everything.they were under construction the first day which wasnt horrible they made sure we got our room in time,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wish I could leave -5 stars.....,"Stayed one night here, was checked into an occupied room. Moved to an empty room finally and checked out early in the morning to catch my flight. My card has been charged the nightly rate everyday since the stay, not to mention charged double for the initial stay. The bank now had to cancel my card because every time I call them they ask if I can hold and then hang up! AVOID this place. Not worth it at all.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A one night stay,"This a budget hotel and I found it average for a hotel in this category. The room was clean but rather tired, the bar staff were friendly but the reception staff less so. The food menu for evening meal and breakfast was limited but okay. This is NOT a city centre hotel, it is situated on the outskirts of Denver next to rail yards and industrial premises. The hotel shuttle bus is fine for getting from the hotel to the train station but seems not to work in the opposite direction, on two occasions we were unable to use it to get from the station area to the hotel, so had to get a taxi instead.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst Stay EVER!!!!!,"I just want others to avoid ever having to go through what we endured. There are SO many things wrong and scary with this place!We stayed here for years for the Western Stock show. It's an older hotel but with the shuttle, it was convenient. This year we got stood up by the shuttle, for 45 minutes, in the 20 degree tenperature, while they kept tellitemperature, just a few minutes away. The driver who finally showed up said he had never driven the shuttle before, the actual driver never showed up! There was a drug addict in the lobby yelling, that the police had to come and get. We had to change rooms 3 times! We even got keys for an occupied room once! Everyone's keys had to be redone at least 3 times traveling to the desk from the 9th floor on a scary elevator that actually vibrated,and screeched with noise. Our rooms heat at 60 degrees ran in the 90s. It was horrid. The rooms worn out with signs of mold. There were thug looking characters in and working at the hotel. The staff at the desk were nice and the activity director, however for 3 days the manager never returned my many calls. They said shes rarely there.Do NOT stay here! I'd rather sleep in my truck than here.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,YOU’VE BEEN WARNED,"Extremely disappointed.   Not sure how they have 3.5 stars.  Lobby was packed upon arrival.  Thought maybe they were just busy.  Nope, they didn’t know what they were doing.  Took two people to get me checked in.  Parked in a dark dark parking lot where one guy was partaking in smoking a joint and the guy next to us was either passed out or asleep in his front seat.  Got to the room, smelled like weed as I’m sure many seedy hotels do in Colorado now.  Room was hooooottttt!!  Opened window to let smell and heat out.  Went out for a while, got back to the room around 12:15am and two minutes later a gentleman l, probably on the new legal stuff, was yelling at his “significant” other to let him in the room across the hall from us.   She locked him because he apparently left to cheat on her for a while.  There were numerous other seedy people in an around the building.   Not a good look for the Clarion name brand.   Choice needs sell it off and let someone else take the hit for the crappiness.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disappointed,Very disappointed. Rooms are run down. Smells of smoke. The fire alarm was covered with plastic. Second room was so hot and fan did not work. Tiles are water damaged. Door to room was hard to open. No parking lot lights.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pay little expect less,"I wasn’t expecting much since is very cheap and we only need it to sleep and run next morning, but from beginning to end I wasn’t a present stay, the were nice to keep my luggage for a few hours, but the bathrooms where not clean, the carpet was smelly, but the worst part for me was the cigarette smell and the marijuana smell, for crying out loud is a not smoking facility. The only good thing was the staff was very nice and helpful.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY,"Would have been better off sleeping in the car. One star is even too high for this ""hotel."" This hotel needs so much help. Not to mention the management is about worthless. I will never stay here again, and I will voice that to anyone looking for a hotel in/around Denver. Upon arrival (130) we were told we could check in in 20 minutes. After 20 minutes we got in line to check in. Front desk checked in another guest into an already occupied room and proceeded to tell us we could no longer check in early but that we could keep our luggage in the back room. We did this as we had somewhere to be. Upon returning, one of our bags was stolen. This was reported to the desk and they processed to tell us they would check the cameras and get back to us. After asking what would be done if this was not found I was told there would be compensation. Cameras were not checked until constantly asking and once an answer was finally given they told me the camera in that particular area was out at the time, so there was no way to check, but I could file a police report. Yes wow what a great idea, considering it's a hotel and I'm not from here. Unless the front desk took it, it won't be found by the police. All that would do is waist a police officers time. They have much better things to do than to file a useless report. The managers were supposed to have been in both sat and sun, but not one was present until after 2pm Sunday. Mind you that's after check out. The heat was out in half of the building, (dec. 28) but don't worry, they'll bring you a space heater. Our tv remote had no batteries. There were holes in the wall. The hotel itself was very dirty and not kept up. After finally speaking with a manager she refuses to do anything about the situation. The manager now refuses to contact me back. This place needs shut down. Most ridiculous hotel stay I have ever had. -- Six days later I finally got to talk to Manager Mia (not Erin, the one I've been leaving messages for) who almost instantly got snippy saying she had no idea what I was talking about. I actually hung up on this manager because she constantly talked over me, and her attitude was very unwelcoming and extremely rude.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not up to Clarion standards,"Stayed here for three nights last month (November).  This hotel is understaffed, and because of it, the front desk is always crowded and the service is extremely slow.  The heating and cooling systems does not function properly either.  The room was cold, and when you turned the heat up you'd get no change in temperature but alot of very loud noises. It was so annoying I would just turn it off/down and be cold. Other people complained that their rooms were the opposite...burning up and they couldn't turn the temperature down. The fitness center was pretty shabby.  Nice shuttle driver though, just don't plan on getting picked up fast...it will be a while! And the restaurant and breakfast were not bad.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Even at this low price you don't deserve this type of hotel,"Well we got a good rate. After that everything went South, we checked in went to our room in the heater didn't work. We reported it to the manager who said he would have it fixed while we were out to dinner we got back late and lo and behold the room was in the 50s. We called the front desk who set up a maintenance man who said yes is heater doesn't work you should have a spot heater here I don't know why it's not in the room. Immediately went to the front desk agreed to move us to another room, unfortunately this room was occupied by another guest. Another trip down to the front desk was met with rudeness and poor customer service. They gave us another room our third of the night, when we got to the room it reeks of cigarette smoke and low and behold the heater didn't work. Since it was by now 2:00 in the morning and this room was at least in the sixties we went to bed. The next morning I was surprised although nothing is surprising now that there was no hot water, I let the water run for 20 minutes and the water never got hot. Cold room, cold shower, cold customer service. That morning we tried to get a manager but there was no one at the front desk and according to one of the employees there was not a manager on that morning.Almost is disconcerting was while we were waiting for our third room to drunk girls walked up to the front desk and said oh we lost our keys to the room. The girl behind the desk said okay what rooms are you in and proceeded to produce keys for them without asking for any ID or proof that they were actually Hotel guests. Even though it looks like a good deal I would run away from this hotel as fast as I could!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Mixed feelings,"Some good things - room was clean, breakfast had a great selection.  Bad things - the thermostat was simple enough to figure out but even when i moved it to 62F, it stayed at 73 and we died.  And there were tons of slamming doors and noise 2:30-3:30am. But it got us away from the craziness downtown Denver, and on our next journey.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Terrible hotel masquerading as just a decent hotel...,"Wow...  This hotel...  It is a terrible hotel masquerading as just a decent hotel.  Where do I even start?  At least read what's marked by the *** if you want to know why you should NOT stay in this hotel.We were in a bit of a rush when checking in.  We called to see if we could do so over the phone.  This took 3 calls to accomplish, the first two of those calls the headset was put down on the desk, it wasn't even a proper hold.  Eventually they told us our room, that we were checked in, and that we could grab the keys and head on up.When we got to there we were told it's not possible to check in over the phone...  So they started the process over.  Even though we were waiting to be checked in they weren't really paying attention to us and were asking others if they needed help.***Once we got our keys we headed to our room. Just outside the elevator there are no signs directing you to where your room would be.  You just guess!  When we got to our room at 7:30 PM someone had the door open and was ready to START cleaning it...  A room they had just checked us into.  Again, we were in a rush, so we asked if we could just leave our stuff in the room so we could get to what we traveled there for.  After our activity, we got back to the hotel at about 2:30 AM.  AND OUR DOOR WAS PROPPED OPEN BY THE METAL LATCH ON THE INSIDE!!!!  Our room with all of our laptops, a Nintendo Switch, all our clothes and bags, was just left open available for ANYONE to go into!!  That is the worst thing I've ever had happen at a hotel.***At this point, ANYTHING that happened just added to this awful experience.  Things that would likely normally be overlooked.  But not after what happened...  These things included our room keys not actually opening the door (good thing our door was unlocked!!), the blinds being poorly installed so we got woken up very early by the sun after a very late night, getting the wrong information that breakfast ended at 9 and found out later it was actually 10 so we could have made it but thought we missed it already, someone knocking VERY loud at NINE AM ready to clean the room (we should have put our do not disturb sign out, but 2:30 AM?  you forget things...), and finally, trying to take a shower and having to wait 3 minutes just to get lukewarm water.  No hot water whatsoever.Extremely poor experience overall.  But hey, the beds were soft!  We just woken up from them way too early...",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not worth whatever you pay!,"We stayed here on a recent trip to Denver and it was terrible.  The hotel states that it has recently been renovated, not the areas we saw.  The wallpaper in both the halls and the room was worn, torn and dirty.  The counter in the room had chipped Formica along the edge.  The bathroom mirror was dirty, the faucet and counter were dirty,there was no Kleenex, just a small amount of toilet paper and there was no bathmat.  The ice bucket still had water in it from the last guest.  The hotel is located in an unattractive, industrial area.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good... if cheap price is important,"I'll start with the pluses: Very central location (the junction of I-25 and I-70 just outside my window). Ample breakfast buffet. Big, comfortable room. Staff were mostly friendly and helpful. Currently almost as cheap as Motel 6.But this is no three-star hotel. The front desk is a shambles; most staff there wore fleece jackets and hoodies (not over their heads, at least!). Housekeeping didn't clean my room; one day they left me a handwritten note on wrinkled paper to explain. I sometimes heard them shouting outside my door. Maintenance only fixed a burned-out light after I asked twice. A lot of the day, the hallway smells like an ashtray. The TV remote didn't work. The heater thermostat didn't seem to do much. One night at 6pm, I couldn't get warm water for a shower.I adapted, and overall the three nights weren't bad. I sent a detailed list to Choice Hotels. I hope things change; I'd come back if they do.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NEVER AGAIN.,"Most unprofessional, unorganized, and uncleanliness hotel I have EVER stayed at. Too many bad things to even list. NEGATIVE stars. Absolutely NO customer service. Shuttle bus is a joke unless you enjoy waiting 2 hours in the cold while calling 6 times to confirm. Rooms are filthy, found dirty glasses and Victoria secret empty boxes under the bed. Mouthwash was opened and used.The heating/cooling system doesn't work. Non smoking? HA! All I smelt was cigarette smoke. Price match? No way. DO NOT STAY HERE.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dump with rude staff but can smoke it up,"This ‘buisness’ hotel is run down looking and off from the main area. We arrived and they had no information about our booking and seemed very reluctant to help. Luckily a lady walked onto the desk and recognised my name from when she prepped the check in list in the morning. She then took over and checked us in. This lady was the only helpful member of staff I remember. The only buisness that takes place in this hotel is drugs. I’m a fan of puffing on the peace pipe so it didn’t bother me but Jesus how do they get way with it! The male receptionist threatened to throw us out because a card fee didn’t go through and he didn’t realise. So after buying food at reception to munch on, he rang about 40 mins later and said I must come downstairs to pay. I told him I was in bed so could he add it to my room or come down tomorrow. He said no and if I didn’t he would throw me out. I told him ‘try it mate’ and hung up. He thought he was a big man. Turns out he was a little man. Perks of this place - can smoke it up, have ample stoner munch at reception - has a bar attached - cheap - next to a great dispensary - the TVs work! Downside - unhelpful staff - aggressive bloke on reception- but of a dump Add some extra ventilation so it’s less stinky and train your staff better and it would be much better.Added note, I made a formal complaint to both the hotel and the hotel chain and got absolutely nowhere with it. Shame you don’t care about your customers",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Rodent Droppings in Room,"I was in Denver for a few nights, as it happens, while the Broncos and Nuggets were both having home games. Lodging options were limited. I knew this was a budget hotel and I didn’t expect or need much.What I absolutely did not expect was to find rodent feces on the bar sink area of my room. In plain view. Meaning either the room had not been cleaned recently, or the infestation is bad enough that a rat crapped in the room in the few hours between housekeeping and my check in.I reported this to the front desk and the employee shrugged and said “weird, we’ve never had that complaint before.” After showing her photos, she offered to have someone clean it. Like, I get that they were probably full due to the games, but she didn’t even try to see if another room was available. To top it off, after an hour and a half no one had come to clean so I had to call the front desk and follow up. She said housekeeping had been “busy.” I wasn’t expecting a refund, but I was expecting some even remote concern from the front desk staff. Nothing.There was a large gap under the room door that you could definitely see in or out of. The entire floor smelled like cigarettes and weed. Several outlets in the room had melted parts and burn marks which did not instill confidence in their safety.The shuttle driver was great though! Had there been any other hotels available I would have gladly moved to another hotel even without a refund, but unfortunately rooms were slim pickings.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Keep your expectations low,"Main issue is housekeeping and maintenance. If you are OK with moldy showers, questionable cleaniness of the floor and carpet, unsightly half peeled duct tape for thresholds, and dust everywhere, then it is a well priced alternative for your stay in Denver. Just don't expect that clean feeling.As for the front desk staff. Don't bother complaining. They heard it all. You won't find many repeat visitors.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The worst experience in all my travels!,"We arrived at the hotel to check in around 4:30 or 5. We were informed by the front desk that they ""just got slammed"" and our room wasn't ready (we had reservations for a month). The attendant at the front desk ""guaranteed"" that our room would be ready when we returned home from the NFL game that we had traveled to see. We missed several calls during the very LOUD game that they didn't have a room for us due to a leak. They said we wouldn't be charged and said ""see you next time. "" When the game was over there was a ridiculously long line of angry people trying to check in or sort things out. We were told there wouldn't be a manager in until 10 am the next morning and we were basically out of luck. And to top things off they STILL charged my credit card for a room that they canceled!!! What a joke!! I've never encountered anything like it in all of my travels. I will NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone ever. An absolute disaster, nightmarishly ran!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wasp in the room and toilet paper holder on the floor.,I have to echo some other recent reviews.  Hotel was old and not well maintained.  We walked into our room to see the toilet paper holder on the floor.  There were random holes in the wall that had been patched by an amateur.  Day 2 a wasp flew out from the curtain.  I certainly will never stay here or at any other Clarion property.  Talked to the front desk and their comment “we will have to talk to maintenance tomorrow”.  No other solution was provided.  Hotwire was notified and this review will be provided there as well.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,AWESOME,Front desk ladies are awesome the bartenders and chef are on point 👌👌 recommended highly been great with the trucking company very friendly and clean rooms awesome food. Reasonable prices on rooms highly recommend,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Avoid this hotel,We booked this hotel based reviews on Hotwire and Tripadvisor reviews.  I always look for 3 star and up hotel with good reviews. It had good reviews so I was ok with trying it. It didn't deserve those reviews. Location is awful. The highway noise was annoying. The whole place smells like an ashtray. I got a non smoking room and it smelled so bad. The windows don't open so there was nothing I could do about that. The bed was comfortable but the whole place is very dated. The bed is about all I can say was positive.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A sad but honest 1 star.,"Firstly, I am realistic and understand that this is a budget hotel. I was not expecting the 4 seasons. If  this hotel was the same as most budget hotels like most I would not have felt inclined to say anything. This was a disaster. The staff were not interested, they were just brash and a little rude. No customer service skills or care. The hotel was dingy and worn down. The rooms were dated and not well cared for. My room had a random sofa covering the door termory door to the next room and a wardrobe that looked like it had been taken from the side of the road. It was just not nice. The first room I was given had guests staying in it. . . So yes, I walked into someone laying on the bed. It was mortifying and they were extremely upset as I was embarrassed. This was made worse when I went to reception to sort it out and the girl behind the counter did not seem bothered, no apology though she did offer me a bag of chipsThe Free Breakfast was a mad house. No staff on hand at all and it was just a mess of people fighting. The best thing I can say about the Hotel is that there is no staff in the breakfast area so if you want a free breakfast just show up between 7 am and 10:00 as nobody will stop you.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Terrible Clarion,This is a terrible Clarion.  Bathroom is in need of repairs and it smells like someone lit up a marijuana cigarette in the bathroom but it’s coming from another room.  The gal at the counter was very nice but this place is a dump.  I should’ve spent another $50 to stay downtown.  Had I realized where it is located (next to railroad tracks and a bad neighborhood). I would’ve but I’ve never been to Denver before.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Better off sleeping in your car,"An utter dump. First room they sent us to still had people in it (learned upon entering). Every floor smells like the worlds largest collection of ashtrays. We are in a non-smoking room, yet a damp tobacco stench hangs in the air, and I’m sure my clothes will smell similarly by morning. Broken lock on door. Terrible location—might as well be a truck stop on the highway. This was a $100 Hotwire booking, and this hotel somehow has 3.5 stars. I’ve stayed at far nicer places in rural Central America for $2 a night.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smelliest Hotel Ever,"I'm retired and travel a lot. This is my 5th trip this year. The room we stayed in smelled very very bad. When we complained about the smell the first day we were told they were full booked. Nothing happened to clean the room. We complained of the smells, smelled like dog poop, cat pee and vomit. The carpet obviously hadn't been shampooed maybe since the 90's. Then the door had to be pushed hard, shoulder into it to open. Closing it required more force. Several times the cleaning staff left the door ajar. The bedding had dark brown spots on the sheets. The housekeeping staff never did change them. The ice machine and soft drink machines were broken on our floor. There was never more than one person on the desk so check in and check out lines are long. The best thing about the hotel is the complementary breakfast. Good thing there nothing close to this hotel it's in an industrial park area. The complementary shuttle bus to Union Station is very unreliable. Don't even try calling the desk for the shuttle. On our 4 days there I was left on hold for 15 minutes twice. Once I was told the desk person put me on hold a few minutes then came back and said the shuttle was on the way to the station. 1 1/2 hours later I hailed down the shuttle at the station. He said he hadn't gotten a call. All and all STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,What a sorry excuse for a hotel,"We were trying to do Denver on a limited budget and decided to stay at the Clarion. Before starting in on all the horrible things, I want to point out one absolutely outstanding feature—the friendliness and helpfulness of shuttle drivers Garry and Brian.  If not for them, the trip would’ve been a total disaster.The hotel is shabby and dirty, our room wasn’t cleaned once in our entire four-day stay. We were told by numerous staff members that there is no manager and that most of the housekeeping staff walked out on the Thursday we arrived.  When you’re in downtown Denver, you have to call the hotel to schedule a pick up. The first night there I called and was put on hold for 10 minutes with no answer. I hung up and had to call back 10 times, each time the phone was answered with an abrupt “please hold” and then I was cut off or put on hold. I finally called Uber.  When we got to the hotel, I asked the woman why she wouldn’t answer the phone and got a snotty reply.The beds were comfortable, but that’s about the only other positive thing to say about it.Over the course of our stay I saw many people at the front desk venting their frustrations about dirty rooms. Incorrect charges, botched reservations, etc.There is a Radisson Hotel nearby. I didn’t see it, but anything would have to be better in this place.Unlike many others who have reviewed this place, we did not notice any pot smoke.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Needs major renovations,"Great location to downtown Denver. Unfortunately, the hotel needs major renovations. The carpet and wallpaper are old and need replacing. My room was a non-smoking room but you could still smell smoke in the room and in the hallways. One of the comforters was dirty and needed to be replaced but a new one was never brought up after we contacted the front desk. The shower didnt have a liner so the floor got wet with every shower. The water was hot and the pressure was good, which is a good thing. The ironing board was broken so we couldn't use it. I would not stay here again, unless they completely renovated the property.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst hotel I've ever stayed in,"This is by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, and I travel A LOT. Not a 3-star hotel at all - false advertising. I have asthma and the whole hotel smelled like smoke, which got me sick. We arrived at around 11pm and wanted a place to stay halfway between the airport and downtown. We did not feel safe in the parking lot, the lobby, and even in our own room. I even tried calling our other hotel in downtown to see if they can let us check-in that night. I would NOT recommend this hotel. Complete waste of $120 / night.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,pot hotel,"Other reviews are correct, this is a dump.  I never even heard of a pot hotel, but the people at the front desk insist it's on Clarion's website.  It's not.  It reeks of smoke, you can get a contact high from the elevator buttons.  No toilet paper or tissues in the room.  AC weak.  I paid $120 for one night, which I think is sort of a lot, and I expected much more from this.  It just smells so bad, all of it.  If you're gonna have a pot hotel, that's fine, but you need to advertise it as such.  We had a non-smoking room, but the smell is everywhere.  The front desk staff is rude.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Smelly, dirty and very disappointed.","Lobby smelled of pot,our bathroom smelled of urine. Our Non smoking room smelled of smoke The iron didn't work, ceiling tile above the sink was dirty & didn't sit in the ceiling correctly Never again!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Visitor - horrible manager Yvonne - she should be fired!,"I witnessed a nice lady checking in last night.   She had her confirmation on her cell phone.  The Front Desk refused to even look at her phone & said her room would be more $$.   The lady asked for a manager, Yvonne came over & called her racial slurs, spoke in Spanish about the lady using foul language.  Yvonne refused to look at the lady's cell phone confirmation.  She went over to the computer, cancelled the lady's reservation and basically told her to leave.  WOW!   I was visiting my friend who had a room, but we both agree to never book with Clarion ever again in Denver.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING,"I am doing a road trip back from California with my boyfriend and we have been trying to fit in as much as possible, sightseeing wise, without breaking the bank. We chose clarion because it was close to the city and not as expensive as other hotels. HORRIBLE DECISION. We got to the hotel around 330 PM and I was actually scared to get out of our car. I did not feel safe at all. I was concerned all night that my car would be broken into. We also did not have a safe in the room (which I never use but would have in this instance). People smoking everywhere and locals hanging out in the parking lot. The hotel itself smelled like marijuana (even with a smoking section designated outside), the lights flickered in the bathroom while showering, and my towels were probably 15 years old with holes in them. I slept on top of my own blanket placed on the bed along with my own blanket covering me to keep me warm because of a darks stain on the sheet. We ate the cost and booked another hotel farther from the city for our second night. I lost money but I had peace of mind. STAY FAR AWAY.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,420 Hotel!,"What a dump! Wife and daughter were there... people smoking pot all over, and yet no where does it say on web site that it is 420 friendly!!.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hasn't improved from Quality Inn days.,"I have stayed at this hotel since it was a Quality Inn and it has gotten worse over the years.  I will say that the service at the front desk was great and the breakfast was very good.  Other than that, I had nothing but complaints.  The hallways and elevators still stink of weed.  A problem that has carried over from the past.  Also the electronic key system went awry on Tuesday afternoon all through Wednesday.  I felt like I had to stay in my room since it would take a long time to get back into my room.  I realize that any electronic system can go down at any time,  but there should be a way for guests to get into their rooms without having someone let them in.  The only reason I stay here is because of the shuttle to the games.  From here on out I will stay at the Quality Inn in Westminster and take the light rail to Union Station.  This place has disappointed too many times.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Avoid at all costs,"Botched room reservation, no amenities, terrible ""grill"" food selection and service. Bed linens are worn out and very thin. The only good thing to report was that my room had a great view of the front mountain range during the July 4th storms and fireworks. This place is a dump. Do not stay here. There is nothing close by, hence their shuttle. Second worst place I've ever stayed. Never again. Cancelled another trip there in September for the Mineral show. I'd rather sleep in a car. Direct comments to management yielded what you can expect from them this time.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,YASMIN IS GREAT,"My stay here was great due to Yasmins kindness , as soon as i walked in my room itwas not cleaned well , yasmin was quick to fix all of our inconviniences , always had a smile on her face and said hi to my family as we walked by  , she made us feel very welcomed , appriciate her she made up for all the inconviniences we had , breakfast was great , pool was clean and enjoyable , will be back",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not too great,Ok so first the pros - free breakfast.  Cereals.  Make your own waffles. Muffins etc.  not bad for ftre!  Alsi free shuttle within 5 miles. But its on the hour so you have to catch it at the right time. Friendly bartenders.  Now the cons - elevators are super slow! Have to wait for a very long time.. hotel is near nothing!  Rooms are so so.  Not really sure what part of town? Industrial maybe? I suggest spend a few mire dollars for something better!,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disappointing,"I recently stayed at the Clarion as part of a package deal with Amtrak Vacations.  The hotel is outside of the city of Denver by the highway and the train yard.  It gets an interesting mix of clientele from truckers to business people.  As other reviewers have mentioned, check-in was a challenge.  We arrived earlier than expected and had to wait for a room.  We took the opportunity to avail ourselves of the free shuttle into Denver.  The shuttle drivers were great!  Very knowledgeable about where to go and what to do.  When we returned and checked in we went up to our room.  The elevators are notoriously slow.  Our room was nothing special, if not a bit on the well-used side of things.  Our shower didn't work properly and spouted tepid water.  As we were only staying for a short time I didn't make a big deal of this, especially after hearing someone complain at the desk about a problem they were having and had no resolution after 24 hours.  They do have an outdoor pool which was great on a hot day.  If you are looking for a place to crash this hotel may be your answer.  If you are looking for an ""experience"" keep looking.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great customer service!!,Travis at the front desk was extremely helpful and welcoming with a great personality. Made a great first impression and was able to answer any questions I had. Made us want to come back for sure when we travel,5

She made our stay AMAZING from check in to check out! The hotel looks like it's getting updated as there was construction going on during our stay, but I know after this I won't stay anywhere but at the Clarion Hotel as long as she's working there!!Keep up the GREAT WORK!!!Thank you for everything!SPE",5

Based on the prevailing rates for that night, it seemed like the best deal!  Overall, I have no serious complaints, but I would like to offer a few observations:  Check-in seemed chaotic.  I arrived about an hour before the published check-in time.  I was told that there were rooms available, but that they were waiting for housekeeping to update the computer, so I would need to wait until 3pm to check-in - fair enough, that is the published time.  In the meantime, everyone else who planned to check-in early arrived and by 3pm the lobby was filled with luggage and people waiting to check-in.  Maybe they could have relieved that by releasing a few rooms earlier on - they were willing to do that for some guests (corporate contracts), but not for all.  When I finally approached the counter after 3pm for check-in, I encountered a staff member - Travis - who seemed apathetic at best.  Rather than greeting me, he waited for me to state my purpose for standing in front of him.  He kept referring to me as ""man"" like I was his buddy.  Common courtesy is becoming less and less common all the time.  By the time I was ready to go upstairs, I had to wait an exceedingly long time for the elevator.  Of the 3 main lobby elevators, only one was in service.  The other two were broken.  I was also a bit put off by the pungent smell of ganja - I guess that is now a given everywhere in Denver!  Before I got to my room, I began to wonder what was awaiting me there.  Thankfully, the room was updated (except the bathroom) and, more importantly, clean.  It looks to me like the Clarion has seen better days, and yet management is doing their level best to update this old hotel.  Still, there are a few touches (customer service is one!) that they need to try!  Free breakfast was about par for the course - standard offerings nowadays!  the one nice touch was the stoneware plates (even if they had only plastic flatware!)",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don’t book or use Priceline,"Man, what a letdown from both Priceline and the hotel. Booked last minute thru a Priceline Express Deal, read the reviews and was very concerned about our health and safety. Contacted Priceline asking for a cancellation or a upgrade to a different hotel that we would be willing to pay the difference for and they said no. Ended up booking a separate stay at the Westin in Downtown Denver for the same cost, which was an excellent stay! Reached out to Priceline again who contacted the hotel directly and said no refund or credit, even though we did not use our stay. Very disappointed in both Priceline’s customer service and this hotels. We will not be using either service again due to the sheer disappointment with customer service we experienced and the inability to support customers who do not feel safe or secure. Please consider using another booking application such as Hotels Tonight and PLEASE do not book here.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smells of cigarette smoke and dope. Some good points - but sadly outnumbered by the negatives....,"POSITIVES: Good sized room, comfy beds, aircon just about able to cope on warmer days.  Good breakfast. Shuttle into town is good - friendly drivers and very accommodating if you need to get somewhere a little off route. NEGATIVES: Shuttle back out of town is extremely unreliable. The reception always say ""it's just left heading to Union Station"" or ""15 to 20 minutes, and they'll be there.  The worst one (of several) was where I was told it was on it's way, and it didn't pitch up for another 1 hour 40 mins.  That was extremely irritating, and if the reception desk had been honest with an ETA, I could have either taken a taxi or waited somewhere a little more comfortable. Very poor internet speeds. Very noisy (our room was on the side of the hotel that backs onto the Highway). No double glazing.  Possibly the curve on the hotel acts an amphitheatre?  I don't know.  Bizzarely, they have a very loud crane/access platform parked up in the car park.  They get this thing out virtually every night, between 2200 and 2300, drive it around a bit and then hoist the cradle up to roof level, leave it there for a while, and then bring it down and park it up again before breakfast. I don't care if anybody else smokes, or what they smoke, but I do care when my room stinks of it.  It comes in through the aircon into the room, and through the vents in the bathroom. Not much of a ""Bar and Restaurant"".  We ate there once and got a raw burger. One lift out of action.  Other two are intermittent.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Lions and Tigers and Pot, oh my!","The secondhand smoke is really as bad as other reviewers have expressed.  We spent a weekend here (pre-paid) and I thought I got lucky at first.  We had a room on the second floor (a non-smoking floor).  There was little or no odor on Thursday night, but by Friday evening the room would seem like we’re in a casino.  The elevators are even worse.  It’s too bad really, because the staff, services and the room itself were pretty good.  They actually have really nice exercise equipment as well.The problem is that even though they separate the smoking rooms from non-smoking rooms, the building uses central HVAC instead of individual room units.  No matter where you are the smoke is distributed throughout the building.If you really like the location, there is a Radisson near by you might check out (don't know their policies or HVAC system).  If you need to stay at the Clarion, here are a few tips to make the room non-smoker friendly.  I discovered most of the smoke is coming from the bathroom vent.  Find the vent in the shower area and stuff a washcloth in it.  Run the AC during the day when people are out and turn if off at night and open a window.  Bring a portable air purifier.  Get a room on a lower floor so you don't have to spend much time in the elevators (the stairs are emergency only).Without the smoke, maybe a 4 star for the breakfast, location, price, beds (hybrid form/spring mattress).",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dirty,"Don’t waste your money this is definitely not three stars. More like 1.5 . There was hairs, long dark hairs all over wall and ceiling of shower as it hadn’t been cleaned. Called down told night shift desk clerk and he said well we don’t have housekeeping here so I guess I can put you in a different room. Well my sons asleep so can you just come clean shower. They said they didn’t have people to do that. Wow. A real manager would’ve said I’ll be right up. Also location is not central as promised. It’s in a rougher area of town .",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very disorganized place,"We had reservations & arrived right at 3:00 pm but were told our room wasn't ready yet & it would be about a 20 min wait but they wouldn't check us in till the room was ready. After 30 minutes, we got in the line of new arrivals that was backing up. After quite a wait in line, we finally got checked in. When we tried to enter our room, the safety bar was on - because the room was already occupied! We went back downstairs & after another wait, they finally got us switched to a new room.  The light over the bathroom sink didn't work. It just blinked, never did come on. The bed was ok but you could hear other guests moving about, talking, doors slamming, & traffic noise all night. Breakfast wasn't bad. Best thing about this hotel, is its proximity to Coors Field.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Items stolen from room,"Several items were STOLEN from my room while I was out for the day. I called the front desk, asked for the manager, and was connected to Yasmin. After telling me that I probably left my door open, she told me she’d conduct an investigation and call me on 7/27 because I was checking out early that morning. She did not call as promised, and I still have not been contacted.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"WTH. Blood, gum, trash!!! ","DO NOT BOOK!!! Save your $$$. I booked two rooms for 6 people. 3 people each room. My little brother makes a pallet on ground in all hotel stays usually, he’s a tall guy and does not fit into bed with one of us. Anyways ...go to climb into bed after a long day in Denver and there is blood on my comforter. The blanket my little brother grabs from my parents room to make the pallet also has blood on it. i call the front desk tell them the situation and the young girl says she will send someone up to address the issue. Ten minutes pass and no one has shown up. Call again and a guy answers this time I tell him there is blood on our blankets and he seems more interested in addressing the issue. A few minutes pass and there is a knock on our door. A maid with a set of sheets, I then inform her it is the comforter that has blood on it and she seems confused all while Forcing my little brother to hold some of her stuff to help her. She grabs the dirty blankets and knocks my wallet of into the trash can. after trying to talk to us in Spanish. And asking us if we speak Spanish? We are dark skinned but are Native American She looks around and precedes to say she will be back. I then dig my wallet of it of the trash can. A few more minutes pass and she returns with what looks like a single comforter in a plastic bag. Obviously a new “blanket”. She leaves and I go to get in bed and she has not in fact brought me a blanket but rather a mattress pad. We receive a phone call after she returns to the front desk. It is the young lady making sure that everything was taken care of, I inform her that she has brought me a single mattress pad rather then two clean comforters. I’m Told again they will fix it. A few minutes later another knock on the door... and now there is a man with the housekeeper and she has two blankets with her. The man says he is there to translate and asks me if there is anything else they can do. I then tell them that obviously the floor was not vacuumed because there is gum and m&ms on the floor as well as a can of peanuts under one bed and trash and a gatorade bottle I under the other! All this man has to say is he is really sorry about the whole ordeal. No offer to make the situation right, points a discount?? Nothing!!! When we checked in earlier in the day we put our stuff in the room and took of to another adventure. This whole thing happened late  at night as we are trying to get to sleep and took about 40 mins at the least to resolve fully. I will not be staying here again or recommending to anyone!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great location,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff, bathroom and rooms very clean. Nice outdoor pool . Smoking rooms available. Scenic view of Denver city and mountains. I would definitly recommend staying here next time your are in Denver",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good spot,"After a long night and long day of camping and hiking it was nice to find a hotel that have everything that we needed. The bathrooms were clean and they also serve breakfast in the morning. A great place to stay, with friendly staff! Can’t wait to stay again with them!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don’t book here!!,"I’m not even sure where to start with this hotel. It is absolute garbage. There are no redeeming qualities whatsoever. If you need anything from the front staff (checking in/out, complaints, etc..) then I would suggest  bringing a snack to tide you over to your next meal because you will be waiting for a long time. They don’t even acknowledge your wait. They just seem bothered that you’re even there in the first place. The outside looks nice but there is no resemblance to that on the inside. The whole place smells awful, the rooms are disgusting, there is no A/C, the beds are so bad that me and my fiancée seriously considered sleeping in our rental car so we could be comfortable and enjoy some cool air. If you want to take a hot shower after a day out, I’d suggest turning your water on before you leave so that it’ll be warm when you get back. The clarion hotel is also home to the slowest elevators in the Midwest. We literally waited 5 minutes for it to come up to the 3rd floor. (We timed it.) On our last day, we actually found blood stains on our shower curtain that were not previously there. God only knows what happened. That’s just my review of the physical condition of the place. Other than that, we paid for this entire stay in FULL a week before we got there. We checked in pretty late and the girl at the counter asked us for a card to put on file for incidentals, like whatever. That’s fine. We asked her straight up if there was gonna be anything charged to that card and she said no. But Maury determined that THAT was a lie. In the middle of doing some shopping on 16th street, we checked our account and realized we were missing about $300!! So after almost an entire day, we finally got this situation figured out and the money was put back into our account. Their way of handling this situation was giving us $40 in vouchers to their restaurant and they didn’t even follow through with that. Side note, we had to pretty much tell them (The Clarion Hotel people) that this was completely unacceptable and we weren’t just gonna accept their “oh I’m sorry, nothing we can do” BS, that they were, in fact, going to fix this situation because this was their fault and we weren’t taking no for an answer. So after this was figured out, we roll into the last day in Denver and have ANOTHER hold on our account from them at almost $500 for the same exact thing!!! We had to wait until after our flight to take care of their mistake this time. Overall, please please please do yourself a favor and do not spend your money at this establishment. There are far better places to be than this.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smoke,This hotel smells-smoke and pot.  We switched rooms and it did not help. Only 2 slow elevators working. I would never return. Only bright spot was Greg who tried to help with the smoke smell when we checked in late.,1

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good enough.  Great mattress. Bad Fridge,Not great but good enough. Best part was the mattress as most comfortable I have had at a hotel. Good breakfast.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,OK hotel with a dispensary nearby,"When I walked into a hotel elevator, the smell reminded me of my grandpa's bathroom where he smoked heavily. I got a non-smoking room, but I guess the hotel is smoker friendly. I tried to take a bath right after checking in at 3pm, but a hot water didn't come out even after running a hot water for 15 minutes (it came out next morning, so I guess the heating system was cold since it was right after the check-in time). While I was waiting for the hot water, somebody knocked the door. Before I could respond, he tried to open the door with a key. I wasn't wearing pants, but fortunately the door bolt was on. When I said something through the door, the person didn't answer and just left. When I tried to take a toilet paper, the entire toilet roll unit came out of the wall.  It's in a warehouse district and not many interesting businesses were there. However, there is a pot dispensary in a walking distance, which may appeal to certain tourists. If you're inclined to walk, I suggest walking on the South Platte River trail from downtown. It's a mostly pleasant trail.",2

That's where the positive for this hotel ends though. We read other reviews about how it'd been remodeled so we were surprised when our bathroom had mold. You could tell our bathroom hadn't been cleaned after the previous guests left. There was hair all over the bathroom, trash from the soap in the shower, and a soaking wet towel hanging up on the shower rod. The air conditioner didn't seem to work (or at least not very well), thankfully it was chilly outside and we were able to open the window. The comforter on one bed was ripped. Not just a little rip but slices in the comforter. It's alarming how an employee could think it was acceptable. At that point, I went to complain. An employee went and got a manager who was outside smoking. He didn't seem concerned really, gave a thin red blanket and said it was better. When I complained about the dirty bathroom, he LAUGHED and said, ""maintenance must have missed that being behind the door."" I'm certain he meant housekeeping, but regardless, that's not a mistake that should happen. He didn't take me seriously and it annoyed me. His solution, ""toss it in the hall and we'll get it."" No apology, no offer to switch us to a clean room... Nothing. It was disgusting. We had the room booked for two nights but we left in the morning. The lady who checked us out was so concerned about getting back to her video call she didn't even ask how our stay was. There are much better hotels without mold and with courteous employees, don't stay at the Clarion.Also, the menu for the restaurant in the room was much larger than the menu in the restaurant (they only have burgers and apps)",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Place!!,Me and my family stayed her. The rooms we clean and smelled good. Beds were super soft. Breakfast was pretty good. Surprisingly they had a lot to choose from to eat. Bar area was quite so I had a cold one and did alittle work on my laptop. Yazmin greated us at the hotel. She was happy and had a great attitude. Other places I have stayed at the front desk people are sometime rude. We also seen her when we checked out and the same cheery smile. Very professional I must say. All around I think the staff gets an A. They make this place what it is. I highly recommend if you stay anywhere clarion is the place to stay.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Quiet, well appointed, and clean","This was our 2nd trip to Denver, and our second time staying at this hotel. Compared to my last review, since last year, the Hotel has changed names and is now The Clarion Denver Central, and what a turn around the place has made. The lobby has a fresher, more welcoming feeling than before, and the front desk as well as every other person that works there, seem to go above and beyond expectations, even before you ask a question, they are at the ready with as much info as they can provide, I have stayed at other hotels and when asking the front desk for dinner recommendations, either weren't aware there was a restaurant on property, or they were embarrassed about it, My associate enjoyed the daily breakfast bar, while I am not a ""morning eater"", the food did look pretty tasty. If I had to complain about anything, other than no safe in the rooms, as if you want anything put in a safe, you have to leave it at the front desk, I would have to say the rooms, even clean and comfortable, could use some updating, perhaps a solid color carpet, as opposed to a square patterned carpet, in a wedge shaped room, other than that, I have no complaints, only Kudos to the Management and staff for dealing with everything they have to deal with.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice place to stay if you're only spending the night,"My wife and I recently traveled to Denver for our anniversary. I bid on Priceline for 3 & 4 star hotels and this hotel was selected. It is listed as Denver Central but it is really about two miles north of downtown Denver. The hotel is nestled against interstate highways to the east and south. The Radisson hotel is across the street to the north and to the west is what I would describe as an industrial/business area. In other words, it is not in a neighborhood where you can stroll down the street and find shops/bars/restaurants. Given it's location, I would recommend it if you were traveling through Denver and just spending the night. They do have a free shuttle to downtown Denver and to Coors Field however if there are many others going to the ball park, you may have to wait a long time to catch the shuttle. I thought the bed in our room was very comfortable and I liked the shower however the toilet seat was broken. I neglected to mention it to the hotel staff but I also thought that Housekeeping would have noticed it when they cleaned. The free breakfast is standard hotel food (waffles, sausage, eggs, cereal, etc.). I would have no problem staying there if passing through Denver and just needing a room for the night.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Be careful here,"We were booked into the Clarion by Amtrack Vacations. It is a 20 minute shuttle trip from Union Station. So, since the shuttle does not leave until 7AM, it would be easy to miss the westbound California Zephyr at 8AM because of traffic. That would ruin a vacation. The restaurant had just a couple of items, mostly hamburger. Our room was OK. We opted for another hotel on the way back even though we had the Clarion prepaid.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Our experience with Clarion Denver Central was brutal-the Clarion gave our purchased room away!!!,"First, we weren’t acknowledged by the front desk staff after walking in. When recognized by staff, we were informed that no rooms were available. This was very unexpected as we made a reservation and provided our credit card information ahead of time. We were even charged for the room!  Second, the Clarion expectations are that your must be present at their check in time, phone calls will not be accounted for. We were shelter-less until finding a different place on our own. There was no help from staff whatsoever.Third, it was very disappointing and unprofessional to do to travelers in an unfamiliar location. If it weren’t  for the Holiday Inn Express & Suites, we would have been stranded without a place to sleep. We appreciate the Holiday Inn Express’s services and accommodating us. Finally, Safe travels to all!",1

The computer lit up,  signed in to the trusty Gmail...pushed print...and proceeded to the front desk to retrieve our documents.  The young lady by the printer, Yasmin,  plucked the papers from the grips of the printer tray,  and with a big smile,  handed them to us, no charge.  What? Did I hear you right?

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,They cancelled the reservation the day before the trip to sell for a higher price.,They cancelled my brothers reservation the day before the stay so they could sell the room for $400 more. Made a complaint with the BBB. The staff was unprofessional. Not a good hotel service will never stay at one anywhere ever again.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Do not stay here,Worst service and hotel I have ever been in.  Waited an hour and a half in line to check in the hotel. They gave us a room that was not cleaned and said they would get to it immediately.  We had to leave the hotel but when arriving back the room was still not touched. When informing the front desk they explained all their cleaning staff got overwhelmed and left early so they would send maintenance up to get it cleaned right away.  30min passed and no one came.  Called down to the front desk to ask when it would be done just to be informed that they didn’t know why someone told us maintenance could clean it because they had also left for the night.  They said they could send us some clean towels if that would help but could get bit further service to us.  At this time it was 1am and we ended up having to leave the hotel to find something else.  On the way out we had spoken to 5 other people who were also leaving because of the same experience.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!,"Absolutely do not stay here, your room is never guaranteed! Where do I even begin to describe the incredibly dishonest (questionable legality), and very poor business practices this “hotel” operates under? We booked two rooms approximately TWO AND A HALF MONTHS PRIOR to a Garth Brooks concert in Denver. Upon arrival at 1:45 pm we paid money on both rooms, were told they were not ready but we could go to the concert, and they would be calling us “within the next 45 minutes” with our room numbers. At that time, we asked for a guarantee that we would have our rooms considering we put money down on them and was told face to face without a doubt they would be ready. Over the course of eleven hours, attending the concert my family and I placed over ten phone calls to the hotel asking where my room numbers were and was repeatedly told they would call in about a half hour, and yet again GUARANTEED that I would have my rooms. After the concert, I returned to get my room numbers and low and behold was met with “we over booked the hotel by 300 people and you no longer have rooms with us”. Even more incredible is that the hotel then had the audacity to lie to our faces and place the blame back on the customer with “well this isn’t our fault, we called you and left a message”, to which I have proof they in fact did not. Looking at other responses this seems to be a fabricated response given to all customers. What makes this even worse in my mind, is the many others they did this exact same thing to. The lobby was filled with people being told they no longer have a room after the concert in which many people had been drinking all day and caught a ride with an uber to avoid implications with the law only to be left with no other options than to drive to another hotel jeopardizing their safety as well as others. For those that were “lucky” enough to get a room, the desk was filled with people describing horrid situations such as being assigned to a room with people already staying in there and walking in on them, or being assigned a room to which still had evidence someone had slept there as it had not been cleaned that day. Additionally, this hotel made no attempt at an explanation as to how a hotel of 215 rooms overbooks by 300! All in all, this place is a perfect example of how NOT to run a business by lying to their customers faces, not giving even the slightest respect or concern for their customers’ safety or for the situation they have placed their customers in, and providing unsanitary living conditions for those that do receive rooms. I am not done with this issue and will be seeking further means to make sure this is heard by as many people as possible and reported to every level possible of the organization.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Amazing stay,Yazmin and Greg are amazing!! Always great us by name in the morning and evening. They make us feel at home and like family. Our room was ready and clean. Very friendly staff. Will most deff stay again.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Fun hotel near Denver,"Nice hotel, nice ammenaties, super professional and friendly staff. Really clean rooms, easy parking, and about 10 minutes away from everything downtown Denver. The staff are more than willing to accommodate you to make sure you have a pleasant stay. I asked for the top floor and they made it work. Would stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Amazing hotel,The hotel staff Yazmin was absolutely amazing with answering any of my questions. Hotel room was clean tidy and nice view of the city. Great bar and food. Shuttle is available to the 16th street mall.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great service,Very accommodating and Yazmin took care of our requests swiftly! Very good location and solid amenities. This was the perfect hotel for my friends and I for our trip to Denver. Would definitely recommend!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY HERE!!,"Terrible customer service, staff is not responsive to any of your needs. Building is run down and dirty! Entire building smells like weed and cigarette smoke. There are many people that come in and out of the building at all hours, very sketchy looking people. Overall, this is just not a good hotel, we had a terrible experience. We checked out and moved to another hotel because of the poor service and quality.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Great Hotel, Great Service",I stayed at the Clarion in Denver and had a great experience with my stay. All the staff is easy to work with and Teressa was great. Yasmin was also very helpful as she helped me find my reservation without a print out!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Awesome hotel,My check in was absolutely amazing. Yasmin and Travis are very helpful and attentive. My room is exceptionally clean and the bar and restaurant are nice assets towards the hotel. All the employees seem happy to work here and they all seem to know their positions.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clarion hotel,"Very laid back and welcoming hotel. Has a nice full bar and seating area. Complimentary breakfast. Teresa is a very lovely lady, Yasmin and Travis helped to check us in. Service was impeccable. I really have enjoyed my stay here 👌",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not bad for the area and price but could have been better.,This hotel is located in an industrial area of Denver but not far from downtown. Their free shuttle runs on the hour from the hotel to various locations in central Denver which is great and cost effective. Unfortunately it is difficult to arrange a shuttle pick up because you never communicate directly with the driver and on a few occasions the shuttle never showed up to pick us up. This hotel has a very good breakfast which makes it value very good. Rooms smelt heavily of both smoke and marijuana but that is expected in a less costly hotel.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,It was amazing!,"I came from Canada to see the Jays, the Clarion, especially Jennifer, was so helpful. Shuttle bus to and from ballpark, reasonable fees and the best breakfast I've ever had! Highly recommend. Came with my kids will definitely return!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Stay,"Stayed here with my Mom for a week, everything was great! Had a problem with the A/C, but the staff was quick to fix it! Highly recommend Clarion Hotel! Rooms were nice and clean, restaurant was great, and the location was easy to get to!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice Hotel,"I enjoyed my stay at the clarion. The Manager and staff are very friendly and professional. The room was clean, comes with fridge and microwave very roomy. Shuttle available to all Denver attractions. A bar and restaurant. I would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Super cool staff,Every single staff member I came across had great customer service. Mgt. friendly and informative. Clean room and great price. Great staff for Breakfast too! The free Downtown shuttle was definitely a plus! Shout out to Danielle at the Fnt Desk! A real problem solver! I will absolutely be back! Thanks guys!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Helpful staff,Staff were very helpful and friendly. Stayed at other Clarions and decided to try this one in Denver. Glad I did.  Would definitely stay here again. Rooms are clean and well appointed. Money well spent.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Front Desk service was flat out AWFUL,"First, my fully paid for reservation was cancelled after I was unable to show on at the time I estimated. No call to me was made to ask if I was coming or when, just cancelled. How did I find this out, you ask? Well, I arrived and gave the front desk clerk (Yazmin) my ID, and she proceeded to pull up someone else's reservation and give it to me. She didn't even notice, I had to point it out and only after I looked to make sure the right rate was listed. She then told me that it was the closest reservation to my name (does that even make sense??). She then asked for my confirmation number, and when I found it, she told it was the wrong one... Well, it was the only one I had received. I looked and looked, and then tried to see if I could pull up my reservation on their hotel website... And sure enough, I could! You're telling me she couldn't suggest that or do that herself?? That's crazy. Then, she proceeded to tell me they had cancelled my one night reservation after I didn't show up when I thought I would, and that's why she couldn't find me. Like that's any better? She then finished checking me and gave me the wrong room type. Look, I know I didn't reserve a room somewhere fancy, but having such a terrible attitude is something they can control, let alone having staff that is mildly competent. I will never stay at this place again.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very accommodating,We came here for our honeymoon. When we first arrived there was a problem with the room and the staff was helpful and courteous enough to accommodate and quickly fix our problems. It was greatly appreciated.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very nice stay,"The staff is very friendly and the place is very clean. They remodeled and it looks amazing on the inside and out, you also can’t beat being smoker friendly. I would recommend to anyone who wants to stay in Colorado for the week.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Returning Customers,"My boyfriend and I stay here everytime we are in the Denver area. Super close to everything like downtown, good local eats, and dispos. Theresa and Travis were quick and efficient at checking us in. They stayed smiling and helped us with our online booking. Great hotel with great staff.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,$tevenbenav,Check in was wonderful. Travis and Jennifer are very knowledgeable and emphatic. Room is nice and clean. Shuttle service is a perk. Front office manager is on point and very nice. I would definitely return to this hotel. Overall stay is a ten for sure.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Honeymoon,"We stayed at the Clarion Denver for our honeymoon, we came to Denver for the cannabis and the Clarion has smoking rooms. The staff was so helpful and nice. Greg K at the front desk was amazing, he even let my husband borrow a jacket since we didn't pack for the couple of cold days we had here. Such a sweet man. Teresa at the front desk was also very helpful and so nice. We had a great visit and would definitely stay here again! 😊",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very disappointing,"Location difficult.  Public transport inaccessible.  Told shuttle service provided was ‘on the hour’ only and could not be booked an advance. Staff disinterested and not approachable. No customer service. Rooms needed new soft furnishings - smoky smells still pertain. On the plus side, at least we had the Village Inn next door in which to eat.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Difficult access; slow elevators, outdated equipment","This place is in need of a major overhaul. It can't do much about the roads around it. GPS took us through a lot to get from here to downtown and back. But it could fix somethings: only two of the three elevators were working, resulting in long waits. OTOH, the doors closed very quickly, and didn't seem to react to a hand trying to stop them. The AC in the room was very noisy, such that we turned it off to try to sleep. The faucets in the sink and the tub were difficult to pull into the ""on"" position and should either be re-worked or replaced.  And I don't know what was going on the night we stayed there, but we encountered five different dogs on the elevators between arrival, coming down for b'fast and checking out. I also felt what I thought was ""left-over"" smoke in the room, although I was assured it was a smoke-free hotel and had been for awhile. Juice machine in breakfast room was ""out of order"". Needs some tender loving care.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clarion,My trip here was nice. The staff are friendly and helpful. The Rooms are clean. It's a quick drive to downtown. And if you don't have a car the hotel Van's will take you downtown. I will come back again.Thanks,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Firearms Historian,"Very nice. Staff very helpful and  accommodating. Room clean and comfortable. Jasmine at front desk was very helpful with checking in and getting room close to elevator for my husband. Also, my husband misplaced his cell phone and Jasmine tolerated my calling it about 40 times before we thought to call the front desk to see if they might have it!!  She’s a gem!All in all a great place to stay. Very pet friendly, also!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place to stay,Great place to stay comfortable beds nice views nice hotel staff would recommend to anybody very quiet and peaceful they have a shuttle service which is great for getting around town this place is very helpful they have a restaurant inside the place and a little snack bar room for a quick bite,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Stay Here,I have an exceptional stay the front desk employees were fast friendly and helpful. The rooms were excellent Lee well cap very clean comfortable. The restaurant a very good selection food for dining. The management staff was always there to moment's notice. And Jolene is the bomb definitely visit her at the bar.,5

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Walk in,Had a great experience front desk was awesome Travis and yasmine are amazing. Clean rooms overall amazing experience will be back ! Breakfast was amazing loved how willing the staff was to go above and beyond,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pleasure trip,There was heavy construction all around the area which made access a bit frustrating. The restaurant was closed but they did provide a full breakfast that was quite satisfactory. The room was clean and comfortable. I would stay here again.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Get a fan at check in or they will run out.,"I was stuck  here for 2 weeks working, although after day three I tried to find someplace else, all close by hotels were full.   I will first mention the good things about this place.  Breakfast was always stocked well, and variety of choices, including pancakes and waffles.  The bed was a king size memory foam that I would have loved to fall into every night after 12 hour days.  Greg at the front desk was always very cheerful, professional and helpful, to the limits he was stuck within. The gals that work the front desk seemed to spend more time on their phones, or just sitting, letting him handle everything.  So there, thats the good.  Lets really focus on what made this stay unbareable.  The heat.  Yes, the heat in the rooms.  They refuse to turn on the air conditioning, knowing that rooms are well above 80 degrees, no matter what floor, or what the outside weather is like.  Even during a 29 degree outdoor temp, it was almost 80.  Most of the time it teetered at the 90 degree mark.  I bought an indoor outdoor thermometer to document this, and photos are being provided. Management's answer to the over the top heat was to hand out fans to the guests and open the emergency exit doors so air could circulate. (Dangerous disregard for the guests safety I would say) I was on the 9th floor, where smoking is permitted, but remember, Denver is recreational weed friendly, and boy or boy, was the 9th floor recreating, ALL THE TIME.  The smell would seep through the door cracks, and the adjoining room has a door as well, so you get a double whammy of weed if you have a recreational user next door. My room was a corner on the  East side, nearest the highway. Even with the windows closed (which you couldnt do because of the heat) the sound was always loud, and added to the inability to get a good nights sleep. It was much worse during rush hour of course, but even at 2 am  you could hear the racing cars and rumbling big rigs rushing by.  The room was in need of a good cleaning, and it would have been nice to have a recliner or lounge chair in the corner to relax in, there was plenty of room for one, but this hotel gives you the bare minimums.  It had a nice shower head, with multiple settings, but the shower head wouldn't adjust so I could use any other setting, and it was caked with hard water deposits.  Water flashed from ice cold to scalding hot, with no in between, so showering was an event in itself.  The tub drained very slowly, taking over 2 hours, and you stood in dirty water as it filled while you showered.  Yuck. The ceiling had obvious water damage to it, and a quick spackle job is all they felt was needed to make it appear repaired.  One of the cups that was provided was burnt with what was obviously a cigarette being extinguished at one time or another.The day before check out I found a surprise additional nights charge on my credit card, which I had to jump hoops through to get them to remove.  On a Thursday night the lobby was filled with guys, quite drunk, with music blasting from the bar into the lobby and it seemed like I was entering a frat party.  Staff was be bopping around to the music just as much. The middle elevator was put out of service a few times instead of being fixed as it would partially open the door, jump and not stop properly on the correct floor, leaving a good 2-3 inch gap between elevator and floor. A couple of suggestions for the traveler considering this hotel.  Bring your own fans, (I got one from the desk and bought one myself and it wasnt enough) stay on any floor other that the 9th if you don't want to get a contact high or have to worry about impromptu drug testing from work, ask for a room on the north side of the building where it will still be hot, just not AS hot.  Or save yourself the headache and stay somewhere else.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,No Air Conditioning! ,"😡 No air conditioning, not joking. First hotel I’ve ever been to that doesn’t have air conditioning. They say it should be on maybe next month. 🤷🏻‍♂️ This is a deal breaker for me. 😡 Slow check in, front desk worker(s) seem like they could use more training. Also, the females were not very friendly. 😡 Purple T.V.😡 Can’t open window more then an inch or two for outside cool air relief.😡 Hygiene amenities are generic and cheap. 😡 Outside hotel look is old and rundown looking. 🙂 Inside hotel look is fresh, modern and chic. 🙂 Bed is memory foam and comfortable. 🙂 Large room. 🙂 Free Shuttle.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,This hotel is dumb,"I've stayed here four times in the past year.  There won't be a fifth.  Started with not having the room I reserved for.  Whatever.  Description says it's newly renovated.  True, if by newly renovated they mean they changed the name from Quality Inn to The Clarion and remodeled their restaurant.  Other than that, not so much.  They have about 400 rooms.  Internet is frustrating and can't handle all the guests.  Download speed is about 5mbps, Upload about 1 mbps, but their pings are all over the place from 5ms to over 4000ms.  Don't expect to do much more than be able to check Email.  They need to get with the times like a lot of the Quality Inns (the sister hotels) have recently with much higher up and download speeds in the 20s-40s.Then there's the rooms themselves.  They're okay in terms of the look, but as some examples of apparently ""newly renovated"", there's more water pressure in a spring drizzle than in their showers and similarly, the sink was struggling to do more than drip.  The mini fridge, though cranked to high, cooled to about room temperature.  And speaking of room temperature, their HVAC system is ridiculous.  It's a central unit, not individual to each room and the system can only pump heat or AC, never both, meaning if they've set their main system to heat, you can't get AC and if they've set it to AC, you can't get heat.  The room temperature hovers around 84 degrees and since the system is set to heat, you can't cool the room.  The only option is to open the window the six inches it allows you to and hope the wind blows into your room.  Then there's trying to sleep with all the noise from the traffic on the highway that's beside the hotel...because the window is open...because you can't cool the room.It's really dumb.  If you know anything about Denver weather, you know one day it will be 80 degrees, the next it will be 20 degrees so not having the individual option to set your room temperature on heat or AC is just....baffling.  They have 9 floors so the higher you go, the hotter the rooms are.Lastly, you can no longer leave a review with Choice Hotels on their site unless they send you an Email after your stay, however it says they ""MAY"" send you an Email to leave a review, not they ""WILL.""  I've been staying at Choice Hotels for many years and don't get these Emails, so I went with Trip Advisor on this one...so you've been ""Advised.""",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,They will throw u for mistakes THEY MAKE,"WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! HOW DANG HARD IS IT TO JUST DO THE JOB YOU ARE PAID TO DO????????I have NEVER IN MY LIFE EXPERIENCED treatment like this in my life!!! & no matter how high up you contact NOBODY CARED!!!! I got a response saying to contact back & they would make it right. So we did because was coming back in a few weeks BUT when we contacted back, they offered NOTHING AT ALL!!! Staff is AWFUL HERE!!! We made reservations MONTHS IN ADVANCE, upon arrival was told no clean rooms as we watched SO MANY PEOPLE CHECK IN & GET A ROOM!!! Hotel clerk actually canceled our reservations while we was standing outside waiting on them to clean our rooms. But that not even kicker to it: She handed to my 16yr old daughter. She wasn’t even adult enough to give to an adult & when asked why we was canceled due to THEIR mistake, her response was “I don’t have to deal with this” we waited for over 3 hours for them to get our room cleaned, then they threw us out rather than clean a room???? Offered NO HELP TO FIND ANOTHER ROOM!!! I will continue to report this hotel to every possible website. & every person I know. We come to Denver 3-4 times a yr to visit for last 20yrs & NEVER EVER had ANYTHING like this b4. I feel as if we completely discriminated against, there is NO OTHER POSSIBLE REASON for they way we was treated. Apparently they are unaware or just don’t care how 1 bad customer service experience can hurt your business. As a business owner myself I know 1 bad customer experience will be heard. That 1 customer tells 20 people & if those 20 people tell just 3 people each you now have AT LEAST now 61 people heard just verbal that doesn’t include how many people you can reach through sites like this, Yelp, etc. I could go on & on about this place but this alone was HORRIBLE enough. Thankful there are few other super awesome hotels that ACTUALLY CARE about customers! There is a reason you make reservations it advance?!?!?!? There are really no words that I can use to describe our experience. We had a family of 4 & had to search town late at night to find a room. From what I read from other reviews seems they are overly happy to throw you out. AGAIN: HOW DANG HARD IS IT TO JUST DO THE JOB YOU ARE PAID TO DO????????",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Monica at front desk,"My visit started off with Monica at the front desk being EXTREMELY  rude . I was told I couldn't check in until 3 ( I arrived at 1:30 ),however she started checking in other guest at 2 . So I waited until 3 . I had requested a smoking room and none were available.  I specifically told her my check out day would be Sunday March 10 th .On the 9th my key wouldn't work any longer. So I went to the front desk to inquire as to why and Monica very abruptly told me I was to check out today Saturday March 9th. I explained to her that was not correct and I would need it for one more night . She quoted me the price for the room which was going to be $10 higher than I had paid all week and I explained to her I don't have my wallet on me because I'm locked out of my room. At that point she tells me she feels it's necessary for me to stay elsewhere. Mind you I am very sick because of the weather here. At this point she told me I had until 1:30 to ""GET OUT "". I proceeded to tell her I had no ride and nowhere else to stay for the night at which point she proceeded to tell me she didn't care it's not her problem I needed to get out.This person has no business and being at a front desk at a hotel dealing with customers. She has no customer service skills at all.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Overall a disappointment,"I’ll start with the good. On the exterior the hotel seems nice enough. The lobby is clean and well decorated and the staff were very kind. Now the bad... It started with my mother-in-law’s room. We had to call the front desk just to be instructed how to open the door, apparently you’re supposed to pull the handle up and pull up on the door to make it open. The luggage cart was too large to fit through the door so it made unloading our luggage very difficult. Not to mention the luggage cart barely fit into the elevator to begin with. Move into my room and there was a whole mess of problems. In the bathroom there was mold in the shower and the sink was constantly dripping. There was a hole in the door that was covered in tape and painted back over. The cups left for you in the room were dirty. The coffee cups had remnants of coffee s I’ll and the drinking glasses had grime and dirt on them as well. The decorating in our room looked no different than the La Quinta compared to my mother-in-law’s room. The beds were so firm, I left with my back hurting even more than when we checked in. I know not to expect much when staying at a hotel last minute, however I do not feel this room is worth the almost $100/night rate they charge. I’m not sure this hotel is bad enough to deserve a 1-star rating however I know it doesn’t deserve a 2-star.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Yasmine is awesome,"Front staff member Yasmine was awesome!  So helpful and patient with all of my questions.  She went above and beyond,  trying to help me find a venue in Denver I was inquiring about!  The manager was also so very kind and helpful. I'll stay here everytime I visit Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Worst hotel room ,ever","I have stayed in hotels from NY to NOLA to Colorado and this might have been THE worst night ever. I could deal with the outdated room, the random screws sticking out of the wall holding up the falling mirrors, even the broken lights and exposed electric. But after returning to our room at 2 am after a show downtown, we found that our room had to be in the 90's and there was no way to open a window or cool the room down. Turning on the AC only caused more hot air to blow from the vent. Around 4 am I was ready to go sleep in my van in the parking lot in 20-degree weather instead of sleep in this room. Sleep never came for me and we packed up and left the moment my husband woke from a brief nap. The sink was also beyond dangerous. Anything besides cold was scorching hot - thank god we didn't have kids with us. Wasn't just our room either, as we caught another guest who said the hotel was aware of the issue as they brought him up a fan after he complained. He could crack his window though - we were not so lucky. We only ended up here because it was the ONLY hotel with smoking rooms we could find... never again. Choice Hotels should be ashamed of putting their name on this property...",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don't risk your life,"The hotel has issues with heating on most floors.  They cannot regulate the heating so they are propping the emergency exit doors open and telling guests to leave their windows open in the middle of the winter.  On other floors there is no heat and they give you space heaters.  This poses a huge fire threat.This hotel is asking for a major catastrophe, don't be there when it happens.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Ok,"The place was clean and had a pretty decent location. The shuttle to downtown was great and so was staff. However, like other complaints, the heat in the room is awful and there is no fan. I’m always cold and I had to sleep on top of the covers sweating in winter. I’d suggest leaving fans in the rooms at this stage for guests.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,1st time Colorado trip,"My bed was hard as a rock!! Now everyone else’s beds had memory foam but mine. (We had 2 rooms, 4 beds) Rooms were extremely warm. You can’t adjust the temperature in your room. The unit just makes noise, does nothing. We even kept our windows cracked & it was to warm. Breakfast on the other hand is quite good with a large variety of just about anything you could want for breakfast & yes it’s free. It is 420 friendly but they offer smoking & nonsmoking",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Short Staffed and Not Prepared,"This hotel was short staffed at every position.  The restaurant needed wait staff, the front desk had one person working with a line of 8 people, housekeeping did the bare minimum.  The hotel was full, but management could have done a much better job of preparing.  The room was average and the food was not great.  The HVAC system would not allow you to get the room below 80 degrees.  The elevator was noisy making you wonder if the cables would hold.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Oldschool Hotel really nice,"my stay was beautiful. a spacious and clean room with a desk that helped me a lot to keep working during my visit.A friendly and helpful staff. If some day i  have the opportunity to return, I will for sure",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Hotel,It was an excellent experience to stay at this hotel.the price is cheap and they offer you many services.I love the lobby and the bar is newly remodeled.I will definitely be back in summer I can not wait,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Second visit to Denver!,"This is my second time in Denver this year and I choose to stay at the same hotel due to my last experience.  However now the hotel is in different ownership! Still had an awesome time, every worker I encountered was friendly, and check in and out went quick and smoothly! Free parking! Smoke friendly! Close to downtown Denver! Only issue we had was the fridge was plugged into a bad outlet and we didn't notice till the next day so some food went to waste. Still would stay here again in future trips back out to Denver. Sweet views of the mountains as well!!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great value - excellent location,Front desk staff was super friendly upon my arrival. Restaurant was recently renovated and looked very modern. Shuttle service in downtown was extremely helpful and made the overall experience much better. Centrally located for all of my business needs. Free hot breakfast in the morning was well prepared. First time staying and look forward to future trips to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,As if you were paying to be in a Breaking Bad episode,"Do not stay here.Three are tweakers in the parking lot at all hours of the night.The entire hotel stinks of weed.Front desk staff are rude and unprofessional.Only one working elevator in a 10 story hotel.Everything is either dirty, worn out, broken or under construction.Spend you money downtown on a hotel that doesn't suck donkey balls.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Enjoyed Our Stay At The Clarion,"My family and I have stayed at the Clarion several times.  The location offers easy access and shuttle service to many activities. I have always found the hotel to be clean, I feel safe staying here, the staff is friendly and helpful. An affordable option in a good location.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Nice for the price, but some issues","The room was cheap enough, and available at the last minute. However, the heat in my room did not work - I turned it up to 78 degrees, and the AC kicked in which only served to cool the room down! Definitely not great when you're staying in the mountains. I decided to sleep under a couple of blankets, because there was a continual line at the front desk, and I didn't want to wait to get my room reassigned (I had just driven in from Salt Lake City and was exhausted).  Also, the remote for my TV didn't work.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,2nd Time Staying,"The hotel isn't the nicest, but my husband is a cigarette smoker so it's nice for him to smoke in the room. Our kids always get there own room and there floor doesn't smell of cigarettes or weed. Staff is always friendly. Only downfall is the bar closes early an there is NO late night food around.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Clean Room Comfortable Bed, Had a Great Time!","Mid range chain hotel. I was booked into a clean room with a comfortable bed. Friendly and helpful staff.Acceptable but weak wifi signal. Complementary hot breakfast. Near a dispensary and they even give you a coupon. As some reviewers have said it was a little warm and lots of traffic noise with the open window, but I really enjoyed my stay. It was very clean, the beds were nice and they had a real breakfast, eggs bacon, biscuits, gravy... Would go back and recommend to friends and family.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Too hot!,We stayed two nights and could not get the room temperature below 78...too warm to sleep comfortably!  The front desk said the AC was turned off and to open a window. Since the hotel is right next to I-25 opening a window meant lots of traffic noise.  The breakfast was very good.  We will not stay there our next time in Denver.,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Have double what you will be paying for the room available,"Nice hotel rooms. Restaurant was closed. The front desk staff is nice and friendly but has no idea how to answer questions correctly. Also, be prepared for them to hold double the amount you are paying for your hotel room. They charge an incidental hold which is the entire amount of your stay prior to check in, then they charge you the entire amount for your stay upon check in. For myself, it was a one night stay so it worked out fine, however, a woman checking in at the same time as us was charged twice for all 5 nights which over drafted her account so be aware to have AT LEAST double what you are paying for the hotel room available plus additional funds for your trip. I am three days post check out with my incidental hold still not refunded.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very Bad Experience,"Made reservations on the road.  When we checked in the room and hallways were hot, no AC.  The front desk told us it wouldn’t be working that night and offered fans.  My wife has MS and we told them absolutely not.  We checked out and told them it would have been nice if they had told us before unloading everything.  Also, asked about other hotels, they were less than helpful.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,One night in Denver,"I'll start off with some good.  The front desk seemed to be interested in helping where they could.  The Manager on Duty seemed to be very friendly and knowledgeable, but the rest of the staff seemed either under trained or slow. Check in process was mostly efficient and easy. When we got to the room it was cold, probably because the heat didn't work and the window was leaning inwards.  There was a huge gap around the window that let a large draft into the room.  I managed to shove something in the window that helped keep it more sealed and kept some of the air out (it was about 35 degrees outside).Also had some food I put into the small refrigerator, well I didn't notice that it was turned to the coldest temperature and it froze my food solid.  Also, there was no tv remote in the room. I did call down about that and they brought a new one to the room fairly quickly.One of the best things about the hotel is that they provide a shuttle on the hour into downtown Denver.  However, during the ride to downtown the shuttle driver was answering the phone on speaker to talk with people about his pick ups and drop offs (which is fine).  However, he was also answering phone calls from other people.  One conversation was with an employee not working, because the restaurant was closed.  Why was the restaurant closed?  Well, because there was sewage backing up into the restaurant and I, along with every guest in the shuttle, heard all about it.  I won't stay at this hotel again because it badly needs to be renovated and the experience was one of the worst I've had at a hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Dirty, sheets that don't fit and more","This was dreadful, although the staff did seem to be interested it was a disaster from the start. Two rooms on the 5th floor, the floor looked as though it had not been cleaned for ages, the room badly fitted sheets with burn holes, the floor must have been the same brush just did not get used, the other room was not a lot different, both smelt of smoking. We were moved and promised better, it was not the case. We were told that new bedding had been ordered but it did not fit properly, we stayed the night and suffered it but never again.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Amtrak Vacation Hotel- 1st in Series of Reviews- Denver/Yellowstone,"This is the first of several reviews I am writing about our Amtrak National Parks Vacation from Denver to Grand Junction/Salt Lake/ Yellowstone/ Salt Lake.  If you are considering buying this package, I heartily recommend your reading the complete series of reviews which I will number in sequence of our experience.  If you are just interested in the hotel, this should be helpful to you as well.Lipstick on a Pig describes this hotel most succinctly.  This is, from the looks of it, a 60s-70s era building set in a crummy part of Denver.  It was previously a Quality Inn or Hotel and there seems to have been some hipster type cosmetic changes to the lobby and rooms to try to bring it up to Clarion standards.  I see people praising the pool area, which of course was shut down at this time of year for us- but I would compare it to a pool at someone's older house.  This is NOT a nice pool area for a large group of hotel guests.  The car rental kiosk was occupied by a man playing Arabic pop music.  The restaurant at midday was host to the entire housekeeping crew sitting around having social time... not kidding- about 12 people shooting the breeze and having a merry old time in the ""public"" area of the hotel.  The elevators all reek of marijuana.  I jokingly asked a younger couple on the elevator if everyone was smoking pot in their rooms and they replied ""yes, pretty sure they are""  even though the hotel has no smoking signs everywhere.  The newish furniture in the rooms has already been dinged up by the clientele here, but the beds were decent.  Our room had a bathtub but I couldn't use the tub because the drain plug was broken. Faucet fixtures feel like they are going to fall off in your hands. Shower head sprayed an uneven stream- probably due to mineral buildup I would venture. Tv remote control was filthy as well as the outlet switches which probably date back to the original incarnation of the building.  The staff's attitude at the front desk was strange- almost as though they are jailkeepers and not hospitality hosts/hostesses.  The elevators sputtered up and down, vibrating as they went- with some kind of rock facing on the lower half which looked incredibly tacky.  There is a trick to getting into your room, even if your key miraculously decides to work.  One night while I was sitting outside my room waiting for my husband to get a working key from downstairs, a girl walked up to the elevator and started crying bizarrely to someone on her cellphone loudly... ""I'm bleeding from my.... and nobody here cares.  I've had it with this.  I'm getting another hotel."" The two good aspects of the hotel were the hot breakfast served in the dated, sticky tabled restaurant, and the comfort level of the beds which I assume are a newish nod to the Clarion brand.  Another plus is the existence of a shuttle to the train station, which is probably the reason Amtrak Vacations still does business with this location.  But, although the shuttle drives seem to be decent folks overall, the shuttle itself is a well worn, sprung spring kind of vehicle.  The overall feel of the experience is that nobody really cares about the paying customer- they are there to take your money and do as little as possible while filling the rooms with partiers and two nighters. So... the upside of this hotel is that we did not spend much time there. Amtrak Vacations books you for two nights here at the beginning of this package.  MY ADVICE is that you would be better served to stay at one of the hotels close to the 16th Street Mall, like the Hampton Inn if you are looking for a better class of clientele and cleanliness.  There is a free shuttle that runs up and down this street to the Capital area with many hotel and restaurant options.  Union Station is right on this line.  There should be no need to take a sketchy van ride from another part of town.  Big, big fail for Amtrak vacations.  Shame on you for putting up unsuspecting package guests here.  We did not expect the Ritz Carlton, but would have gladly paid the difference for even a Holiday Inn Express level stay.If you are reading reviews only to judge the suitability of this hotel for a stay, then you have been warned.  It is pretty nasty.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Will not be back,"My husband and I stayed here for a little vacation with plans to go to the Broncos/Chiefs game. At first glance, the property was nice and clean and we were able to get into our room a little early, but that's were the good part stopped. The elevators were horrible. Pretty sure one of them didn't work at all. The middle one was VERY shaky and they took forever to arrive. One guest told us that he had been waiting over 10 minutes for an elevator and housekeeping told us we couldn't use the stairwell because it would set off the fire alarm. The door to our room, and a couple others that we noticed, was very hard to open, we actually thought it was locked from the inside it was so difficult. Once in the non-smoking room, we were greeted with an overwhelming smell of marijuana. We don't smoke and weren't necessarily mad about the smell, but didn't expect our non-smoking room to smell so incredibly strong as if somebody just smoked a joint before we opened the door. The bedding was weird and hard to figure out. I seemed to be a top sheet, comforter and then top sheet??  Turned out a mess in the am. The free breakfast was good. The bar was VERY lacking. It operated at odd hours and definitely not the hours posted. The bartender was very cooky and friendly to some and downright mean to others. Two gentlemen came in around 10 pm and were told the bar was closing at 10:30. They said the website said it didn't close till 2 am and the bartender told them very rudely that he didn't care and was closing at 10:30. The customers said they would make sure to give him a bad review online and he went and got the manager and had the men thrown our for ""threatening"" him. It was VERY uncomfortable.  The windows were filthy to the point of not being able to see well out of them.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Sports package gone wrong with the strong aroma of Marijuanna,"I bought a sports package through your website that included a $50 voucher to use for food and beverage at your establishment.  When I checked in no one knew anything about it the $50 voucher and referred me to the corporate number.  The corporate number provided referred me to member services.  Member services was not open until 8am the next morning ~ next morning I called again.  They said the issue had to be resolved at the hotel...  I went down to resolve the issue and the gals at the front desk told me that there would not be a manager until 9am I went down at 10am and the director said that she could not help, however she would get the front desk manager.  The front desk manager then tried to find the promotion and did not know anything about it?  She said she would get a hold of the corporate office and that should take about 20 minutes.  After calling she then opened a drawer at the front desk and handed me $50 worth of vouchers to use at the hotel restaurant area.  She also said she would credit my rewards account for the trouble.  O.K. ~ Finally.  Around noon, I go downtown watch the baseball game come back to the hotel go to use my vouchers and the gal working tells me that she can’t use them!!!  I order tell her that I will clear it up at the front desk in the morning.  Next morning, I go to check out, show the bill to the front desk after breakfast and I am told that they can’t take the money off, but she will give me more reward points to make up for the $50 in vouchers?!  I showed her the charges were for the in-house restaurant, she responded by saying that she would issue enough reward points to be the equivalent of the $50.  If I would have known that I would not have ordered anything the night before!  I then transfer hotels stay in town for a few more days check the balance and see 2000 points ~ hmmm O.K. It looks like I received points for the nights that I booked at 10 points for every dollar that I spent ~ basically what I booked.  The other lip service points for not knowing what your own program is, not honoring the program once you figure out that ""your guest"" was telling you the truth and then promising more points ~ what a terrible experience.  As I write this review verifying my points, so I can accurately respond on here, I am disconnected while being on hold for 8 minutes.  Call back and the phone is answered right away to customer service.  I want to verify that I understand the points correctly; I am transferred to member services and once again on hold.  Member services tells me that the hotel gave me credit for my trouble, however for some reason I did not receive credit (points) for the stay.  They finally fix the credit points for the stay.  I then have the pleasure to share this experience with the world.  The communication at the hotel between whoever designed the package should have communicated this to the entire front desk, so they could have served the customer and made it a great experience.  Breakfast in the morning was good ~ that I am sure is important as the hotel had the strong aroma of marijuana throughout.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Came for a concert,"We booked through TripAdvisor, stayed for two nights. Breakfast is excellent. Not just muffins and cold cereal here! While those things were available there was also biscuits and gravy, sausage and bacon, eggs and pancakes. Waffles. Juices and coffees, teas. Fresh fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese..... So much good stuff! The staff is very helpful and while I thought we had a shower that wouldn’t divert water to the shower head and called to tell them so, the maintenance guys came up and showed me how it worked. Guess that was my bad, they were awesome. If you are looking for a five star place where everything is top of the line and all the staff has rods up their butts then this is not your place. If you are looking for a clean place with good folks around and a fun atmosphere then this is it. Definitely going to be our go to when in Denver. Thanks for the stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,its ok,"loved the pool ,the accommodations 'were fair , we checked in and had our room key ,we walked in and thay said we have to change rooms , we were put in a room with no balcony, no sliding glass door , I spasificly  as for a room on the ground and we got put on 2nd floor , my husb is a handicap person and no accommodations' for him . the night crew was rude to me when I ask for a comment card ,but we loved the breakfast it was so good ,that's the only thing we liked about this place",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,It was okay...,"We stayed here because we needed somewhere that was pet friendly and wanted somewhere that was weed friendly. The entire lobby smelled like weed (could be a bonus, could be a deal breaker). Front desk staff were very friendly, efficient and gave us coupons to the nearest dispensary. Location was great. Could use updating and housekeeping could do a better job of cleaning the place. Continental breakfast was very meh. All in all it was a very average stay that met our two most important qualifiers. Not a deal breaker but there is some work that could be done. Overall I feel like the entire experience was what you would expect from the most stereotyped stay at a weed friendly hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst reservation I've ever made.,"I ended up not even staying in this hotel. When I tried to book through tripadvisors partner getaroom, before I booked I called them and told them I wanted 2 beds and a smoking room. They told me since there was no option on their site to ask for a smoking room that I could book the most expensive room they had then call them and ask them to make the change to a smoking room and the hotel would accommodate my request. The most expensive room they had was for 1 double king size bed (which again when I called I told them 2 beds would be a must.) I called the hotel and they told me they could make the change and there would be no problems. I called multiple times after to confirm the changes to a 2 bed smoking room were made and every time I called they insured me that I would be getting what I wanted. I even called the day before I got there to check in. When I get there to check in there is trash all through the parking lot. Lobby was filthy and I speak to the lady at the desk and she tells me I can only have a nonsmoking 1 bed double king sized room. I explained I had called multiple times and was suppose to be getting 2 beds and a smoking room. They told me they were full as it was a weekend and there was nothing they could do for me. Refused to refund my cash on the spot, so I ended up having to shell out enough money initially to get 2 hotel rooms as I ended up staying someplace else. Then to make matters worse, When speaking to getaroom (TripAdvisors 3rd party booking agency) to get a refund the hotel tried to claim that I checked in and did stay at their hotel when I did not. Had to argue with them through 2 phone calls (which both were over an hour long) to get a full refund. This was the worst hotel experience I've ever had in my life. I will never use TripAdvisor again to reserve a room. They say misery loves company, so If you like dealing with problems, horrible customer service, a dirty property, no guarentees, etc etc... Then TripAdvisor and Clarion Hotel Denver Central is the way you should go. As they will make all your entire experience a complete nightmare.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,At least provide sheets that fit the bed.,"I booked this room as an express deal on Priceline. If I had a choice I would not stay here again. The customer service with the check-in was great and the girls were super friendly. This hotel provided fast elevator service. They also provide a local shuttle for the Pepsi Center which we thought was nice. Unfortunately once we got in our room I instantly felt ""icky"" and didn't want to touch anything. I just had a feeling some things hadn't been thoroughly cleaned (like the carpet, bedside table and toilet seat). The king size bed was VERY comfortable and soft but had these awful sheets on it that kept coming off and wouldn't stay on any of the corners. Prepare for some noise from the parking lots, we heard quite a few car alarms in the early hours of the morning. But honestly if you're looking for a place to lay your head and don't care about fanciness then book your stay here.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NOT A BAD PLACE,I had a one night stay here while on business.The outside is nice looking and the hotel is accessible from the highway.There is an outdoor pool with nice seating area.My room was OK (not outstanding).  It appeared to have been cleaned in a rush. . found candy and candy wrappers on the floor.  I was very impressed with the shower pressure and abundance of hot water.Read the on site restaurant menu before dinner. . .only to find an appetizer menu was all that was available.  Luckily there is a great place to eat right next door.staff was very friendly and the free shuttle to downtown was a huge bonus.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Outstanding stay,"I had an incredible stay at the Clarion. The hotel met my expectations and needs. Despite its location, you can easily use Uber or Lyft or take the free shuttle going to 16th street/union station. The room is spacious and decent. A Little bit noisy being close to rail tracks and highways. Other than that, i thoroughly enjoyed my stay from the moment i checked in. I loved the near by diner ""Village Inn"". They serve all day breakfast that is really tasty and their pies are to die for.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Watch your bank account!,"I read the mixed reviews of this hotel and really thought the complainers were likely just whiners.  I really should have taken them more seriously.I will start with the biggest problem in case you don't read any further.  We booked directly with Choice Hotels so there was no one involved in the transaction other than this hotel and us.  We had a one week stay.  I believe the hotel put a hold on our card for one night initially, as is normal.  By our third day, our card was declined when we tried to buy gas...we looked into it and the hotel had charged our card for the week's stay (over $800) and also had a pending charge for nearly $700, tying up $1500.  The pending charge stayed on our card for FOUR DAYS.  The hotel was never able to adequately explain why.  Their explanation ranged from ""I don't know why that happened, I don't know why we charged your card at 2AM"", ""That's what we do, we always secure payment"" ""We should have only taken one night then the balance"" to ""We use a third party and sometimes this happens, I don't know if we don't have it set up right or why it happens"" In spite of requesting a call from the hotel manager, four days later, I have heard NOTHING.The other bothersome, though not as serious problems were:I made reservations two months in advance for a mountain view, king room (extra cost) and called to confirm that as well as to ask for the 6th floor the morning of our arrival.  Upon our arrival, we were given a 7th floor, queen, street side room...that smelled dank and smoky due to its proximity to the smoking and 420 rooms above.  It took two days for us to get a better room, though we never got a mountainside room nor a refund.The rooms were in disrepair, both had lose toilet seats and torn comforters, the queen room sheets and mattress pad didn't fit so it came lose every night, the showers were mildewy, one tub didn't drain when showering, and neither tv remote worked well (we thing the batteries were low).Wifi was so spotty as to be nearly useless.We didn't receive housekeeping one day and had to call for towels.Our room key had to be reprogrammed about five times...which required a trip to the lobby.  They sent maintenance to repair it, but it didn't completely eliminate the problem.The front desk seemed to be very poorly managed.  No one seemed to know what was going on and we got a lot of misinformation and noticed a lack of any care for the problems.The elevators are so janky they're on the verge of scary.  One didn't work till our last day there. There are open joints in wiring over the pool table, etc.  The fire doors in the stairwells are propped open.  I bet code enforcement would have a heyday.  The back door near the pool is never locked so its easy to come in that way... On the bright side, the beds were comfortable and the pillows were nice...They have free USA Today papers in the lobby.  It was convenient to be able to get our rental car in the Avis location off the lobby. The location was convenient to the interstates (and the rail yard if you were interested in hopping a train to make a quick get away from the Clarion Central.)I am ordinarily a pretty easy going guest.  I think my real issue with this hotel is the fact that there were so many problems that were not made up for with effort or attitude or items on the plus side...AND the manager apparently does NOT care.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Short Vacation,"The hotel could use some updating and serious cleaning.  Would consider staying there again. Centrally located easy to get to anyplace.  Staff was helpful and courteous especially Betty Martinez, Guest Relations Officer.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"New mgmt letting staff & paying guests down, want a response please from management!","New management is letting paying guests & staff down. We decided to eat at the restaurant (we were 8 ppl and had 3 rooms) after flying in from Europe & the East Coast in the early evening. There were only 2 ppl working bar, restaurant & kitchen? Service was sweet, very professional (Jenna & Melanie did their best & were great) but with only 2 ppl working everything with 30 customers, it was completely chaotic. Food arrived 1.5 hr later & dad is diabetic so we were very concerned. By the time we got a few orders, we canceled others as needed to go to bed! Don't think we should have paid full price for everything as management should have staffed more ppl to not only support paying customers but their own staff. As I was talking to the front desk this morning, who were really, really nice, another regular customer to the hotel was waiting to complain about rude staff. Seems like you guys have missed the mark under new management and I would like to speak with someone. Thank you",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not worth it!,"We stayed for two nights at the end of a wonderful 2 week trip to Yellowstone. This was by far the worst hotel we stayed at. First it is no longer a Quality Inn, but a Clarion. The front desk was not very professional looking; died purple hair, nose and lip rings, growing out bleached hair. Nice enough, but not what I look for at the front desk of a hotel. We could not even get into our room and had to have the cards re-keyed. I talked with someone in the elevator who was on his way to get his redone for the 5th time. The room was OK, nothing special. But when we took a shower the tub did not drain. A 15 minute shower and I was standing in 5 inches of water. Also the sink did not drain either. Really frustrating! When we came back to our room after being out all day housekeeping had not remade the bed. Just straightened it. Sorry, but I expect my bed to be remade everyday. The gold bed covering was thrown off in the corner, not even folded and put in the closet. Horrible! The hotel was also smoke friendly. Apparently they had several smoking rooms on the 8th and 9th floors, but you would not know it was only those floors. The whole hotel reeked of weed. I really don't appreciate my 9 and 13 year old getting contact highs. I will never book a hotel in Denver again without verifying that they are completely smoke free. Final nail for this place was when we checked out the final morning, no ""Hope you a had good stay"", ""How was your stay"", nothing. Just a curt Thanks and a blank stare. I do not recommend this place.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,GREAT HOTEL,This is a wonderful hotel with a great staff.  Our check-in went really smoothly and the staff was very welcoming.  My kids really enjoyed their pool and my husband and I really enjoyed the restaurant.  The breakfast had a great selection.  We even used their shuttle to go back and forth to a few restaurants in the area.  GREAT HOTEL!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Glad we went!,"We did read the reviews before staying so we were a little skeptical.  When we arrived there were several people in line ahead of us with one person working the desk.  She was fast and very polite.  It was a peak check in time and the hotel was completely booked, so the fact that we had to wait came as no surprise.  The only time we smelled smoke from either cigarettes or MJ was outside, and there was a faint smell of smoke in the elevator.  The room was fantastic.  Yes, the hotel is old and renovated, but it was comfortable and trendy.  The kitchen is being remodeled so the food available for lunch and dinner is extremely limited.  The pool area is great, as was breakfast.  They had more options than most Choice hotels.  About the only negative was that our room door was really difficult to open.  Luckily when we first arrived a staff member was there to help us get in, and show us how to open it by jiggling the door handle.  I would recommend this hotel for the price.  And, they offer a free shuttle into the city until 10 pm.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Short visit,needed a quick room to stay in that was smoker friendly. Middle elevator was very shaky and the hotel itself was very smoke filled and smelled of marijuana. Ice Machine was moldy by the drain. I did not feel the safest with a few people in the lobby very shady I stayed in my room rather than coming down to the lobby area after 10.,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Inconsistent,"Let me start by saying that we stayed at this hotel two nights, about 3 nights apart. We chose it because it had a rental car office in the hotel, which made it convenient for our trip plan. The hotel got good reviews, so we booked it. We arrived on our first day earlier than expected. Our room was not ready, but the desk people were super friendly and allowed us to go ahead and eat breakfast. We even took the shuttle around Denver, some, to see the area. By the time we got back our room was ready. It did smell smoky, which surprised us in a NON smoking hotel, but we turned the AC up and the stench went away. The room was clean and comfortable. The hallways need updating but we noticed that the elevators, pool area and lobby looked updated. That evening was stormy, and we were tired, so we decided to eat downstairs in the bar/restaurant area. That was our first big disappointment. The owner and his son were trying to find enough food to satisfy the people who were coming downstairs to order. We asked about wine, but they basically only had a couple of types of beers, and whiskey. They had Chardonnay, but no reds, so we passed. We ordered cheese fries and steak sliders. The cheese fries arrived, but were cold. We sent them back and then they brought the slider (one) that we were going to share. We never got any more cheese fries. We left unsatisfied, and bought chips at the little hotel snack store to supplement. We did get to talk to the owner that night. He has not owned it for long (a little over a year) and is trying to make it better. He seemed very sincere, and nice, and responded well when we told him that people need more than ONE trash can per room. We also enjoyed the shuttle, and the driver, Max, who was friendly and helpful. Our next experience was not as pleasant. We had rented a car, and spent days in other cities, and the National Parks. We planned on returning to this location to turn in the car, then go to the airport. When we got to the hotel, after driving around Colorado and touring all day, I was informed, by Yasmin, the front desk person who helped me, that my reservation was cancelled. I had NOT cancelled it, and pulled out my emails and paperwork to show it. While I was doing that, she helped other people, and even took a long phone call, while I waited, with my email in hand. When she did get back to me, she said she was sorry, but there was nothing she could do... too bad. I asked for a manager. There was NO manager onsite, Yasmin tried to call her, but the manager never responded. By this time, my husband joined me, and we asked about Chris, the owner, who had been around all day Sunday. She told us she had no number for him, and could not reach him because he ""is not my friend"".  Honestly, there was a problem with the card that I had used to make the reservation, but instead of contacting me, and letting me know the problem, my complaint is that they cancelled it, and did not try to phone or email me to let me know of the cancellation. Had they done that, I could have solved it over the phone. The desk conversation did get a little contentious, which all of us apologized for. As it happened, a cancellation seemed to immediately appear and we were offered a room. They were going to charge us more for the room but we insisted that we would not pay more, and Yasmin agreed to adjust it. By this point, she was seeming more helpful. We got to our room, and the AC was not working, even when we turned it down low. We knew it probably was the only available room, so we didn't say anything. I'd already had enough confrontation for one night. Fortunately, it was not overly stuffy, so we were able to get some sleep. I am not a really demanding customer. This hotel has potential to be a very pleasant place to stay, as we found the first day. But, if the staff is not consistent, and if they are going to cancel a reservation without at least letting the customer know, then it is not the kind of place I want to stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wonderful Experience!,"My experience at this hotel was AMAZING! Super friendly staff; delicious and filling complementary breakfast; clean pool; clean rooms; always could find a person if I had a question; great shuttle service/ mini tour guide; just a wonderful, wonderful experience-I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Denver! Alyssa A was a outstanding front desk person, friendly, stellar customer and a welcoming smile!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Tired grubby hotel with a horrible breakfast,Stayed here with my wife. We first had a 'no smoking' room that absolutely stank of cigarette smke. We asked for another room and were given one that didn't smell so much of smoke but was sad and tired and slightly grubby. Although the staff were freidly enough the whole place had a shabby feel to it. There were mostly people there on a boozing weekend it seemed to me. The poorest breakfast  by far of a 3 week holiday across USA.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Friendly staff,"We enjoyed our stay here. It was fairly easy to find.  they were in the midst of changing signs to Clarion. We drove by it at first, then figured it out and quickly turned around and got into the parking lot. All staff were very friendly and helpful.  My mother commented several times that this was probably the best hotel staff she had ever encountered.  Shuttle service to Coors Field was very helpful. I wasn't looking forward to driving around Denver in the dark. My only problem with the hotel is the smell of marijuana that lingered in the bathroom, and a few things need updated.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Big,"Largest Quality Inn we've stayed at-- 9 stories with very slow elevators.  Industiral area.  Stood in line for over 20 minutes to check-in and process also slow.  6 workers behind counter with only 2 helping customers.  Check-out also slow, although no one was in line--maybe slow computers??  Room was large with vanity counter and large mirror outside of bathroom.  Good place to store extra stuff or drinks/snacks.  Good lighting in room and bathroom.  Many people with unleashed dogs in lobby/elevators and strong smell of pot.  Breakfast served in restaurant-- lots of seating.  Standard fare plus large bowl of cottage cheese (not on ice), cubed cheese, potatoes, Mexican dishes.  Large parking lot.  Nice outdoor pool with seating and small fitness room.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nasty hotel,"**REVIEWS DECEIVING..DO NOT STAY HERE** We were so disgusted with this hotel and had to deal with it for 4 days because we booked on a non refundable site! It's dirty, smells awful (marijuana is smoked all throughout the whole hotel even on non smoking floors however it smelled like urine and mold in the halls), my brothers room smelled like dog pee horribly, there's a gap under ALL the hotel room doors so you can hear EVERYTHING in the halls, young ignorant staff and simply horrible breakfast! Literally this place is meant for college kids to have a cheap hotel to party! I would NEVER stay here again..my family all felt the same way! Major waste of $..spend the extra 30$ a night and get downtown. I'm amazed this place has a ""good"" rating because it's nasty!!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel of Last Resort,"We stayed here for a large, regional softball tournament.  Unfortunately, if there were any other mainstay hotels available, we would have stayed elsewhere.  For starters, I was told that our group’s block of rooms was supposed to be all non-smoking.  The first day we checked-in -- to a supposedly non-smoking floor and non-smoking room on the 8th floor.   Once we exited the elevator, we noticed a funky smell in the hallway.  Our room had a no smoking emblem on the door, but upon entering, it smelled like smoke and it had ashtrays.  The hotel staff said that they could not accommodate a room change to a non-smoking room, so we drove 45 miles to stay elsewhere – a big inconvenience, but necessary from a health standpoint.Our group coordinator called the hotel sales manager and got us a non-smoking room the following day.  The room was better… at least it didn’t have an odor like the prior room.  The room had what appeared to be relatively new carpet.  I can also say that our room’s shower was very good – hot with good water pressure.  We were appreciative that the manager got us a non-smoking room for the rest of our trip.  We noticed that it did not appear that housekeeping vacuumed our room with their daily service … and from prior comments, it appears that housekeeping services are not up to par with what one might expect from other chains.This hotel is supposedly “upgrading” to a Clarion hotel (and according to the reviews/comments, has been doing so for some time), but overall, in my opinion, there is much work yet to be done.  The hallways and doors are in need of a complete remodel; in dire need of cleaning old/worn items replaced and upgraded lighting.  Various parts of the hotel have a funky odor – this hotel allowed (and I think still allows) smoking and it has permeated everywhere – the hallways, stairways, and the rooms.  The doors to most of the rooms look to be original…they feel old, some look dirty and some don’t open or close properly.  The hotel bar and the restaurant appear to be “half” remodeled…the restaurant side looks fairly new; the bar side is in need of an update.  The pictures on the website make the hotel look great – somewhat deceiving.  Given that most of the hotels in Denver were sold out this week, our group was appreciative to have rooms, but it seemed like everyone had a comment about something that wasn’t right, didn’t work, or was just plain dirty, smelly, or old.We heard a number of people outside of our group commenting while we were there… everything from the smoke and funky smells in the hotel, to the poor elevator service.  A number of prior TripAdvisor reviews about this hotel commented that smoking was allowed and that it was 420 friendly.  I’m not sure who the hotel is catering too, but I don’t think it is families with children.  The Denver area softball organization that has this hotel on their designated hotel list obviously has not checked out this place nor stayed here.  The hotel is in an industrial area… with the exception of a Village Inn next door, there is no shopping, grocery or, restaurants nearby.  You must drive to get to anything – which isn’t necessarily a bad thing – just know you’ll need to travel if you are looking for food or shopping.  The hotel is about 3-4 miles to the downtown area – don’t let the name “Denver Central” fool you.  However, if you’re just traveling through, located at I25 and I70, it’s fairly easy to get to the hotel.Breakfast was “adequate”… lots of choices…  Knowing the lack of the hotel feeling “clean”, I tried not to think how the kitchen might look or the food was prepared. We did not use the pool area, which looks to be in reasonable shape and perhaps renovated within the last year.I’ve read the many comments here on TripAdvisor and the hotel sales director responding by apologizing and stating that they are in the process of updating the hotel and changing over to a Clarion hotel (these comments go back more than six months).  I can’t figure out their approach – it’s as if there isn’t a master plan.  Renovating an aging hotel room by simply replacing the carpet does not justify being in a “remodeled room”.  The wallpaper in our room looked original, the fire/smoke detector was hanging off the wall, the mirrors in our room are attached to the wall hillbilly style – with the screws on the outside.  Hopefully, they will get everything updated, sooner vs. later.Not every guest can be happy at even the best situations, but I would tend to agree that many of the unfavorable reviews are spot on.  If you’re traveling to Denver during a busy season, event, or conference, book early and book elsewhere.  I rarely stay at a Choice property, but if this is indicative of other properties, I doubt I’ll seek these hotels out in the future.  For me, this is a place “of last resort” to stay.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smoked out,"It is really too bad, this place has much to go for it. Now under new management (it is a Clarion Hotel for a few weeks), we liked most things. The receptionist was very friendly, our room was large, towels etc all there. The breakfast was pretty good, too, better than most buffets at this class of hotel.Why do I give it a 'poor?' When we got to the room on our after-midnight arrival, it reeked of smoke. ""Stank"" is a better term. This was not the smell of someone smoking a cigarette but some serious tobacco smoking must have gone on for a long time. It was unbearable.The hotel said there was not room available and wanted to add air freshener to the stink. We refused but we had not choice, by now it was 1.30am and the receptionist said all nearby hotels were fully booked. We endured the night and left as soon as we could the next morning. We booked a non-smoking room and we definitely did not get what we booked and what we paid for. We did not ask for a price adjustment and none was offered. It would not have made the night more bearable. Read my other reviews, I am not a complainer. There are few places where I will never go again but this is one of them. Be warned!",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Value and Convenient Location,"We recently stayed in Denver for an event and were pleasantly surprised by our stay at the hotel. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient. The shuttle to downtown area was extremely convenient, and it was less than a $10 Uber ride back. The complimentary breakfast offered a great variety of items!  My only drawback was the housekeeping staff.We didn’t get service the first day, and perhaps that was due to having the privacy tag on the door past10 a.m.  On our last day, we decided to have breakfast and checkout at noon, which was the check out time. At 11:50 a.m. we heard knocking on our door and answered. It was housekeeping, and she was telling us that checkout is at noon. We told her we were getting ready to leave and she basically waited at the door until we left with our luggage. Unfortunately, this didn’t leave us with a good final impression.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Perfect,"First things first location was pretty good. About a 20 minute drive to most activities. Located right next to a highway barely noticed the noise, I was facing the front of the building still  a beautiful view of the mountains. Upon arrival another couple was experiencing what  alot of views said with their room being already occupied so it does happen. However our room was great and check in was smooth. They are a 420 friendly hotel as well as cigarettes smelled weed as soon as we walked into the building. They offer breakfast from 630 to 9 I believe, as well an on-site restraunt we didn't try either. Pool was just okay, it fulfilled its purpose. We did call for new towels and toliet paper 3 days into our 5 day stay and never received them so we took what we could from downstairs pool area. At night the water was usually very hot like too hott. Other than that our stay was amazing, I would recommend this hotel just make sure you call ahead to confirm your stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Convenient, good value","We spent three nights here. The room was clean and adequate. The mattress was nearly the end of its comfortable life and should be replaced soon. The free breakfast is very good, and the free shuttle to downtown Denver was quite useful. However, it was overbooked (or understaffed) twice during our stay, and we had to opt for Uber instead on those occasions. The elevators are slow. The staff courteous. The location is in an industrial and rail area, but there was no noticeable noise.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Just OK.,"We travel to Denver on a family vacation and stayed at the this motel.  Rooms were okay, beds weren't too bad, but the housekeeping was not the best.  The first morning, my son's room was not cleaned at all. We were gone from 8am-9pm and came back to a dirty room.  We both went down and spoke with the desk clerk and he was told that they could send someone up in an hour or two.  At 10pm and tired from all day, we asked for some towels and went to bed. Second morning, all rooms were cleaned but this time, our room did not get any towels.  I had to walk down and asked for towels again.  Their shuttle service was great. We used it to go to amusement park and the Rockies game.  The only problem was that on Friday night, they only one driver to cover all the service runs.  I contacted the motel and they told me it would be a while because they only had one driver.  We had to wait on the shuttle for over an hour after the Rockies game to get a ride back to motel.  Several others that were waiting took cabs or use Uber. I don't understand why the motel wasn't prepared for this by having a standby on call, especially on a Friday night.Hot breakfast was good each morning that we were there.  Hot food, fresh fruit, and a cool pancake maker, according to my grandson.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Horrible experience,"My family and I just took a road trip to Colorado, and I had our room booked for over a month. When we arrived we encountered multiple issues. First, I was given a room key that didn’t work. Next, I was given a key to a room occupied by sleeping guests. Then, there were no other rooms available to offer us. While there we witnessed to other people complain about similar problems. With so many options out there, don’t waste your time or money at this place.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Most staff is Friendly,"We arrived later in the day, and we didn't want to go out for dinner, so we opted for the onsite restaurant, big mistake for dinner, but according to my travel companion, the daily breakfast bar was wonderful, I don't eat breakfast or lunch, but the sampler platter that we ordered, was by far, the worst of any restaurant food that has ever been placed in front of me, the chicken tenders were like batter fried rocks, although once you were able to chisel your way through the breading, the chicken was ok, the potato skins were so greasy, couldn't even eat them, have no idea how long they had been sitting before it was delivered, but, but first choice was the Rueben, took 45 minutes to find out they didn't have any corned beef, for the most part, the servers acted like their guests were an inconvenience, not to mention the nasty condiment bottles that were set on out the tables, our sampler plater wasn't set down but slammed down in front of us, found that a bit discouraging. The front desk staff were wonderful, couldn't ask for a better group of people, they, if were not genuinely happy to see you and welcome you to their hotel, then they have some great actors, but, you could tell that it was genuine. Another A+ for the hotel, is it is 420 friendly. The elevators are/were a bit sketchy at times, as there were a couple of times that I wasn't sure I was going to make to my floor or not, or if the cables were going to snap as I plummet to my passing, because the elevators shook so bad. The beds, like all hotel beds are, any more, 30-36 inches high, which means you either have to carry a trampoline, springboard or a step ladder to get into bed, one should not have to pay as much as we did to wake up in so much pain that they can't walk, other than that, the hotel needs a serious upgrading, and the bar could use at least 1 hit per week with a broom, as I saw the same pieces of trash on the floor every day that we were there.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The staff at the quality INN are the bet,The hotel itself could use a little updating but it was very clean and the staff at the front desk and house keeping were fabulous. They were always friendly and willing to provide assistance. The hotel is a 420 friendly hotel and allows smoking in the rooms and on the grounds. The beds seemed a little hard but that seems to be normal any more. During a couple of days there was some issues with the elevators and for a short period of time only one of the 3 was working but by the weekend they had all 3 up and running again.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Trip to Colorado,The staff was very courteous. It was clean. They offer a shuttle to downtown Denver. They offer smoking rooms. I could see the mountains from the window in my room. The breakfast was fabulous. Dinner wasn't so good. View from the room.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Conveniently Located, Great bar, Perfect Couples get Away","I loved our stay here! they are clearly in the process of remodeling but the noise never made it to the room. The view from our room was unexpectedly gorgeous, mountains for miles. the bartenders were very nice, as well as all the other staff I met. the breakfast was not my favorite, but it wasn't bad food either. (But with Denver Buiscut Co. 10 minutes away, we always ate out) we ubered in to the city and it ranged from $8-$12 per trip depending on time of day. They have a shuttle that leaves every hour for free if you want to save some cash on transportation. Don't let the odd location turn you off, this place is a great price for it's proximity to the city.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A bit disappointing,"We were here for a conference. The hotel was full, but only one of the three elevators was working. Cleanliness was fair. The room was amazingly quiet considering that it is close to two major interstates and a train yard. The bed was comfortable. Most of the staff were friendly, but there were some who seemed to not care whether they helped us or not. There was a strong marijuana smell. Breakfast was average.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst ever,"We arrived this past Saturday after a long drive. We checked into our reservation and proceeded to our room after standing in line to get an elevator as one was non functioning. The entire fifth floor smelled like a Cheech and Chong party. I live in Colorado, I get it. But I can't smoke my cigarettes in my room, why do they get to smoke their weed? We got into the room which was stiffling hot and discovered the AC didn't work. Went back downstairs to inquire about a new room. The front desk person, Alyssa, was extremely rude, condescending and snotty. She advised that they couldn't accommodate us into the same type of room. When asked about the price difference she advised us there wasn't anything she could do. We were nice to her, polite and explained the issues. When we told her she was being snotty she replied with I don't see how but whatever. I just took the room she offered, no refund for the price difference and asked for her to have the manager call me. She stated she was the front desk manager. I asked for the manager above her then. Went back upstairs to the room on the same floor that reeked of weed to discover the new room had no shower curtain. Back downstairs to ask if I could please get a shower curtain. Back upstairs. Mind you I had some where to be in an hour. Well the phone rings and it's the front desk manager, who was not Alyssa. Did she lie? Doesn't matter at this point. I advised him what was happening and none of it mattered more then the way we were treated at the front desk. He proceeded to say 99% of the time she was a great employee. He would talk with her. He then went on to explain that it was 100 degrees outside and the heat can do things to people. So that was his reasoning as to why she was rude. SERIOUSLY!?!?! I told him I could not believe he said that and he was defending her actions. He then stated he would give us a full refund and we could leave. I said no it's fine, I have to be somewhere. I would stay. He said no. He was giving us a refund and wanted us to leave. My partner was already getting in the shower. She had to get dressed and pack so we could leave to go find another hotel. We were never rude, never raised our voices, never caused a scene and only asked for and conditioning and a shower curtain. Basic necessities. And we were kicked out. All within half an hour of arrival. I am not a complainer and I even let being put in smaller room and the cost difference go ( even though online said they had three rooms available that matched the room we originally booked two months ago). I have never been treated so badly. Ever. I stay at Hilton for work and I choose choice hotels for personal visits as my family works for them. This experience has changed that. Going forward I will use my accuired Hilton points for personal vacations if this is any indicator of Choice management style. I will be contacting corporate to file a complaint as well. DO NOT STAY HERE.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst hotel ever!!,"Why can’t I leave a review with negative stars??? This hotel is HORRIBLE.  No equipment functioning in the fitness room. One out of three elevators working ( we were on the 9th floor). Local riff raff getting wasted in the bar downstairs. Shuttle drivers trying to solicit girls downstairs. Dirty. Terrible sketchy neighborhood. Not close to ANYTHING! Keys don’t work after two days. A/C not working in the room. Candy in snack bar melted from the heat. Old, outdated decor.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,It’s good for a quick trip ,"Our room was clean and beds comfortable. We got a non smoking room, but our sheets still had a hint of smoke smell. The lifts smell of smoke too. The staff were polite, a little slow to process check in, but polite none the less. The free shuttle to downtown was handy for us with a friendly driver. We just parked our car at the hotel and we were set for the afternoon not needing to drive anywhere.  Breakfast is ok, nothing amazing - but covers the staples for a Buffett. All in all it suited us for a night before flying out.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Staff,Danielle and the hotel staff and the shuttle drivers were so awesome with this experience of your beautiful mountain Vistas and all that the city has to offer. It was a wonderful time! Thank you all!!!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good place, great value","I had my reservations when booking this hotel, having read some of the reviews, but the price and the shuttle bus were an offer too good to turn down. I did read others talking about hookers and homeless people and whatnot but I have seen none of this in my sixth day of seven day stay. I was not disturbed by traffic or train noise and I was facing the railway and motorway but I am a quite heavy sleeper.The positives - clean hotel and rooms, helpful staff, reasonably reliable shuttle bus with great drivers, mostly hot and powerful shower, plenty of clean towels, secure, a good breakfast (it is the usual average fare of lukewarm scrambled eggs and ham but there are also make your own waffles and pancakes and it is plentiful).The negatives - there is nothing else around, the shuttle bus still means you are 15-20 minutes from anything, I couldn't make international calls, the halls smell very 'deodorised'. The water was less hot on one day and meant it had to be at full heat to get adequate warmth. However, you can't really take away a star for things you already knew or are inconsequential.Conclusion - I would stay again but it would need to be the same price or as low relative to other offerings.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wonderful place,"My boyfriend and I took a quick vacation to Colorado this weekend. When we got to Denver, we had to quickly find a hotel since it was so late. Not only was the room under $100, but it had an incredible view of the entire city. It was absolutely beautiful. We thought being so close too all of the highways would make it really noisy, but we didn't have a single issue throughout the night. The customer service was beyond excellent. I spoke with Jamie, Danielle, and Rowland (spelling may be off) and they were all so polite and helpful. I was beyond happy with our stay and the complimentary buffet breakfast the next morning. Would stay againWould recommend to a friend",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great stay,"Nicer room than expected. Great complimentary breakfast in a restaurant atmosphere. Everyone was helpful, especially Betty Martinez and Susie in the dining room. They couldn't do enough for us, treating us like family. This is what we appreciate more than anything.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,First Time In Denver,So let me start off by saying thank god for the manager Edgar who was able to assist myself and boyfriend from the time we landed. We was having issue with our booking but he went above and beyond to assist us with whatever we needed . Free morning breakfast is okay then shuttle can pick u upFrom certain locations witch was good. Despite having a rough start to our trip over all it was worth it do to the fact that Edgar was so  polite and  generous . He  suggested  some places for us to try out as  first time visitors to Denver.,4

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT STAY HERE,"I recenttly stayed here to attend a concert at Pepsi Center. When we arrived we went up to room and there was no air on very humid in room. We turned air down to 60 lowest setting and went to concert. When we came back about 4 hours later it was not any cooler in the room so I called front desk and ask if they had another room and was told by Lowrence  to just shut the air off and sleep with window open. I asked to move rooms or get me a fan needless to say there was no effort in moving me to new room so he gave me a fan which we had to clean before even being able to use it. They also must have long term guest stay here as the next morning I went down to get name on shuttle list and there was an older gentleman at desk checking his mail.DO NOT STAY..

I had to change my room 1st cause the none smoking room had an awful smell, they upgraded me to a bigger room, but there was no heating system functioning in my room, it seems some have it, others do not. They promised me to bring a heater but never did. Breakfast was basic. They smoke in the elevator, marijuana and all kind of smokes. Horrible experience. Staff mainly snobby non chalent and rude.

I will not be staying at another hotel affiliated with this brand.  Manager only apologized and said the hot water issue was because I was trying to use during peak time.  I doubt 1:30 A.M. is a peak time for showering.  Would not give me a discount on room for inconvenience.  I will be sending a letter to corporate.",1

Comfortable beds and pillowsCons:  Location - at the intersection of two major highways and a railroad yard.                              Sleep was nearly impossible because decades old, single pane windows let in the sound of every passing motorcycle, car, truck and train.And also, the old windows allowed a serious cold draft across the nearest bed.           One of three elevators was not working.           NO HEAT in the restaurant that serves as breakfast dining room.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,One of the most unpleasant stays I've ever experienced ,"This hotel has the possibility of being an extraordinary hotel. It's clean, the bed is comfortable,  slept great (once I stopped freezing), the breakfast was good, the staff for the most part was great,  free shuttle. But there were some things that made it not so great and is the reason I had to give it a 2 stars. My husband and I stayed here 3 nights at the end of December.  Every single night we had to set the thermostat at 90 and the temp probably never rose above 60. I froze! My husband asked the front desk if there was anything that could be done and she said she would have maintenance staff look into it and call him. After 2 hrs,  with no response,  he went down again. Different person, and this time,  nothing could be done.  So he asked for more blankets. No, they didn't have any blankets. So I just froze every single night. There was nowhere in the hotel I could go to get warm besides the bathroom. I would literally have to go in there, run bath water,  let steam build up and get warm. Even the dining room in the bar was cold lije that.My next complaint is that the entire building smelled of weed.  I get that its legalized in Colorado and I'm ok with that,  but it stinks. And the building REEKS!.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pinnacle Pickup ,"Absolutely the worst from checkin to checkout. Crowded from Denver game, one elevator down, questionable area, freezing cold dining room. Bed was comfortable. Don’t recommend this hotel. Motel 6 is better They leave the light on.",1

Customer service was great. I believe Minna checked us in.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Yuck!!!!! Run away!!!,"This hotel is the filthiest most disgusting hotel room I have ever seen or experienced in my life. My entire family felt dirty after staying here one night. The entire hotel reeks of cigarettes and cannabis, the heat doesn’t work, and it was just plain filthy everywhere you looked. My daughter found a hair in her eggs at breakfast, we found a dried booger on the nightstand in addition to black mold in the bathroom, various stains on the curtains, carpet, and  bedding, as well as something that appeared to be dripping down the back door of the bathroom. It is very evident that there is not even a wipe down done between patrons and we actually purchased Clorox wipes to try to feel OK about sleeping there one evening.The front desk staff was nice upon check-in and the shuttle drivers try their best despite no communication from the front desk about times and pick ups. If you are in town to experience the 420 lifestyle and are not afraid of a lot of germs, feel free to enjoy your stay here but if you are a family or have any hygienic standards I would look elsewhere.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Horrible room!,"Newer carpet is the only nice thing I can say about the room.  The room was filthy.  Actually Googled how to check for bed bugs.   Staff at check in were nice.  For the life of me, I don't understand how this is a 3 star hotel.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,disappointing hotel,"Stayed there for 1 night. Near intersection of I 25 and I 70. On our way to the grand Canyon. Very noisy, bad acoustic insulation. Bathroom crying to be replaced. Hard mattress as per American standards. The toilet was clogged after first use. No safe deposit box in the room. Don't take a room on the east side of the building.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,First Time in Colorado - Don't Stay Here,"Visited the state for the first time; because of Elf Fest and a Tattoo Convention, there weren't many options available in our price range; the hotel smelled of weed - like, a lot; the lobby was cozy; they had apparently redecorated it recently; the staff wäs friendly; the hotel is located in a not so nice area of the city; don't walk alone at night; lots of people hanging out drinking alcohol near the entrance/loitering; the room smelled of humidity, smoke and bleach; the towels were dingy; the bathroom toilet is for a child; the water pressure was awful; there's a train that goes by there at 5-6 AM, heads up; the breakfast in't terrible.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Free Shuttle and Great Customer Service,"I must say that from the time I checked in to the time I checked out, everyone I came in contact with was top notch!  We even had a lady walking around asking us how our meal was as we ate this delicious ""free"" breakfast!  The location was easy to find and there is plenty of ""free"" parking.  The rooms were clean and the ""free"" shuttle took us to 3 different locations during our stay to include the Pepsi center, the aquarium, and the 16th street mall.  Our entire family had a blast and I am so happy we decided to stay here.  The only thing that wasn't great was the smell of marijuana in the elevators and in the hallway to our room, which is no fault of the location.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Truck Parking, VERY clean rooms.","I so wanted to give this a 5-rating, but unfortunately it was a bit noisy. We were on the 8th floor--and yes, the smell of cannabis lingers in the hallway but NOT in the room. There was the sounds of slamming doors--but noone in the halls??--so not sure where it was coming from? Other than that, our room was a great size, linens were extremely clean, it was a not warm & the front desk sent up a fan immediately. Breakfast was fantastic with a woman visiting every table making sure all was well. And as far as the reviewer saying something about this place being a 'drug hangout'--we didn't see anything during our stay to warrant that comment. Its a great place, just wish they'd figure out what that banging noise is & fix it.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"It was ""OK""","As a General Manager of a Choice hotel with 5 years straight gold and platinum awards and being #1 on Trip Advisor in our area for over a year,  I tend to look and over look things at other choice hotels as I am very picky with my staff and the way we handle things at our hotel. And this is my opinion.At Check in the front desk clerk was very nice I would love to mention her name but she did not have a name tag on. We stayed  with our points and she did recognize our Elite status with choice hotels and offered a bag of chips and a small bottle of water. She gave us direction to our room, mentioned free parking, breakfast (we did not eat) and shuttle service which is a great amenity! Her customer service was great :) When we entered our room there was a musky smell, but we dealt with it. We did not have any problems with the heat or air in our room as many reviews mentioned, so that was nice. The room was clean,although not to my standard.I did not feel the room was ""rent ready""!  Reviews are on point about smell of Marijuana from 7th & 8th floor. I had to check for myself and the minute the elevator opened the smell just hit you. But with new Colorado law, I understand how hard to control.  Although we as innkeepers have the right to charge for smoking in a non smoking hotel. Note to management authorize $100.00 for incidentals on guest's credit card to assure funds are available should they smoke in your hotel. Housekeeping could use more training in cleanliness. (Choice University offers great on line training ) Dusting all surfaces is important, there was so much dust behind night stands and also trash it was disgusting. Sheets were put on the bed inside out and the bed skirts should be washed and changed more frequently as it too was dusty and also had hair on it.  NOT RENT READY! All in all our stay was ok, although I would probably not stay at this property again. This property needs some working on, there are so many things I would love to share with management, many idea's to improve come to mind.   GOOD LUCK ON YOUR NEXT LRA INSPECTION!",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice hotel with great ammenities ,This hotel is very nice for its price with a lot of ammenities and a shuttle service that takes you several places in the downtown area. If you're not a fan of marijuana then you shouldn't stay here since the 2 top floors are reserved to be 420 friendly.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not worth the money,"I only had two nights in Denver and chose this hotel, one for the rating and the location was central to what I wanted to do.  The cost was $150 a night.  I wish I would have read the o5er reviews before I booked this place.  This is more like an $80 a night motel.  The staff was friendly the hotel was clean, my problem was the amount I spent.  Upon my check in to my room I immediately turned on the heat and then left the room for 5e evening. My room never warmed up.  I called the front desk and the said something about turning up the boiler.  By midnight my room still never warmed up so they changed my room.  I had to repack and go up a floor.  Turned on the heat in that room and went to bed.  I woke up about 6am freezing because the heat wasn’t working in that room either.  A maintenance person came to my room removed a ceiling tile and turned some valve and he said it should work now.  My room never warmed up at all.  At this point I just bit the bullet and realized nothing is going to change. I’m glad I’m checking out today.  I would not stay here again especially the cost.  Not worth the value.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Terrible marijuana hangout ,Don't bother stopping. The halls are so heavy w marijuana smell by evening your tongue starts feeling numb... in your room.   Even tho outside the hotel it says No Smoking Within 25 Ft Of Hotel. Every night around 8 o'clock the a.c. turns off and switches over to heater (central air that you can't control) and you spend the night so warm you can't sleep. Till like 4 am. Breakfast is pretty good w a fairly large variety. The rooms are moderately clean.Overall I will never come back. Its a drug hangout.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dirty. Lazy staff. Not worth your money. ,"Unfortunately I made the terrible mistake of attempting to save some money by booking a questionable hotel room. Well to my surprise the room was as bad as the reviews had states prior to my stay. I strongly recommend that consumers stay away from this hotel and that the management/leadership team step up and start inspecting what they expect. The hotel rooms are dirty, cleaned very poorly and unfortunately most of the fixtures look outdated. Please save your money and stay somewhere else. Trust me you’re going to regret staying here.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,No quality in this Inn,"Outdated, unkempt rooms, rude cleaning staff that walked in our room unannounced, broken down elevators, can't control your own heat/air & no hot water. Beware this is a privately owned hotel.  Your complaint will fall on deaf ears. You will receive a nice reply from one of the managers. TRUST nothing will change.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,I WISH I COULD RATE IT A ZERO!!!,"To Whom It May Concern:I recently stayed at the Quality Inn Denver Central in Denver, Colorado. I stayed October 6th through the 9th. This hotel was by far the worst experience I have ever had a hotel. We paid $445 to be inconvenienced, mistreated and suffer for our vacation. This hotel lessened the enjoyment of our vacation. Nothing described by the hotel’s website was true. The hotel is not a 3.5 rated hotel nor is it in downtown Denver. Also it was right near a very large Salvation Army. There were many homeless people around the area and parking lot. This was not described on their site.  The hotel workers were also rude, incompetent, and not empathetic to what was going on with their hotel. When we got to the room October 6th we checked into room 410. The room was not cleaned right at all. We checked the bed sheets and there stains. We called the front office 5 times and it took 30 minutes to an hour for the workers to finally come up and change the sheets. Not to mention they never apologized for it once. Then the AC in the room was not working properly. The AC was blowing out lukewarm air. I then called priceline.com and was on the phone with them over an hour. I called and tried to speak to a manager downstairs but they told me none were available. A Priceline representative let me know they could not do anything for me until Monday. Monday was the day we checked out. We left for the night on Friday and stayed at the hotel. The hotel room we were in kept making a banging noise every 20 minutes. We called downstairs and they said they would look at it. The banging continued throughout the night. In the middle of the night I woke up and the room was very hot. I tried to call the office and no one would answer. When we got up we called again and they sent a maintenance man to room 410. The man checked the vents and told us there is nothing he could do because the AC was too old. He said we could open the window and he brought in an old fashion fan. I then called downstairs and told them this would not work for us. The employee at the front was very rude and said “come get a key to a different room.” We went down and got the key to the new room. The new room was 309. We checked out the room’s AC and it was working. We started to move things to the other room when an employee called room 410. He said “are you bringing the key down?” This was done in a rude condescending manner as if we were putting him out or bothering him by having him do this job. My boyfriend took the key to 410 down. When we moved all of our items to room 309 we noticed again a dirty room and this time the bed felt as if it were 30 years old. The bed was rough, lumpy, and the springs creaked horribly. We decided to stay and deal with it because dealing with the front office was a complete hassle. In the middle of the night the room was blowing out hot air. In the morning I went down and told the employee the AC in room 309 was not working. She said that they turned the AC off all night! We were never notified of this and I told her and she did not care. We again dealt with this because once again the front office did nothing for us and every time I asked to speak to a manager they told me they are not available. Our final day in Denver we came back to the room around 8:30pm. When we got to the room the key did not work. We went down and talked to Randall and he gave us a new key to 309. We went back to room 309 and again the key did not work. We went back down and Randall did not help him because he was busy on his phone. Our stay was the worst by far and it lessened the enjoyment of our vacation. $445 was money thrown away just to be put through misery by the staff at the hotel and the rooms. We've stayed at cheaper places and the service and overall quality of the rooms was much better. I would not recommend anyone stay here and their website should be updated because everything on there is a lie. This was the poorest customer service and should be used as every example of what not to do in a hotel business. I usually never leave complaints or bad reviews but this was extremely horrible and Quality Inn Denver Central should be ashamed of themselves.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Ew, keep driving! ","We were in Denver for my birthday last weekend and we had booked this hotel. Their ad says newly remodeled, but if this newly remodeled I shutter to think what it looked like before. Just from pulling into the parking lot you can tell this place was going to be a dump. There were people camping in the parking lot, the roof is peeling off in places, the trashcan is full of mattresses, and the fence is beat to heck (pictures in comments). We tried to get a refund because this is no 3 star hotel and they tell us too bad, so we decided to look around. We went to several different floors and every single floor the carpet looks like somebody had drug leaking garbage bags across it! On the floor, there was even a cake smeared across the carpet. At this point, we decided that even though we couldn't get a refund leaving and going to a different hotel was going to be cheaper than bringing this filth home! I wouldn't stay here if my car broke down on the highway. I would sleep in my car.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Was nothing I read for reviews,"We arrived at the hotel early in the morning. We called to see if we could check in early or do they have a room. We were told no. We found a spot in the lot to sleep. A couple hours later I went in the hotel and talked to Alissa and explained our situation. She said all I had to was sign up for the hotel program. We were in a room in minutes. Once we got to our room, I seen right away the reviews I had read reviews, looked at the pictures. The hotel was nothing I read or seen. The room over looked the highway and the industrial area. No mountain view. The room needs up dating. The cleaning of the room was horrible. Nothing seemed cleaned but the sheets. We asked the cleaners if they could clean our room one day. We made the beds and left. When we returned they had remade the beds and left. They did not even vacuum or wipe any thing. We cleaned our room. There was a gem show that week at the hotel. We were not told when making reservations. We could not find parking in the lot most days. We paid a lot of money, not to be able to find convenient parking. We had gotten a flat tire when we did find a spot in the hotel lot. I walked a round the lot one morning, I could not believe all the nails, large screws and other sharp objects in the hotel parking lot. I got up early and went to get coffee. At 6 am the elevator was gross. I was told because of the gem show, I had to wait for breakfast to open. They usually have it out, but they don't want to spend the money for all the extra coffee. I was there for vacation not the gem show. Another way we were inconvenienced for all the money we paid. The elevators and lobby area at 6am were disgusting. They never looked like they ever get mopped, the hallway leading to our room never got vacuumed the week we were there. The grey dust a long the walls was gross.  You didn't want to touch anything. One night I used the lobby restroom. There was NO toilet paper at all. I went to the counter to inform someone. The worker Rollin was on the phone. so I waited and waited and waited. Rollin never even acknowledge me standing there. Not even I will be right with you. Nothing. His call was not that important. They were just chit chatting. I walked away. I was not impressed with the staff. I would see them on their phones. Another day I wanted to get some information from the front desk,  I walked up to the desk. I was the only one up there. Rollin looked at me and walked away. I stood there a few minutes. Rollin was not doing anything. He never asked if I needed help. Someone came from the back and seen me, came up to assist me. Rollin was no help at any time of our week long stay. The staff need training from Alissa. They need new cleaners and some hotel up dates.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hits and Misses,"Here for business. Fellow travelers, this was not a restful or quiet hotel. Pluses: friendly staff, especially the drivers for the free shuttle service (quite punctual). This service is a big bonus. Breakfast, better than the norm with delicious and pretty hot green chile, served in the hotel restaurant with NO TV playing. Gold stars for that. 3 elevators, weight room, new wellness services. International crowd, families and seniors, who were good for interesting conversation.  Very clean room, good beds. Drawbacks: Pot smoke wafts through the halls even from no-smoking rooms. Maybe this is a universal situation in Colorado now.  I reported shower problems first day and they were not addressed. Some towels had stains, loose parts in the shower, and my comforter had burn marks. Housekeeping skipped my room one day and did not pull the door closed on another. I popped it right open upon my return. Doors here have to pulled very hard to lock but there are gaps under the doors, so this makes for noise that is frequent and audible.  Pretty dubious younger and/rough clientele during my multiple night stay....some folk who were rowdy, with no security patrol in sight. Worth the investment, I think.  Hotel is close to freeways and frontage roads so traffic noise is ever-present. I used ear plugs every night.  One restaurant in hotel, one next door and then that's it. No other shops withing safe walking distance. Despite the easy access, hotel is tricky to get to approaching from one direction in particular so look at your map very closely before trying to find this, esepcially if coming in at night. Conclusion: I will be pay more for better lodging next time I come to town.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Three Years Later and the Place has gone Downhill,"Just spent 5 days at the Quality Inn Central Denver and I agree with the preceding 2014 review criticizing the restaurant.  Moreover, the hotel is starting to fall apart; bathrooms with rusty fixtures, mildewed shower curtains, stained paint in the bathroom.  The maid service puts in a very minimal effort to make beds and vacuum rugs.  I even found a needle and a wallboard screw on the carpet.  There was no coffee for the in-room coffee maker for two out the 5 days.   There are very poor parking accommodations.  One of the three elevators probably couldn't pass a safety inspection since it creaks and bounces up and down as it moves between floors.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Upgraded Rooms and (Some) Staff,"I've stayed at this Quality Inn off and on for at least 20 years (always in September). This is the nicest the hotel has been in all of those years. The additional service of providing a microwave/refrigerator in every room is much appreciated - in the past, if the staff liked you, you might get an old, dirty, microwave/refrigerator; now, the appliances are clean and are provided to all rooms!  The beds are wonderfully comfortable; the previous awful bed covers and curtains have been replaced with nicer ones and with a duvet. The rooms and bathrooms were clean (a great change from the past). It was wonderful that the window opened a little in order to have fresh air. The air conditioning system worked well and was not intrusive with respect to sound. Some of the furniture is in need of repair, but it is my understanding that the furniture is also being upgraded.Downsides: If I were going to fault anything with respect to the employees, it would be the one person at the front desk who was totally non-responsive (don't ask Stephanie to do anything for you because you will not receive a response). Danielle (front desk) was the most efficient and helpful - I was fortunate enough to have most of my staff-experience with her and her very efficient manager. The Fabreze smell which permeated the lobby and the hallways was unpleasant, but it did work to cover the marijuana odors (for a few hours) - it would be much better to use something like Ozium for this purpose. The only other downside is the water pressure available for the bathroom sink - it takes twice as long to brush ones teeth or even fill a cup; I realize that Denver has some major water usage laws, but the water (saver) which must have been attached to the sink went far beyond the laws.With respect to the restaurant and bar - the restaurant had very sporadic hours and the food was low quality - we had our meals offsite (even though the breakfast is free for guests, it's worth paying to have quality food (Village Inn is just next door); the bar overcharged us on our first night there and we never went back.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Ugh!!,"i don't even know where to begin. i asked for a room on top floor and in quiet area. they gave me a room on 7th floor so i could hear the person above me pound along the floor all night. AND be sure to request a room that faces west or the parking lot. otherwise, you will hear the traffic from I25 and I70 ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT!!  it was horrendous. i chose to stay in room because i become immune to the noise but friends complained they couldn't get any peace and quiet and had to switch locations. also, be aware that they allow dogs in this hotel. that doesn't mean that the dog owners are responsible and pick up after their dogs outside. there are no dog bags provided so why bother?   you smell smoke from cigarettes and marijuana almost daily as soon as you leave your room.  there is an onsite restaurant.  ok food but mainly sandwiches. there is a place next door that is called the village in (compares to denny's). best of all, they had a gem and mineral show that was taking up 75% of the parking lot. you either had to park along the street or above in another business parking lot. the hotel is located conveniently to the interstates- that's a pro and a conthe breakfast is typical with waffle maker and various other items that are typical of hotel buffetsthe room was comfortable although not extremely clean. i see they supposedly had a remodel??  never really noticed this. the hotel staff i dealt with was friendly enoughthe hotel is located in a very industrial section of town.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NON SMOKING IS A FARCE,"We reserved a non smoking room.  Our room posted a notice that should we smoke there, we would be charged $150 cleaning fee.  The whole hotel reeked of smoke.  No escape!  Location is hard to get to.The breakfast was great.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Drug use by night manager,"The night manager not only smelled of marijuana but had white powder around his nose and kept sniffing. He seemed confused when we asked for a different room because our tv had ""no signal"" such a horrible experience, we left with 2 more nights already paid for. Save your money, stay anywhere else.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,perfect hotel,man this place looked a little old from the street pulling in but once we got inside we were very happy. Staff went above and beyond while accommodating us everyone was smiling it was a great experience. Edgar the manager was awesome !,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,perfect hotel with great staff,"We stayed here while attending a 3 night concert at Dick's Sporting Good's Arena. Everything was perfect. The rooms were clean and nice and they provided us with a cot which was super convenient. The owner Chris couldn't have been nicer. We had a lot of time to kill in between check out and our flight and they were extremely hospitable to us during that time, in addition to the entire weekend. They also have shuttles that take you where you need to go. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that needs to stay in the area.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Bad experience ,"We booked in on the 4th September 2017, for two nights.The name is quite deceiving, its not Denver Central , feels more like Denver industrial area.The room was filthy in the corners, not what we expected.We went for drinks and dinner downstairs , the person working the kitchen , her name is  Neomi Lopez, very rude, they quickly offer our food for free, which is not what I wanted and expressed that to them. They insisted and we got zero charge, but its the opposite of how to deal with a problemI wanted to speak to a manager, I got the feeling that they all covered for each otherThe bathroom is something else, very dirty , old hair on the toilette and basin.The shower has no pressure, and if you use water from another tap, expect to burn in the shower !!The window is stuck in the room, you can see it's past it use-by date, I could only get it open a few centimeters.The morning of the 5th, as we went downstairs around 10:30am, I think he might be the owner or manager, but he had a few friends in the bar area drinking beer.At around 12:30 I went into the bar, he poured me a beer, very nice guy.Later the evening I tried to order food, the room phone didn't work.I used my mobile , after my second call, I managed to place an order.They never called to let me know that the food was ready, so after 35min , I went downstairs , as I stood by the bar , I was watching the staff.The owner / manager took a used beer glass from a guest that was finished , rinsed it quickly, poured another beer in it, and proceeded to take it to another table for another guest, absolutely disgusting.I have to say, he was very drunk, stumbling a bit.Waited another 10 min, got my food and went to my room.The cleaning staff took all our soaps, complimentary stock on the second day, and didn't replace anything!My general opinion is, the staff , management is a joke, this is a classic situation of bringing in Gordon Ramsey to save this place!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,5 nights in Denver,"This was our first time in Denver and we stayed at the Quality Inn and had a comfortable stay. Everything was great. Reception Staff were welcoming, We had a nice big room (with Air con) that was comfortable and clean. It was at the rear overlooking the pool. The complimentary breakfast was really good and had a wide variety: Such as Eggs, Sausage, bacon, ham, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, waffles (Very popular), Toast, Chili, fresh fruit,  muffins, and oatmeal. Also Coffee and a selection of Juices.Coffee was also available in the lobby all day and a variety of snacks are available for purchase in a small pantry. The hotel is also centrally located just off the intersection of I-70 and I-25 which makes travel to all other areas of the city fast and fairly easy. We didn’t try the restaurant at night but the bar had drinks at a decent price.As this hotel on outskirts of Denver, there is not anything around the hotel so the courtesy shuttle is a must.We took advantage of it to explore downtown Denver. It dropped us off and picked us up on the 16th Street (by the clock tower) as there were many things to do along the 16th street area.The pool was clean with a decent depth.We had a very enjoyable stay. No issues in staying at the Quality Inn again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Um. No. ,"Specifically picked this hotel because of price, location to Interstate, and it's ability to accommodate a car pulling a trailer.  By Denver standards, this hotel is reasonably priced.  Denver isn't cheap. When we arrived we discovered that the area that we could have parked in had a large tent on it. There would be more tents built.  Starting the next morning. At 7am. Think saws and jackhammers. We ended up having to park on the road.  We weren't left feeling particularly secure with regards to the vehicle.  The hotel isn't very clean outside of the lobby and bar area. Our hallway carpet was covered with stains. Our room smelled like something I can't quite describe.  At one point we thought we smelled pot coming through an air vent.  So much for a non smoking floor. This hotel is in dire need of an upgrade. Spend and extra $25 and stay somewhere nicer.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Decent hotel with expected amentities. Leo Damillini kansas,Decent hotel.  The room was clean but had a strong smoke smell even though we were on the non-smoking floor.  Maintenance ran a filter fan in the room but it didnt help.  They said the smoke was coming from the floor below or the stair wells.  The morning breakfast was good but very busy.  We took the free shuttle to the Rockies game although the shuttle schedule is confusing.  The shuttle driver said they would pick up when there is a van full ready but some people had been waiting over an hour to get picked up 5 miles away.  The fitness room was closed.  The pool is very simple and the hand rail was broke.Leo Damillini kansas,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The shuttle and price- not a bad choice,"A buddy and I booked this hotel while attending a Rockies/Braves series. And unlike some people, I actually checked where the hotel was located so I knew that it was not located where most people consider downtown area. And even the price, I knew it was not on 16th street.  But overall the experience was nice.  You cannot get as close to downtown for the price and still have shuttle ready at a call.The hotel did look aged and is in need of an update. However, the room was very comfortable and clean.  There is not anything, that I would want to venture, around the hotel so shuttle is a must when staying.This was our first time in Denver and knew nothing about the area.  The shuttle driver, Lisa, was very helpful in finding places and dropped us off where all the action was happening.  Plus, they told us exactly where to be when we wanted to return to the hotel.  She dropped us off in the main downtown area around noon and we did not call for pick-up till the baseball game was over.  Many things to do along the 16th street area.>One note that I did not like about the hotel experience-  Upon arriving by plane, we were told to ride the light rail tram to 38th and Blake station and call the hotel for shuttle service. 38th and Blake station is just a rail stop with absolutely nothing around.  Nobody works the station nor and good place to wait for a ride.  In fact, there is some make-shift homeless boxes just over the hill.  How come we could not ride just a bit up the track to Union Station is beyond me.  Had it been my wife or children making a similar trip, I would be pissed that the hotel lets customers stand where no security of any kind is present. So beware!!--- Going back to the airport we got Uber to drive us rather than chance the homeless drop off point.>The breakfast, which is included, was weak.  Instead of sausage or bacon for breakfast we had ham slices. They were in water and looked like it was out of a can.  Had the same ham the entire three days.  All I can say is that it must have been a very large can. The orange juice tasted terrible like it was Orange-ade instead of juice. Everything else was about average.>Before staying at this hotel check out the location.  It is not in the main downtown area but is close. This way it will not be a surprise where the hotel is located.  How a person can claim they did not know where the hotel was located is beyond understanding.  >Overall an average hotel with a great shuttle service and friendly staff. Plus a price, with the services provided, that cannot be beat for the area.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Convenient, clean and great service ","I recently stayed here with family while exploring the area. LOVED this hotel- I was concerned about the reviews but had heard new owners took over and were making lots of changes- we were NOT disappointed! We were treated well from the moment we walked in (smiles) the room was CLEAN and well appointed, beds and linens new, comfy and good quality. The gym was adequately equipped and clean- not crowded - just enough for our needs. Pool was fine and clean; kids had fun - was told they were replacing pool furniture - Free shuttles to many area events - really a nice hotel that keeps getting better! Not the Ritz but we were not expecting that... VERY HAPPY with our stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Stay Away,"My wife and I used Priceline to get a so called 3.5 star hotel in Denver for the Zac Brown Band concert. Priceline selected The Quality Inn Denver, and unfortunately, it was the absolute WORST hotel we've ever stayed in.The facility was run down, dirty and right out disgusting. There was broken patio chairs and trash scattered about the pool area. The carpets were black with dirt and wear marks throughout the entire hotel.In our room there was tiles missing from the bathroom, an entire ceiling tile missing and the shower wouldn't work. The so called arcade had every game turned off, covered in dirt and was being used as a temporary spot to store tables, chairs and whatever else the could store there. Oh, and by the way, you had to walk through the arcade to get to the delapadated pool.The entire hotel smelled of smoke on every floor, to include our ""No smoking"" room, which obviously had been smoked in due to the cigarette burns in the furniture. We use Priceline quite often as our kids play travel Baseball, but if this is a 3.5 star facility in their book, we'll no longer use them.Save yourself the headache, DO NOT STAY HERE.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Rockies Game Stay,"My family and I booked this hotel through Priceline, not knowing what we were getting. Priceline said we would be in a downtown hotel, but this is not downtown. We were attending the Rockies baseball game and wanted to be near the stadium.  This is not near the stadium. There is a free shuttle, but we were unable to take advantage of it because the lines were so long. They were shuttling people to Coors Field as well as the Pepsi Center. We ended up getting an Uber to and from Coors Field. Room: When we arrived, they told us that we had a smoking room. I asked if there was anything that could be done because I didn't want my 5 and 8 year olds around smoke. The front desk lady did make a trade and I was very thankful for her accommodating. We stayed on the 6th floor and it faced the outside pool. Very basic room. Two queen beds, tv, mini fridge, coffee maker, blow dryer, and ironing board. It wasn't the cleanest place I have stayed, but it was ok.Breakfast: The breakfast was included and they offered waffles, cereal, coffee, yogurt, toast, egg beater scrambled eggs, beans, tortillas, ham, and some pastries. We were able to find something.A few things worth mentioning. Every time we entered the elevator, it smelled so strongly of marijuana, so if this bothers you then make sure you get a non smoking room. The location is along two major highways with not a lot nearby, other than a Village Inn next door. If you are staying here for a concert or game, you better line up at least an hour before you want to leave.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Anniversary trip,"My husband and I stayed at the Quality Inn on August 1st as this was our second wedding anniversary and we spent it at a Rockies Game (they won...Go Rockies!). Our room was fine. We did select a cheaper hotel as downtown was insanely expensive that day. The room was not the problem. However, our elevator and hallway overpowered us with marijuana smoke. Now... we are not uptight about marijuana.  We are mid 20 something people and couldn't care less about people choosing to use it as it is in fact legal in CO.   The next morning my husband and I both felt so nauseous as the smoke had been heavily seeping under our door all night.  These were labeled NON SMOKING rooms!  My husband called down to the front desk to let them know we were so uncomfortable and did not sleep well. It wasn't a little bit of weed, It was clouds of it coming in our room.    The manager took some money off of our bill. When we went downstairs there were families and small children in this hotel and we had finally had enough.   I spoke with the manager and she said she had put us on the ""cannabis floor"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! First of all, that's even a thing!? Second of all, we were in a non-smoking room. As a ""manager"", she should have marched up there and charged people smoking and put an end to it as it was effecting other customers. Her reply was ""oh well they're supposed to be using vapes, but they don't. I try to put all people using in the same area because a lot of people come here just for that.""    Ummm wow.  Do you ASK people if that is what they are in town for? Because I as unaware we were stuck on the marijuana use floor.  That is a BIG DEAL. I will never stay here again and will certainly tell everyone I know about our stay and the manager's nonchalant attitude. This place is a JOKE. If you have children or would like to enjoy your stay without leaving with unwanted marijuana in your system, I suggest calling another place.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,I guess you get what you pay for,"So my family and I stayed here for a couple of days for our trip in Denver and the surrounding areas. There was a list of a couple of items that when we booked this place was why we decided to go with this place. We were looking for a place that had breakfast, a pool, a central location for the outings, a fitness/game room and a laundry facility. This had all of those. However, the reality was some of these items were not available. The fitness and game rooms were closed due to renovations, the elevators were slow and often broke down and smelled of weed. We went to complain and we were told that some of the floors were smoking and that he smoke will often waft into the elevators. Ok, understandable, but they made no effort to act apologetic or have a note in the elevator, especially when we do have a person in our party that has sensitive lungs. Next thing on my list of inadequacies is the breakfast. I find it cheap and disgusting when canned fruit is used as the ""fruit option"". It was soaked in the canned fruit juice and was warm after sitting out for a couple of hours. The other breakfast times were ok, but nothing special, your typical bland eggs, biscuits and gravy and bacon. Lastly, the room itself was disappointing. When my family and I got to our rooms we have a checklist to look for. We check the bedding and towels to make sure they're fresh. We were disappointed in finding that the sheets on one of the queen beds was dirty around the feet area. It took an hour for housekeeping to come up to our room and redo the sheets. Additionally, one of the room alarm clocks was fast! I've never seen an electronic alarm clock go twice as fast. We put a note on the clock for housekeeping so they were aware and placed it backwards. However, when we came back for the day, we noticed it was turned around and not replaced. So then we had to take the clock back down to the front desk and notify them directly of the issue. Luckily we have alarms in our phones to use instead but it was rather inconvenient not having a working clock for the remainder of our stay. Some positives about the hotel is the shuttle service, the pool area and the bar. We did not take advantage of the shuttle service but they do offer it to a lot of the main travel locations around Denver with pick up available. The pool was small but adequate and had a nice gazebo area for conversing outside if you wish. Lastly, the bar has very nice staff. They are a little limited in what they have available in terms of labels, but for a small bar in a cheap hotel, I was satisfied with my drinks and the bartender was friendly and accommodating. I probably would not stay here again though.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice Place to Stay,"This hotel is very convenient for activities in Denver.Our room was very clean, and had any amenities that you would need.The free shuttle was a godsend for getting to Coors Field or the 16th St Mall area.Just get in the van, sit back, and let the driver deal with the traffic.All the drivers we had were very friendly and got us to where we were going without any problems, and picked us up quickly when we were ready to return.The breakfast they provide has just about anything imaginable to start your day.We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great stay free shuttle,This place is very clean and extra friendly staff.  Free shuttle to many places- they give u a list at check in.  So convient not to have to fight all the traffic. We went to sixteenth Street Mall and Coors stadium.  Friendly drivers too!!! Good breakfast buffet...choices for everyone.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Awesome stay,"Recently stayed overnight for the Queen concert on July 6th and was very pleasantly surprised at all we got for the money! The onsite restaurant came in handy pre-concert and the free shuttle took us right to the Pepsi Center and was right out front waiting for us when the concert was over. Our room was spotless, beds and pillows comfy and although near the elevators I slept like a log. The breakfast was hot and yummy! (Waffle station! Eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy ...and even used a tortilla to make a breakfast burrito topped with green chili sauce!)  The front desk was so nice and even helped me print my boarding pass! It was an awesome stay for the reasonable price I paid.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,It's Pretty Nice until we smell Smoking Pods on Non-smoking floor,"Compare with other Quality Inn that we stayed before, this is by far the best one.   The breakfast is hot and free, except the oatmeal is too plain, no raisin, nuts etc...  Staff are friendly, there is restaurant inside the hotel.  But we walked to the next door for dinner.  The pie was good.   The Room is spacious, clean, free wi-fi. It's Pretty Nice until we smell Smoking Pods on Non-smoking floor.   We called the front desk and a staff came up and spray the room.   There were smoking floors upstairs.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not the Taj Majal but it gives you everything you need,This is an aging hotel that still is very popular mainly because it gives you everything you need at a reasonable price. Great buffet breakfast to start your day. Shuttle service to downtown (Coors Field) was so convenient. The staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable for all things Denver. The rooms are a bit dated but they are clean and provide nice views of the city. What more could you want.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,WISH I COULD GIVE IT ZERO,"So awful, NOT CLEAN in anyway food on walls, hair everywhere , elevater took 20min waiting for and was full each time so I took the stairs that went through the kitchen. People coughing all over the food in the morning, my shoes stuck to the bathroom floor (yes that dirty I wore shoes)  If it wasn't so late we would have got in the car and drove up the road. Pay the extra money to stay downtown or just drive to Fort Collins.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smoky Smell,"This hotel isn't in a great location. There are railroad tracks very close to the hotel and you can hear cars going over them at night as well as other loud noises. The entire hotel smells of smoke, even the non-smoking rooms. The room had bad lighting and very firm beds. Towels were pretty sketch - one had black marks (probably from mascara) and the bath mat had a fly on it.  I wouldn't stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice visit,"We had a very nice stay in denver. This hotel was priced less than other hotels that were closer to downtown but we had a rental car to get to where we wanted in town. They offer shuttles to some of the main attractions, just not the airport. The free breakfast was really good! Eggs, bacon, bagels and fresh coffee. The rooms were clean but not fancy and the elevator was really slow and there was no stair option even tho we were only on the 2nd floor. I think we might stay there again if visiting Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Non-Smoking room filled with Smoke,"When we got to our floor, the entire floor was filled with smoke as well as our room.  I called the front desk, but the hotel staff simply said they were sold out and I had to bear with it.  But when my friend talked to another staff, we got new room.  I have nothing good to say.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smells like Marijuana,"We took a family vacation and ended up staying at this hotel. The minute we got on the elevator with our kids, my heart sunk. Then we stepped off on the third floor and the smell of marijuana was overwhelming. We complained to the manager and all she said was that the smoking floors were supposed to be the top two levels and simply said sorry. Upon leaving we again complained and she said sorry I understand but AGAIN no offer to make it right. Our room was SO dirty my kids had to leave shoes on. My daughters feet were so black after about 5 steps on the carpet she had to go to the bathroom (that smelled even worse like marijuana) and wash her BLACK feet. We were planning to stay 3 nights but had to end our trip early because we couldn't stay another night in this place.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice Staff!,"I accompanied my students to Denver to attend a national conference in mid June; and chose to stay at Quality Inn because there was no vacancy in any hotel in downtown Denver. This hotel is 4 miles away from downtown Denver; and is located in an industrial neighborhood.Hotel needs a major remodeling and upgrading. The other shortcoming of this hotel is lack of having a good restuarant even though it isn't really close to a one!Because of its proximity from any major attraction points hotel provides free shuttle service on hourly basis between 8:00 am and 10:00 pm; but one should not rely on pick up and drop off time. During our stay, there were few occasions that we had to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to more than one hour for the shuttle service!Finally I should let you know the staff are friendly and willing to help guests.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Great Stay, Great Location!","Nice, quite, clean, friendly. The bathrooms are in need of a little love. Close to the airport with shuttle service. Walking distance to various restaurants. No complaints. We would definitely say here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,OK but not great,"We stayed here as part of an Amtrak package trip. Don't know why it is named Central Denver as it is not within walking distance of downtown. The hotel is near the intersection of two interstate expressways, in a mixed industrial area that had been built up around an old residential section where many of the homes had steel bars on doors and windows. Walking anywhere around here is not convenient and definitely not recommended. However, the hotel has a free shuttle van that goes to the 16th street mall at the top of each hour, but you need to call the front desk in advance to request a pickup/drop-off. The drivers were friendly and quite accommodating-- if time permits will drop you off at another location along the route. The front desk here did not seem too efficient. When we checked in at about 8:30 am on Sunday morning they had a non-smoking room with 2 queens for us. We asked for a king non-smoking room instead. When we put the key card in and opened the door we immediately realized that the room was already occupied (fortunately the occupants were not in the room) so we hurried back to the desk and told them we'd take the room with the 2 queens. This room was OK, décor was dated but seemed clean. There was a refrigerator and microwave in the room.  We were on the second floor right above the front entrance.  We didn't have a problem with road noise as some reviewers have complained about and there was no smoke odor in the room. The free breakfast buffet was better than average. We only had one meal in the restaurant, sandwiches which were OK.  However, in hindsight, we would not have booked this hotel had we taken the time to research more convenient alternatives.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Not exactly ""Quality""","We stayed here for 2 nights. The room was comfortable & looked clean but we found a discarded paper cup under the bedside table (we were trying to switch of the USB charging point). The USB charging point had a very bright blue LED light which lit the room up at night and couldn't be switched off. We had to cover it with a pillow so we could sleep. When we mentioned this to reception they said this wasn't the first time there had been a complaint about it.There was also a constant hum to the building which we found intrusive. Also, there are tea/coffee making facilities in reception & the room but no milk. When we asked for some we were told the fridge was locked and they didn't have the key.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Decent Stay,"Hotel is dated and needs a refresh, but that hasn't affected comfort.  Room was very clean and linens appeared fresh.  Temperature control was key since it was so hot outside and staff were friendly.  Free breakfast buffet is basic but meets a need.  Only issue was restaurant wasn't open for lunch and there isn't much around if you don't have a car.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality??,We were a group of 6 so we had three rooms. The rooms were in need of updating. Two of the rooms were cleaner than the other. The showers in all rooms didn't have enough hot water. Beds were comfortable enough and bedding seemed clean. There is breakfast in the morning and a shuttle runs hourly although not directly to airport. The staff was nice and helpful. There is a lot of road noise from the highways.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality Inn,"My husband and kids stayed at this hotel,when they arrived it was overbooked and they sent them to another hotel. Need less to say it was NOT good. The next day they went back and stayed at the hotel which was fine and my husband complained about the other hotel and they offered to refund him which was great but we bookec thru travel adviser and are not fighting to get a refund. I will NEVER book with trip advisor again. I will go directly to hotel website.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,just okay,"We were a bit disappointed with the hotel.  It was a bit rundown and our room could have been cleaned better.They are a bit away from the center and run a shuttle bus to various locations.  That worked very well for us and we appreciated the service and the drivers.  At times though, they do get a bit too much demand.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,People are nice. Hotel is tired,"At a great price, this is worth a stay. I'm not sure that the location is near anything except for being right off I25 and I70Very nice staff. Sheets and towels seemed cleanMy carpet in my room was filthyThe rooms, bathrooms, and hallways have seen better days and are quite worn outI'm not usually a low rate giver, but for the money, there are better spots",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Central Location, Great Service","Even though this hotel is under renovation, everything was great.  Staff were welcoming, room was comfortable and clean, breakfast had a wide variety, and the food in the restaurant in the evening was good.  Coffee is also available in the lobby all day and a variety of snacks are available for purchase in a small pantry.  The hotel is also centrally located just off the intersection of I-70 and I-25 which makes travel to all other areas of the city fast and fairly easy.  Would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Noisy Rooms,I found my room to be very noisy specially at night with the freeway next to it. It seems the windows are not properly sealed so it fees like the window is open. This should be and easy fix for the hotelBreakfast is OK but the pastries did not seem to be fresh enough to have been baked the same day. Salsa was good but the tortillas were not restocked quickly.Parking is good. The shuttle is useful and require you to call them to pick you up. I used google hangout to make the free call using Wifi although there are not many free wifi points in the city. The pickup can take a while but this is understandable.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,mini vac!,"I thought this was a great hotel, the staff was awesome and very helpful!Ive seen alot of comments about bad shuttles but this service is free so why complain, I used service with no complants.The pool was nice and warm! and the restaurant next door is the bomb!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not worth the money,"This place was dirty and overpriced! There were stains on the comforter, water kept getting cold during shower, tiles were falling out around the tub, light switches were filthy, the vanity was so filthy I had to wipe it down...and then the face cloth was filthy, tv went out during our stay. It needs some updates and heavy duty cleaning!  I wouldn't recommend it or stay again.   On the upside...the breakfast was good, but it still isnt worth the price. ",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Beware! This is a 420 friendly hotel - not suitable for most families.,"Our lacrosse organization (kids aged 8 - 14) booked a block of rooms - the rates and proximity to the Stenger Soccer complex are what drew us to the this hotel. What we didn't know when booking is that this Quality Inn is a ""420 Friendly"" location.  I guess that means pot friendly.  Which really means not family friendly.  At all hours, there was group of pot smokers in front of the building which means that the lobby, elevators, restaurant and pool area smelled of smoke at all times. Ok - so that was our miss as an organization and we need to own that.  But, there were many other issues - our room smelled of cat urine, the showerhead fell off, the bathroom ceiling leaked, and the cable tv was out. When we returned to our room at 4:30 pm on Saturday, it was still not cleaned. …",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great stay,"This hotel was great for the price we paid, staff was very helpful with a shuttle to places, had a snack area to buy food from, decent place to eat in the lobby with bar. Clean and very comfortable rooms not to mention they don't mind 420...",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Near downtown Denver,This is a centrally located hotel in Denver. It's an older hotel. The staff is friendly and the room clean. The things you find I n the room have a lot of miles on the. For example the toilet seat looks dirty but when I tried to clean it it was just the finish coming off in spots. It's right by the I25 so it's quite noisy up here...all day and night. Some sleep better with background noise so you don't hear others staying next door. You're close to the baseball stadium so you have sports fans here that are on a budget. We're here because my wife booked this soccer trip. Personally I would have spent a few more dollars and stayed somewhere in a better location. Lots of guys hanging around outside with backpacks. But we were downtown and there were lots of young people who had…,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Decent Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel June of 2016 with some friends for a trip to Denver. The pool was tiny and gross, half of the lounge chairs were broken. We stayed for 1 week and from day 1 asked for a fridge and finally got one midway through the week (and it was completely broken). They were not helpful but gave us a gift certificate for their restaurant, although we were never able to use it because it was only open such limited hours.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Clean, okay for $100",Stayed for a night enroute to yellow stone. Very standard amenities. Breakfast was standard and okay. Hotel is clean. The sheets and toilet everything was clean and standard. As good as $99/night will buy you. The reception was helpful. They have water and coffee by the reception. No complaints,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clean and Comfortable,"Great stay this weekend - it's come a long way since it was a Best Western.  Will definitely stay again on our next trip to Denver.  Convenient location, comfortable beds, great breakfast and friendly staff.  Also - plenty of parking for a truck and trailer.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disappointing ,"This hotel is not walking distance to Downtown Denver where the stadium, shopping, tourist spots are located. It is not in ""central"" Denver. It is next to a freeway and it is a $10 uber ride to the Union Station. They have a free shuttle that transports guests to the Union Station every top of the hour from 8am to 10pm. The drivers are friendly however inconsistent in that one driver makes sure the foot stool is in place on the ground before letting people in and out of the van and others do not.All the elevators have a strong scent of marijuana and even their designated non-smoking floor (6th) have a strong whiff of pot especially at night. There is a constant loud banging of doors that they should take care of with rubber dividers/ silencers as every time a door opens and shuts make a really loud noise.Our room was not cleaned on our 2nd day. We made sure to take out the privacy tag out of our door before we left in the morning. When we returned at 9:30pm, we immediately noticed a privacy tag swinging from our doorknob. To our horror, our room was not cleaned, the trash bin was not emptied, the towels were not replaced and the bed was not made. My husband called the receptionist to complain and they made my husband go down to the front desk to pick up new towels. Surely one of them could have gone up to deliver?I spoke to Betty the following morning to air my grievance. She apologized and told me she is unable to give me a refund of the 1st day because we booked thru Orbitz. I also spoke to Suzanne on the phone. She apologized and sent me an apology card, ice teas, chips and candies. I appreciate and thank Suzanne (i know she reads this) however it was still a disappointment because even after all her apologies, her housekeeping people still did not replenish our soap, shampoo, conditioner, tissue box and lotion. There was a snowstorm that weekend yet our room temperature was very very warm. I was sweating most of the night and Suzanne said they were having problems regulating the central air. Seriously. There's a basic 4-prong standard for reasonable accommodation: housekeeping, location, comfort and front desk response to an issue.  This Quality Inn in Denver failed to deliver.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great choice for a training/meeting!,"I have hosted an event at this property every year for the past 3 years. The staff has been super helpful and catering has been excellent. In addition, the location is convenient for attendees from around the city and front range.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place for a conference!,I hosted a 2-day conference for my company at this location. The experience was fantastic! The events coordinator (Jess) was great to deal with and she ensured that every detail was checked off. We used their catering service as well and the food was always super fresh with a great presentation. Finding a conference space in Denver was challenging on short notice and these guys really delivered.  Thanks Jess!,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good hotel on outskirts of Denver,"Good hotel on outskirts of Denver, good shuttle bus that drops you off in the centre. Nice big clean rooms and good selections of breakfast food. Staff were very friendly and happy to help. Air con in rooms.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,3 nights in Denver,"Overall, this started out to be a pretty reasonable place to stay. It is out of the way with not much else Round the hotel. The room was big enough, but on the 7th floor, it was still very noisy.  The air conditioner is not really an a/con. It is either set for winter or summer, so in the room at night when it got quite stuffy and warm, we were advised to open the window to allow some cool air in. Which we did and they also bought up a fan for us to use. The breakfast was really good in the hotel however the food in the bistro was somewhat ordinary.Reception staff were wonderful, checking us in early after we had come off the train and were pretty exhausted. The reception staff were the stand out as far as service goes. The hotel advertises that they have a free shuttle to take you downtown.  We used this a couple of times, however this totally let us down on our final day! After calling ahead, as told to do, we waited over 2hours for  our pick up.  3phone calls back to the hotel gave us incorrect information about when the shuttle would be there. (Supposed to pick up each hour) each time I called, I was told he would be there in 15 mins. So we kept waiting and waiting. Finally after the 3rd call,I was told he would be at least another 45 minutes away!! After all that waiting we called an UBER who got us back. But don't advertise this as a bonus if it can't be delivered, or at least tell people the correct ETA so they can make a decision whether to find other means of transport back. Would probably not stay here again due to the transport issues, if I wanted to explore downtown Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Comfortable stay at a reasonable price only a short drive away from Downtown Denver,"Stayed in October 2015..Location is great..Very close (3-4 miles) to downtown Denver area. Easy to drive to almost any place in Denver one would most likely need to go while visiting the city. Although there is a shuttle run by the Hotel to 16th st mall, for all practical purposes one would preferably need to have a vehicle in my opinion. Breakfast was included in the rent and options/quality of food was quite satisfactory. There were a small fridge and a microwave which could be useful.We were visiting Denver for attending a conference in Downtown, so did not spend much time in the hotel itself. Nonetheless, great location for the price and comfortable stay. Friendly Staffs at reservation/check-in counter. No hassle. Enjoyed our stay for three nights and will return if we are back in the area.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Amazing hospitality, memorable stay","I stayed at this fabulous hotel again this year, along with my family. We took the suite on the 5th floor close to the fire exit as this time around we were staying for 10-12 days along with kids and preferred to stay safe. The concierge, the housekeeping, the restaurant staff of the hotel were all so helpful and caring, its impossible to forget that. I now have a place away from home that I can surely call 'home'",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place to stay,"My friend and I came up for a concert and we stayed here. It was very clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. We stayed here two nights and had a very comfortable stay. We will definitely be back on our next trip out here.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Weekend Trip,"So overall, the hotel isn't bad. However, word to the wise, they do allow smoking throughout the hotel. We were next to a room in which the occupants were enjoying some weed/marijuana/mary jane or whatever term you prefer and the smell was quite strong, even though our room was non smoking. I have no problem with people smoking, but I don't particularly like the skunk smell. However, when I called the front desk, they handled it quickly and effectively and moved us to another room. Funny thing is, we had already moved rooms because in the first room the water in the bathtub came out slightly yellow/brown at first. They also handled that quickly and effectively by moving us to the first room mentioned. Anyway, I guess third time is the charm. Oh, and the breakfast is alright.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Long Weekend Trip,"Stayed for a long weekend trip. Our flight was early, so I called to see if it was possible to check in early. I was told over the phone it would be no issue, would take a 45 minutes to an hour to get a room clean. Not a problem. When we went to check in however, we were told it would be an additional 45 minutes. Since we were checking in prior to the standard 3pm, I was not upset. However, we waited for over 2 hours in the lobby told in 30 minute intervals it would be another half hour until the room was ready. The representative at the front desk, (Alissa or Alisha) was incredibly rude. When I asked how much longer it would be, she snapped, ""were doing you a favor by cleaning the room now."" Once into the room it was lovely. Very clean. The breakfast buffet in the mornings were very good, assortment of cereals, fruit, pastries, waffle maker, sausage, bacon, etc. There is also a bar/restaurant in the lobby, but the hours are very restricted. The air conditioning broke on our second day there. Being on the 9th floor and unseasonably warmIn Denver, it was a bit uncomfortable. There was one particular front desk representative that was absolutely fantastic and helpful. Thank you Maria! Overall had a good experience would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good value,Stayed here for 2 nights and the hotel itself isn't bad. It's been updated and the room was nice enough but it did get very hot as the AC clearly wasn't working well. I can't imagine staying here in summer . For the price it wasn't bad.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good place to be,Staff was friendly. Rooms were clean. Breakfast was free and awesome to. There is a bar in the building which has drinks at a decent price.

Although some of the furniture looks a bit dated the hotel itself has been completely renovated with new carpet, bathroom fixtures, etc. The room was very clean. The beds were super comfortable. The buffet breakfast was included in the price and there was even a small bar on site. Only a five minute Uber ride from downtown Denver! Highly recommend. Much better quality than some other Quality Inn-type hotels we have stayed in.",5

The check-in staff in the afternoon were excellent they handled the entire hotel with class there were multiple groups staying at the hotel and everyone was handled with ease and everybody was quite happy. Love the fact that there were shuttles available to take us anywhere we wanted to go and this location is close to the Grizzly Rose. Breakfast with so-so however the staff and the clean rooms more than made up for it and the price was right.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,HORRIBLE Hotel - The worst Choice hotel we have ever stayed at,"This is the hands down worst choice hotel we have ever stayed at.  The hotel shuts off it's AC until March so if you have some warm February days, the rooms are extremely warm and you have no way to cool them down.  We had no hot water even after making several complaints.  The rooms were filthy and after making several complaints, we had to have the manager come up to the room to get the toilet cleaned.  The freeway noise is awful.  The staff is the worst we have encountered.  Absolutely no customer service training.  When we let them know our room had not been cleaned by 7 pm one night, we were told ""What do you want us to do about it?""    We couldn't make coffee in the room because the coffee maker was dirty the entire stay and never was cleaned.  The ""Deluxe Buffet"" consists of the same cold food every day which I am sure does not meet Health Codes in that they are not kept hot.  The onsite restaurant which we chose to try one night was absolutely awful.  We left and went next store to Village Inn to eat.  Don't get tempted to stay here.  YOU WILL REGRET IT.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice for the price.,"Rooms were clean, mostly quiet, comfy bed and pillows, bar/restaurant in hotel, good breakfast buffet included, and free shuttle service available to/from Union Train Station.  I didn't rate as excellent since the water was never more that lukewarm and I could not get the room to heat up.  I did get an extra blanket otherwise would have been freezing.  Oh, FYI 420 smoker friendly.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice but Noisy,"Stayed here because of the shuttle to/from Union Train Station.  The night front desk staff were very nice and greated us warmly. The room and bath were nice and clean and the breakfast was the best I've had in a long time.  Unfortunately, our room was on the Interstate 24 side of the hotel (which is VERY close) and it was noisy which made it difficult for me to fall asleep and stay asleep.  Most of the noise was coming from the windows which could benefit from additional sealing to help cut down on the noise.  If you are a light sleeper, which I am - but my spouse isn't, this would cause a problem.  Wished I knew to request a room AWAY from the interstate.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Comfortable Stay,"I stayed here for 3 nights. It was very close to the customer I was visiting. I had read the reviews and it looked like an ok place to stay. The staff made the visit. They were friendly and helpful. The rooms were nice. The WIFI was strong even on the 5th floor. They do have a smoking floor. It is located in a commercial area with limited eating places. They have an onsite restaurant. However, it is not that great. I ordered a BLT and fries. The fries were very greasy. I would stay here again in a pinch.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Helpful ,"My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights. We found the hotel to be nice. The staff was helpful and the shuttle bus was a big help with us getting around. We were very pleased after the Loopr ride we went in and stopped in the restaurant for the steak sliders they were great and I believe they made fresh horseradish for me. The breakfast was good, I liked the waffle machines they have.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A great hotel 6km from downtown Denver,"We are visiting Denver from Toronto, Canada. The Quality Inn Denver Central is around 30km from the airport and around 6km from Riverwalk Park. The hotel has a shuttle service to the Convention Center, 16th Street Mall, Coors Field, Union Station and Wynkoop Brewery,  elitch gardens and the aquarium. Shuttle leaves on the hour every hour until 10 PM at night. Once downtown one can take the free 16 street Mall shuttle bus that runs from Union station to Capitol Hill. The receptionists were friendly and knowledgeable and checked us in quickly.  We were given a spacious rooms with 2 queen beds on the 5th floor. Rooms have been recently renovated and the beds and pillows are comfortable. The shower has great pressure and the water hot. The hotel is located near the highway but it's proximity to downtown makes it a great location. Breakfast is included and we were very happy with this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent Staff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The front desk staff is, by far, the most courteous, helpful that I have ever encountered. Danielle is awesome.  The breakfast is varied and tastes wonderful.  The hotel is a little dated, however, our experience was amazing.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Much better than my last visit.,"Improvements from my last stay were the shuttle service was much more prompt than my stay in August.  I went to two games at the Pepsi Center and the shuttle took about 20 minutes after my call to arrive the first night and was waiting for me on the second night.  Also the smell of weed was not nearly as prevalent as it was during my August stay.  I don't know if the management is cracking down on this or if the dope smokers have become more courteous.  Service at the front desk has always been good.  Decent breakfast.  This is my favorite place to stay in Denver because of the easy access location, the shuttle, the breakfast and staff.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,National Western Stock Show,"We stayed at this hotel this past week for five nights. We also stayed here last year. The reason we like to stay at this hotel is for the shuttle van service. We arrived at the airport and took the train to 38th and Blake Street Station. From there, we called the hotel and they picked us up. The one thing that I absolutely hate about this hotel is that the room is incredibly HOT! It is miserable! Our room this year and last was on the sun side and you just can't believe how hot it was! I complained and was told that they turn the AC off and only heat is available. The air in Denver is very dry so this makes the room that much worse. Housekeeping is almost non-existent as they don't seem to start cleaning rooms until after noon. There is a mediocre hot breakfast that is included. If you can stand all of the above, then you will be happy with this hotel because of the shuttle! It saved us the cost of a rental car to go back and forth to the NWSS. The hotel restaurant is nothing special. One night we went in 1/2 hour before they closed and the waitress was a little rude and said the kitchen was closing and we had to order immediately even though they were open another 1/2 hour.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,This place is great,"If you are in Denver for an event or to sight see this is the place.  Very centrally located and a FREE shuttle that runs early AM until 10 at night that will drop you and pick you up at several designated locations, saves a lot of cab fare!  The rooms are comfy, the continental breakfast is good and there is a lounge on property.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst service I have seen in a long time.,"Since the moment we checked in, we got the impression that we were bothering the staff and not worth their time. We had to call for a shuttle three times before it came to pick us up from downtown. I took my kids down for breakfast and the staff, especially the manager was extremely rude. My daughter tried to tell her that they were running out of a few things and the manager snapped at her when telling her that it had already been taken care of. Then I asked her to fill the creamers, and she informed me that it wasn't her job to fill the creamers because she was the manager and didn't do that. She told me I was asking the wrong person. She proceeded to stand next to me with another employee and talk about how rude I was for asking her to help in the kitchen. I will never come back to this hotel and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Bad start on busy weekend but decent stay over all,We were staying here over a particularly busy weekend causing a bunch of confusing and chaos among the staff but eventually they figured everything out and the hotel was good after that. The restaurant on site was pretty good and their breakfast was enjoyable. The place was clean and fairly cheap so I can't really complain.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality is DECLINING fast!,"We first stayed at this hotel about 1 year ago and it immediately became our ""go to"" hotel for our frequent trips to Denver. Over our several stays this year the quality of the hotel has declined greatly each time. During this (our most recent) trip we had two rooms (we usually do). In the first room there was hair IN the bed. They eventually sent someone up to change the sheets. The heater was not working at all in that room, they brought up a space heater (after making us feel like it was somehow our fault that the heater didn't work). In the second room the heater made an awful sound for about 10 minutes every time it came on. Then, on the last day of our 3 day stay, there was no hot water (in the entire hotel) at all. We were told it was because everyone coming back from the game showered at the same time. At 3:30 a.m. the next morning, when we were preparing to leave there was still no hot water. The breakfast offered has declined greatly as well. Initially when we started staying here we couldn't say enough good things about the breakfast, now, and the past couple of times we have stayed here it has been very lacking. The sausage wasn't even heated through, the eggs are now some type of ""boil in the bag"" eggs, not good at all, the biscuits hadn't even been defrosted and the potatoes were hard and crunchy and tasted at least day old. The chairs that sit around the hallway on the 9th floor (this is the floor we always stay on) are now damaged with their covers hanging half off, the carpet needs a thorough cleaning throughout the entire property. It snowed about a foot our first night there, they had not even attempted to clear the parking lot before we left (2 days later). This was odd to me because almost everywhere else, even small convenience stores had at least started to clear their parking lots. We asked for room service to come in and clean the bathroom only (in one of the rooms) and replace towels, etc. They came and replaced towels and cups and did nothing else. Every morning that we were there (around 4:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.) there was no coffee in the lobby. If there was coffee (there was the morning we were leaving), then there was no sugar and/or creamer and no lids for the cups. I am very disappointed because we really enjoy staying at this location, it is close to everything and the employees are always extremely nice. Hopefully this location will put a little back in to their facility and bring it back up to nice standards with the rooms, breakfast as well as the entire property. If not, we will have to find another ""go to"" hotel for our frequent stays in the area.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Do you like hot water on cold days after being left in the snow in 6 degree weather for a hour?,"If I could leave 0 stars I would. They have a free shuttle that you can call and they will pick you up, sounds great until you call them after a Denver game in the 6 degree (F) weather and they don't come for over an hour and there are 11 other people waiting. Some of those people were waiting at that spot for hours with promises the shuttle was on the way and never came. Then after that game same game the vending machines on the 9th floor didn't work oh and there is NO hot water. There only explaination is oh to many people must bring taking a hot shower at the same time! This place has been nothing short of a nightmare! I will never come back to another quality inn.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A Hidden Gem hiding in an industrial neighborhood.,"Read the reviews about this QI property, and..... they're all true! Great room price, the best hotel hot breakfast buffet I've seen in well over a decade (if not longer), the showers in the rooms are three steps above outstanding, the rooms were spacious, beds were good for sleeping (I'm used to a waterbed, and finding a hotel mattress that I can sleep on is RARE, mine was one of the rare ones)... Staff was VERY courteous and on top of everything that needed to be attended to (which wasn't much). Rooms have nice flat-screen TV, most have small microwave and fridge (it looks like the people there are re-doing the rooms from the main story upwards, so this may be addressed real soon in 6th floor and up). Amenities are very good, and include individual cup coffee (with decaf and TEA).There are just a few niggly-bits, though: (1) yes it is in an industrial area adjoining a.... questionable... neighborhood. Staff is on top of that situation, though, so personal safety was not an issue, even out in the designated outdoor smoking area (a nice circle of benches around a fir tree that is VERY well lit). (2) it is near the freeway, and the noise was a wee bit noticeable (I live out in the exurbs, so I'm used to near-dead quiet). It is NOT BAD and I have seen MUCH WORSE out there. Might want to bring earplugs if that's a concern. (3) getting to the place. TIP: if coming from the south on I-25, take the exit from I-25 to I-70, then take the first exit you come to off of I-70. Take the first right off the roundabout (48th) and backtrack past the rail yard overpass, and you'll see it on your right. Easy-peasy. Coming from the north on I-25? Just take the 48th Ave exit and it almost drops you on the doorstep. (4) There are GOBS of power outlets in the room, including a double-USB charging point. That  charging-point is the niggly-bit... it is one of those with the blue LEDs all around it. At night, that thing FLOODS the room. If one is a dark-room sleeper, prepare to use a bunch of towels and/or pillows to cover that. Or, just unplug it and put it in the bedstand drawer.OVERALL: I would DEFINITELY recommend, especially if you can get a good rate. Their shuttle is great (except that it stops at 10pm, better uber back if you're going evening-hopping), even though we had our own vehicles. Pick this place and NOT the Ramada just up the street. You'll be glad you did!",5

Thank you all.  = )",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Girls Winter Weekend,"My cousin and I stayed here last weekend and really have no complaints. But it is all what you are looking for.  This is a basic hotel that is OUTSIDE of the city and located in a relatively industrial area.  The hotel serves a nice hot breakfast each morning for free and has relatively good service.  The BEST part about this hotel is the FREE shuttle to Downtown Denver. Because the hotel is located about 15 minutes outside of Downtown Denver they have a shuttle that runs pretty much every where you need to go downtown.  Denver is a metropolitan city and parking is a pain as well as expensive!  So leave the driving to the shuttle.  They took and picked us up from our Nuggets game at the Pepsi Center.  They dropped and picked us up from the 16th street mall area where everything is, and included the Parade of Lights last weekend.  Honestly the shuttle was the highlight of the hotel to me.  It is a decent hotel but all floors are supposed to be smoke free but EVERYONE is smoking on the floors.  Again, it's all what you are looking for, it was perfect for us and we had no complaints.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good price, decent room, excellent service","Stay there for 4 days this week. The free shuttle  and breakfast are very nice.Service is excellent.Room is clean and cozy.The only problem is the noise from high way, but it's still worth the money.Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Friendly Staff,"We booked this direct because we got a good price due to hubby's connection with the business he has at the convention center nearby. The staff who greeted us the night we arrived was very nice and pleasant. The room was ok, not that bad but could improve a little. There's no fridge in the room but there were some outside the room so hubby took it inside so we can use during our stay. We thought it should have been for us but they didn't place it inside the room. The location of the hotel is surrounded by industrial neighborhoods. Denver is an industrial city and I'm sure there's a lot of work in this city. I was hoping the hotel would be in a nicer neighborhood but our driver who picked us up at the airport said the neighborhood is turning. It's not bad, just not in the heart of downtown Denver. The breakfast is ok but I didn't eat scrambled eggs here because it's  powder egg type. There's potato, yogurt, fruits, muffins, waffle, English muffins that I could eat. It's limited but hubby's super creative with food. Do not worry about breakfast here, just go next door to Village Inn and enjoy your breakfast if you get tired with breakfast here. We ordered breakfast from next door once. If you need to print something, they allow up to 6 pages at a time. There's a manager (I think) who we saw everyday walking around greeting people. The management and team were very friendly, including the shuttle drivers. The pool season is over so they closed the pool although the weather  was warm and sunny. The hotel needs some type of makeover.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Mile High Hotel,"I stayed here as it was approved lodging for the company that I work for.  Had I been visiting for pleasure I would have looked elsewhere.Pros:* close to my place of employment* night front desk person was very friendly and recommended a good place to eat* newer mattress* decent wi-fiCons:* entire hotel smelt like stale cigarette smoke and pot* people higher than rail riders at a Phish concert* bathroom was not clean, especially the shower* limited low-def TV* free breakfast* train noise* lack of hot water for shower",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The Staff is what makes this hotel so delightfu,"I stayed here for 4 days and I really enjoyed it. The hotel itself has seen better days, but they really keep it clean and it is priced right. The hotel is only about a 12-15 min drive from Downtown and they do offer a shuttle service. The staff are excellent, I'm sure that's the reason the hotel does so well. Betty, the manager, and Marci, at the bar, are outstanding! They really make u feel welcomed and it's genuine.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Okay ,Stayed one night while driving a tour bus for a group playing in the area. Not the best. The staff was exceptional. I had to move to another room because the a/c was not working. Then the one I was in was barely okay. I was able to sleep but not that well. This place is old and I don't think it's in a good part of town. But it's where they booked me. The room did have fairly new furniture but it was cheap stuff. The water pressure in the shower wasn't much. Not recommended.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Awesome 420 friendly hotel Suprisingly Excellent Service,"We stayed during the summer for a couple days in July and despite the strange location were very satisfied with our choice. For the price it can't be beat, and the girls at the front desk were fabulous!!! Especially DANIELLE!! Thank you!!! You really made our trip, and deserve a raise!!! Because of you, we enjoyed our stay in Denver even more by going out of your way to make sure everything was great for us, truly above and beyond any other place we've stayed. Kudos to your bosses for hiring you.  Plus, the free shuttle is great!! Next time we're in Denver, we'll be booking with you again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Denver 420 Anniversary,"Stayed on the 8th floor for five days, great service, coulda used a little heat the first day, and that wasn't working but the temps rose to high eighties so that was fine. The rooms are clean, a little worn on the furniture, but clean and the bed was a king size and very comfortable. Close to all the attractions going on this time of year. Thanks for a great vacation, will definitely be back.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Surprisingly Satisfied,"After reading terrible reviews on this hotel, I was unfortunately disappointed when my third party hotel purchase through Priceline booked this through an express deal. HOWEVER, I was certainly surprised when I saw how clean the rooms were and updated as well. They have a nice bar inside and the complimentary breakfast was so nice with a HUGE variety as well. They provide shuttle service and it is close enough to downtown Denver and the surrounding area for a short drive if needed. I would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Room for improvement ,"I stayed her because I did not want to pay $300 to be in a better location. So it is industrial as other reviews mention but it does have free shuttle service. The staff is hard working.  The breakfast is great. I loved the Mexican theme. The problem is the room. Yes the hallways stink but I was pretty disappointed when I first walked into my room. It's totally a smoking room.  It feels dingy. The sink at the wet bar didn't work and the ceiling tile right above it was filthy.  I didn't want to put any food or drinks near the food and drink area.  You're really paying to be near downtown because he room is not worth it's rate. But what I don't understand is there are 9 floors -213 rooms that fill up on many nights. That's a lot of dinero coming in. How much is a new ceiling tile??  And what are young people allowed to hang out in the lobby all day?  They clearly don't have a room there. That's kind of strange. The next day I found a nice hotel 15 min away and was much happier. If being close to downtown on a budget is important then yes, absolutely stay here. But if location isn't that important, move on.  I'm sorry for the staff because they get 5 stars. But the hotel just needs improvement",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,4 nights in Denver,"Our room was spacious, comfortable and clean, including the bathroom. Staff was friendly and helpful. The location is industrial, so not the best choice if you want to roam on foot from the hotel. The only negative for us was the scarcity of hot water for showering in the morning.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Stay in Denver,"My husband used a Priceline Express Deal ($100/Denver Downtown 3 Star Hotel) and was given a room at the Quality Inn Denver Central on W. 48th Avenue. We were disappointed to find out that it's on the very outside legal limits to be considered in the downtown area but tried to remain optimistic. Priceline has failed us in those darn Express Deals many times.First impression of this hotel is that it was, indeed, not close to anything downtown. It's in a more industrial area. The hotel itself is clean, had a very friendly staff, and offered a free shuttle to various areas such as 16th Street, Union Station, ect. It runs every hour but has limited capacity. (We used Uber the entire trip) We had a room on the 3rd floor and enjoyed the spacious room with a far off mountain view. The beds were comfy, the room was clean, and it was quiet. For a 3 Star hotel it was pretty good. One thing I would note as previous guests have said is that there's a whole lot of pot smoking happening here. There was always a whiff of it at any given time throughout the halls- but this is Colorado and it's legal. It was not disturbing to us and all guests were quite calm and quiet. The free morning breakfast was not so good for us- but we tend to like healthier options and there weren't any. I would recommend this hotel to travelers passing through Denver or wanting a more affordable hotel not too far from downtown.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,This hotel was disgusting! Don't stay here!,"I booked this hotel last minute on a flash deal from Priceline. The flash deal said to let the hotel know if you preferred non smoking. I called to let them know and they didn't take down my name or reservation number just said they would take care of it... I should have known right there. I got there and they had put me in a smoking room. I am not a smoker, I told her no I need a non smoking room. Sabrina the front desk clerk was very unfriendly and said there was nothing they could do because I booked through Priceline. She stated they were completely booked so I couldn't have a different room. I asked if there would be a way I could get a refund since they didn't have the room I wanted and she said it was a non-refundable room... I was only going to be there for 2 days so I bit the bullet. I got up to the room and it smelled like I was walking into an ashtray! Not only that but the room was covered in a disgusting ""smokers film"" I wanted to vomit... I will attach pictures so you can see. I understand it being a smoking room, but this is just negligence! I have tried to file a formal complaint with the hotel they tell me its Priceline's fault, I try to file a complaint with Priceline, they tell me its the Hotels fault! I am sooooo upset by all of this... I have had to throw out my luggage and travel items that I cant wash! This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I signed up for Trip Advisor just so people will know about how terrible this hotel was. I didn't get a good picture of the beds, but those were completely uncomfortable, they were too close to the floor and they were hard as a rock!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Great Customer Service, Poor Facility","I actually booked through a 3rd party app (priceline.com), I wanted a hotel downtown and 3.5 stars. This hotel was neither downtown (central Denver, 3 miles from downtown) and not 3.5 stars at all. Also, come to find out, this hotel puts all 3rd party customers on the 9th floor, which is the floor for smokers. We opened our door and was immediately hit with a pot smell. I went right away to talk to the staff without looking at the rest of the room., Unfortunately they didn't have a non-smoking room available. So she offered to have house keeping come spray the room. So i go back to the room, only to realize that the wallpaper is falling off and bubbling, the ceiling has water marks and looks like it's going to fall in the corner, and it just looked unsanitary. So while I'm surveying the rest of the room, housekeeping comes and uses some spray for the pot smell. The spray didn't help, and I went to talk to the manager because we weren't going to be able to stay with that smoke smell. My friend has asthma and was wheezing already. I will give it to the staff though. They have amazing customer service. It's just to bad that they have to work in such poor conditions and probably have to put up with many complaints. After talking to the manager, I was able to get a full refund from priceline.com.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Stinky hallways but clean,"It wasn't bad, but we regretted staying here.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,just below standards,"The staff was above-average friendly and courteous. The location needed much to be desired the hotel itself had an interesting design but needed to be updated. Tape over the elevator signs parking lot was trashed most of the time I always found something next to my car each time I got into it.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A room with a buzz!,"Stayed one night here while in town for a Rockies game.  Room was clean and pretty nice but the entire hotel smelled like pot.  Hallways, elevator and lobby all wreaked of pot and there were people standing outside the front door smoking a joint.  I don't personally care what people do in privacy but I'd prefer not to have get a buzz just by walking to my room.  You'd think the management would at least tell them to go to their room and not stand in front of the hotel lighting up.  There was a long line at check in time so that was a bit of a process.  Overall not overly thrilled with our stay here.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very good option for your stay.,"This is a good hotel to choose for your stay. About 21 miles from the Denver Airport and short drive from the very heart of the city it does offer a shuttle to the Convention Center and all central locations. The hotel is right off the highway so it is best to consider ear plugs if you are sensitive to noise but the rooms are standard-nice and the bedding is good. There is in-room coffee/tea station, fridge and microwave oven. The breakfast is included. It takes place in The Palm Grill and offers eggs,ham, cereal, breads and fruit.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice inside,"The room was clean and comfortable, with both firm and soft pillows on each bed, and the price was great. The shuttle to the downtown area was great, since parking might have been difficult.  The only downside is that it is in an industrial area, and when we returned Saturday night, there was a strong smell of raw sewage outside the hotel.  This is not something they could control, I am sure, but it was off-putting. Also, when I went to get a room for the next weekend, the price had gone up 50%, and I am not sure it would be worth that much.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Three days in Denver,"Room was large and clean . Free wi-fi included and work okay.  No refrigerator.  Parking was a problem because the hotel was full and vendors selling rocks outside and inside the hotel. There was free shuttle service downtown.   Also had a problem getting hot water and a running toilet.  The staff were friendly, especially the shuttle drivers.  This hotel is in an industrial area and near interstate 70 and 25.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Another great stay,"My second stay at this Quality Inn was again a great stay. Like I said in my previous review, this is not the Ritz. But what really separates this Budget hotel from the other Budget hotels is the up keep and the great staff. You find the staff constantly cleaning all the areas. Even during the breakfast buffet, which is quite good, by the way, the staff is making sure any used tables are cleaned off. It may be a Budget hotel, but the staff provides 5 star service. I must confess I had a concern in rebooking this hotel because some of the reviews indicated they could smell weed throughout the hotel. Well, I can only conclude that those reviewers were smoking their own dope because I never got a whiff of any weed. Even standing outside where they have designated areas for smoking cigarettes away from the main entrance, I couldn't smell any smoke. Although the hotel is outside the main city center, the free shuttle to the 16th Street Mall, as well as other drop off points, makes the location quite convenient.I would recommend booking directly with Choicehotel so you can get the best price point.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,I should have spent more money,It is my first day and I wonder if I am going to stay. The receptionist put me in the mood because he was so rude. The hotel is in the middle of the freeway and a railway but it is much more noisy inside. The swimming pool doesn't work. The remote control of the TV doesn't work. My car was blocked by a truck. Well if you haven't booked your hotel in Denver you should probably think it twice before choosing this one.,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Steve Mora GM of the Year,My organization held an event at the Quality Inn Central Denver.  The entire staff made our event successful.  They worked with us on everything from the buffet meals to the accommodating our guests.  Friendly and professional!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,No Where Near LoDo (lower Denver),"Thought the bid I won on Priceline was a deal, especially since the property was advertised to be in one of the coolest neighborhoods and it had a pool.  Wrong on both counts.The best shuttle took twists and turns through industrial neighborhoods upon pickup from Denver's Union Station.   The very helpful and informative driver told us that technically when we went under a particular bridge we were on the outskirts of the desired/advertised neighborhood.   As we thought we were close to downtown Denver we had not made arrangements for a rental car.  Even if we had there was no parking available due to a huge gem and mineral show.  This hotel was one of the locations.  With all of that at least a dip in the pool could be provide some relaxation.   Towels were advertised to be gotten at the reception desk, where we were told not to use the pool.   Unsanitary?   It looked to be the case. One bright spot besides the male shuttle tour guide/driver was the delightful front desk attendant Silvia.  After being snarled at by Erin not five minutes prior (no rooms are ready until 3pm) Silvia offered to check and cheerfully gave us our room key.   Guess who got a good tip?The room had clearly been occupied by smokers in the past.   Even the slipcover over the eorn chair reeked.   Too tired to move after an overnight on Amtrak coaches from Chicago, we crashed.    Rather literally.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Think Frat House,"The first room, the heating didn't work and there was jack hammer construction going on outside at 3 am. The staff are very helpful and moved me to the far side (pool side) which was much more peaceful. However, the room furniture was covered in visible stains - Disgusting. I didn't even want to lay my suit case or clothes on the couch, let alone sit down. I moved to an airbnb after one night at this place and wish I'd done that in the first place!",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Couldn't fault it,"Large comfortable rooms, friendly staff, excellent hot breakfast with lots of choice, good restaurant food which was well priced, good beer selection, reliable shuttle service. Only down side was that the pool was out of service.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality Place to stay,"This hotel was our first stop on our American Roadtrip. It's always a bit disorientating when arriving after a long flight, and the reception area seemed really busy. We were checked in quite fast and got up to our room with no problems. Everything was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The next day we had breakfast which was good then we used the shuttle to go into town. The pool was a nice area to chill out in after our day exploring Denver. All staff here were really nice.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good service and a nice hotel,"We stayed here one night. The room was big enough for the four of us, everything was clean and we had a perfect dinner/breakfast. Unfortunatly, I lost my wallet in the room. I realized this back home in The Netherlands. After a email-session with Alissa from the frontoffice, the wallet is now on his way back home. So the staff helped me out well! Conclusion: I enjoyed my stay and I reccomend it to the ones who'd love the great service and a basic, but good room.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good breakfast but room was a bit shabby,"My husband chose this hotel for its convenient location and queen sized beds. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were big, but the decor was shabby and the wall paper was peeling off in places. Also, the shower did not drain very well.  We did tell the desk about the shower when we checked out. The breakfast was delicious, and we liked the free shuttle to the 16th Street Mall. We did not call for a ride back to the hotel because we got a ride back to the hotel from a relative. The prices for hotel rooms in Denver have shot up recently. I would have rather stayed in a hotel near Cherry Creek because of proximity to relatives, but this hotel was much cheaper.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Nice Rooms, Odd location",This was a good hotel with a decent rate. The location is a little inconvenient but made up for by the good rate and the good quality of the hotel. The staff was very nice. The room was clean and maintained. I had a nice view of the mountains from the 7th floor room. The west face room I was in did have a bit of highway noise cause you are right next to I-70. I would definitely stay here again. The breakfast was a standard hotel breakfast. good coffee.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Comfortable room, LOUD hallways","Comfortable room, but SO MANY party people wandering the lobby and hallways. We had to call the front desk about a group of drunken men in our hallway late at night. Drunk people and MJ smokers all about, and this was on a Monday night... If you have pets, be SURE to call and let them know because they won't read your reservation notes. Breakfast was very good for a freebie.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,This stay a little disappointing.,"Pros:  Room was clean, Breakfast was decent, but I thought it was better in my past stays.  Easy access to highways.  The staff was very helpful.Cons:  Shuttle service was disappointing.  After the Rockies game on Monday, about 25 of us waited for 45 minutes for a ride back to the hotel.  The shuttle driver said  he didn't know the game was over since no one called.  I know I placed at least 4 calls to the hotel and everyone else called several times but no one would answer the calls.  Quite a few took cabs back.  Also, the faucets in the shower were not properly hooked up.  It took until the second day of my stay that the ""c"" on the shower faucet means hot.  Lastly, I realize that weed is legal in Colorado, however, when I stay on a non smoking floor I expect to not have to smell it.  The hallways constantly smelled like a skunk was let loose.  I expected that in my last 2 stays since I was in Denver during the annual 4/20 festival.  However in August,  I would like a reprieve from it.  Not sure I am going to stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good location for sports games, needs updating.","Staff is friendly and helpful, bed linens were nice, free and ample parking, shuttle and breakfast.  We stayed in a king suite and my kids slept on the two pull out couches which were very old, uncomfortable and one had many broken springs (even for a pull out).  King mattress needs replacement.  It was nice to have a full size refrigerator, microwave and two baths.  Room was clean, but due to its outdated furnishings, it seemed dingy. Interior door between areas didn't latch and therefore didn't lock.  The exterior doors are thin and you could here other guests come and go in the hallway quite easily.  Elevators are slow and at check in there was a bit of a wait.  Nice outlet for phones to charge on.  Free wi-fi.  We didn't use the shuttle to get to Coors Field, but a large group of people were waiting for it.  We didn't eat breakfast there, but the restaurant looked nice.  Overall, this was our least favorite Quality Inn that we have stayed at.  It just needs some updates as the location is very convenient.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Filthy beds, terrible elevator, no luggage carts, terrible wifi, awful shower, but very nice staff.","I think that the housekeepers who tend the rooms here should be fired immediately. The beds were very clearly dirty when I returned from my day out exploring Denver, and there was a huge stain in the sink from where she had poured some brown liquid, which was most likely coffee or something, and not even bothered to rinse it out. The housekeeper also threw away a ton of my toiletries for some reason. Not only that, but the bed was absolutely filthy with a bunch of lint or some other crap under the sheets. The elevator was incredibly slow and never got to my floor with less than 2-3 minutes of standing there waiting for it. The elevators also smell like homeless people most of the time. The wifi was awful as well. I understand that the hotel may be booked or very full, bujt internet is a necessity these days and I think that hotels should build internet infrastructure that can handle the entire hotel being booked... My room's shower also never worked correctly. When I tried to take a shower, the water was either scalding hot or freezing cold, and on top of that, the water never drained properly and pooled in the tub whether or not I unplugged the drain. The only bright spot for me was the very nice staff who were willing to at least try to make the stay tolerable. The man in charge of the decent breakfast was probably the nicest of all the staff. He was very friendly and congenial. If the staff, minus the embarrassingly bad housekeepers, were all moved to a hotel that wasn't awful, that would probably be one of the best hotels in Denver. All in all, if you don't mind filthy, disgusting, abysmally kept rooms that are seemingly dirtier when you return than you left it, then stay here. The hotel is also really far away from everything and in an industrial area next to a train track.I feel kind of bad for leaving this review because the staff was so nice, but the hotel really needs some work and the housekeepers need to do their job. I just can't leave a positive review when there were hairs, lint, and little bits of dirt in my sheets when I returned to the hotel that is supposed to clean my sheets daily. The sheets also had stains all on them in multiple spots. Much worse than any hotel I've ever stayed at, but it's a quality inn, so I don't know what I expected.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great for what you pay ,PROS• friendly staff• decent breakfast • clean rooms and comfy beds • free parking - can view from room too • free shuttle - didn't use but other guests were telling me how great it was • close to highway - noise wasn't an issue• close to downtown - 10 mins driveCONS• elevators were very slow; not sure if this was done for safety etc • food from hotel restaurant was a bit pricey for what you get Note: this hotel is located in an industrial area. I don't find this as an issue (especially as a majority of travellers will rent cars in Colorado) but worth noting as you wouldn't be able to do any night time strolls or nightlife or dining around hotel Overall a decent hotel for the price.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Better than the average Quality Inn,"The hotel is about 3-4 miles outside of downtown Denver and is right next to the highway.  The area is not the prettiest area but it certainly did not seem unsafe.  The front desk staff is very helpful and friendly.  There is the Palm restaurant right off the lobby.  There is also the fitness center (which has a treadmill, an elliptical, a bike and a small Smith machine), a game room and the hallway for the pool.The not so good stuff: only 2 of the 3 elevators were working and sometimes the wait was 10 minutes for one to come.  The stairwells are not meant to publicly accessed unless there is an emergency (as the signs stated).  We got desperate and told the front desk we were taking the stairs, they said it was okay because the alarm only rings at the front desk. If you know your elevators are slow and one is out, why not make the stairs accessible? Also, the bathroom towels: they were obviously washed but EVERY SINGLE ONE had lots of ladies hair wound up in them.  You could visibly see it on them on the shelf and even when you thought they were all out as you dried off you were pulling hair off your body. The pool area looked decent but it seemed to have odd hours (it opened around 1 pm or 2 p.m).The room was a nice size and had a microwave and refrigerator.  The bed was comfortable and the linen seemed clean.  The bathroom was a nice size but that is where you could tell that the hotel needs some upgrading.  You could see that the caulking was wearing and you could see the mold in the caulk around the toilet and the tub.  The breakfast was decent - a meat (sausage or ham when I was there), eggs, bread, cereal, yogurt, muffins and juice.  The Palm restaurant had a wonderful chicken salad that was a nice size ( a little pricey but great).Overall I was pleasantly surprised at this Quality Inn, though there were some downsides.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Solid Quality Inn,"I agree with many of the other posters in their initial hesitancy to book due to the location.The property is NOT a downtown Denver property but they have a full steam shuttle that will take you to and pick you up from everything from the corner grocery all the way up to a Rockies game.The rooms are not the Ritz quality but are just fine.  My only gripe as a Diamond Hilton guy is that I'm used to a dedicated desk with desk chair with multiple power connections up top. Here I've got stuff plugged up in the main room plus the bathroom.That said, Its a good value unless you are looking for a shuttle out to the airport which I know know is almost 25 miles away!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Needs more help ,Was a comfortable room nice beds good stay. I would not eat at the restaurant in the lobby check my review of the Palm restaurant. Desk clerk seamed overwhelmed. Not enough help in the restaurant. The room was missing a light bulb between the beds. Found lunch meat in the refrigerator. For the price I was hoping for a better stay.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Go Quality,This hotel is easy access from interstate 70. It was pet friendly. The room was clean and roomy. Breakfast was included. Staff was very courteous and efficient. We had a king-sized bed which was very comfortable. Only drawback was the elevators. Being on a lower floor of the hotel we had to wait about 5 minutes to get to the lobby. (It was packed with people from upper floors.),4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Summer 16 Denver Road Trip,"Booked a room here for me and my girlfriend in the middle of July for two nights and we were not disappointed! Chose the ""room with a view"" (701) when booking and they delivered with a gorgeous, romantic, panoramic view of the Denver skyline. Additionally was able to keep an eye on my car from the window in the room although there didn't seem to be anything to worry about seeing as the parking lot was well lit. Aside from a fridge not being standard in the room everything else was excellent. The room was the cleanest we have ever stayed in by far and the bed was super comfortable. Complimentary breakfast in the morning was surprisingly delicious and filling with a nice variety to keep everyone happy. Front desk attendants were helpful and friendly. On top of all of this the location makes it quick and easy to get downtown or really anywhere in the Denver Metro. Only complaint aside from the lack of a fridge (had to pay extra to have one sent up) was the fact that the elevators are as slow as molasses other than that terrific stay and will definitely be back in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Free shuttle from A line stop is great!,Only stayed one night and got in late but very friendly helpful staff. I called from airport after getting in 2 hours late due to weather and they advised I take the train to 38th & Blake and I called when I arrived there and they picked us up on 5 minutes. Room was nothing special but fine and free breakfast was pretty good. And then they kindly drove me to the nearby rental car place so I could get my car ( which was half the price of renting at the airport. All in all a good deal!,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great customer service,"When I first saw the location I was skeptical, but stay turned out great. Most impressive was the customer service and friendly employees. Great included breakfast, clean rooms, shuttle to downtown.  Room a little noisy, but overall good value.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Could have been better,"I want to say that the staff was friendly, but there are many things that could have been way better.1. The room was way too warm, and you could not get it to cool down at all.  The thermostat said it was 60 degrees, but there is no way it was that cool.  It was more like 78 degrees in the room.2. The elevators were extremely slow.  Had to wait almost 10 minutes at times to go up or down, and we were only on the 2nd floor.  There was only emergency stair access too, so you could not take advantage of using the stairs.3.  there was mold on the ceiling of the bathroom, and some trash that was in under the sink that was there the whole time we were.4. Their pool towels are the size of a hand towel, there is no way to dry off without using several.5. One of the comforters was soiled with black hair or something when we turned down the bed the first night we were there.6. The shuttle did not have working air, and my seat belt did not work.  The shuttle driver shut us in there with no air while he went to see if he could find other hotel patrons.7. Are coffee items we had used during the day were not always replaced for the next day, we would have to go down to the front desk and ask, and then they did not have any regular coffee down there, just decaf to use in the room.8. It was often loud and you could hear here people out in the front, including dogs barking, which made getting sleep hard.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Price Quality ok...,"I stayed here for 4 nights, clean hotel, clean rooms and complete with everything you need.Staff very friendly and helpful.Breakfast in the corner of the restaurant / bar. Proposed more than varied.Ideally positioned for the various movements to and from the city.They offer a shuttle service to some location, but better be well informed on the course and timing.I`ve not used it, because in the city of Denver is easy to find parking.Recommended.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great staff,"thank u and ur staff for a great weekend. The front desk clerk that checked us in was so very sweet, u don't always get that lucky... she is one in a million. They let us check in early which was fantastic. The only part that wasn't amazing is coming back from the Rockies on Saturday the bar called last call... there was at least 15 people in there and it wasnt but 1030. This happens honestly everytime we stay there, not sure why they don't want to stay late. But once again for a great stay",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great hotel experience,"The customer service was impeccable. Everyone working was busy making sure all visitors where taken care of. The hotel lobby was always being cleaned by someone and the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel does need to be updated as it appears that the carpet and furniture is old and needs to be replaced. Our room was very clean and the maid staff was very attentive to our needs. We stay for over 10 days and enjoyed the pool, weight room, free breakfast, free shuttle service to light rail and local restaurants, laundry machines on 5th floor, free coffee and a mini store with snacks for purchase was nice to have for late night snacking. The location of the Hotel is perfect as it is right off I-25 and 10-15 minutes away from several attractions, including downtown Denver, Elitch Amusement park, Water World, Dave and Busters, Boondocks and many restaurants located in the new and renovated Highlands neighborhood.  We loved the location and felt all the hotel really need was to  updated some of the carpeting and furniture, and become a no smoking hotel. We highly recommend this Hotel for families that are vacationing for long or short visit as it has all the amenities you would need and the staff was amazing.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Dirty, smelly and overpriced","This hotel is badly in need of a makeover. Room smelled like stale smoke, dirty carpets, trash left behind night stands, in one word yuk! I will sleep in my car rather than sleeping in this place again. Did I mention way overpriced?",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good size rooms, hotel shows age but is well managed","Rooms where of good size (reason I gave 4 stars), hotel shows age but everything was in good working order and functional. Smoking is allowed in the hotel which one could notice, we however got a non smoking room and it was OK. Pool was good and nicely appointed - having an outdoor pool was the reason I booked here during a huge summer heat wave. No Airport shuttle off course (too far) didn't use the shuttle for downtown but ordering seemed complicated and they weren't very courteous about it. The next property / parking lot up the hill is a decent pie, pancake and breakfast, lunch (dinner) place.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice hotel,"The staff at this hotel were very friendly and helpful.  They offer shuttle service to and from Elitch's and the aquarium which was great because as with any city, the traffic is horrendous.  Our room had some cleanliness issues upon check-in but they were quickly resolved.  This hotel has 3 elevators but one was broken during our stay which made the waiting time going up and down a little bit longer because of the hotel occupancy.  The morning hot breakfast was great.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good beds but smelly rooms,The bed was comfy. My son loved the arcade. The pool was open until 10 which was good because we didn't arrive until 8:30. But it got dark shortly after we arrived and the pool wasn't as well lit up for an outdoor pool as I expected. There were two partially eaten breakfast sausages laying about the pool deck with bugs on them. And my floor smelled like weed. We were by the elevator and it started to waft into our room. I am all for people having fun on vacation. And I come from Washington where it is legal. But I have a 5 year old and we requested a non smoking floor. I wish they enforced the non smoking rule regardless of what you are smoking,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,BEWARE!!!- Pathetic on so many levels!!!!  Quality Inn should be avoided at all costs!,We are STUCK here.  We are in town for the Softball Sparkler.  All hotels within a 25 mile radius are booked solid.  There are no rooms and we cannot move.  The nice pictures of the lobby and the decent looking hotel room are deceptive. This place is pathetic.  The first night we were placed in a room where the maid OBVIOUSLY made up a dirty bed.  Then after requiring they replace the sheets we find the air is broken. BEWARE!!!!  You have been warned!!!! They get one star because there is no negative options.  I cannot say enough negative.  I am shocked the Triple Crown has this hotel anywhere associated with its name for rooms.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Gave us a good smoking room,"Gave us a good smoking room but it was like impossible for somebody to recommend us to do something. I feel like because we are Latinos they treated us indifferent. The only guy that was helpfully does days was a Latino named Edgar. Best service ever just from him. I can say it was ok. Inclusive there was a problem the last day that we were there our plane lived at 11pm and the check out was at 12pm and I asked if there was a space for half day stay the manager, that was a horrible service, told us that there's no space it was impossible. I got really mad cause I checked the hotel on trip advisor to see if there was a room available and there was 2 rooms. So what I did was book it and got down and with actitud she gave me the same room I was in. Stupid she was, but we got it on the hard way.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Perfect for Our Recreational Trip!,"Surprised Hubby with a trip to Denver for recreational reasons. This 4/20 friendly hotel was perfect for all of that and very convenient, stood 6/3-6/7. Check-in was a breeze no issues at all! Staff was very friendly, they helped us with all our questions on where to go and what to do and always greeted us as we entered the hotel.  The free transportation was a plus for me and a big reason why I choose this hotel.  It was very useful to go into Downtown Denver. It was always on time when waiting for us in front of the hotel. I do have to say the drivers were awesome, they engaged in such friendly conversation and just very welcoming. We enjoyed our conversations with them during the ride to Downtown.  NOW as for picking us up to take us back to the hotel, that was an issue.  They took way too long and after awhile we realized that the best and quickest way to get back to the hotel was to jump in a cab. We didn't mind that too much, it was like a $12 ride back to the hotel from Downtown. Quality Inn is about 15 min from Downtown Denver but also very close to A TON of Dispensaries. Which was perfect for us!!!! There is also one walking distance.  Room: Bed was ok, standard king size bed it served its purpose. Pillows were HORRIBLE!! They were way too small for a king size bed. They were more of a bunk bed size pillow for a child. I don't know how I slept with them but we managed. They came and cleaned the room every time we took off the ""do not disturb sign"". Food: They have a complimentary Breakfast served every morning and it was really good!! Not even sure why I read complaints about this when your getting a full Breakfast Bar for FREE!!! Eggs, Sausage, Potatoes,Biscuits, Waffles, muffins etc are only to list a few of what was included in the Breakfast bar. Now we also had dinner here a couple of times late night at the Palm Grill. Small Menu but the food was good as well.  The service was not great, the waitress we had our first night was too busy chatting it up with her boyfriend that we waited forever to get our food, at that point I was upset because she kept saying ""I'm so sorry"" and I'm like really!? Clearly she wasn't that sorry she was too busy with her man to attend to us. We are New Yorkers nothing annoys us more, especially when it was such simple dishes, a salad and a sandwich w/ fries. Everyone else got their food on time but of course they did not have the waitress we had.  Hotel premises were kept clean. No issues there. Location is right off the highway which did make it a little noisy at night but It wasn't that bad at all..Hubs is coming back for 4/20 and he said he will definitely bunk here again but will bring his own pillow!  HA.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Comfortable with large complimentary breakfast,"They had a lot to offer at this hotel. It seemed to be a very popular location. The place was always packed. My least favorite part of the stay was waiting for the elevators. I stay for 5 nights and most nights I took the stairs to avoid the wait. They had a nice selection for breakfast. The restaurant inside the hotel has delicious hot wings, it just took a while for service. The staff was friendly. The maintenance personnel were quick with assisting with the dryer not starting for me.  I definitely enjoyed my stay, overall.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Could be a 4, or even a 5....!","This hotel has a good location for what we needed, and it has the ""bones"" to be a great place.  However, it seems that upgrades are slow in coming, and touches that could be made, just aren't.What we liked:1.  They had a great meal they put on in the evening for the group I was with!2.  Good breakfast.3.  There is a restaurant on the premises, so if you're very tired, no need to go outside anywhere.4.  Rooms were comfortable with nice pillows.  Good sleep.5.  Staff was friendly.6.  Continuous fan on the AC - great for sleep.7.  Free wi-fi.What we didn't like:1.  There were three elevators.  One didn't work, hadn't worked since before we got there, and was still not working when we left.  This was a VERY busy place.  Elevators were slow, somewhat unresponsive.  We thought it was just in our minds, but virtually everyone we rode up or down with commented on the very same thing.  Some waits were VERY long!2.  The luggage carts are a disaster!  The one we used to take our luggage up to our room almost didn't make it.  Everything was loose. it leaned, squeaked, was hard to move.... you get the picture.  We only saw three different carts the four days we were there, and they were all mismatched - like they were purchased at a cheap auction.  NO EXCUSE for that!  - not with a hotel this size!3.  Our duvet looked like it had dried snot on it at one spot, and at the bottom corner was some sort of stain or dirty spot.  My wife called to the front desk to ask if it could be changed.  It never was!4.  The AC had a continuous fan which was good, but it didn't cool properly at all.  We turned it down, then down some more, etc.  It finally said 60 degrees, but was nowhere near that cool.  We were always too warm.  NOT good for a hotel room!5.  On the nightstand next to my head was a nice little stand that had extra plugs and USB ports on it.  Cool, right?  Well, if that's ALL it was, then right.  HOWEVER, whoever built the thing felt that it was necessary to put bright little blue lights all over inside it that lit up the room like a Christmas tree when all of the other lights were out.  The only way I could effectively darken it (so I could sleep!) was to take the outer ice bucket and place it upside-down over the whole unit.  That worked.As I said, this place could be great --- with a little extra thought.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Loved this place!,"I thought this hotel was great, they had a large staff and everyone was really nice that I encountered. Each floor has a ice machine and every room has decent view. They've got it all including bar and grill, pool, game room, business center and a great breakfast for free. I would stay there again for sure, its close to a lot of attractions being centrally located.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pleasantly Surprised,"We had stayed at this hotel a few years ago, and were very disappointed.  When we saw that the recent reviews were good, we decided to try it again.  We're so glad we did.  The room were clean and comfortable.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  Breakfast was better than most complimentary breakfasts.  We come to Denver every year for a conference, and will look forward to staying there again next year.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Just ok!,Took in one night here while we was on a road trip across country ! It's clean but had a smell to it ! And the elevators was way to slow to accommodate! It is not very far away from downtown Denver but I would not venture out because it is in a bad area of town ! So if you are looking for a decent hotel go elsewhere! And it was dog friendly!,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice hotel nice staff,"I would highly recommend this hotel. They offer a free shuttle to many of the area attractions. The staff were extremely helpful to me and I witnessed them being just as helpful to other guests. Our room was big and clean and bed was cozy. The free breakfast was more than I expected and by far the best complimentary breakfast I had on my entire trip! If you're smart, you'll book this place.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Cannabis,Well we booked this hotel quite innocently and did not realise that this was a cannabis friendly hotel ! But hey ho after travelling through what seemed like an industrial estate to get to hotel we found clean big rooms and a friendly hotel which ran a shuttle service every day very frequently into centre of Denver. staff are helpful and vey polite. Breakfast is adequate and plentiful. If you can stand the over powering smell of cannabis then this is a cheap and good base hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not bad not great,"This is about 5-10 minutes  from Downtown.Reasonably priced.PROS: free parking,free shuttle to coors field,downtown, outdoor swimming pool, hot breakfast, 420 friendly, personable staff,clean rooms,pets allowed.Free wifi.CONS:Hot breakfast ends at 9am,shuttle times are hit and miss,420 friendly, elevators very very slow plan on waiting 5-10 minutes, lots of kids, slow check in. Its in an industrial area.1. Came back to room after waiting 5 +min elevator and card didn't work was required to go back down to front desk to get new cards.2. Few of the shuttle drivers were on their phones showing pics  or  looking at maps while driving not a good thing.One didnt even get out of the van to open door and we waited  40 minutes late at night.3. Most annoying was elevators so very slow. said it doesnt work well  if more than 6 people on elevator.I would plan on staying on floors 2/3 so you can walk down stairs saving much time.I would stay here again because its a good price and close to downtown and staff were good.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Location is horrible ,"We're here in Denver to attend a conference. Downtown Denver is pricey so we stayed here for a more reasonable price.  Long story short, pay the extra to stay elsewhere.  This hotel is near NOTHING. U can't walk to anything.  Half of our room plugs don't work, lamp doesn't work, tap in kitchenette also doesn't work. Internet is painfully slow, like dial up kind of bad. There are a couple positives - they offer shuttle service to quite a few locations, including several places downtown and the airport. They also have a pool here. Aaaand, that's about it. If you're looking to find a reasonably priced hotel, search for hotels about 20 mins outside of the city but located in populated areas so that you have somewhere to eat or possibly shop. Closest place to buy beer is a 20 min walk away. Having said all this, if you're driving here, these may not be as much of an issue, but for anyone flying here without a vehicle, definitely choose a different location.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pretty Good,"Overall the stay was nice. There was one downfall which was the shuttle picking my family of 6 up from Elitch Gardens, in which they were almost an hour late and we stood out in a storm. This was due to only having one shuttle running with numerous people waiting to be picked up and dropped off in certain areas of Denver. The other pickups work on time. I would strongly suggest that they add another shuttle or two to accommodate all of their guests as this is a very good perk but they do need more shuttles and drivers. The customer service was awesome the breakfast was awesome and we had a good time.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good value for money,"This is an affordable hotel in the area. Rooms are comfortable. The huge downside is that it seems that many people stay in the hotel only to get high. Don't be surprised to wake up with the smell of marijuana although in theory smoking is not allowed. Breakfast is very limited but free. I recommend you go to the diner nearby that serves breakfast all day. Bottom line: if you can spend more go else, if not - this hotel is ok for several days. There is a free parking. Free wi-fi is relatively fast.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Awesome!,"The staff was super friendly . The room was clean. Will stay again! Honestly We went for 4/20 and they were very cool about it. Not every floor was smoking , so if you are not a smoker this hotel is still great for you!! The location was great , close to downtown! Best quality inn ive been to.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Weekend Break in Denver,"The Quality Inn is not in downtown Denver, but has a free hourly shuttle that works well. Our room was clean and there was an on-site restaurant and bar. The complementary breakfast buffet was well stocked and varied enough.The best feature were the staff who werre very helpful and always smiling. All in all it was good value for the price",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"AS ALWAYS, A VERY GOOD HOTEL!","This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel and I have never been disappointed. I stay here whenever I fly to Denver to visit my elderly parents. Both check in and check out is a breeze with no problems whatsoever. My rooms have always been very clean and the beds and pillows very comfortable. One of the best things about this Quality Inn is their wonderful complementary breakfasts. The food is excellent and very plentiful. A big plus for this hotel is Betty Martinez, the Guest Relations Officer. She always makes me (and I'm sure everyone else as well) feel welcome, and I enjoy seeing her smiling face whenever I stay at this hotel. The only negative (if you can call it that) is that it is a bit out of the way. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 rating, however that would certainly not deter me from staying here every time I visit Denver. Good job Quality Inn!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good for a night ,Price was right for one night. Staff where very friendly and went out of way to get us checked in early. Was nice to have a restaurant on site although cafe would probably be a better description. Free breakfast was ok but would taste so much better with proper cutlery and dishes. Plastic just doesn't work.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Non-smoking room reeked of smoke,"At first, I thought this hotel was good for the price and location. The lobby was nice, staff was friendly, and the location was pretty close to downtown (not the best view though due to industrial surroundings) The room was a little dated, but clean and comfortable. However, as soon as we turned on our air conditioning, smoke from the smoking floor made our room smell awful. I usually don't mind the smell of smoke, but it was so bad we asked if we could switch rooms, which we didn't end up doing because we would have had to wait until the next day to switch. It was so bad that clothes I kept sealed in a compartment in my suitcase and never opened until I got home reeked of smoke. We were only there for three nights and it absorbed that quickly. I had to wash all of my clothes when I got home because the smoke had absorbed so much into the fabric. I really hope they can find a way to address this issue.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good, especially for price","Helpful employees, nice facilities, yummy breakfast, great shuttle service to the ballpark. However, I must say that the neighborhood is rough to say the least. Lots of sketchy folks out there, and really all over downtown Denver. Maybe becoming the legal pot capitol wasn't the best idea after all. However, this is not anything Quality Inn had anything to do with, other than build a nice motel in a run-down, industrial area. Thanks for a nice stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Basic. A little worn around the edges. ,"Clean rooms, generally a little worn around the edges. Has a strange odor in hallways. Basic breakfast of toast, cereal, coffee, waffle maker, eggs, sausage, biscuits. Eggs are not the best compared to similar hotel breakfast places. Location is good if you have a car. Quick trip to market, downtown and other local sights. Location next to industrial area and freeway. Not recommended without a car as there is no nearby public transportation or anything walking distance.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,good last minute place to book; cool mountain view,"My husband & I stayed here for a ""getaway"". We had to change hotels after our first room was a non-smoking hotel. The front desk associates were friendlier than the housekeepers. The breakfast was pretty good though. Gravy was great, (being from the south) lol. No refrigerator/microwave in our room, which sucked for $100. Smoking room, yay! :)",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Contemplating The Stars on a Potty Trainer,"If I were visiting a luxury resort and ended up with this QI, I'd have to give it a one star rating.  But if you're doing business in industrial North Denver, out by the trains, bus hubs, oil refineries, and you're paying a very reasonable price, then this QI couldn't be much better. They provide an Internet connection that actually works a free breakfast that is ""fine"", and a clean room with hospitable staff. No movies to rent but the flat screen was nice. Oh yea, the toilet seat?  What's up with that?  I've never seen a toilet seat that small except when we were toilet training our infants.  I'm a big guy and could only fit one cheek at a time in this beauty. See photo.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,good place to stay However hard to find- not real easy to get toand to DownTown,"The hotel nice, people are nice, However this place is one hard pup to drive to and find and difficult to drive to and from downtown much less any where. They have van but it only goes to specific spots for drop off and pick up. Sorry guys  but Their system to reserve a ride or pick up needs some work. (Quality Inn you need to work on this issue, drivers nice front desk is nice, they are trying to make the best of it, I can tell this is a Mgt decision) - If your going to a game, or going to CENTER or being picked up from these events and your not in ANNY hurry then ok (I had to wait over hr for pick up and I had to pee). If you have a meeting /apt to make CALL CAB - cab will take pick you up door of you apt. U will have to walk if you use van system. I picked this place because hey had parking. YES parking lot looks very secure, I had no questions about that the place is all by it self. The place has been up dated, and a little rough in spots like some trim, and outside window cleaning. But for price ok. FREE Breakfast your basic hotel feed. Not any thing to write home about (what do you want for free, Sorry guys). The hotel is not next to ANY thing, except highway and train yard. Work out room area they have but not a happy spot- rooms areas look like after thought you can do better. The hotel had that goofy smell that hotels use to cover up musty smell, hotel you can do better.  Now they did have FREE Wifi. Cable TV I like to suggest you place a channel guide easy to find, could not find one if there was one.  Looked like they only local channel (may have been user error) If you had a team this could be your spot they can not /would not want to wonder off..",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Needs Work,"Public areas are nice. Had us down for only one room when my confirmation clearly showed two causing slow check in. Main area of room was okay, bathroom in dire need of updating. Cracked/chipped tiles, slow flushing toilet, sometimes had to flush twice, shower went from ice cold to scalding and back. Room had an odor. 7th floor ice machine didn't work. Noisy area. Only a single outlet at head of beds. I normally have at least 2 items I need to plug in near bed so was inconvenient. Bed too soft for my liking but that's personal preference.",3

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Vehicles Get Vandalized/Stolen Often - Entire Hotel Smells Like Weed,"This hotel is in a terrible neighborhood in Denver. Slums surround the entire property.  On 04/27/2016 someone attempted to steal my vehicle and stole several items from it.  Luckily my vehicle had an anti-theft device installed so they were unsuccessful. They did damage the ignition severely to the point that it was impossible to start the next day.  Steer clear of this place if you value your property.  Hotel staff was unapologetic and refused to refund my stay after the incident.  Hotel staff made it sound like this was the first time this happened, but Denver PD said they come out to this location all the time to deal with issues similar to mine.  I hope my review prevents others from having to go through the stress and inconvenience this caused me. The entire hotel smells like weed.  The shower in our room did not drain very well so I was standing in bath water.  Noise from the train and the freeway are audible all night.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Hotel,"I was really iffy about Quality inn because the locations in Houston aren't that great. So glad we chose this place. Very affordable, free breakfast with great variety, and clean rooms. Met tons of new people! Will definitely come back next year!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Mini Vacation,"I booked this hotel because it was a choice hotel, but also we were in town for the Iron Maiden Concert. Upon arrival the front desk agent was rude and it was awful for her to set the tone for our trip. Besides this one particular agent, every other staff was friendly and welcoming. The hotel was decent for a Quality Inn. We tried to book a shuttle but everyone else was there for the concert. Parking was a hassle. The beds were comfy. My family and friends didn't spend much time in the hotel. We only were in the rooms to sleep and shower the following day. Breakfast was awesome and I appreciate a balanced meal. Upon Check Out the front desk asked about our stay. We told them the pros and cons and made us feel better. We felt that our voices were heard and it made us feel like they will do their best to not let it happen again. Again comfy beds, quite hotel and the room is dated but all hotels look the same when we are sleeping. Haha. I'll stay here again next time I'm in Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,This place is GREAT!,The entire staff was friendly and very accommodating.  It is close to EVERYTHING!  The hotel is very well maintained and the rooms were clean.   Will definitely be staying here when we return to Denver again.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,4/20 last min trip,The stay was great everyone was super friendly and accommodating...it's was before the pool opened but I'm sure I'll stop back in the future visits. 420 friendly was a great plus for our denver tour..the beds are nice and comfy and clean. Staff was friendly to help even if one was unsure of most questions. Great trip. Will recommend to my friends,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good but ...,"Convenient for the Interstate the approach can seem a bit strange, across a  (little-used)railroad onto a service road.  The welcome was warm despite me being before the official check-in time. Despite its location it is quiet. The in-house restaurant and bar have limited hours and selection but the complimentary breakfast is excellent. The desk/table is not near a light.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disgusting,NEVER stay here. Old. Dirty. Smells like smoke. AC doesn't work (hotels response...turn off the ac and open the window!). Wifi doesn't work. Not worth the $$. Also tons if people outside smoking weed and cigarettes. Beyond bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,comfortable and friendly,"Try their best to give everyone, everything they need.Also let me bring my dog.They even give dog bones.Need anything call front desk,they do help.Good breakfast and also for smokers they have placed to go.They do have smoking rooms on 9 floor.Good food at cafe on first floor.Husband, me and our dog visit several times a year .We travel alot and this one is 1 of our favorites we stay at least 5 times a year.Never made it to the outdoor pool,but we will. Not a stuffy hotel",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Enjoyed our Overnight Stay,"Stayed overnight while attending a concert at the nearby Grizzly Rose Saloon, and really enjoyed our stay. The room was extremely spacious, and the two queen beds were comfortable.Special mention should be made of the complementary shuttle (mini bus) service, which was happy to drop us off at the Grizzly Rose about 8 o clock and provided a phone number for us to call when we wanted taken back to the hotel. We phoned about one in the morning, and the bus arrived within ten minutes, to take us home. really appreciated the service, which reflects well on the hotel.I'm also going to give mention to the complementary breakfast, which was something to write home about. It was very busy on the morning we were there because there was a schools basketball competition somewhere in the vicinity and lots of kids/parents were staying at the hotel but the food was replenished frequently and tasted hot and fresh.I'm happy to recommend this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Stay,"This is a belated review since I stayed here last September. I'm giving the hotel 5 stars. Now clearly this is not a five star Ritz, but I would have to consider it a very good 5 star budget hotel. Rooms are probably going to be between $80-$100. For that money I got a very clean non-smoking room, a bit dated, but hey, it not the Ritz. They serve a free breakfast that was doable and they have a shuttle that will you to the downtown area, very convenient. The entire hotel might be non-smoking, I'm not sure. I smelled no smoke in any of the areas of the hotel, yeah. They did have a smoking area outside.When I have a little extra money, I'll probably stay at a hotel near the 16th Street Mall. However, when money is tight, I will have no problem staying at this Quality Inn.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Overnight Stay,"We flew in to Denver on December 15, 2015. We originally planned to spend one night at the hotel and drive to Aspen the next day.  During the night, it snowed pretty heavily closing schools in the Denver area and prompting requests by law enforcement to stay off the roads. The Quality Inn accommodated us for another overnight stay. There is a restaurant on the premises and they offered free shuttle services to the downtown area. The breakfast was plentiful and the staff very helpful. I would stay overnight again when flying on to the Denver area.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Location and price fit the criteria,"While the rooms were updated, overall the property is somewhat dated, but the price was right for the area. Front desk people are friendly. It’s just on a very noisy road thus hard to sleep.The air didn't work. Air conditioning was pretty loud; we didn’t realize that if you just left it on, it loses the constant click, click, click, after about 15 minutes. We tried to turn the cool setting on, but it only blew hot air. The hotel set central air to ""seasonal"" settings, and cared less that heat poured into rooms with no way for guests to regulate it. We had to open the windows to let cool air in, but it also let in the interstate traffic noise and the sounds of nearby trains.The WIFI worked well.The free breakfast was the a bit larger than the usual  hotel fare and consisted of scrambled eggs, canned fruit, yogurt, waffle (make yourself), English muffins, and cereal. Apple and Orange juice were the only juices offered.  The fruit medley was canned fruit. The meat was either link sausage or bacon. The sides were re-fried beans and fried potatoes. There were biscuits and gravy, as well as Tortillas and salsa.We did not pick this hotel for its lavish furnishings or incredible amenities; we picked it for its location and price. On those two criteria, it fit the bill,",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Ski Trip Stopover,"Older buliding.  Checkin/out was smooth.  New carpet in the room.  Friendly front desk and drivers.  Well stocked breakfast.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,When Passing Through DEN,"I have stayed here several times when passing through Denver, all been one night stays. The free shuttle service is great! Breakfast in the morning is good. Free wifi in the rooms. Just wish this place had a hot tub. The Village Inn (closes early) next door is about all there is around this location. Have eaten in the dining room once and the food was good. My last stay here the room would not cool off. Thankfully the window could be opened and that solved that problem.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Run down,"Bathroom door wouldnt shut all the way, sink leaked causing the floor to floor and damage our belongings.  Ghetto and run down definitely better places to spend your money.  Would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless it was half the price.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,We  were there for the gift show at the Denver Mart and Betty Martinez a guest relations officer has for several years g,Most of the staff gives out standing service.  Betty Martinez goes above and beyond.  I have stayed there for many years and she has been consistently there and the real face of the hotel for me.  There is also an older Hispanic man that works the morning shift who is also there who is also great I wish I knew his name (ask Betty).,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Not bad, but I was robbed","I am a President of the European Fan Club of the NHL ice hockey team named the Colorado Avalanche. I have been organizing annual trips to Colorado to watching US hockey for European fans for years. Our goup decided to stay in the Quality Inn Denver Central for the second time in a history of our trips. It was also for the first time we chose to stay at the same hotel.My feelings for this review are mixed. General manager Suzanne was friendly to me and offered our 12-man group good price for our two-week trip. Rooms were clean, breakfast was perfect, the shuttle operated on time and without problems. Sadly, something bad happened at the end of our stay and it still has not been solved - even after almost 2 weeks I am back in my country.The problem is I left my pure new jacket in the room. Yes, I know it is primarily my stupid mistake. It happened for the first time in my life that I forgot on something to pack in my baggage. Fortunately, I took a picture of our room when I was about to leave it. I do it every time when I am leaving hotels at all my trips - it is like my own habit. When I checked the photo closely, I could see my jacket on the chair in the room. I just didn't notice her in person. I was happy I have a photo proof which I sent to the hotel, but... They don't care much.Even without a photo-proof of my jacket forgotten on a chair, the hotel staff has kept telling me they have not found any jacket. They have not offered me any consideration, even not 50:50 payment for the jacket which cost 77 dollars. Simply nothing. They did not care about the photo I took. They even told me that I probably lost the jacket on a way from USA to Europe. The GM was surprised why I contacted her in this matter two days after my departure from the hotel. I had to explain her that it took almost two days with all delays and one diverted flight to get back to my country.For me it seemed they did not understand the photo I sent them. I am not a native speaker but I think I was clear when I described them that my jacket is visible on a chair in the room.When I shared this sad story with my US friend on a first day I was back at home, he told me I should say ""goodbye"" to my jacket as the hotel staff (especially in low rated hotels) are not paid well and they used to keep everything what they found in the rooms. I did not believe him because in Europe it did not work like this - even the hotel staff is probably paid worse than in the US.I sent a long message to the GM past weekend when I was honest and thankful for her past service and reservation, but I also asked if there is any way for a consideration. I have not got answer yet, so I guess it is done for her and rest of the staff.Honestly, US culture of service in restaurants, sport arenas and hotels are much better than in my country. But this case has really shocked me. The hotel simply does not care about our 12-man group which may be even bigger in the next years.If I had not photo-proof, I could not tell anything bad... But I took it and the jacket is there.Finally, if members of the next trip will want to stay at this hotel, I would have to agree, but at the other side I will kept all stuff locked in my baggage during our stay there and I will re-check all of our rooms for at least two times.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Here for the Gem Show 9/2015,This hotel is actually where one of the Gem Show is located.  Love the convenience.  It's also not far for getting into the city or the rest of the Gem Show.  The shuttle will be able to take you around.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Very kind, trusting Staff!","****READ ALL THE WAY TO THE END****I was in Denver on a mini-vacation with a gal pal of mine, we are both single mothers and were so excited to be out having a girls weekend. We arrived at the hotel late and hit the town, the fallowing morning we slept in. Upon waking up we got ready to hit the mall and have some good'ol Denver fun, I cleaned out my purse just before leaving the room and had stashed away $120 into a little compact mirror for an emergency fund. We then left the room and went about our day, later that evening I was in my purse and could not seem to find my mirror anywhere, we began to search the room, form under the beds to in the trash bins in hopes that it may have been tossed out. I forgot to mention that we had the DND sign on the door the entirety of our stay so there was no reason for anyone to enter our room. Keep reading the end is where this story looks up. So after searching the room and my car numerous times I phoned the front desk and explained the situation. The girl at the front desk told me shed have a manger call ASAP. 5 min later the manager called and asked me to tell her what was going on. I then explained the above situation and she informed me that she would have her manager look into the activity on my room. Approximately 30min later there was a knock at the door, it was the man to that was going to look into it (can not remember his name). Anyways he informed me that he was going to look into the keys that entered my room and the cameras. Sunday morning came around and still nothing, I was checking out that day and began to feel worried, the gentleman assured me he was working hard at finding out what happened, so I left my information with him and went home. The fallowing day he called me and informed me that this dose not happen ever and that he was so sorry, they then refunded my $120!!!! I am so grateful that this man took it upon himself to make this right again!! I will defiantly stay here again, however to take extra precautions anywhere I go I will not leave such valuables out and will be extra sure I  put all my stuff away! All in all this hotel is amazing, we enjoyed our stay very much, the shuttle driver was adorable and fun too!! We will be staying here again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place to stay for the price,"My trip to Denver was to attend and Rocky Mtn. Horse Exp.  The hotel was 5 minutes from the venue.  They had a shuttle that took us every day and picked us up whenever we called -- very prompt.  The room was clean and comfortable and everyone was very helpful and friendly.  I would certainly stay at the hotel again and would recommend it to anyone that is not necessarily looking for luxury, but a clean reasonably priced room with a great staff.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very satisfied,"Recently used Quality Inn Denver Colorado, due to a hospital visit, so unlike our travels, we stayed there due to the personal situation,the staff were wonderful, the hotel was very appealing to the eye, there was an issue concerning check out but the general manager of the hotel rectified it and all was very well... I would more than likely stay there once again...",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality? Inn,"The facility is OK but a little hard to get to.  The cooling system in my room didn't work correctly.  There were strobe lights going off most of both nights outside the room.  It was very annoying and didn't lead to good sleeping.  I got very sick after eating their breakfast.  Overall, not a good stay.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Hotel,"Right when we got there, we had an extra guest with us.  They were able to switch us to a suite to suit everyones needs (beds, privacy with the two rooms connected, etc).  We were then allowed to move to a different room a couple days later with two queen beds.  We did encounter a couple of problems throughout our 6 day stay.  The management quickly fixed and compensated us for our troubles.  The front desk attendants were great and we were only a 5-10 minute drive from the Denver Mart, which is why we were there.  The restaurant downstairs had good food, as well.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Lack of Quality Inn,"I was not expecting luxury at this price, but my visit fell short of adequate. The dirt-colored rug and tiles do not hide the actual dirt: Mold in the tub, dirt and debris on the rug. I stayed for 6 nights and the maid skipped service one of the days. The shower is not equipped with a temperature regulator so it went from lukewarm to hot with intermittent scalding hot. Similarly, the heating/cooling unit was not working well. Even on ""auto"" the heat didn't shut itself off. It got very hot regardless of the temperature setting.The elevators worked intermittently. At one point, only one of three was working. This created a real problem since the hotel was very busy. It would have been alleviated if there was an accessible stairwell, but for some strange reason, the stairs are all alarmed so long waits for the elevator are inevitable.They claim to have wireless but it is so weak that working was difficult and watching a movie was impossible. I found the free breakfast inedible. The Cheerios were stale, the eggs are fake, industrial eggs, fruit is canned in syrup. Good news is there is a fairly decent diner next door. Something unique to my stay was sharing the hotel with a college baseball team. For some reason, the front desk thought it would be a good idea to place them all on the same floor rather than split them up. No surprise, the guys were up until 3am running from room to room, slamming doors and being rowdy with me stuck in between all of them. Yes, the shuttle is convenient. The beds are not the worst. If you don't need to shower or sleep well, and you are not a picky eater, this is a good choice for you!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A great place to stay in Denver!,"I fond this place because I needed a break before heading home. Colorado legalized marijuana last year and the good folks here recognize that so in addition to having a cigarette smoking area, you can spark up out there as well.  Ok, that puts it on a par with Amsterdam.  It's a bit out of the way, but they offer Uber ride coupons so you can visit all the bars, breweries and dispensaries as you wish.  Very laid back, also like Amsterdam.  The real value of a hotel is how they make you feel. The best 5 stars have pleasant and professional staff who make a guest feel welcome.  This hotel makes you feel welcome and valued.  The rooms are very nice and clean.  The thing that won me over was the best hot breakfast I've seen at a US hotel breakfast bar.  The eggs were freshly scrambled the sliced ham was thick and excellent, real roasted potatoes and the best part was, it all tasted good - nicely seasoned with excellent flavor.  They have a good chef back in the kitchen.  There were healthy choices fresh fruits, varieties of cereals, fresh juices and excellent coffee.  People come down for breakfast and stay because it's so very comfortable. It's a congenial place. I'll be back.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Value & Location • Desperately Needs Updates,"I picked this location because of its proximity to downtown and the River North district. I wasn't disappointed in that aspect of it either; it's only about a 5 minute drive from that area. One of the first things you notice is that the hotel appears to be quite old from the outside, and rooms themselves are no different.  Saving on updates, though, is surely what allows them to be such a good value. And the room WAS clean. All that said, there were some deficiencies and other little things that I should point out. as I said, the decor is very old.  the popcorn ceiling has been obviously repaired in several spots and there are multiple areas of discoloration. the curtains are 1970's golden and not in the best of shape. Then there is the bathroom. The faucet is so close to the back of the sink you cannot wash your hands without rubbing your knuckles against the sink, which--even if its clean--just seems a little pointless. The hot water temperature was very good initially but I had to constantly adjust the temperature in the shower because it progressively got colder and colder. All that said, my stay was not a bad one, and I would come back here again if I needed to be fairly close to downtown or the RiNo district.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Overnight Visit For a Concert at The Pepsi Center,"I happened to get lucky on a Hot Wire purchase.  The Quality Inn was selected for us and so didn't know exactly what to expect when we got there.  Free Breakfast...not the best but much better than some.  The room was great and the beds very comfortable and we found out they had a free shuttle service for us, so a free ride to the pepsi center and pick up after the concert.  Very convenient to downtown although not in the nicest of neighborhoods, we didn't spend much time at the hotel so not a huge deal for us.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Bang for Buck!,"We booked this hotel in hopes that Denver would win the Superbowl so we could join the parade the following Tuesday.  It is a few miles away from downtown, but they offer a shuttle for events and I believe the airport as well.  We didn't utilize that feature though.  Our room was nice and clean.  Housekeeping did their job sanitizing the toilet and leaving us starchy clean sheets.  The view was nothing to write home about, but when we pressed our faces up against the window we could see the downtown buildings (Sorry about the face prints on the window, Ms. Housekeeper).  The front desk workers were accommodating and polite.  My only complaint was the noise from the doors slamming and people yapping in the hallway sporadically through the night.  But what the heck did we expect?  The Broncos just won the Superbowl, so people weren't finished partying yet.  The internet was fast and breakfast was delicious.  The neighborhood is pretty safe from my estimation as well.  The bottom line is that you're not going to find a better deal this close to downtown.  It's probably better if you have your own car, but isn't that always the case?",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clean room and excellent staff,"Stayed for 4 nights while in town for a convention. The folks at the front desk were exceedingly helpful and I was impressed with the custom service. Room was clean. Shuttle service ran as promised, great drivers. Thanks, will use this hotel again when back in Denver.Also, the smell of cannabis did not bother us at all on the 5th floor. The staff goes to great lengths to accommodate all guests. Thank you.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not bad for the price,"Stayed here while in town for the stock show this month. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful at check in. Room reeked of marijuana when we first checked in, however it aired out with time. Unfortunately this may just be a sign of the times in the area as I've had this experience at other hotels in Denver. Overall the room was clean, and somewhat updated. Lots of free parking on the property, and a hot breakfast is included although due to our rushed schedule we did not partake. While the rooms were updated, overall the property is somewhat dated but the price was right for the area.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NASTY!  DISGUSTING!,"Walking in the front door it looks good, but it's all a lie!  Toilet won't flush, mold around the bathtub, ripped old wallpaper, stains on the carpet, and HORRIFIC SMOKE SMELLS!!!  I begged to change rooms, but was told that you get the crappy rooms when you book on third party sites like TRIP ADVISOR because they don't care what rooms you get!!!!!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,New Years Eve Hotel Stay,"My fiance and I stayed here on NYE 2015. We went through Hotwire and ended up with a smoking room, on the smoking floor, which was smelly and gross. Given it was NYE, the entire hotel was packed full, so we didn't have much of an option to switch rooms. The hotel has a really nice view of Denver and we were able to watch all the fireworks go off. The breakfast here is what makes this stay worth it. They offer a wide variety of breakfast items which are hot and delicious! I wouldn't consider staying here again. For the price we paid, I wasn't very impressed.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,New Year's Eve 2015,"It was very busy upon arrival being New Year's Eve and all.  Great check-in experience and very friendly staff.  The room was spacious and had very comfortable bed, pillows and bedding.  I was disappointed that it did not have a refrigerator or a microwave but did have nice toiletries.  The t.v. is really small and placed too low for my liking.  Did not have any hot water left for showering at about 9:30 a.m or so.  Betty, the Guest Relations Officer was extremely friendly. During the free full breakfast, she was attentive and wanted to make sure our stay, food and satisfaction was top notch.  Super friendly.  The shuttle service is wonderful.  Did have a small communications problem as far as the pick up spot to get back to the hotel, but very friendly also. Tom, the Hotel security in the lobby is extremely helpful and full of wonderful ideas for veterans plus offers several different services as he owns his own Veteran operated and serviced business. There was no noise from the close freeway but a lot of partying, but can't be too upset about that because it's the best night to party. Thank you Quality Inn for making our New Year's Eve wonderful!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Hotel near Invesco Field,The room was great.  The beds were big and very comfortable.  There was a free van that took us to the Broncos game that dropped us off close to the front gate.  They also  picked us up after the game.  The breakfast was great and was refilled quickly when something was low.   The wifi worked fine.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Bedbugs and Marijuana,"We recently went to this hotel because my daughter is a cheerleader competing at the State Spirit Competition.  Despite signs with a pot leaf crossed out, this hotel reeks of marijuana.  When we asked the front desk about it, they quipped, ""Well, we're 420 friendly"" which means this is not exactly the place you want to have student athletes.  As if that wasn't bad enough, we found bedbugs and the combination of the two issues forced us to move the team to a different hotel.  Of course, the rooms were boiling hot, maybe to bake out the bedbugs??  I have no problem with 420 friendly hotels, but it is grossly irresponsible to not communicate that to sports teams.  As for the bedbugs, very simply ....unexceptable.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Meh....,"The woman who checked us in was super sweet and updated us to a suite, which we really appreciated! The customer service was fantastic.... The hotel itself.... Not so much. When we got to our room it was literally 83 degrees... In December. The thermostat was set really high so we turned it low and it continued to blow out suppppper hot air. The bed was bad, it was a spring mattress and every time one of us moved the whole thing shook and woke us up. It was horrible. The breakfast was really nice actually, especially the fruit salad. This hotel could be really nice if they updated their decor and most importantly... mattresses.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Super Cold!!!,"My husband and I stayed here for our birthday and anniversary vacation. The staff was super nice and helpful BUT we stayed on the NON-SMOKING floor and once you get off the elevator all you smell is weed! Which...ok...is not so bad but once we got to our room it smelled heavily of cigarette smoke. So much that it kept giving me a headache. The room was clean and large and the bed was comfortable. But we also noticed (as other reviews say) the heater did not work and our room at night was COLD. I didn't bother contacting the front desk since we were only there two days, but I probably wouldn't recommend staying here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Has Improved,"Last stayed here in June 2014,stayed for 4 days in October 2015.The hotel still looks the same but the service has improved ten fold.The rooms are still spacious and comfy with a good sized bathroom.I do believe the aroma on the 9th floor can cause you to wonder!   The front desk is well managed and the shuttle service to downtown Denver,16th st mall & Amtrak station,Coors Field and Mile high Stadium is so much better than last year.This is mainly due to the shuttle drivers being so good and obliging.Nothing was too much for them to arrange,they really made the stay a pleasure. If you only want to visit for a game(NFL/MLB) or a smoke,this is the place...",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst ever in every way!,"Not worth staying, and don't even consider! I stayed here for business. The original plan was to stay for 2 nights, but the building stinks, room stinks, floor in the room was nasty, and it is so loud being by the railroad tracks and thin wall. I could not sleep at all. Worst of all, the service is fairly bad. It is convenient that they have a shuttle to take you to downtown Denver. But they do not pick you up exactly where they dropped you off. I called and asked where to wait. ""Exactly where you were dropped off"" what a vague response. But I thought it was ok since they asked my number and they said they'd call me if they couldn't find me. Of course the van didn't find me and left without calling. If you miss they will tell you exactly where but comes up with excuses as to why they didn't call. I had to wait in cold Denver whether for 1 hour since they could not be reliable. I also ended up staying in another hotel for the 2nd night eating the cost since this place is way too nasty. They provide breakfast, but as you may tell, it is not very good.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Clean and Comfortable, Good Breakfast, Free Shuttle","Staff is friendly, rooms are very clean, bed is comfy, shower is hot and has good water pressure. The breakfast buffet is a notch above the usual free breakfast buffet and they change it around a little. Hot items with scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage one day, ham the next, refried beans. Pretty decent biscuits and gravy, make your own waffle. Coffee was OK and is always available at the front desk. They have a little ""store"" behind the desk with frozen burritos, ice cream sandwiches that sort of thing so you can satisfy your ""munchies"" anytime. They have a shuttle that will take you almost anywhere (except 16th St Mall- Bummer!) including Bronco Stadium, but they drop you off at the KFC on Federal and 17th, kinda close. The bars will drop you off closer. Housekeeping never did replace any towels, we always had to go to the front desk. That can be a pain when you are in the shower and realize no washcloth, no bath towel and have to make do with a couple of hand towels. One day we came back to the room and the bed was only half made. The shift must have been over! LOL. I really liked this hotel and would come back again except it isn't close to the interstate. We always drive to Denver but if you are exclusively using their shuttle you may not care. Probably won't be back just because of the location.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Ups and downs,"We just returned from staying at this hotel for a Convention in downtown Denver. We started out our stay after flying in late only to find our room was next to a loud dog and reeked of smoke. To be fair, it said smoking room on our booking, but I assumed it was a mistake. We asked about changing rooms and let them know about the dog which seemed to be addressed right away as we didn't hear anything after the first few minutes. We couldn't change rooms though since they were fully booked.  Our first night, both my roommate and I had a hard time sleeping due to the incredibly loud radiator. The hair dryer didn't work, there was no fridge or microwave, and we didn't have any cold water.  After a rough first night, they moved us into a new room in the morning. It was a completely different experience: working hair dryer, microwave/refrigerator, quiet radiator, and non smelly room!  Throughout our entire trip, the staff were wonderful- definitely bumped them up to 3 instead of 2 because of them. Front desk to wait staff in the restaurant, they were fabulous.  The shuttle bus drivers were also very friendly. Speaking of shuttles, if you are planning to go to this hotel and use the shuttles during a convention, DON'T. We were told they were prepared to take groups to the convention center, but that it was ""first come, first serve."" That in turn meant that since there were 50+ people wanting to use the shuttle, we wouldn't get to our destination on time in the morning and waiting 30+ minutes to get picked up.  I have no idea how they didn't plan for this.  You only have 1 shuttle when there are probably over 100 people staying in the hotel going to this convention?  Needless to say, we ended up using Lyft to get us to and from the rest of the trip. Overall, this hotel was ok.  Good hot breakfast, tiny but usable workout room, and mediocre room conditions. If you're in Denver and can get it for  a good deal it's worth it. If not, I'd look elsewhere.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place prices clean and comfortable,we arrived early way before check in time due to our train being on time and they had our room ready and waiting or us clean as a whistle no bugs no dirt just clean clean beds were super comfy to sleep and like sound proof room their breakfast buffet was the best kept us till dinner time the entire staff were all friendly and helpful in any request we asked for like getting a fridge in our room plus I loved their shower head just like being at home and their hair dryer worked better then mine close to downtown Denver like 10 min away I recommend this hotel very highly plus their also have a awesome work out room  they have an outside pool weather permitting also they have a great vending area at main entrance in which we had our ice cream treats every nite for only $1.50,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Felt like home, away from home!","I stayed here in the month of September this year with my husband and son and absolutely loved the hospitality of the staff here. We were extremely tired after a 26 hour flight from India and wanted to get into the room as soon as possible. The front desk staff quickly made all arrangements and sent us to our plush room on the fifth floor of the hotel. The room was well lit and had a fabulous view that of the Downtown. We loved it from the moment and kept extending our stay! My infant enjoyed all the comforts that he gets at home, thanks to the very helpful and friendly hotel staff. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone, especially people traveling with small kids. Be sure that you'll get the best care you expect!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Friendliest people you ever meet! ,"My boyfriend and I came here for the weekend. This was the second hotel we stayed at and we were satisfied from the moment we arrived up until the day we left. Great price, very friendly and helpful staff. Our room was spacious and clean. I would also advise you stay here if you're in town for the recreational activities, everyone is very professional. Hotel is in a nice area and everything is pretty much 15 minutes away. I didn't like how we always had to take the highways, but if you like it that's fine. They have free parking, free breakfast every morning, (with a lot of tasty options) a game room, a restaurant and a bar. They also gave us an Uber and Lyft credit which was pretty helpful. They have a free shuttle to take you places, but IT WILL NOT TAKE YOU TO THE AIRPORT. I feel like that was the only disadvantage for us, but other than that our stay was amazing and we will definitely come again!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Mile High Comics!,"We stayed at this hotel at the end of our trip.  The room was nice and clean with a great view of the city!  We stayed just down from the Jason St. Mile High Comics location, so if your a comic book fan, I suggest this hotel for sure.  I also saw a lot of people dressed for skiing here.  The breakfast was far out for hotel quality.  I rather enjoyed my stay and it was fairly inexpensive.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Value ,"This was an excellent hotel for the price.We were on the fifth floor,non-smoking. This clearly is an older hotel,but has been renovated in key areas..Betty Martinez was very out-going and chatted with us every time she saw us in the breakfast area. We had no issues other than one very uncooperative male desk clerk whom we learned to avoid. We stayed a week,used the shuttle frequently,it is an excellent service. Breakfast was excellent. The hotel is in an industrial area,no nearby convenience stores,etc. We would surely stay here again. One aside,the Ford shuttle van really needed some attention ,tires were so worn we questioned the safety,and it needed a wash inside and out.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Staff goes above and beyond,"Everyone we interacted with was EXTRA helpful. We had a problem with the tv, and the maintenance staff & front desk were so nice and thoughtful in how they dealt with things (such a minor issue really.) This isn't a fancy hotel, but we were treated like royalty the entire time. The guest relations officer, Betty Martinez, helped us in the restaurant, she went and found something we asked about that wasn't on the buffet. I was just blown away with how everyone did their job. Thank you all for making our stay a really pleasant experience!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Front desk stuff stole my infomation,"Upon arrival, I was asked to sign in for Choice Rewards, a  rewards program which I have already signed for with my non work email. I handed my phone to the front desk lady to have her copy the number and she copied my regular work email and signed me  for the same program without my consent. Same lady also charged me twice for the same stay. I have called and left messages to the hotel manager and so far have not heard back form her. Very disappointed. I am sure what the front desk lady did is highly illegal.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Better than expected,"My sisters and I stayed here recently.  For the price, I didn't expect much.  We checked in late and our toilet was running, but we decided to wait until morning to ask someone to look at it.  In the morning, we went down for breakfast, which actually had a great selection and the food was on par with Denny's.  At breakfast we were approached by Betty, a member of guest services.  She checked in on us, without being prompted, and asked if there was anything we needed.  We mentioned the toilet and had someone at our room to look at it within 5 minutes.  Customer service was great!  The location is great if you're heading downtown (they also have a shuttle).  Our room was very clean and we even had a nice view of downtown off in the distance.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The stay was less than comfortable,"I stayed in Quality Inn for three nights. - Rm 520. The room got too cold at night, and I tinkered with the temp control in the room. It did not work. Called the front desk at about 11.00 Pm or so. Angry man at the desk informed me that the hotel is centrally air conditioned. Those temp controls on the wall do not work. I asked him for blankets. He was very rude and said he has no one to deliver the blankets to the room. When I pressed him, he said he would call 20 minutes later to tell me if he could find some one to deliver. But he never called. I ended up not sleeping. The next day the same story repeated. Angry woman at the desk told me she has blankets but that I have to wait for the Van driver to get back to deliver the blankets. I did get the blanket after half an hour. Their morning breakfast is great. Well run and really customer friendly staff.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Perfect location,"The room was extra spacious and cozy equipped with fridge and microwave. The breakfast buffet was decent. The workout room was just what I needed--treadmill, elliptical and weights. The hotel was a great location to downtown area. We had a rental car so we didn't take advantage of the free shuttle. Only complaint I had was our second night's stay, the room next door kept slamming doors loudly and causing a huge disturbance.  Not cool, when you have to get up at 4 am to catch a flight. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay here at the hotel.  I highly recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,one of my better hotel stays,"very good hotel,happy with my stay. staff excellent. staff are very helpful with all your needs.  there is free shuttle to take to downtown denver and its a short ride. its 420 freindly for those interested in recreation thc.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent at everything!!!,We booked this hotel for three nights.  Everything was fantastic!  The breakfast buffet had lots of choices and was very good.  All the staff members I met were kind and seemed genuinely glad we were staying with them.  The room was nice and had a microwave and refrigerator inside with two queen beds.  FREE hi-speed wifi too!  The hotel provided a free hourly shuttle to many different spots in downtown Denver.  Cannot say enough good things about this place - Excellent!!!!  +++,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Recent Stay,"This hotel is run down. I stayed in 905. The air didn't work, the sheets had stains on them, the walls were peeling, there isn't enough light in the bathrooms(you'd have to take a shower in the dark), and the room just wasn't clean. The staff is rude, acts like you should already know everything. Just a bad experience and will never stay again.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"By far, the best hotel experience for the money I spent","I landed up on 24th Sept 2015 and stayed through 13th Oct 15, with my wife and a 14 month old. Customer service was exceptional, given our long stay and a small child. Very clean rooms, close proximity to downtown with free hotel shuttle back and forth. Got stuck near the zoo without a car and hotel sent in their shuttle to pickup. The manager, entire management staff was outstandingly helpful and courteous. Felt pampered to the highest degree. Highly recommended",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,nice hotel,"We arrived early and our room was available. The lady who checked us in was very nice and easy to get a long with. We went up to our room and it was nice, had no complaints. They had a complimentary shuttle, it does run every hour. We had them take us to the mall which was a nice little area. And we used the next morning to get us the amtrak station. The guy who picked us from the mall was nice and friendly. We didnt have much interaction with the driver who took us because we were sitting in the back. The guy who took us to the amtrak station was rude and didnt even speak. We were told the shuttle would leave at 7 sharp. We went outside and waited and waited and nothing so we went back inside to sit down and then the guy that was standing at the front desk that new we were waiting for the shuttle asked if we were ready to go? I wanted to say really we were outside standing for how long yes we are ready to go. That was my only complaint for the hotel was that guy, very rude. He just dropped us off and said nothing to us. The hot breakfast was good to. Had eggs, bacon, gravy, potatoes, pastries, toast, bagels etc. Enough to fill you up! WOuld recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good place,"This was a good place to stay as it was close to downtown and the hotel provided a shuttle.  We took the shuttle to Coors Field and after the game, we simply called the hotel and waited a few minutes to be picked up.  Alisa at the front desk was extremely helpful, as were most people at the front desk.  Breakfast was better than most hotel breakfasts.  One of the employees went out of her way to locate a tea bag for me.  The rooms were big and beds comfortable.  The hotel is located on a busy highway, but there was not a problem with road noise.  We would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Budget friendly denver chain,Good budget hotel for an out of town tourist. The location is central and they have a lounge and bar. Several smoking areas too. Breakfast was good and adds value. They offer hourly shuttles downtown added value. Smoking rooms are top floor. I recommend this hotel if you are in the area recreationally.   It is in an industrial area but has a really mellow vibe. Staff were friendly and professional.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great combination of value and service,"Medium quality environ, older building, clean, nicely decorated, nothing over the top. Very friendly staff, very helpful on multiple occasions. The breakfast exceeded expectation, scrambled eggs, breakfast meat rotated (ham/sausage), juice... lots more. Offer shuttle service into town. Good location overall, easy to get around from there. Uber service always within 3-4 minutes. This is a yearly stop for my group, all occasions have been very satisfactory.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,awesome place,"i went to denver and stayed for 4 nights at this motel ,I love it here ,they treat you like family ,the breakfast is awesome ,my room was great nice and clean and i love the shuttle bus service they provide  if you plan a trip to Denver please stay there cause it is really nice .",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,we were in town for the LA Dodge game,"our room were clean and the breakfast was great it meet excellent and very clean area. very Kind people that work there. also want to mention that your employee by the name of Betty Martinez was very helpful and kind and mention place to see and how the hotel would also help us in anything that we need if it, if they could . we notice that everyone that work there were very, very helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disappointment,The hotel staff were very friendly.  The hotel did not have adequate parking. The windows were filthy.  The bed linens did not fit and came off the bed every night including the mattress pad.  The bar restaurant was inadequate and they would ask you to shout your order to them.    The rate is cheap and you get what you pay for.,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great staff and very good breakfast.,"I was not aware that this hotel is in an industrial area.  However, the shuttle was an added value.  The shuttle drivers are great but they get really busy because without a car there is a lot of need for the shuttle.   They try very hard to accommodate you.  My one suggestion is if you go out on the shuttle call well in advance to get a ride back to the hotel because they get very busy during the day.  All of the staff that I met at this hotel were very professional, courteous, helpful and friendly.  The food at breakfast was very good.  I really enjoyed the waffles and fresh fruits.  My stay here was great.  The rooms are clean but not very fancy and the staff will do whatever it takes to make sure you are comfortable.  The shuttle does not go to the Denver Airport, however they will call Teddy at Ted's Limo Service.  He is an awesome guy - very friendly and knowledgeable.  His fare to the airport was less than I expected.  Kudos to all of the Quality Inn Staff at this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel Exactly What We Wanted,"We were looking for a clean, decent hotel for a 4 night trip to Denver without having to spend top dollars.  The Quality Inn Central met our needs and without a car one of the best things about the hotel was the free hotel shuttle that got us downtown where we could enjoy the city.  The hotel is in an industrial area so without the shuttle we would have been stuck or paid a lot of money for taxi cabs. We needed 2 rooms and asked for adjoining or next to each other which we did get. The rooms were roomy, clean, and comfortable. The free hot breakfast served was really good and all 3 in my group agreed that it was better than the average and served in a nice restaurant offering plenty of tables.  All hotel staff that we interacted with were so helpful and friendly, especially the shuttle drivers and Betty, the Guest Relations Officer.  I can't say enough about how impressed we were with the staff and all they did to make us feel welcome and to know if we needed something they would have made sure our needs were taken care of. In short, the hotel was a great deal for what we paid and I highly recommend it. Betty recommended a driver for us and if you need transportation while in Denver definitely contact Teddy at Ted Limo Service.  He will take care of you.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Awful ,Not impressed with this hotel. We didn't receive maid service until after 3:30 pm one day even AFTER we requested it from the front desk over an hour earlier. The cleanliness was very poor and the room smelled highly of smoke. If we make the trip back to Denver I am sorry to say we will not spend our money here. This has been one of the worst hotel experiences all around.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Cheap & cheerful,"This is a budget hotel & you get what you pay for. We experienced problems checking in - despite showing them my reservation voucher they couldn't find our reservation & told us they were fully booked. They ended up phoning the accommodation booking agent who emailed them something & then all was ok & they had a room?!! This took about an hour after we'd been on a 9 hour flight. Not what you want. On the plus side they gave us lots of complimentary toiletries since our bags had been lost!! Great start. The room was ok. Spacious, comfortable bed, air con & wi fi good. Shower was rubbish though. Bit grubby looking & it took ages for the water to get hot plus the pressure was terrible. It was a bit noisy on a night. Breakfast was decent. Despite being ""central"" it was a short drive downtown. They did have a complimentary shuttle every hour though. You needed to go downtown really as there was nothing around the hotel. Overall it was ok but wouldn't rush back.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"No Frills, Nothing Fancy, But it works!","Let's be honest, ""Inn"" is part of it's name. So there's where you set your expectations. If you're expecting something modern and chic, then go to a Hyatt or Marriott in Downtown. We opted to stay here because of the affordable price, the proximity from the airport and downtown. We were there for the weekend to take in a Rockies vs Giants game at Coors Field. They run a free shuttle that will drop you off just down the street from the ballpark. I would also inquire about where else their free shuttle service takes you as I think this is an added convenience. The complimentary breakfast is an added bonus. They had strawberry pancake mix when we were there, where you can either use it to make your own Waffle or Pancake. They also had eggs and sausage, with potatoes, and your typical cereal, continental breakfast variety. The rooms are decent and exactly what I would expect for what we paid.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Stay away!,"If on a vacation, on a budget this might be the place for you. If a business traveler – I’d stay away from this hotel. What a dive. I was trying to be economical on this business trip, and sadly believed the reviews – WRONG. I have Diamond status with Choice Hotels, so I have stayed at plenty of their hotels across the nation – so this review comes with some experience. The hotel is located in a scary place, nothing around it. The room – dated and the shower – disgusting, bed hard as a rock, but the A/C worked (a plus) and the WIFI worked well. Oh – no bath towels in the room, and the shower drain is stopped up. Fitness room – I’m still laughing about what they call a fitness center. It only took 40 minutes to get a grilled cheese sandwich and fries from the NOT BUSY grill. Oh, and NO PARKING, but you can park on the street if you like. The breakfast was nice for a Quality Inn – a step above from others that I have stayed at. I should add that the staff was nice and kept apologizing for all of the problems. I had a reservation for 2 nights, but checked out early as this was a bad choice for me.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Okay,"Hotel is okay, nothing exceptional or outstanding, but ok. Staff is friendly, rooms are old and some equipment broken (fitness center). The design and interior of the hotel lack charm or any pretty details. However if you are just looking for a place to sleep the hotel is okay.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Comfortable and clean,"The Quality Inn Central is a fine place to stay.   Our room was overlooking I70 with some attendant noise, but earplugs solved that.  The blackout curtains don't quite cover the whole window, leaving very bright gaps at either end (and the middle, but we solved that with a clip).The shower uses a mixer handle which went from quite warm to hot - no option for slightly warm. Also the thermostat didn't register properly - my d was freezing as it was reading 77.  There were no spare blankets in the room (I'm sure I could have requested one), but we solved the problem by setting the temp to 80.This was nothing special, but a perfectly fine option in Denver",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,5 year anniversary,"Great free shuttle service. Friendly emploees. Could have used more pillows but they had none. Legit breakfast borritos. They were out of cholula hot sauce though. Biscuits and gravy good. Location pretty prime for being so close to downtown and a 7/11. Also close to expressway for country mountain travel. Good diner next door. Fine prices. Nicepool. Quiet elevators.  Private. Average hotel, but service free parking and shuttle andbreakfast and pool make it good. As for the smoking complaints the hotel was clean and smoke free. It's a safe area. Bartender sonja was a good Makers Mark drink preparer.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Amazing location, clean rooms, friendly staff, tasty breakfast, great shuttle service!","I was in town for a job interview and work in the hotel business. I had a wonderful stay and was pleasantly surprised that the common areas were even nicer than the online pictures showed. I liked how everything was clean; the elevators smelled like pine trees!The FREE shuttle service is such a nice amenity they provide. I suggest catching a Rockies game (cheap tickets always available) and take advantage of the shuttle service. Also, go the 16th St. Mall location using the shuttle for shopping, dining, and city exploring. It's location is awesome because it's right by I-70, which you can take right to downtown Denver. The hotel isn't in a congested part of the city, so after a day in the mountains or exploring the city, you can chill out in this less crowed location.That girl with the dark brown hair and glasses who is always there and works on the left computer is so helpful. So is the gal with the short light brown hair and the other gal with long brown hair in a ponytail with glasses. I'm so sorry I didn't get their names! Management, please give them the appropriate credit. One minor thing that is needed is new shower drains. I thought my drain was clogged, but the drain was just closed. From reading other reviews, other guests have this problem too, so it would be helpful to have drains that stay open so guests aren't confused.   Great job guys! Thanks for a great stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Close to Regis University,"We have stayed at this hotel several times in the past few years since our daughter started school at Regis University.  I have read some of the reviews and have to say our rooms have always been very clean.  We had one maintenance issue on our last stay with lack of hot water in the shower, and a maintenance person arrived shortly after our call and fixed the problem.  Yes, this hotel is located in a very industrial area, but if you do any research when you make the reservation, you will know that.  We stay here because it is so close to Regis University and we ran into several other Regis parents during ""drop off"" weekend who seemed very satisfied with the location and price of this hotel as well.    It does not advertise or pretend to be located in a ""happening"" part of Denver.  It is a decent, clean hotel that has quick access to the interstate system.  The free breakfast is better than most hotels, and the women working in the breakfast room were always helpful and working hard.  We enjoyed some drinks and appetizers in the bar at night.  The bartender was delightful - good service and super friendly to all the customers.  The only complaint we had was the man who seemed to be the manager of the bar/restaurant.  He hovered over the bar each night we there and if he did any work, we did not see it.  All he seemed to do was helicoptor over the bartender as she was trying to build a rapport with the customers.  What a downer he was!  He totally ruined the mood while the lovely woman working in the bar did her best to make sure customers were having a good time.  We went back a second night because of her, and there he was again, staring her down.  We never saw him try to help her when she got busy.  It was noticeable to the customers so hopefully he can either step in to help her, or stay out of the way!!!!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Comfortable stay with dog,"I think what made the biggest difference for me when I stayed here was the quality of service.  I checked in late at night, and the person behind the front counter was so nice, welcoming, and accommodating.  When you're exhausted from driving all day, that is a welcome experience.  My room was clean, with adequate amenities ( I was only staying for one night).  Another plus was that I was able to get a late checkout for the next morning without being charged anything extra.  The bed was comfortable and clean.  My only issue was that I was placed in a room on the 2nd floor near the elevators, and throughout the night, my dog would see the shadows of people passing by the room through the seams of the door (the bottom and side) and this bothered her.  Needless to say, I didn't get very much sleep because of her getting upset by said shadows.  The free breakfast in the morning was okay, I wouldn't call it deluxe, though.  Overall, I had a good stay (apart from my dog not letting me sleep much). If you have a pet with similar issues, I'd request a room further from the elevators.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality in Name only,"We were looking for a moderate price hotel downtown near Cooks Field. There were some reviews that caused concern but decided to take a chance. We found the hotel to be worse than we expected. The hotel is badly in need of renovation. The halls and room had a distinctly musty smell. The mattresses were worn and the bedding was old. There were an inadequate number of electric outlets. The bathroom was a disaster. The tub didn't drain, the sink had no hot water and the floor was dirty. I called the next morning to ask that the bathroom issues be fixed. The plug was removed from the tub, there still was no hot water in the sink and the floor was still dirty. There was no explanation or apology offered. There is a shuttled offered as a nice feature. Unfortunately they didn't plan well and had didn't have enough room on the shuttle for the return. When I asked if another shuttle was coming, the driver said we would have to try to get us all on as there was no plan for another shuttle. There were eight of us left off the shuttle. The driver did return and other out 40 minutes later to pick us up. When we finally returned to the hotel there were at least two more shuttles sitting in the parking lot. Again no apology. Definitely wouldn't staff here again",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Reasonable rate, close to downtown",I was looking for a hotel with a reasonable rate and close to downtown. I got it at this hotel. This hotel has a free shuttle service to a few downtown locations so you don't have to take public transit. And it has hot breakfast included.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great customer service,We live 4 hours from Denver and were meeting a friend in Denver. Unfortunately her flight was delayed and the plans shifted 1 day later. The manager was very understanding and accommodated our one day delay. We stayed here last month and this is now our go-to hotel in Denver. Centrally located with a great shuttle service to downtown makes this the ideal location for affordable near-town lodging.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Just sleep,"I visit the Quality Inn in Denver the room was a little date, I stay on the 8th floor just below smoking and not just cigarettes was being smoke it was very strong ,The hotel was close to the highways made it easy to get back on. room was ok just for sleeping .",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Problems With Restaurant, Front Desk","Room could have been cleaned much better, I found Q-Tips and a couple pens behind one of the bed stands in my Single King room. There were 5 of us with 2 rooms staying the 10-13, they couldn't get us adjoining due to a concert being in town so we were on the 6th and 8th floors. On the 10th we ate at the Palm Grill, which is located in the hotel, and had great service. Food was pretty good. We all paid separately, and the next morning woke up to one of our party having a pending charge of the entire pill as well as her own part of the bill on the card, setting her back about $100 for the entire trip. When approached about it, the restaurant staff sent us to the front desk who then gave us a rude response saying that they could do absolutely nothing about it.. Which is fine. However, I work front desk at a hotel and when approached with problems such as that would offer some sort of discount etc.. For the guests troubles. Only front desk person we got great service from was Maria Steele (I believe thats her name). They should have more of her working there.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Would not recommend families to stay here...,"Stayed here with my 2 kids (5 and 3 yr old) and 2 dogs.  The area was in an industrial area and quite frankly, i was a bit unsettled with the people hanging around in the lobby. They offered shuttles to 2-3 different locations and i can hear the shuttle driver laughingly tell one guest that he can drop her off at a liquor store.  Anyway, the hallways and carpet in the room just felt a bit musty and dirty.  Sheets were clean and bathroom was fine. The breakfast was ok -- it wasn't terrible, the restaurant where the breakfast is served seems a bit dingy -- the workers were very nice and friendly.  Overall, i would not recommend this to folks with kids, the area and guests that it seems to have didn't seem amenable to families.   Also, not a great hotel for dogs -- i had to walk the dogs out at night and didn't feel safe in the parking lot.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Former greatness really tired property now,"Had a one king bedroom on an upper floor.  Hotel staff was very accommodating when checking in.  Lobby looked pretty nice.  Requested room away from elevator, which was fulfilled.  The structure of the hotel and floors was a 3-sided, kind of curved triangle, which actually worked kind of well with the rooms and how far they were from the elevator...  all were close enough that you don't have to walk forever just to get to your room, and most were far enough away that the foot traffic and noise in the halls that can be created weren't an issue.  The room, however, was rather tired-looking and almost shabby.  There was an aroma in the room that told me it used to be a smoking-allowed hotel, in spite of the fact that the entire floor was now non-smoking; there was even a burned hole right in the middle of the coverlet for the bed that no one had even attempted to mend, let alone replace.  Bed was comfortable enough for sleeping, and view was good.  Bathroom was clean, but toiletries were pretty cheapie...  Peeked at the breakfast the next morning and was not impressed, so decided to stop at a Mickey D's on the way out of town...This hotel advertised a free shuttle to close area attractions.  I personally didn't use it, but there seemed to be a lot of people doing so, and it seemed to be working well.  I drove a car here and had a really hard time getting to the drive and entrance to the hotel.  The streets are kind of weird around it, and even using a GPS, still had trouble.  Just an FYI, the traffic on the freeways in Denver is HORRIBLE, going both ways (into town and out), no matter what time of day it is.  Plan accordingly!",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Poor experience capped by an unacceptable bathroom,"Well, in sum I can confirm the negatives reported elsewhere: the grim, the poor quality of food in the restaurant and the misnomer that the word central represents when the only acces to downtown is via a shuttle bus. The bathroom however, oh dear!A minor matter: we were unable to get cold water from the bathroom tap and the sink plunger didn't work. This took nearly the length of our stay to sort out. More seriously:Yesterday afternoon water began to pour through our ceiling. We called maintenance who claimed that they had fixed the problem that, they said, was related to the use of the shower in the room above us.I was sceptical and, it seems, rightly so.At about 1.30 am we were woken up by the sound of running water. Water was coming through the bathroom ceiling at a fair rate. We called reception, maintenance could do nothing immediate to stop the problem. Security came but could also offer no assistance. The person manning reception was much more helpful but could only offer us a room to moved to that reeked of smoke. It had apparently only recently been redesignated non smoking. Eventually, she found a room that was slightly less noxious, threw open the window and said that she hoped it would air. We were at first unwilling to swap but as the water continued to pour into the bathroom we moved. I ought to add that we were offered no assistance with our luggage.All this doesn't help when you need to get up at 5.30 to get ready to travel on an early AMTRAK train.The staff work hard and stay surprisingly cheerful in the face is under investment and poor quality management and leadership it seems to me.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Decent hotel,"Our party of six had two rooms, one of which had a strange fishy smell.  The buffet style breakfast was great included scrambled eggs, potatoes, biscuits and gravy...  Otherwise was a good stay.  They have free shuttles to downtown (didn't need, didn't use) but if we needed them would be great.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Mile High,"While beginning to show its age, this Inn is well maintained, clean and very reasonable. A nice, free breakfast is available at 6:30am, all you would want to eat and tasty for sure. The staff is most accommodating and friendly. My wife found she was missing a hearing aid( she felt it was lost in our room) and mentioned it to the Guest Services coordinator, a lovely lady, who took over and instructed the maid service personnel to use a hand sweeper rather than the usual vacuum sweeper. As it turned out my wife found the hearing aid tangled up with her iPhone charging cord. Being  located about 10-15 minutes from downtown Denver, free shuttles are run on the hour from 7:00am-10:00pm. I would gladly recommend this inn to friends and family and will likely stay with them next visit to Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don't be deceived! ,"This was old and dirty. If it wasn't late, we would have left. So disappointed! Our towels were dirty, the floors disgusting,  dogs in every other room......need I go!?!For 20 or 30 bucks more we could have stayed somewhere very nice. If you don't have time to preview, don't take a chance.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"A practical, useful hotel in Denver","This is a very practical, popular hotel with good value for the buck. It serves a warm breakfast which will take you a long way and has a shuttle to downtown Denver that works well and connects to the public transit system as well. It is a bit out of the way so you need a bit of planning if you are not driving, but more than compensates with good pricing that doesn't seem to go crazy when there are events in town as others do. Lots of people coming in and out in all kinds of travel - tourists, foreigners, people attending conferences in Denver or even Boulder, bus or train excursions, truckers, the gamut. Nice, friendly staff and basic but complete services. Bonus points gained by solving an administrative issue (not caused by them) instantly and with good humor. WiFi decent with some flaky intervals. If it's an option in non-luxury travel, don't hesitate.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Extended Date Night,Demitri  Was Rude! We Did Not End Up Staying At This Hotel. We Had Booked Our Room For The Wrong Date. Demitri Was Not Very Personable. The Young Lady Working The Front Desk Was Willing To Help. Demitri I Believe Was The Manager.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Stayed on the 9th floor for 4 days,"I really have no complaints! The staff was AMAZING, very friendly and helpful. The hot buffet style breakfast was decent. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable and we always had clean towels. We had a microwave and a mini fridge in our room and the staff had no issues with bringing us a roll away bed. Will definitely stay here again when I visit Denver in the future.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality...yeah right!!!!,"If you don't mind bloodstained comforters, cold showers, and mildew in the shower then this is the place for you!!!! The first room smelled like throw up ...luckily they switched our room.  The breakfast was not it was cracked up to be. Room was dirty and I slept with my shoes on because I was afraid to let my feet touch the blankets. If you do decide to stay here being your own towels, blankets, pillows and Clorox wipes!!!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Game,"I was confident about our hotel selection for our annual family trip to Denver to go to Water World and to catch a Rockies game because we had stayed here a few years back. Unfortunately, the hotel has gone down hill significantly. Our non smoking room smelled like smoke, the carpet was filthy, the floorboards were broken and separating from the walls, and the hallways were dirty. We stayed one night and immediately changed hotels the next morning. Thank goodness the staff allowed us to check out early. They offer a free shuttle and breakfast, but it doesn't make up for its shortcomings. We will not be staying here again.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Would I stay here again? Ummmm...I don't know.,"We stayed here from July 1 - July 6 and then again July 9 - 11th.  I give it an overall C-.  This hotel has 9 floors.  It has a bar and a grill restaurant.  In the mornings the grill is used for the breakfast eating area. We ate 6 breakfasts here.  Keep in mind that this is a large hotel.  I give the breakfast a C.  The only egg dish served while we were there was watery scrambled eggs.  I never saw any other kind.  The meat was either link sausage or ham.  The sides were always re-fried beans and fried potatoes.  There was always biscuits and gravy and Tortillas and salsa.  Two kinds of cereal. already cooked pancakes (which were pretty good) and halfway through our stay a Belgian waffle maker was available.  The syrup was cold and so the hot waffles and pancakes were quickly cold.  The fruit medley was canned fruit.  I never saw a banana for those 6 days.  They did have apples every day and sometimes good, fresh orange wedges.  Cooked oatmeal, yogurt, toast, bagels, and assorted breads were available.  Regular coffee and decaf, 2 kinds of hot tea - Earl grey and English Breakfast - always.  Orange juice was the only juice offered, water and milk.  The first room we stayed in was on the 8th floor (there are 3 elevators).  It was supposed to be a non-smoking room but there was a strong odor of cigarette smoke.  We opened the window every morning and closed it at bedtime.  This was a king bed room.  The mattress was ok - not great but not horrible.  I don't recall any pictures in this room.  There was a pullout couch and a chair and coffee table.  One bedside table with lamp.  Outlets on the walls for computer and phones.  The best feature of this room was the counter space in the bathroom and a separate vanity just outside the bathroom.  Ironing board and iron in the closet.  There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom.  No fridge and no microwave. The lighting was adequate.  We were given 2 wash cloths and 2 hand towels.  I left a note to please give us 4 after the second day and housekeeping left us 4 each day from then on.  The room was pretty clean but could have been better.  Kind of noisy.  The hotel is aging and it shows and the decor and furniture is dated and needs to be replaced.  The second stay was on the 7th floor.  The noise was worse on this floor.  This was a 2 queen bed room.  No fridge or microwave.  Pretty much the same layout as the King room.  This room and bathroom was not cleaned well when we arrived and was not cleaned well while we stayed there.  Our shampoo, conditioner and lotion was not replaced the second day.  I give housekeeping on this room a C- or D+.  The TV cable had kind of a strange programming offered.  We did not use the pool or fitness center or laundry.  I had no complaints with the staff.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Husband is not allowed to choose hotel anymore,"This is NOT a 3 star hotel. If you are looking for an overpriced place to sleep look no farther.  Room was groddy, stains on lampshades and ceiling, huge hole in curtain, hair in bed when pulled back sheets.  I should have known from the beer opener in the bathroom to run,  but this was husbands vacation, his booking and one of few rooms/hotels that offered smoking. Attempted speaking with cleaning staff, unfortunately it didn't seem that they spoke English as they just looked at you when you spoke to them, no responses just blank looks.  When they came into room to ""clean"" it was a joke, my children's rooms look better.  We were told by front desk when we called about our cold room that the thermostat is based on outside weather conditions. They stated they would send a space heater right up, never came.  The restaurant customer service downstairs is just as bad. The only redeeming quality about this hotel was a nice woman who came by the tables every morning asking how everyone's food was as they have free breakfast. I'm sorry I don't remember her name as she was really nice and a great example of how the rest of your hotel should be. Needless to say, husband no longer making room reservations.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Too hot for comfort,"After staying in this hotel for 4 days on the 9th floor I would like to say the room was very hot and uncomfortable. The heat coming off the windows made it difficult for the a\c to keep up.  I had to buy a fan to keep cool. The smell of reefer was extremely strong coming from the room next door. The hotel staff was extremely friendly including ""Albert"" our shuttle driver. The restaurant food was good but, check your food bill for overcharges. The waitresses spend more time socializing behind the bar then taking care of the customers. Overall we enjoyed our stay and hope to return in the winter when it's cooler.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Really close to downtown and easy to get around town.,"The staff were are fantastic.  Very helpful with directions to everywhere and very gracious and helpful with any questions we had.  The only thing were weren't aware of was that there are some rooms without fridge and microwave, so check before you reserve a room.  Otherwise, this was a great place to stay and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Mixed thoughts,"Check-in was very quick and friendly. We were booked on the second floor. I asked for a higher floor. The Manager cautioned us about the 8th floor as the 9th is a smoking floor. The room was fine until we turned on the AC. The whole room smelled of weed. Just be aware.I returned to the lobby and apologized to the Manger for not heeding his advice and we were given a room on the 6th floor.The room was good, clean in good condition.The hotel is well away from any restaurants within walking distance. When booking the hotel the picture gives you a sense of it being in a ""tourist"" area. However you have to drive 5-10 minutes to find a restaurant. Not a big deal once you are aware.Breakfast was hectic as there were three busloads of visitors arriving at breakfast at 7:00a.m. Having said that the staff replenished the food very quickly and efficiently.The biggest drawback for ourselves was coming from Toronto  the constant smell of weed in the elevators etc. was a turn off. In speaking with the manager he indicated that by law the Inn had to provide a smoking floor.The pool area was fine. A lack of decent towels in the pool area but clean.In spite of the helpful staff we would probably not stay here again mainly because of the location.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Vacation ,"Great place, front desk Demetri was awesome, great sense of humor while getting rooms book. The area was a little sketchy were the hotel is. Thought the bar could of had a drink menu, but good. Rooms were nicely cleaned. But overall had a great stay.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great location and good value,"My brother and I attend a different baseball stadium every summer and we currently went to Coors Field in Denver.  This hotel is about 3 miles away from downtown Denver and they have a shuttle that leaves every hour to take you anywhere for FREE!!  Can't beat that deal.  They also have a bar downstairs, so it's a nice place to wind down and have some drinks before you call it a night!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great and friendly services,"We spent 4 nights at this Denver hotel. Yes, it is a bit hard to find but once you know the way to get there, it is a very good base to discover Denver. We had one of the new rooms, these looked nice and were clean. Indeed as indicated by other reviews some parts of the hotel definitely need a make over and have to be cleaned incl. the restaurant. If they would do this the hotel would be a 5 start experience.But best thing of this hotel is the front desk staff and their personal services. Unfortunately my wife got a medical emergency during the first night we stayed, however many compliments for the professional attitude of the front desk staff and management how they handled the situation and support afterwards. Due to all the stress we forgot the cellphone of my wife, which was returned safely to us within 3 working days at our home. Again great service!We would definitely consider to stay at this hotel, next time we visit Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Really needs updating,"This property looked good from the website and it showed a curved facade to the building.   The reviews mentioned 'great views of mountains or city'.  This is actually a three sided hotel property which will give one side a view of mountains, one side a view of city (sort of) and the third side a view of industrial area alongside Hwy 25.  Guess which side we got?  Yea - we could waive at the truckers from our 5th floor room.....We checked in with wonderful desk personnel and went up to our room.  There we found that the toilet was half-hearted in it's function at best.  We called downstairs and were offered a room change - same room just one floor down.  Same problem with the toilet and the room looked like it had barely survived a frat party.  We opted for the original room and tried to overlook the general shop-worn look of everything.  There had been repairs to the ceiling which consisted of patching over and painting only the patch - and no effort at all to match the paint.  There were scratches and dingy marks on the wall where pictures had originally been hung.  The doors don't shut - they SLAM.  Even if you try to avoid it - they SLAM. The room also looked very worn out - lampshades dented and dusty, mold spots in the shower area.  Oh, and the shower - there's a good one.  No Hot Water - - nope - No Hot Water.  Well, to be honest, you could let the water run for about 15 minutes and it would 'approach' tepid.  We  were told that they had a girls softball tournament in town the next weekend and were going to be fully booked with dusty, grimy teenage girls - - - yea, good luck with that water thing.When we inquired about the issues with the slow fill on the toilet we were told that the water supply is on the roof and that explained the 'lower water pressure'.  Ooookaaaay - whatever.  They also told us they were working on renovations.  Yep - the dumpster was right below our window.   Getting to the property is a bit of a challenge but you can't blame them for that.  I wish I had looked more closely at the area before booking but we went for a place that was reasonable nearer the city.  $130+ a night during the week and when we added another room that was $159.  Wow.  The breakfast was good but sometimes it took a while for them to replenish items.  Dinner in the restaurant was OK but again, the area needs massive renovations.The staff is marvelous especially considering how creative they have to be in their explanations of the property conditions.  All in all - would not stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dirty... Not clean... should have cost $50/ night not $100,"The front desk staff, Alyssa and Betty in the restaurant, were excellent. Helpful, happy and so nice to deal with. We stayed here for five days june 2015.Unfortunately our room was run down and dirty. badly needed a vacuum which never happened and the second day when we returned I was hopeful after the house keeping staff cleaned that the state of the room would be improved... NOPE... same dirt, hair and lint AND a bottle of cleaning spray left on our unclean bathroom counter and sink! Would NEVER stay here again and could not recommend. My husband couldnt believe it... ""You always do your research... how did this happen?"" Wont happen again. Sorry to be harsh but we were bummed out and avoided our room.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Apt for business visits,I stayed in Room 209. No smoking. For the value the rooms are fine. Does require a bit more more refurbishing the carpets. Also charging points are required on the bed side and the table. Otherwise the rooms were fine.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Fun stay!,"The staff accommodated us by putting my family's rooms close together. Older hotel with good upkeep. The kids loved the pool, a good temperature. Free shuttle service downtown. Clean, large rooms with comfortable beds. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a good selection. The staff kept it stocked and were friendly.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,We went down for a ball game.,"The rooms are very nice and clean. They are presently updating the rooms, so that makes them really nice. The people who work there are very nice and friendly. They have a wonderful breakfast every morning. The motel is conveniently located to many attractions and they have a free shuttle to all of them. A very nice outdoor pool. Also an attached restaurant and bar. We've stayed there several times because we like it so much. I just feels so homey.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Enough,"The hotel is in a bad part of town, but it is far away from the bad things about the area. The hotel is a little rough and outdated, but on the days we were there, they were doing renovations. We saw them getting rid of old carpet, broken fridges, gross shower curtains, and they were painting! So it is good to know they are improving. That being said, there were lights with no covers in the hallways, broken appliances sitting outside of rooms. The room overall was good. There was an old flickering light in the bathroom. The doors were dirty. The windows were super thin; we could hear all of the traffic. Wall outlets need replaced; they were either pushed into the wall or non functioning. The complimentary breakfast was pretty good too! No fresh fruit though. Only canned fruit. This place is good for an overnight stay though!",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Great Location, Loved the Pool","Recently enjoyed a Road Trip through the Rockies and gambled a little when it came to my hotel rooms..... I've been using apps that supposedly offer last minute (i.e. day-of) discounts. They work well unless there's some big event happening in town. This was the case in Denver for me, a large Convention had skyrocketed prices in town for the night. After much searching and thinking that I would have to stay pretty far out of town, I stumbled upon this hotel. The price was perfect for what I needed and the location was only minutes from downtown. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. In the morning, I used the outdoor pool and while the air was still a little brisk, I was pleasantly surprised to find the pool heated. I would definitely stay here again next time I visit Denver. After 4 long days of road tripping, this hotel offered the perfect opportunity to relax and unwind.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,gloomy and dirty,"this place was quite dirty and ugly. there was nothing bright, pretty or uplifting in the place. luckily we only had to spend one night there!the shower was moldy and the sheets had many questionable stains. we arrived so late and tired that i had no energy to ask them to clean it up or change our rooms, we just passed out.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Great location, needs a lil love","We stayed here because we love Choice hotels, but our usual Comfort Inn on 58th ave was booked.  It's a great location for downtown & the amusement parks & they provide a free shuttle too.  I loved the outdoor pool, but was disappointed they didn't have a hot tub.  (Or if they did I never saw one)  They allow pets for a small fee but there wasn't much for grassy areas to relieve them. The rooms were clean & had somewhat newer decor.  My only complaints are that they need to add the mini fridge & microwave as its a humid area to keep ice cold & you come to expect that extra perk with Choice hotels.  Also the bathrooms could use a lil love..room 826 had what looked to be a large hole through the door that they attempted to fill in & paint over.  It looked horrible & was an unnecessary way to save money. I'll be back if I cant get our usual one, but for $100 a night I think they should put some of that back into the fix ups.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Best continental breakfast!!!,"This was not our first time staying at the quality inn. The staff is over the top, very accommodating. Betty Martinez was helping with the breakfast & I remembered her from last year, it's nice to see the same friendly faces! We will definitely come again. The rooms are clean & the beds are comfy. :)",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Stay away.,"This may be a cheap place to stay, but it is not a good bargain. Floors are awful in the rooms and hallways. Couldn't let the water out of the sink or tub without taking out the plug completely. They came out because they were broken. Had a roll away bed that was not fit to sleep on. Hair dryer didn't work and did not get replaced even when ask for a new one. The windows are so old that they sound like they are open and you can hear all of the interstate noise. Awful place.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pleasant stay near Interstates,"Spent one night here with spouse. Check-in was fast, friendly and efficient. Received room #514, a kind with sofa bed, non-smoking. Room was clean and comfortable. Sheets and pillows were of good quality. Windows could be cleaned, but otherwise can't complain.Single-serve coffee maker as well as fridge and microwave. Nice! Free wifi worked well.Breakfast in the morning is in the hotel's restaurant (also open for lunch/dinner/drinks at night) and offers eggs, potatoes, refried beans, blueberry waffles and biscuits and gravy as well as fruit, cereal, oatmeal and toast, coffee, juice. Plenty of food to get you started off well!Hotel location is north of downtown (not in downtown) but offers a free shuttle bus to downtown that runs on the hour until 10pm. You must sign up for it as is limited and they don't want anyone to be left downtown!Outdoor pool on property.If in Denver again and needing a hotel, we would likely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Great service, very clean and comfortable","We stayed here while passing through Denver on a cross country journey.  The room was basic but clean, and service was exceptional.  We arrived prior to check-in and were able to get a room one hour before the normal check-in time.  Front desk staff was attentive and friendly.  We had an issue with our tv and, when we called for assistance, the problem was resolved immediately.  A service person was at our room in minutes.  The hotel is located in an industrial area.  Complimentary shuttle service is available to and from Rockies games as well as other locations.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The breakfast isn't bad,"This hotel isn't great. I stayed here for a great price due to having good discount codes. For a room for four with two queen beds, it wasn't expensive at all. With that being said, because I got the stay at a discount, I wouldn't recommend staying here for full price. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable but the rest is really mediocre. There was an obviously homeless drug addict sleeping in the hall chair outside of our room. I want to feel safe in my hotel and him being there did NOT make me feel safe. The breakfast is so small with really unhealthy options. The eggs are REAL eggs which is a bonus but I can't say I wanted to eat anything from the buffet. It all looked gross. You'd be better off going out for breakfast.Finally, the location isn't great. It's in a sketchier part outside of downtown. I wouldn't really recommend this place, unfortunately.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Meh,"This was our second time staying at this hotel. Our first stay was in June of 2014- it was mediocre at best.  We booked again this year through Cannabis Tours without realizing that we'd be staying at the same hotel. We drove about 580 miles to get there and upon our arrival around 4:00 p.m., we learned that they did not have a vaporizer for our room, which was a part of the deal with Cannabis Tours. I would like to say that this was not the fault of the hotel, but when we walked away I heard someone behind the desk remind the other employees ""No one gets a vaporizer unless they booked through Cannabis Tours, one per room."" Later we went to the front desk again to see if it had come yet and when they said it had not, we tried to ask what was going on and why we hadn't yet received it. The front desk staff attributed it to ""the guy"" not being there yet, and basically pushed the issue off on Cannabis Tours. We emailed Cannabis Tours to see what was going on and they confirmed our suspicions that the hotel was giving vaporizers to those who should not have had them.  I was quite unsatisfied with the breakfast selection each morning as I like to have fruit, and each morning the hotel placed out what seemed to be the same, slowly diminishing tray of canned fruit. Another part that was bothersome about our stay last year was a small mishap with the washing machine. We were inserting coins and it wasn't counting all of the coins, so we ended up having to pay 2x more to wash a load of clothes than we should have. When he left the front desk know, the man stared at us blankly and said ""but did you get it to work?"" I told him yes, we got it to work but it took 2x as much money as it should have. He begrudgingly wrote us a slip for the amount we were shorted and we ended up walking away feeling as if we'd inconvenienced him.  So what did we like about this hotel? The location is good, we found that it was pretty easy to get wherever we needed to go with a little help from our GPS. Our rooms weren't uncleanly and the beds were comfortable. We did ask for a king size bed and instead got two queens, but that wasn't a major inconvenience. Last year we had requested a room with a mountain view, and were welcomed by a tiny sliver of mountain- that turned out to be alright because the view of downtown was pretty neat. We used the shuttle last year as well and that was a good experience, the driver was nice.  I would stay at this hotel again if they improved their breakfast and if the staff was consistently honest and empathetic. Mistakes happen, but it's better to own up to it than to try to push the blame off on someone else.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Love this hotel!,"We live in Eagle, CO, but every time we go to Denver for any event and spend the night, we stay at the Quality Inn Central.  The rooms are always clean, the prices are reasonable, the complimentary breakfast is OUTSTANDING, the staff is friendly and the FREE shuttle service to almost anywhere in the city is great.  It's really relaxing to know that we don't have to worry about getting around Denver.  Getting to the hotel is very easy and convenient to both the major highways that go through Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Friendly staff, though hotel needs updating.","The room  we stayed in was old and outdated. The hotel is close to downtown, but it is not convenient or easy to get to.  The hotel staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the area. I would not stay at this hotel again. It is near railroad tracks, as well as two busy highways.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great hotel close to downtown...,This hotel despite being in a kind of industrial area was only 10 minutes by car to downtown Denver. The people were nice. The place was clean. The beds were good enough. And best of all the price! Much cheaper than the same type of room down town. And here you have free parking and the Village Inn restaurant next door for breakfast. Yes for me the only con was the breakfast included with the room. It was not worth it. But the breakfast at the Village inn was wonderful and cheap!I would stay here again for sure. Ask for a quiet room away from the highway if they have it.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,First time I stayed in this Hotel. Beds are comfortable also!,"Very nice Hotel, enjoyed my stay, reasonable rates, Pet Friendly. I will stay here again.Shuttle service to and from 16th Mall was excellent.Rock Bottom on 16th Mall had a great Bison Steak!Wonderful shopping and great places to eat.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Great rates, clean rooms, and over a really nice stay.","I really like this place. It is in a super easy to get to spot that is pretty effortless to find. The room was very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. I liked the atmosphere of the hotel, always plenty of people about. The breakfast offered for free in the morning is also pretty good with something for everyone. I will defiantly stay here again and again while in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Best trip ever!,"Free breakfast!  It was  Awesome!  Free shuttle downtown!  Our driver was  Awesome!  Hotel friendly! Awesome!   Wasn't in our room but to sleep and get ready.  Bigger pillows would be nice but I managed!  We had only booked for 2 days...ended up keeping the room the whole week at the same great price. The location was perfect for us to see the mountains, rockies game, go downtown and the red rocks!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Older well kept property not far from downtown,Booked on line.   Price reasonable.   Rooms very clean but a bit older.   Access from nearby Interstate not easy.   Great free shuttle to downtown.  Beds very comfortable.  Great free breakfast buffet.   I would stay again,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great venue for a Large Business Meeting or event!,I recently held a 2 day hiring event at the Quality Inn Central.  I was very impressed by how cooperative the staff was.  Steve and Maria worked very hard to make sure that our event was successful.  The floor plan / room layout was set to our specifications exactly.  The catered food was delicious!  We will certainly consider utilizing this hotel (which is centrally located) for future events.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great stay for the price!,"We enjoyed our stay.  The beds were very comfortable, nice shower head with plenty of hot water, clean room that had plenty of space. Our room was very quiet for we weren't near the elevators. We had a great view of downtown and the mountains off in the distance on the 6th floor. Only thing I would recommend is that the outside windows be cleaned periodically.  I liked how there is a mirror with a counter outside the bathroom so that one can use to finish getting ready, while the other one takes a shower. It's an older hotel but has been renovated. Not too impressed with the area its in for it took around 15 minutes to go to eat or to a Walmart/Target. Our A/C didn't ever get real cool even when we set it at the lowest it would go, and I seldom get hot, if ever, but fortunately the highs each day that we were there only got in the 60s so it was ok but would have preferred it to be a little cooler when getting ready and sleeping. If you will be traveling when the weather is in the 80s, I would recommend you bring a fan. Overall our stay was pleasant and would stay there again if I planned on staying in Denver. The mountains are off in the distance, so if you want to have more scenic views, I would recommend you stay in another Quality Inn, simply because their beds are very comfortable at every one i have stayed at and that is one of the most important things I look for when staying in a hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Shuttle is great,We booked for the shuttle to take us to coors field. We drove 10 hours and arrived at 4:45pm only to find that the 5:00 shuttle was booked and we had to wait till 6:00 which was only 10 minutes before the game started. If we had known in advance we needed to book the shuttle we would have but we weren't told that on the phone. Pick up was great though! We stayed on the ninth floor and were given a room by the elevator so it was loud with people outside the door. The beds were great but the cleanliness and upkeep of the bathroom left a lot to be desired.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Event is a busy stay,Manager was very attentive to the breakfasts and friendly. She was a pleasure to talk to in the mornings and did a great job accommodating the amount of guests that were staying there. The building is need of repair.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,horrible customer service ,Upon check it we requested a mini fridge. We were staying 7 days and brought groceries that needed to be kept cold. We waited almost an hour for someone to bring it up after asking two different people. The first day of our stay one of the elevators broke and the girl at the front desk told us not to worry that someone was coming to fix it. Well nobody ever came and there was a horrible wait every time you wanted to use it the elevator. We requested blankets from housekeeping and they never brought them. The housekeepers didn't speak any English and would take our dirty towels and not replace them with clean ones. Breakfast was the worst breakfast I've ever had and the ONLY reason we returned to this hotel is because they had a great breakfast. The head waitress lied to us and told us the last day of our stay she would bring the cupcakes they used to serve but instead she avoided us the next day. We opted to go to IHOP and pay for breakfast because their breakfast was so bad. They didn't even have bacon!! The laundry room had a laundry detergent dispenser that was out of order so you couldn't even wash clothes. Staff is a bunch of lying smooshers and they provided the worst customer service I've ever experienced.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,....our dogs loved it too!!,Great location in downtown Denver. Convinient little coffee shop with sandwiches ect on bottom floor. Lobby bar is nice too. Staff was friendly and helpful. My pets were super spoiled!! Lush beds were delivered as well as bowls and waste bags in a cute holder. My dogs spent the day lounging in the window overlooking the street. Pet fee is pricey but comparable to other nearby hotels.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Mediocre Stay,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times, and it seems like the service has gone down and the price has gone up. Upon check-in, the front desk clerk stood and stared at the computer screen for five minutes, never once communicating with us. Finally, we get our cards back and she briefly tells us about the shuttle and breakfast. Once we get our keys and go to our room and realize there are no ""real"" pillows on the bed. All you get are small, lumpy couch pillows which are very uncomfortable. Plan on traveling with your own pillows unless you don't mind waking up with a stiff neck. We took the shuttle to Coors Field for the Rockies game, and when I called towards the end of the game for pick up, I was told we would have to wait until the 10pm shuttle left the hotel, because they couldn't send the van for just 2 people. (I called at 9:15pm) We start walking out of the stadium and as we are approaching the pick up site, I see the shuttle sitting there picking up passengers. Why couldn't the desk clerk tell me the 9pm shuttle has left the hotel, and we might be able to catch that one? The customer service overall on this trip was intolerable and very disappointing. The next morning, there was no hot water for a shower. Also, our room was right on the freeway and it was very noisy and hard to sleep. The only redeeming quality for this hotel, is the morning breakfast. As always the food was hot and delicious and plenty of it. I'm sorry to see the quality in this hotel has decreased as it used to be a nice place to stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very pleased with our stay here...would do it again!,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights last week.  It was a pleasure trip to Denver to see a few hockey games and explore Denver for the first time.  We went there all the way from Ontario Canada.  It was a vacation package booked through Southwest that we got for an extremely great deal with this hotel as our choice!!!!!!!   Anyways, it was great!   The free breakfast was tasty and lots of options....hot foods, cold foods like cereal and pastries...and plenty of hot delicious coffee every morning. Another bonus that probably saved us about $500 was the free shuttle service they offer.  We made our way to most of the stops that they go to, and nothing is close to anything in Denver we came to realize...but the shuttle takes you to all of the great places to see for free. (the zoo, the Pepsi Centre, the Downtown Aquarium, the Museum, 16th Street pedestrian mall).....  To take a cab to each of these places with a return trip would have totalled at least $400 to $500 guaranteed!  That is an amazing service they offer!  Betty at the front desk and restaurant was AMAZING!  She was so helpful and nice...we really can't complain about anything really.  Yes, not gonna lie...the hotel can use a little facelift in some of the rooms, but frankly, if that's your concern, choose a luxury hotel if that is your major concern.  Comfy beds, lots of pillows, no bugs...and we had hot water (other people seem to say they didn't in their reviews...ours was fine)  ... Be prepared that a taxi ride from the airport to the hotel is approximately $65 but that wouldn't really matter where you are staying...its out of the way (the airport) .  BUT, keep in mind, when you return to the airport, you can ask the front desk for a ride in their private limo.....it was an Expedition I believe...and a super nice guy (didn't catch his name) but he sure was friendly and loves his kids :)  So, thank you Denver and the Quality Inn Staff for giving us a great experience and we have no complaints!  You also gave us super warm weather which made the trip even more enjoyable!  Thanks!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great hotel for the price!,"My boyfriend, my parents and I were going to a Fleetwood Mac concert and chose to stay at Quality inn. The reason I chose Quality Inn over other hotels in the area was:The fact that the price was at $84 even though all the other hotels were skyrocketing prices because of the concert. They only charged $15 per pet and they offered many pet friendly roomsThe complimentary shuttle would take us to the Pepsi Center and back for the concert. As far as amenities- the pool is outdoor which is a bummer during the cold months. The rooms are quite spacious and I was quite impressed. The King bed was pretty comfy and the room temperature was easy to control. The restaurant was mediocre- we didn't get service for 20 minutes and my Reuben was extremely greasy. However, the complimentary BREAKFAST IS THE BOMB. They had eggs, ham, biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, waffles, cereal, much more then most places have for complimentary breakfast. Overall I would recommend Quality Inn. The only let down is the restaurant (Palm Grill) and that the location is about 15 mins from downtown.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,You get what you pay for,"Cold shave and cold shower.  This hotel seems dated and not in the best location; however it is conveniently located near the Salvation Army store.  I had business downtown but not sure if many other guests had downtown on their agendas.  Good two star value.  Room was clean, but did not get warm water in the sink or shower until the stop watch went past ten minutes. Took Lyft (transportation like uber) from downtown for $6.  Courtesy shuttles available.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great customer service!,"We were extremely happy with our stay.  The shuttle service was great and allowed us to explore 16th street mall, and later attend a concert at the Pepsi Center without having to worry about driving.  They were prompt and saved us a ton in cab fares.  Also, the breakfast was good...typical fare that hotel breakfasts usually have.  We will return there on future trips to Denver!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Close to sports venues,"Pros - Julie in restaurant, very nice & helpful. Complementary shuttle to/from Pepsi center was great, John very patient with phone calls for directions to new pickup point. Breakfast, plenty of it, hot and tasty.Cons- no hot water the following morning, vending machine and change machine didn't work. Restaurant/lounge closed at 10 pm on Friday night :(Redemption - there was a miscommunication regarding our arrival date, Nicole and John worked with us to ensure we had a room and were taken care of.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,We always stay here!,"We stay at this hotel 4 or 5 times a year when in Denver. The staff is always very friendly and while the hotel is a bit older, it's always very clean. The shuttle driver is a hoot! Very friendly and full of information about what to do and where to go downtown. See you again in a couple of months!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don't waste time in your room,"I loved this hotel. It was everything I needed it to be. A bed, breakfast, and shower stop. This hotel was the perfect launch pad into the city of Denver for many late nights and also great for hopping on the highway to go to the beautiful scenery. The hotel was a little difficult for Lyft and Uber drivers to find, but their rates make it entirely possible to not rent a car and still be able to get around in the city. I highly recommend this hotel for people like me, who view the hotel as a bed and shower hub. I do not know if I could recommend this hotel to someone who was going to spend their entire vacation on property.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,True definition of hospitality,"I had an emergency and came from the Ramada hotel where the manager refused to give me the shuttle. Luckily I'm a Choice privileges member and John at quality inn central said we would be glad to assist you even though I wasn't a guest. Now that is what I call TRUE DEFINITION OF HOSPITALITY. 10 STARS for this hotel, you can tell they go above and beyond for their guests regardless if your a choice member. Job well done",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,15 Minutes from the Denver Convention Center,This hotel is in a good location right off the interstate and 15 minutes away from downtown and the Denver Convention Center.  The breakfast they offer is nice and the eating area is clean and well kept!  Rooms are clean!  The traffic noise and the passing train train are loud during the day but I found it ok during the sleeping hours.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,I'd stay there again,"I found this place to be a good stay, once I found it. It is not he easiest place to get to. It may be right off the interstate, but you have take a circuitous route to get there. Once arriving, the front desk staff are some of the most friendly, and helpful I've dealt with. Check-in was fast and painless. The room was clean and spacious. My only complaint was about the TV, having no local programming guide. You had to flick through the channels to see what was on. The restaurant only serves breakfast and dinner. You are on your own for lunch, and there is not much available in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. There is a Village Inn next door, but it closes at 3:00pm. Breakfast is another sort of down spot, as it is a buffet, but very limited in choices. If you are diabetic, you don't have much to choose from. It's only saving grace is it is free. Their dinner menu is ok, leaning more toward salads and large sandwiches, but with other choices too. (The chef's salad was awesome). Another good thing is the free shuttle service. It leaves every hour and will take you almost anywhere in the Denver area, eliminating the need to drive. This was good as I found Denver a rather confusing place to drive around.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,nice hotel,"this is a nice hotel , it looks like its outside denver, but is only 5 minutes from downtown by car, there is nothing close to go walk, but they provide you with a free shuttle, you need to make the appointment, but they take to downtown and some other closest place, even one place close to walmart.the rooms were fine as well.i will come back for sure",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Place to Stay!,"A great place to stay right off of the Interstate.  The rooms were spacious and clean, the breakfast was well stocked and it provided great options.The noise from the interstate traffic was and the from the passing train from the nearby railway was a little louder than I would prefer, however, the pros definitely outweighed the cons.The staff was very courteous and all in all I would stay here again without any hesitation.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wonderful people wonderful place,I love this place. Breakfast needs changed up a bit but otherwise everything else is perfect.  Staff is friendly and helpful. Most of management is wonderful. They help me with everything. I love this place. I wish I could describe in words how truly amazing front desk staff is. I recommend this place to everyone. Thank you for making my stay most memorable.  I truly thank each and everyone of these hard workers for being there for me.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Home away from home,"We were at the hotel for over a week, and had a great experience. Very comfortable room with microwave and fridge.  Good breakfast with more than the usual fare.  Bar and restaurant had excellent staff and service.  Our only complaint was a train that sounded off, during the night, early in our stay.  Thought it may be coming through the room!  Thankfully, that was the only time that we heard it.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Rescue Operation,"We are foster parents for Midwest Boston Terrier Rescue. When our last adoption didn't work out, we needed to meet the adopter in Denver to take Adele (5 year old Boston Terrier) back to Montana where we are now staying. We chose the location as roughly half way between Albuquerque and Ekalaka, MT and also on the basis that the hotel was pet friendly. We're grateful for the location and the welcome extended on our little rescue mission. Adele gives 4 paws up, also. As an aside, we  enjoyed visiting with Betty, the guest relations officer very much. She's an outstanding ambassador for the hotel and the Quality Inn company.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Loved it!,"The staff of the hotel is really helpful and lovely. The breakfast is included and it has everything from fruits, eggs and muffins. The hotel shuttle is nice 'cause they take you anywhere you want and it's free. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that's visiting Denver and I will stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Follow up to my December 2014 review,"As stated in my 10000_feet_up review last month, this was my first negative review of any kind. As LizVi noted in her review, I am a not a diva. --- Synopsis: I was put up in this Quality Inn Central Denver near the Mousetrap by employer while I attended training in Commerce City. They paid for the room, I did not. I left and used my own funds to stay in a hotel near the old Stapleton so I could get at least one decent nights sleep. ---- Funny thing, after posting my first review about this particular Tripadvisor acclaimed Quality Inn, Quality Inn Corporate, to use the words of my employer's upper management, ""set our phones on fire"", demanding that they talk to me and have me remove my negative review. --- You see in fairness and transparency, I listed for the world to see that…",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,For the Budget OK,"It's not the nicest of hotel's décor wise, but it has large comfy rooms, with a good sized bathroom.The traffic noise is not a problem ,it's not in the best part of town but we experienced no trouble at all..The Restaurant/Bar serves good food and all the staff at the hotel were helpful and deserve plaudits as some of the guest's behaviour they have to deal with was amazing...  So It's at the lower end of the scale but a nice place to stay if that's what you need in Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NEVER AGAIN,"I have never written a bad review, Ever! When I read the review before mine (dated in December 2014), I thought; this person is a 'diva', it can't be all that bad, well... I was wrong! When you first walk in, it reminded us of a run down Las Vegas hotel. Then in the rooms, they tried to update it but that can't make up for the paper thin walls. If you stay one night, it might be fine but more than that and your body will have to adjust to the lack of sleep you get. Our first night our room and the entire non smoking floor smelled like cigarettes thanks to the rodeo guys staying on our floor. The second night was like being in the audience for Jerry Springer. We called security but it still scared the crap out of my kids. The third night we were awoken by a screaming baby next…",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,My first negative review ever.,"Ugh. I feel kind of bad to write this. This ""Quality Inn"" in Denver just north and east of the I-25 and I-70 (Mousetrap) interchange was an amazing disappointment. The best (or worst) part is that I am not even paying for this room; an employer is. I have been lucky enough to do some worldwide travelling, but I am certainly not a snob, I have stayed in the equivalent of Motel 6 or Super 8's around the world. Generally, they are a great sleep bargain wherever they are.  Not this Quality Inn in an industrial, heavily travelled section of Denver. The corporation has tried to get give it an appealing cosmetic uplift, which mostly works. When you come into the lobby, and after you catch your breath from the wierd and overpowering attempt they mader to cover up from years, and decades…",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great hotel terrible shuttle service,"I stay at this hotel at least 3 times a week. Called for a pick up and it took over an hour to get service. Shuttle finally showed up, waited for a few seconds and the drove off leaving me. I was told they'd be back in an hour. Ridiculous. I missed breakfast and had to take a cab. Get it together!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good and gooderer,"Really friendly,  helpful check in.  Room was good, nice view over Denver.  We were on 5th floor and no smokey smells anywhere. Room comfortable and spacious.  Great having free shuttle.  The hotel is in a funny location but close to downtown and the shuttle good, will take you to many predetermined locations and pickup from the same. Breakfast varied and good.  Restaurant and bar on site but we didnt try.  Would recommend staying here as its really good value for money.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very nice stay!,"Traveled there earlier this week for the Pearl Jam concert. The property is a little out of the way, but worth the extra time getting there. The lobby is so cute! There is an attached restaurant, bar, arcade room, fitness room, ball room, etc. Very family friendly. Front desk staff was a little flustered, but I understand as it was the changing of shifts and we arrived rather late. Was well taken care of regardless of that. Room was large, though it probably could have been cleaned a little better. Little burn mark on the blanket, a stain here and there on the carpet. I understand that a hotel with 213 rooms is a little hard to keep up, beings as I also work at a large hotel myself. It was decorated nicely. Easy access to all parts of the hotel. If you had any problems or questions, the front desk was more than willing to accommodate. I would stay here again, no questions asked.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Older, but Ok - Beware of Smoke","This hotel is located in a weird industrial area with really nothing close. It's a couple of odd U-turns to get there. It is, however, an affordable hotel close to downtown Denver. It's about a 10 minute drive to the city center. The lobby is a throwback to the 70s and I'll bet this was quite a place back then. It's pretty dated and retro, but kept up, mostly.  Check in seemed to take forever, but we got to our room eventually. The top floor of the hotel is the smoking floor - that might be the 9th floor?  We were on the floor below it, and the smell was unbearable. It smelled every bit like a smoking room and was uncomfortable and irritated my wife's asthma to the point where we had to get a new room on a lower floor. It's a real shame, because Denver is such a beautiful city, and the high rooms offer beautiful views of the skyline and the mountains.  The room on the 5th floor was about the same, without the horrible smell.  Spacious, clean, a little worn-out, but comfortable.  Other than that, the pool was locked, probably because it was a little cold, and the workout room was small but had what I needed for a quick run on the treadmill.  I doubt I'd stay here again, but I wouldn't rule it out. In this day, it seems like hotels should just be smoke free.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Old is fine, neglected is not","Staff at the front desk were not very friendly. The telephone was more important then the guests, every time I approached the front desk. The interior of the room (810) was old. Nothing wrong with that only the interior was neglected as was the entire hotel. The non smoking room smelled like it was being smoked in. According to the front office this smell comes through the ventilation system from the 9th floor which is the smoking floor. All they offered was that housekeeping could spray the room against the smell. Bad thing that they are aware of smelly rooms and not able to resolve the issue. Breakfast is just okay. Best point is the free shuttle bus to downtown which is very needed due to the remote location of the hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice place ,"I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend with some of my girl friends . There is absolutely nothing wrong with this place.  It was clean and the staff was very nice . The beds were comfortable and the water pressure and temperature in the shower was great ! The shuttle is also pretty awesome , it would drop you off and pick you up different places in the city . It's in a great location and easy to get anywhere.  The free breakfast buffet was also convenient and tasty . I would recommend this hotel to anyone !",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"""I would stay again.""","Well it is not in central Denver as the name implies. It's about 8 minutes from the 16th Street pedestrian mall which is in central Denver. The hotel is located in a commerce/ light industrial part of town with easy access to both 40 and route 70. I stayed one night for a total cost of $77.12 as this was the end of a long road trip. Parking is free and there is a lot off it I booked the room four months before my arrival but check-in was easy, friendly and efficient. Having arrived early I was concerned about check-in but they held my bags while I took the free shuttle to downtown Denver. I was dropped off at the 16th street mall and picked up about 6 hours later. You have to call to be picked and be at the location you were dropped off. It took about 30 minutes to get picked up which I thought was reasonable.  I had lunch at the Village Inn which was next door. It closes at 3 pm but the Palm restaurant which is located in the Quality Inn opens at 5 pm. They also have a lounge/bar area. My room was clean, non-smoking with no hint of smoke. The flat screen TV got a lot of channels and good receptions. I used the free WiFi, printed my boarding pass on the lobby computer using their free internet service. The printed pages had to be picked up at the printer located at the front desk. That was no big deal. I used the wake up service and went down to breakfast. The continental breakfast looked diverse enough. I like eggs, oatmeal and coffee for breakfast and they were all good. They did have other choices like waffles, muffins, biscuits and gravy juice and fruit. For Denver I would consider this a value/ discount motel which could use some repair work and upgrades but it was what I was looking for and I'd stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Average hotel, certainly needs upgraded facilities","I'm torn on how to rate the Quality Inn Central in Denver.  Let's do a breakdown of the recent 2 night stay I had:Pros:+ Staff were all excellent, and friendly.  No complaints whatsoever about my interactions with them.+ Rooms were quiet, and even though I faced the highway, I could not hear that noise with the windows closed.+ Ample free parking for your vehicle.+ Easy access to the highways.+ Affordable room rates.Cons:- The age of the rooms made you feel uncomfortable about just how clean everything was.  It was one of those places that if you looked too closely, you probably would feel grossed out.  In particular, the carpet wasn't that lovely.- The location of the hotel was poor.  It's about 6-8 minutes north of downtown Denver (where you want to be), and there really isn't much nearby that is appealing.  It's an industrial part of the area.- The A/C system looks like it was built in 1953.  And if you turn it on max, it sounds like that as well.If the hotel could just get a much needed upgrade, it would easily justify a 4+ or even a 5 star rating.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Fantastic hotel,"The entire hotel was clean, updated, and comfortable. Free shuttles to downtown every hour and free breakfast, parking, and wifi. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Didn't expect this much from such an affordable hotel. Glad we picked this one.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Perfect if you're going to the Denver gem show,"We stayed here because one of the gem & mineral shows was being hosted at this hotel.  The location is perfect if you're here to buy or sell rocks. You can walk across the street to the Ramada show or drive a short distance to the Coliseum (probably wouldn't have rented a car if I knew they had a shuttle). The hotel is not in a great part of town, but it certainly met our needs.  The rooms were comfortable, but if you are a light sleeper, be sure to ask for a room on the side away from the freeway. The free breakfast was adequate - same as any other chain hotel. If you're not into hotel food, there's a very good restaurant, the Village Inn, next door.  The hotel earned the 4th star in this review because the staff was so exceptionally friendly and helpful. The front desk was extremely helpful in accommodating us when we needed to extend our stay a few extra days although the hotel was fully booked.  The restaurant manager actually walked around at breakfast to see how everyone was doing - a first in all my travels. The restaurant/bar staff went out of their way to meet our special requests.  Overall, it's not the Ritz, but it made our business trip convenient and pleasant.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Inexpensive, Noisy Location, Outdated/Needs Renovation","I haven't paid this little for a hotel room in many a year.  My 'antenna' were up because of the price and the age/appearance  of the property online. When I arrived, I saw first-hand that the property is showing its age and lack of investment.  I was given a room that overlooked a huge parking lot with large trucks and very loud traffic noise from the freeway.  I changed rooms right away and got a slightly less noisy one with an equally awful view. Compliments for: friendly staff, clean comfortable beds, free wifi, free shuttle, free breakfast buffet and having a restaurant/bar on site.Not so much for: traffic noise, peeling wallpaper in the room, outdated/grungy bathrooms, not one comfy chair in the room, no safe in the room to store my valuables, had to carry my computer with me every day.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great value Great location to all attractions,"Exceptionally nice staff, great breakfast buffet, Great central location to all freeways. Will recommend to all wanting a great value without breaking the bank. Accommodations were much better than I had expected for the nightly rates.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Does The Job!,"We stayed here for 4 days.  The rooms need updating, but everything else was great! The shuttle they provide is very convenient and the staff is friendly & helpful.  A very reasonable rate to receive a free breakfast, free wi-fi and free shuttle to the city's attractions.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good price, not so great location","I should have checked, but when a hotel says they're in central Denver, I just assume they're in central Denver. I made a wrong turn out of the hotel, went down three blocks, stopped someone to get directions, and they told me it would be best to get out of that neighborhood asap, as it wasn't a good one.There were loud groups in the parking lot (one group had a white van they parked next to me in the compact cars section, and left door marks on my rented car), and the morning I left, some men were drinking beer outside the front door at 7 am.The room was clean, the room's facilities worked well, the bed was comfortable. The computer downstairs was partially non-functional so I couldn't get a boarding pass. The woman at the desk twice seemed to have zero idea of the area or even what mailing a package entailed. Was she newly arrived from Siberia? She was also condescending.The hotel's restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. (The kid who served me was friendly, though he didn't seem to know exactly what they had. They comped my dessert for some reason. ??) The food is uninspired, but there's really no other place to eat except at the breakfast restaurant next door, which seemed to be very crowded as there were lots and lots of cars parked along the frontage road in the morning. Those could have been hotel overflow, though.People seemed to be enjoying the swimming pool. There is a van that circulates among various hotels to take guests to malls or something. The front desk people were vague about what to expect about that.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Convenient, affordable, nice enough.","Not in a great neighborhood, but plenty convenient to interstate and major roadways.  We stayed one night at the start of our two week trip, and this hotel was perfect.  The price is right and the room was great (clean and well appointed).  The downside is the restaurant/bar:  It's really outdated, with dirty windows and stained carpet.  Food was okay, with breakfast being the best deal.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice for One Night,"Friendly staff, nice clean room.  Great breakfast selection.  It was a bit noisy, and the view from our window was horrendous. . . looked like a garbage dump.  Yikes!!!   I wish they had room service.   Oh, the only issue about the room. . . the shower water temperature did NOT stay consistent.  It kept cooling down/heating up.  Not fun!!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Maybe 3 1/2 Stars,"We were here for two nights. Even though it is adjacent to a freeway, the room was very quiet. Comfortable, in a more industrial area, but good location. Friendly staff. Nice breakfast buffet included.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pleasant Stay,"Close to the downtown, makes it convenient to spend time in the city.Room was fairly big with decent furnishings.The breakfast menu is fairly extensive too with Mexican dishes included.We were there on a busy weekend & reached the hotel at night. Parking seems a regular trouble there & guests end up parking either in the neighbour's lot or by the roadside.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place w brekky,Had a 1 night stay here & the place was great. Would go back just for the breakfast. Was very good and especially compared to what most other places think they can serve. The place is older but i mean for what you are paying who can complain plus we had a view of Denver which was nice.I would stay here again.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nothing fancy.,"You get what you pay for.  The room served its purpose, but it was nothing fancy.  I don’t think the hotel and the rooms have been updated for a long time.  Our friend’s room seemed nicer than ours – the furniture at least matched and the bathroom had lighter tile in better shape.   The towels are thin, the blanket was thin, and we had trouble getting the room temperature right – it was either freezing or too warm.  There was no vent in the bathroom, and mold in the bathtub caulking.  Breakfast was okay – scrambled eggs, tortillas, biscuits & gravy, mini muffins, breads.  They alternated ham or sausage from day to day.  The orange juice looked watered down.  Don’t get there 5 minutes before closing, they start putting everything away a little early.  The bar and restaurant seemed a bit run down – unfinished paint, old fixtures and furniture.  Behind the bar, on the ceiling, there was a ceiling access door that hung down open the entire time we were there (4 days),¬ which made me think about the dust and asbestos I was probably breathing in.  Location wise from downtown?  Pretty far out of the way all by itself with absolutely nothing close by.  They had a free shuttle, but it seemed complicated to use, so we just drove our car to get downtown.  The one good thing about this Quality Inn that stood out was the staff, and especially the manager, were super friendly.  If elevator bells or freeway noise bother you, ask for a room away from them.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,we stayed at the Quality Inn Central 08/30/14-09/03/14,"The room was clean and the bed comfortable and that is where the positives end.  The toilet did not work properly, we reported the problem the morning of 08/31/14 and we were gone all day expecting the problem to be fixed when we got back that evening and it was not.  The food was mediocre at best, the bar and restaurant were combined and bar music was too loud, wait staff service very slow.  On the shuttle service, we were told to call the hotel when ready to be picked up from location and it was over an hour before we were picked up.  We would not recommend this hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,less than average,"When looking on websites to book this hotel, it is classified as located ""downtown"". This led us to believe we could barhop at the downtown bars and not have to worry about driving/parking. This hotel is NOT located downtown. The shuttle WAS useful--it took us to Coors Field and picked us up downtown, but obviously couldn't be used 24/7. The drivers were all VERY pleasant. The place itself and the rooms are below average. Could use renovating for sure. The bar area is ESPECIALLY run down-to the point that we didn't want to sit on the chairs. The first night we arrived, we had a drink in the bar--and it was FULL and they kicked everyone out at 11pm (on a Saturday). WOW! They sure missed out on a lot of revenue that night. The pillows on the bed are unlike any we've seen. Tiny little squares. Took a few nights to get used to that.The breakfast was good--can't expect gourmet eats for ""free"". But the staff took care to keep the food filled and at the right temperatures, which I appreciate. It was difficult to find a parking spot on the nights that there were full banquet halls--weddings I assume. But, again, being that the parking is free, we dealt with it. I wouldn't stay here again, but it was okay.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good for school group.,"The manager (Raja) was very accommodating. The hotel pool was great for our group and the breakfast area, although somewhat smallish for our group, worked out fine. I will second what some other reviewers have noted. A few of the rooms had a smell as if they were smoking rooms at one point or another.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Awesome location,"The location was perfect for our stay as the hotel shuttled us to Coors Field, downtown and Sports Authority Field.  Couldn't of asked for better.The hotel was nice and breakfast was good.The hotel was very easy to find and was close to the interstate.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Enjoyable,"Got to the hotel and were allowed to check in early, the lady at check-in was very nice and helpful about all of our questions.  The rooms were clean, but did have a slight odor (I believe it may have been smoking room at one time).  I didn't like that the rooms did not have refrigerator/or microwave (had to 'rent' those per day).  The restaurant in the lobby was clean and decent food and the breakfasts were very good and filling.  Would have liked for the hotel to be closer to restaurants/shopping, but they did have shuttle buses that ran every hour on hour, from 9am-10pm.  Overall our 3 day stay was satisfying and the staff were all friendly and helpful.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Grows on you,"Initially we were worried when we turned up to this hotel: it's in a very industrial area and there is nothing around. In fact, you probably wouldn't want to walk around nearby at all. However, it redeemed itself. The room was spacious and despite overlooking the front entrance and freeway, we heard hardly any traffic. The bathroom has been redone and the shower is excellent. Breakfast was better than I expected, with more choice than the usual artificial waffles (though they're there too). The shuttle to town was handy although we had a half hour wait to be collected from the station. The major downside was that our key cards seemed to need reprogramming on a regular basis. Not a huge deal but certainly annoying. I wouldn't pay mega bucks to stay here but I've seen worse.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,4miles to everything,"Must say the staff was very nice, we got to hotel early and was allowed to check-in. The room was a smoking room which is very hard to find in Denver. A Plus is the fact that they have a shuttle bus that takes you around Denver, last pick-up is 10pm. Kendall and Mike great guys,very helpful and easy to talk too. However shuttle bus should be a little later on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.The Palm Grill was oh k. However the the hotel is is located in an industrial area. I must say that the area didn't bother me at all, it's close to I25 and I70 which is great. Good price and nice staff.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Okay hotel,"Stayed here for a week in August 2014. Ok place nothing much to it. Good clientele so safe. In an industrial area so nothing much to do. They'll pick you up and drop you off to locations downtown which is nice so you save on parking fees. Rooms are a little dated. Furniture could do with a replacement. Good breakfast spread but the service at dinner could be better. Overall, a very ordinary place",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,DO NOT DO IT,"I consider myself to be happy with the very basic necessities but this hotel was such a dump. It was in a dumpy location, room that was no smoking reeked so bad of smoked my eyes watered and clothes smelled. It was awkward to get to and hard to get to nearby attractions. I almost puked at the breakfast, and like I said,, I am fine with basic necessities, but this was AWFUL!!  By far my biggest mistake on my CO trip. Do not go to this place.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not what we expected!,"I'm not one to give a bad review but decided I had to this time.  We chose this hotel for the location and the positive reviews it was given on tripadvisor and hotels.com.  First of all, it is not easy to get to.  We checked in just as the restaurant was closing and there is nothing to eat close by.  The lady at the front desk was not helpful and gave us the wrong keys to the wrong room which was a little awkward.  Our room was on the 8th floor and reaked of smoke although it was a ""non-smoking"" room, it was grungy and there was mold in the shower.  We were to stay two nights and for the first time ever we checked out early and found a different hotel.  I think that some of the rooms have been updated and I know that they have a great shuttle service to downtown but our experience was not favorable.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,If you paid around $60/night its fine,We booked this thru a discount site. Paid $66 a night. If I had paid a penny more would have been disappointed. The location is NOT near downtown denver as the site indicated. They do have a shuttle to bring you there and back though. Front desk people are friendly. Its just on a very noisy road thus hard to sleep. Air con barely worked. Hotel is old. Pillows were so unbelievebly bad. They have to be years and years old. Barely anything left to their lumpy existence. No water pressure.,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Traffic and trains,Found it a bit hard to get there coming from airport.bloke at check in was helpful.when stepped out of lift hallway had a stale smell room was ok.had dinner at there restaurant  steak sliders were dry as.morning breakfast not much better.noise from freeway constant then late at night trains tooting not to good if you are a light sleeper.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Easy access to several venues,"We stayed here for 6 nights for our first vacation in 27 years!  This Quality Inn has a shuttle that we took to a Rockies game.  Saved us $ and frustration of finding parking.  The shuttle also goes to the Zoo, Botanical Gardens, etc.We asked for a room that faced the city and they were able to accommodate us.  The hotel was very busy with lots of people but it was not noisy.  Our room was clean and perfect size (king).  The refrigerator and microwave were perfect for our long stay.Got to know the night time front desk people.  Even gave one a birthday gift! Everyone treated us so well.Breakfast buffet was slightly different every morning and a good size.  Our first breakfast, I asked Betty, Guest Relations Officer, for iced tea and she remembered each morning even though they served a lot of people.We felt safe in the hotel neighborhood.  There's a train track and we never heard a train until our last night and that was because I was still awake and we had our window open AND it was only the engine :o)2 minutes to I-70WE WILL DEFINITELY RETURN WHEN WE CAN.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,In an industrial area but safe,We stayed for 1 night at the start of our vacation and returned for 2 nights at the end of our vacation before we flew home.  Room was clean and fresh.  Our first room faced away from the car park and our second room faced the pool and the interstate.  Second room was noisy and suffered from road noise.  I woke at 4am and couldn't get back to sleep.  I'm not a light sleeper at all so was surprised.  Breakfast was ok but nothing special.  Front desk staff were very pleasant and professional at all times.  Next time I would stay further from downtown in a quieter location - just my opinion.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Central, but not Downtown","Located in the northwest corner where I-25 intersects I-70, this older hotel is generally well-maintained.  The neighborhood is light industrial and residential.  Aside from the bar serving a limited menu, and a similar restaurant at a hotel within walking distance, there are no services, entertainment, or shopping opportunities near the hotel.HOWEVER, the hotel offers free van service within a 5-mile radius, and because we were catching a train from newly restored Union Station downtown, it suited our needs very well.The staff were friendly and helpful.  The room and bed were comfortable.  Some mold is starting in the shower grout and needs attention pronto.  The bathroom lacks an exhaust fan.  There was some litter on the lawns and parking areas.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"""Nice stay while going to a Bronco game""","This was a nice place to stay, a little older hotel, but can tell they work hard to keep it up. Great shuttle service at no cost, it may take a lil time but worth not having to put up with the traffic after a sporting event. Nice breakfast.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Free Shuttle,"The hotel was located in a industrial area we felt total safe our whole stay . The rooms are a little dated but the service really outweighs a little older hotel.The hotel offers a great free shuttle service to downtown Denver drops off and pickup .We rented a car while we were there but hardly put any miles on it ,just needed transpotation to and from the airport. The service behind front desk was excellent .They recommended restraunts and places of interest .We wanted to go to a movie and they called the threatre to check times and help us arrange for their shuttle service to be there to pick us up . I recommend this hotel mainly  because of the saving of the free shuttle and over friendly staff! They made our stay in Denver memorable !",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good breakfast,"The good points: the breakfast, the outdoor pool, front desk staff.  The bad points: The room smelled, 3 of 4 washers and dryers were broken, the bathrooms seemed grungy.  I probably wouldn't stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice stop while visiting the city.,The room was had was large and clean and had everything we needed. Yes it was a little old looking and could do with a refurbishment but for the price this was fine. The staff at the reception were very helpful. They run a free shuttle but into the centre which is a great service and collected us after the game. The breakfast is also very good.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,OLDER  hotel but convenient,"We stayed at this hotel to use Shuttle to Coors Field. Shuttle was great most of the time but late Saturday night, shuttle didn't show, we were stranged in Downtown very late at night, had to take a cab. Hotel non smoking rooms smell like smoke.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice stay,"This hotel was great.  Nice comfortable rooms, wonderful staff and service. Lobby was very clean and the breakfast was fantastic. (only thing wished they served bacon at breakfast).   I wasamazed that we could not hear the people in the room next to us.  Location is in a industrial area but was fine.  It was a nice central place to stay as we traveled all over the Denver area.  The only thing was the bathtub was not cleaned properly for me.(see picture)   Other than that I would recommend this hotel to everyone",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Surprisingly pleasant and great staff,"Clean comfortable rooms but what makes this a fine inn is the service and staff. Shelby at the front desk went out of her way to find no-smoking even though they had a full house. Next morning at comp breakfast we met Betty, who made use feel just like family. We were there for a week and service never flagged. Keep up the excellent work!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice Stay,"Nice hotel. Room was nice and clean. Location is good, not too far of a drive to downtown area. Breakfast had a nice variety. We ate eggs, sausage, muffins, danishes. Not bad for a free breakfast. Kids enjoyed the arcade for a bit on a rainy day. Would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,It's a good place to get a night's sleep!,"We had rented a house for our stay but it didn't quite match what was online...being it last minute on a Thursday night there was nothing reasonably priced so we bit the bullet & booked. We only stayed 1 night but it wasn't bad at all. The sheets were clean, the duvet double wrapped in white sheets, the bathroom at least from sight was clean sure could be have some cosmetic maintenance. I avoided getting too close to shower curtain, it could have been that its older not that it was dirty it was a bit yellow. Towels were basic & a bit rough, bath products aren't the best but at par with what I expected.  The bar downstairs is what made this a better experience, the people watching is simply top-notch!! I won't spoil it for you....after a few wines (they only serve beer/wine & ice cold jagermeister shots).I slept very well in my own bed as all they had left where double beds :) THE best part for me was the next morning, the area where breakfast is served has vintage teacups as decorations being a collector of them I was giddy throughout my meal. I went to breakfast in my pajama pants & sweatshirt many were the same, please make sure to leave a few bucks for the servers its a thankless thing to serve FREE breakfast. It was a pretty tasty mix match, waffle maker, bagels, fresh fruit, yogurts etcc...If we are ever stuck again I will certainly look at this brand of hotels again, staff is incredibly friendly all over this hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Place to Stay!,"My Family and I were in town for a huge convention! We really enjoyed our stay here. Beds were really comfy. The Breakfast, I figured it would be your typical Continental. The Deluxe Hot Breakfast was the BOMB! So much to choose from! Hot fresh eggs, Refried Beans, Pancakes, Waffles, Sausage, Gravy, Oatmeal, Tortillas and so much more! Totally Impressed! We had a Wonderful, Hot Breakfast every Morning! The hotel offered shuttle service to and from the Colorado Convention Center! It was cool! Save us lots of money in Cab Fair! Housekeeping was always keeping the hotel clean! The Staff was friendly and very helpful! Hotel Manager always making sure we had everything we needed and if we were comfortable in our stay. We asked for extra towels and pillows and they happily filled our request. I would totally stay at this hotel again if needed! It was so good I was looking for another Quality Inn in the next city I was going to stay! We also got a great price with our Travel Website! Thanks Quality Inn!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great service and excellent location,"Sitting just east of I-25 opposite Coors Field and downtown Denver, this is a great location to see Denver sights-especially with their free shuttle service!  Stayed two night (Fri-Sun) checking out Coors Field and LoDo (Lower Denver). Suzanne (desk) let us check-in early so we could sight-see and Betty (grill) checked to ensure breakfast was just right.  Friendly shuttle staff was very helpful.  All I can say is to work with the staff if you have issues-these folks where terrific. If you have a desk issue, ask for Suzanne-she's money!  This place is half the price of downtown Denver hotels and only minutes away but shuttle/car.  Plus there are some great NW Denver eateries (like Bang).This place can get really busy given its central location so book your trip. There were some big soccer-team (and Manchester United fan) groups but the desk seems to handle the flow.  Also wise to arrive a bit early or maybe a bit later-but desk had at least four folks on duty during rushes.  Fifth floor is non-smoking and had fairly new carpet throughout.  Very clean bathroom and firm king bed plus microwave and fridge. There is some road noise given intersection of two interstates but it's more like white noise. A/C was perfect (90s during our stay).Talk about breakfast-this place has fluffy, homemade biscuits plus homemade green chili (out-of-towners might not know what that is) - rich flavor and just a touch of heat-plus waffles, pastries, etc.  Eggs seemed fresh (not powder) and the thin-sliced ham was above average. Only thing missing was yogurt.  One of the best hotel breakfasts we've had. Didn't hit the bar nor pool but they're right downstairs.  Grill has supper too but did not try it. Free shuttle to 16th St Mall and Coors Field. One train came by (north side) in two days but it's a factory shuttle-not a through line.  Room walls/ceilings very soundproof.You can easily get to downtown via non-interstate routes-just check Mapquest, etc.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great for going to the game,"We showed up early on a day we were there to see a soccer game at Mile High and they were incredibly courteous. We checked in early, signed up for the shuttle van and then relaxed until it was time to go to the game. After the game we walked to dinner downtown and caught a shuttle back - they make it incredibly easy to get around. The room was great, no traffic noise at all even though you're a stone's throw away from I-25. Our room didn't have a fridge, but other than that everything was fine. The hotel's non-smoking but the wind kept blowing smoke from their smoking area when we were waiting outside. The free breakfast was decent but not exceptional. We live an hour and a half from Denver, so we're keeping this Quality in mind for the next time we come down for a game.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Our stay was terrible,I would not stay here ever again. I work at a Choice Hotel and I know how the system works. I called the day before and requested an early check in (Understanding how to manage an early check in). When we went to check in the lady at the front desk was just rude and did not want to help me at all and asked me to wait for a few minutes... we sat there for almost 40 minutes before I finally went back up to the front and asked a different lady who then helped me get checked in as I had to be across town in 30 minutes!!! Then when we finally got to our room (a non smoking room) it reaked of Smoke!!! We kept our stuff packed and went down to the front desk and asked them if we could move rooms when we came back because neither of us are smokers and we could not stand the smell. When we came back later that night a man was working and he would not let us move rooms so we had to put up with second hand smoke for 2 nights. we were also informed that the ninth floor is the smoking floor so do not stay on the 8th floor because smoke leaks through the vents and ceiling!!!! Request a low floor!!  All in all the breakfast was the best part and i hope everyone else has a better stay!,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,As stated!,"I would stay at this property again.  Large clean room, warm breakfast with very friendly staff working it, used the free shuttle service twice, and found the front desk staff friendly and helpful.  I would stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good stay,"when we arrived to check in, the gal at the front desk was very nice , bonus when we got to the room the room is nice and clean. Are three day stay was very nice and comfortable. I would stay there again if need be",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"A great stay, if you make it that way!","We chose this hotel because it was the least expensive and provided a free shuttle to and from Coors Field. I'm a firm believer that the way you treat someone is how they will treat you. Therefore, throughout the entire experience I remained polite and understanding of the hotel staff, who in turn were extremely friendly and helpful! Suzanne upgraded our room in honor of my fiancé's birthday and also requested that they put a couple beers and chips in our room! Alissa checked us in and was able to get us in early as the game was at 2 and also arranged the shuttle for us! Elizabeth and Hamid were also very kind and made us feel welcome! Rooms were clean and the in-room coffee was great! The only downfall to the stay were the guests who thought they owned the place because they rented a room and feel the need to nit-pick everything! (Get over yourselves)",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Bathroom flooded black scum,"Woke up to our bathroom flooding black, dirty water all over our floor. No refund given because we booked through a ""3rd party."" Also our sink was held up by stilts. Would have rather slept on a street corner. Called the shuttle, never picked us up. Had to pay $25 to the hotel from downtown.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A Good stay,I stayed here this past April. The front desk was very accommodating. The shuttle to downtown and back is what is going to bring me back and stay here again. That was a great service. The shuttle runs from 11am to 11pm if I remember correctly.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Convenient for travel,"This was a convenient place to stay in the north part of Denver. However, with that convenience comes noise and lots of people, some a bit questionable in appearance. Once in our room, though, it was quiet. There were no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms, which was a disappointment as we travel with a cooler so we always have cold drinks and food to make a picnic lunch. It is nice to be able to put those items in a refrigerator at night and refreeze our ice packs. The breakfast was good, better than many Quality Inns.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,You get what you pay for,"We booked this hotel with the understanding we were not getting a 5 star however there are a few fundamental issues that one would expect to receive even at a 2 star property.  We would not stay nor recommend this hotel. Trying to see some positives we do need to acknowledge the free shuttle service to downtown and area and the shuttle drivers, Heather and Julie, who were so friendly and always smiling.   What we didn't anticipate was having to smell pot in our room on more than one occasion. Vagrants hanging around outside in the parking lot which can be intimidating when you return to the hotel in the late evening. We also were very disappointed to return to the hotel after being out during the day touring the city finding our hotel room door ajar. When we called to notify the front desk no apology was made but rather a simple we'll have the housekeeping manager contact you....gee thanks!  As mentioned we wouldn't stay here again and while we thought we could save a few bucks by staying here, the lesson we have learned is , you get what you pay for and if you can afford to stay at higher rated places don't cheap out so your time away from home is more enjoyable.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Decent for the Price,"We stayed here recently while in Denver for 5 nights.  The price was good.  The bed was clean and comfortable, very comfortable as a matter of fact.  Lots of hot water when taking a shower.  I appreciated that as well.  The room was clean.  The bathroom was outdated.  That's my only complaint.  It looked like the tile around the shower was new but the sink, faucet, toilet, tile on the floor were OLD.  Otherwise, it was fine.  Yes, it's in an older, more industrial part of town but we were only sleeping there, so it didn't matter.  Actually we liked that it was close to downtown Denver and the freeway.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Bed Bugs!,"My non-smoking room reeked of cigarette smoke, as did the common areas and elevator. I was awakened late at night by a small pest I easily killed. I checked the pillows and bedding and bedding and saw no more but rest would not come. That morning I googled 'bed bugs' and was horrified by the results. Management was not surprised when I presented the tiny corpse for identification, yet insinuated I had brought it in myself. (I had stayed in the Choice hotel chain the previous night as well!) My room was a business expense so I was insulted by her insinuations that I was trying to get one over on them!She offered a 25% discount and told me the pests were not harmful!  However just one little hitchhiker can cause serious infestations that are nearly impossibly to irradicate without costly professional help. I was without a place to stay and now everything in my case has to be cleaned!  I lost an entire business day, keep dreaming about bugs & was insulted in the process. Also, the shower goes from very hot to very cold of its own will. Simply atrocious!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good value for your money...,"We stayed here for 2 nights while we were in Denver, We used the free shuttle to go to 16th street mall better than trying to find a parking space. The breakfast was fine, the rooms were nice, nothing too fancy but that is ok with me. It was close to the interstate but we couldn't hear the traffic in our room.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Ok,"Walking into the hotel, we were impressed and excited about our stay.  The lobby and elevators appear to have been recently remodeled.  We requested a smoking room.  It was kinda gross, but we stuck it out.  Smoking rooms are hard to come by in Denver.  The hotel has signs banning marijuana, but on our floor it was very obvious that marijuana was present.  Didn't bother me.  Overall ok, location kinda out of the way.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not so Quality,Located just off the freeway in a fairly run down bit of town. the rooms where nice enough and the staff helpful. decided not to eat here so can't comment on the food. Did go to the bar but went to my room with my beers as some of the locals at the bar didn't look to friendly shall we say.,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel personell very polite.,"People working here very nice, the bar needs ceiling repairs.  This is a good value for the money with free parking.  The location of this hotel is in an industrial park, not downtown, but the free shuttle makes this hotel very accomodating.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hit and Miss,"We had been informed that when we arrived in Downtown, Denver to contact them and they would send their shuttle to pick us up. We did this and told them where we were. 45 minutes later, we rang them again. They apologised, got in touch with their shuttle driver and then said he would be there to get us soon. 30 minutes later we rang them again. The girl said they didn't pick up where we were standing so we had to move to where they did pick up and that it could take 2 hours before the shuttle arrived. We therefore got a taxi which cost us $20. The girl who had spoke to us was quite rude and tried to deny it was her who had talked to us. We were very upset that this one member of staff could have spoiled our vacation, however the Indian manager Ragu came out. Apologised for the wrong information given to us and reinbursed us with the $20. He was so nice to us and we could not ask any more from him, it took the bad taste out of our mouths. Apart from that, the Quality Inn was as good as we expected it to be. We must say that the breakfast was very good and the hourly shuttle service to Downtown from then on was excellent.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not Quality Inn,"I the worst hotel stay ever at this location.  The problems started when I arrived and discovered that I was in a smoking room.  When I mentioned that we had booked a non-smoking room through Hotels.com the front desk staff said that they get it wrong all the time and there was no way I could get a non-smoking room.  If you know it doesn't work well, fix it.When I went up to the room, the floor reeked of smoke. The smoke stench in the room was strong enough to upset my stomach.  The room was one of the worst rooms I have ever seen. The window sheers were torn and there were cigarette burns in the black-out curtain. The vents were gross, ceiling tiles weren't in place, the bathroom light didn't have a proper fixture, the shower hardware wasn't in good shape and the hot water was inconsistent. I will include a few photos here... On top of the horrible state of the facility, the location gives new meaning to being ""on the wrong side of the tracks."" It's next to the freeway and the tracks, and you have to go through a shanty town to get there. I will never come back or recommend this hotel chain again.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not Handicapped Friendly,"We arrived to the hotel after a long drive from North Platte, NE. Our room wasn't ready yet, so we had to wait for about a half hour, before we could go up to our room. There were 2 gals cleaning also. We got there at about 2:30 pm, so the room should have been done. The Bell Boy took our luggage up to our room, walked in & the room was very big, with 2 queen beds(which worked out fine, because my husband was sick, so we slept in separate beds). The bathroom was huge, it was a handicapped room, with roll in shower. I had asked for a refrigerator, one was brought up right away. It was plugged in, then I opened the door to set the temperature, & it had a bad odor, like sour milk. My husband said use it anyway. The hotel was very clean & so was our room. We went down to check out the pool, & my husband couldn't take his scooter into the pool area, because there was a step. When I called & asked about the pool area, they told me it was handicapped accessible. When I told them he had a scooter, they said no problem. That was the first fib. That messed up our pool time, we couldn't even lay out in the sun, because it isn't handicapped accessible. We went to dinner in there restaurant/lounge, they had good food. The service was good. That was a plus.There free breakfast in the morning was pretty good too, lots of variety. We left for the day to go to The Denver Zoo, when we got back our room was cleaned with beds made & fresh towels, another plus. We went to check out the restaurant  next door, but it was closed up. There is nothing else around for miles. Didn't want to go hunting for a restaurant, because we were tired. We ended up ordering from the restaurant/lounge again, & bringing it to our room. The next morning we were packing to leave & my husband saw a bug crawling on the bathroom floor. He called me in the bathroom & told me to look at the bug. I picked it up with a piece of toilet paper & it was a tiny cockroach. I put it in the sink & called down to the front desk. The gal asked me if we wanted to change rooms? I told her that we checking out this morning. She sent the maintanence man up, he said that it was a cockroach, & that he needed to call to have them spray. I told him we were leaving soon. I was told over the phone that the Manager would take care of our fee for our room, hence fib #2. The janitor told the manager that it was a moth, fib #3. When I went to talk to the Manager Mr. Hamid, he told me that his hotel doesn't have cockroaches, so now he is calling me a liar. He told me that it was a moth, I told him that it wasn't a moth, that the bug had no wings, then he said well maybe it was a fly, I told him it wasn't a fly, because it had no wings. Mr. Hamid kept trying to tell me that the hotel didn't have cockroaches, he kept saying that over & over again, like we don't know the difference between a moth & a cockroach. Even the janitor Louis said it was a cockroach, until he lied to the manager. That wasn't the only problem that we had during our stay. The first night we were there, I took a shower in lukewarm water. I told the front desk the next morning, the janitor Louis said that it was just the boiler trying to warm up. I took a shower the next night & the same thing happened again. I had also told Mr. Hamid that too. The hotel took off $20.00 off our stay, which is what they charged us for 2 days rental for the refrigerator, so it wasn't really a discount. The hotel was nice, but I would not stay there again, or would not recommend it for a handicapped person. Watch out for the hidden charges, ie: the refrigerator/ microwave.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Little things,"Overall a good place to stay. However a number of little things made this a less than optimal hotel room. It appeared that some of the rooms were being updated but ours was obviously older. The wall paper was peeling. Bathroom door sticks. Toilet seat worn through. Room entry door lock was a bit ""catchy"". Housekeeping was marginal. We did not receive a full compliment of fresh towels each day. They even left a toilet paper holder empty. The biggest issue we had was with the room key. 3 of our 5 nights, the provided key cards did not work in our lock. This necessitated a trip back down to the lobby to get new keys cards. Unnecessary and inconvenient after a busy day. Apparently, ""Quality"" is a relative term.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The location lets it down,Nothing too far wrong with the hotel but it really is in the middle of nowhere...... They run a shuttle bus into town on the hour every hour until 10 pm.  It would be impossible to walk . There is nothing very much close...... They are parading a tripadvisor award for excellence and I can't imagine how the could have achieved that!  Central it ain't !,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Staying at Quality Inn,The front desk is really helpful and friendly. They have a shuttle bus service for every hour from 8am-10pm to downtown which was a bonus for me. The breakfast the provide is also ok if not the best. The rooms are pretty clean. The cleaners normally come around noon so I was ok as no one disturbed my sleep early in the morning !,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not a quality place to stay,The lobby was very nice.  Too bad it didn't extend to the room we stayed in.  The room was outdated and the air unit was extremely noisy.  Didn't like our room on the 9th floor.  Air unit was very noisy.  Were supposed to staytwo nights but checked out after just one night.  Staff was okay.  Breakfast was notvery good.  Would not stay here again.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Just right!,"This hotel was 'just right.'  The rooms are just the right size a hotel room should be. Very comfortable. The beds were just right.... the pillows.. not so much....glad I brought my own. The breakfast was just right for this type of hotel, maybe a little better. It had a southern flare though, with some additional breakfast items I've never seen before like tortillas and re fried beans. They were actually pretty good.Air conditioning controls are ancient but worked just fine.... rooms are oddly shaped but added to the uniqueness. I liked the two separate bathroom vanities and mirrors. The first night we had a desk chair with a broken wheel and they had me a new one in less than five minutes. Very impressed. Check in was nice and easy. Parking adequate. Entry into hotel very nice.Wished they had fridges and microwaves in the room but those cost an extra $10 EACH per night...  Nothing but 'crud' on the television. No stairs accessible from lobby or outside. There are stairs on each floor but they land you outside and you can't get back in the same door you went out. They are just emergency exit stairs. We often like to take stairs for additional exercise.Over all a nice stay! Will come back.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great breakfast!,"The free continental breakfast is very good, with real eggs, green chili & waffles. Super friendly service too. Betty Martinez was very welcoming. The location isn't bad, it's about 10 minutes from elitchs. The room was clean.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel ok! Restaurant TERRIBLE!!!,"This hotel fit the bill for our family. It has a large parking lot, a decent free breakfast, an outdoor heated pool, and it was pet friendly. The reason we decided to stay here is because it is less expensive than a hotel in downtown Denver with the same amenities. Plus they have a shuttle that will take you downtown. However, make sure that you sign up for it at the front desk ahead of time. It is a very popular service! The only reason I gave this hotel 3 stars is because of the restaurant on site and the lack of restaurants or stores nearby. I cannot stress enough on how horrible the onsite restaurant (Palm Grill) is! I have never got such bad service before. Only one server was working and she had no clue what she was doing. We were there forever waiting for our food and then our bill. And the food just plain sucks. I was sceptical going into the restaurant because other reviews had said it was bad. However we were forced into eating there. The Village Inn next door closes at 3:00!?!? And there is absolutely nothing else close by. No restaurant, no stores, NOTHING!! So if you cannot drive, I recommend ordering from Dominoes. They have menus at the front desk and they will deliver to your room. Way better than the trashy restaurant at the hotel!!",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Rough Start....great finish,"When I first checked in, I encountered a terribly unfriendly and rude manager who embarrassed me for wanting a refrigerator in my room, because I am a breast feeding mother.  He spoke loudly, shamed me, and even CHARGED me for the medically NEEDED fridge, I needed in order to pump and store my addition breast milk, while on family vacation-wedding weekend.  The morning after our arrival, I took my 6 month old son downstairs to get some coffee and juice from the breakfast buffet.  The women at the front desk the next morning were a completely different story!  The cooed over my infant, and were overly helpful, even asking how my night was and if there was anything they could do to make our next day go more smoothly.  I explained to them about the rude manager from the day before, and they were very apologetic on his behalf and assured me that they would do anything they could to make our stay better.  They changed my opinion of the hotel in an instant and I started noticing all the upgrades they had clearly made to the inside of the hotel to give it a ""cosmetic facelift"".  It was a very nice hotel, and for the $ and location, I thought it was great.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Best choice for an affordable hotel just outside of downtown Denver,"This is my 2nd stay in a few years and it continues to be the best choice for an affordable hotel outside of downtown with tons if amenities.  Free breakfast buffet, pool, free shuttle to pre determined locations, free wifi, noon check out and very affordable.  Staff is also very friendly and helpful.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent stay,"I look for hotels that are a reasonable price, good location for the area I want to visit, provides an actual breakfast and has good reviews and this hotel met all of those criterias.  The location was close to downtown.  To get to the hotel was a little interesting but nothing my navigation couldn't figure out.  The hotel was clean and we had a great view of downtown from the 7th floor.  We only heard the train one night at 2am it blew its whistle several times.  My son and i heard it but my husband slept thru it.  The breakfast was good.  You could make your own blueberry waffles and breakfast tacos.  They even had refried beans.  We went down to the sports bar downstairs and they normally close at 9pm but stayed open so they could finish watching the first game of the nba finals.  I was very happy with this hotel and would recommend it if you are looking for a hotel close to downtown but not paying downtown prices.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very Nice Hotel near Downtown Denver,"The hotel is very clean, and the staff are fantastic.  The hotel is just off of the freeway, perhaps 10 minutes from Coors Stadium, and about 15 minutes from the heart of downtown.  We had a rental car while visiting Denver, but two days we opted for the free shuttle transfer available hourly.  This hotel is a pet-friendly establishment, so one can expect a few barks on occasion, but nothing that would keep one up at night.  My spouse is diabetic, and they provided a complimentary refrigerator rather than the standard $10/day rental rate.  The pool was clean and warm.  They do not provide in-room safes, and I did not inquire if they had a safe in the reception area.  Do not expect great views, as you will most likely have a view of freeways, railroad facilities, etc....but it is less than half of what one pays for a similar room closer to downtown.  I didn't care for the dinner that I had in the hotel restaurant, but the bar area looked lively about the time I went to bed.  The complimentary breakfast is the same each day, and not too bad, but the eggs are obviously reconstituted powdered eggs, and the protein was always black forest ham slices.  I must say, however, that I had a friend staying downtown on the same dates, and they had to pay $4 for a cup of coffee and $4.00 for a cookie for their breakfast.  Everything at the Quality Inn is complimentary.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and actually am planning to make a return trip to Denver soon for pleasure and almost certainly will stay at this facility again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Great, budget stay","So this isn't the Four Seasons, but it was completely clean and comfortable. Nice mattress and pillows, quiet air conditioning and a good, hot shower. The motel buffet breakfast was good.  The free shuttle bus service is fantastic and the staff friendly. The neighbourhood is a little depressing being an industrial, interstate area but the car park was safe and we had no dramas.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Made our stay memorable!,"We stayed here for 3 days for the occasion of the first anniversary of our marriage. The hotel is pretty close to downtown Denver and they seem to have a free shuttle service too.We wish to thank the Hotel Manager Mr. Raja Prasad for giving us a free upgrade to one of the renovated suite rooms on our anniversary and for the entire stay. Would also like to thank Ms. Suzanne, the front desk manager and the entire team involved in the arrangements to make our special day all the more memorable; especially in helping me surprise my husband with a cake and flowers. They were also kind enough to grant us a late checkout. Mr. Prasad and Ms. Suzanne were very helpful in suggesting us places to see in and around Denver and ensured us a comfortable stay.The free breakfast has a decent spread of items and the restaurant managers asked the guests daily if they were happy with the breakfast. We felt though that the same items were for breakfast every day, may be a couple of items could be changed on alternate days to keep some variety for the guests and kids in particular. Nevertheless, the breakfast was good. The staff is very helpful and rooms are neat and clean. We would definitely recommend this place to fellow travelers.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wow!...for the price!,"The management of this motel just made our vacation so complete. Everyone treated us wonderful. The rooms are clean and the shuttle is a trip in itself! The breakfast was great, and the management even walks around to check to see if things are going well for you. Many needs are met including some interesting pets heading to their rooms. The pool looked clean. We had a blast and will return!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Smart deal,Free hot breakfast and free shuttle to downtown Denver made the Quality Inn the perfect place to stay without spending a fortune.  I was Denver for 4 nights for a conference and had to be at the Colorado Convention Center every morning at 730am.  It was so nice to be able to ride the free shuttle to get to wear I needed to go.  I'll definitely stay here again if I ever make my way back to Denver.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very nice Hotel,"Flew into Denver and stayed there one night before a train trip and one night on the way home,  The hotel was very clean and nice comfy beds.  The desk people were very helpful and friendly.  They have a bar and a restaurant and in the morning there is a buffet breakfast that was much better than the usual.  They had scrambled eggs, meat varied, one day bacon, another day sausage, toast, muffins, gravy and biscuits, fruit and other things I can't remember.  Free parking, Wi Fi and free transportation to the train, downtown and other places of interest. If I had to knock something it would be the road noise.  The hotel is right off the freeway so there was a lot of road traffic all night.  We did face the road so it might be better to be on the back side.  All in all, for our short stay I was more than pleased.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Customer Service Priority,"A was very pleased with the friendly, helpful staff, cleanliness of the hotel and free shuttles downtown! Mr. Postman/Shuttle Driver, Mike, was great! He shared historical and interesting  formation while taking us to our destinations!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clean! Lots of amenities! Pet friendly! Comfy beds!,"Just visited Denver for a night's stay with my dog. This hotel is really nice - I love the 3 elevator system, I never had to wait more than a second (and the elevators are nice inside). Staff was friendly and provided me with a ninth-story room away from people as requested. The room was a smoking room because they were pretty booked up, but honestly I could barely even tell, the faint smell was gone a minute after I walked in. No balconies but giant windows, and a modern little coffee maker. A generous amount of towels in the bathroom, which was clean and perhaps recently renovated. There was no microwave or refrigerator in the room, which didn't inconvenience us this time around. There's a restaurant in house open from 5:00pm.. I appreciated the little slip of paper I was handed at check-in with the wi-fi password, breakfast times, and hotel amenities. It was unfortunate to see the ""no marijuana"" sign at check-in, but I realize the hotel has Choice brand standards to comply with. Overall a wonderful stay!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Meets expectations,"This hotel is conveniently located near downtown.  It is close to Coors Field, Mile High Stadium, Pepsi Center, Auraria Campus , and downtown but is much cheaper than the downtown prices.  It is easy to get around if you know Denver or if you have GPS but might be tricky to find otherwise.  The staff is very friendly, the rooms are clean, and the ""free breakfast"" is standard hotel fare.  They have a restaurant/ bar on the property but it is only open in the evening.  There is a Village Inn next door that is open for breakfast or lunch.  They have a small outdoor pool and work out area has only a few pieces, but I wasn't here for either of those amenities. The parking lot is well lit.   Overall, I had a pleasant stay and would not hesitate to stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The hotel is nit conveniently located for people with no car but their free shuttle service helps,The hotel is near cross section of major highways and also has railway yard next to it. it is not a convenient location and may not want to venture out late in the evenings. The hotel rates included breakfast. Breakfast spread can be better. The hotel is undergoing renovation but ee got the room with newly laid out carpet.  Hotel staff is very helpful.  Hotel provides free shutt within a radius of 4 moles and er used the same to go to downtown. The hotel haz a small gym and a smsll swimmt pool but the swimming pool was under repairs. We didn't repent our decision to chose this hotel as hotel staff tried to make our stay comfortable. But if I am travelling next time with my wife I would prefer to stay in a hotel in a better place.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Decent Stay,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times when we come to the area for a Rockies game. They have been in the process of renovating, and have done some nice things since our last stay. The front desk staff was much friendlier and attentive than our previous stays. During our previous stays if I need to tell the front desk clerk something, he always acted like I was bothering him and totally blew me off. The breakfast is fantastic and worth the stay. The hotel also offers a shuttle service to and from the game which is one of the main reasons we stay here. After the game last night, the driver came and completely overloaded the van with people. While I appreciate the fact he was trying to get us all back to the hotel in a timely manner, I'm sure we were breaking all kinds of traffic laws. There were 19 people in this van, and sitting on each other's laps. Overall, the stay was nice, the breakfast delicious, and the room nicely renovated. We will be back for our next baseball adventure.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good value for money,"The rooms are very comfortable and clean and have all the basic amenities that one can ask for, including coffee/tea maker and an ironing board. I was on the 2nd floor, and the view of Denver downtown was fantastic. Although it is a little out of the way, the shuttle service more than makes up for it. Denver downtown is about ten minutes by shuttle, and they even come and pick you up. The breakfast is tasty but the menu was the same for the entire week that I stayed. Perhaps the management can look into providing a little more variety. Although my interaction with the staff was  mostly pleasant, at the time of checkout, me and my lady colleague (who was asthmatic) had to lug 7 pieces of heavy suitacases and bags by ourselves, as there were no bellboys around and the man at front desk refused to lend a helping hand, saying it was not his job. However, I had a pleasant stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone who is not very particular about the frills or courtesies of a 5-star hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Disgusting,This hotel should be shut down. From the nasty personnel working there to the nasty rooms. It's in a horrible area and I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. The train keeps you up all night and so does the constant door slamming. Don't even try to use the heat or a/c. It is so old and it makes the loudest clanking noise that there is no way you could sleep with it on. Our bathroom was disgusting. Pubic hair and urine everywhere. Just do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Such a pleasant surprise,"At first I was a bit skeptical, the hotel is older and not as fancy as some I have stayed at.  However, I was quickly won over by the friendliest and helpful staff ever!  I checked in very stressed as I had misplaced my cell phone at the airport.  The front desk made the necessary changes to allow me to make long distant phone calls without the usual high rates.  I was also able to check in early because there was a room available.  The room was clean and comfy with a pillow comforter and pillows.  Although not downtown, I had a lovely view of downtown Denver and the friendly shuttle staff made it easy to get anywhere I needed to go, including to the store directly after check in because I had forgotten some items.  The breakfast buffet was perfect, a nice hot breakfast gave me a great start to the day.  I will always stay here when I visit Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good value,"Hotel room was clean,but a bit out dated. The hotel is going through some remodeling. When we were there, they were painting the outside and I heard a worker say they're in the process of updating the rooms as well. The location is good, easy access to main roads and close to downtown. The breakfast (included in room price) was good, with eggs, potatoes, fruit, waffles, biscuits & gravy, muffins, etc. Accessing the hotel is a bit weird as you have to come at it in an odd way and then across train tracks. While I had requested a room away from the train, when we arrived one wasn't available for a smoking room (9th floor is all smoking rooms). I thought it could be an issue being disturbed at night by the train, but I never heard it once. The room walls are cement, which really helped avoid hearing noise from neighboring guests. The beds were comfortable. The cleaning staff was attentive. Only had one dealing with management and he was as accommodating as he could be. The desk clerk was very pleasant and helpful with advise. The time we were there they were very booked, but had sufficient staff to handle it and everything seemed to function smoothly., I did order dinner one evening from their lounge (and took it back to my room to eat) and it was decent. The appetizers were a good price for the quantity received. Overall I was pleased. I would recommend this  hotel to others looking for a good budget hotel, that included breakfast and had easy access to area destinations.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,GOOD HOTEL,"We liked the rooms,  they are big and confortable. Breakfast area is big and serve all basics. For the price we were very pleased. It is , no doubt, complicated to get ther if it is your first time,  however nowadays with a GPS there is no problem.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Remodeled Rooms,"The rooms have modern furniture, new carpets and comfortable beds. The breakfast area was a little small for the number of guests who stay at the property, making it a bit hard to maneuver through everyone.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Awesome staff!!,All staff-shuttle drivers; front desk; housekeeping; bartender; breakfast staff and Betty Martinez made our stay delightful! Everyone very friendly and helpful. Nice room for the price we will for sure be returning to this same hotel. Highly recommend,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Down Time,"I spent ten days at this hotel and I must say the staff did everything in their power to make my stay  extremely pleasant.The only problem I had was the restaurant/bar only opened at 5 pm everyday, so if you were hungry before then you would have to order in and there were quite a few places to satify that need. The shuttle bus runs overy hour so if you need to get somewhere its pretty good. The breakfast is better than you would expect and they actually come around to your table to see if everything is ok with you or if they can help with anything The hotel is clean, quiet, family friendly,  pet friendly, smoker friendly and non-smoker friendly. I give a big thumbs up to the staff of the Quality Inn Central Denver...one of the most enjoyable stays.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great for OTR drivers,A lot of parking space free breakfast mostly great views of the city and shuttles great front desk outdoor swimming pool which wasn't open when i was there  good tv close to shops and pet friendly  Highly recommend,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality and Service,"Good quality hotel, personnel fair and helpful, well located for easy access with a car, from aiport, and rather close to go downtown.  Spacy bedroom, convenient bathroom. Nice and expanded breakfast. Reasonable price.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent value for money,"I had gone to attend a conference at Denver and stayed in this hotel in a standard king room. The room was large and comfortable with all the amenities. The room heating was good inspite of the snow outside. My room was on the 8th floor with a awesome view of the Colorado mountain range. The check-in and check-out was quick and hassle free. They even gave me a complimentary shaving kit which i had forgotten to pack. The complimentary breakfast had a good spread and was served at 6.30am, making it easier for me to go to the conference. The best part was the free shuttle to the  Colorado convention centre which was punctual and regular. A special thanks to the courteous reception staff and the friendly shuttle drivers. The only downside for me was the absence of a 24 hours restaurant.All in all it was a memorable experience.complimentary",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,1 night Stay,Nice Hotel close to the insterstate but yet it was very quiet in our room. We chose thai Hotel for location on this trip and value for our $. Nice restaurant downstairs for an evening meal and it was good food and we didn't have to take a drive to find someplace to eat. Nice average breakfast in the morning and the rooms were average size and clean and the water was HOT!,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good deal ... pleasant stay,"The shuttle makes the stay very affordable.  It is available hourly.  But when the hotel was filled with guests, they ran it as quickly as they could with two.  The trip is like 15 min in light traffic, but near 25 min in rush hour.  You call them and they pick you up from town, usually a 10 to 25 min wait.   The breakfast was pleasant - buffet style.  Fruit - fresh and canned.  Make it yourself hot belgium waffle.   Lean ham slices, scrambled egg, sometype of hot cereal mix, muffin, english muffin, toasts, cereal, real orange juice, milk, coffee, etc...   Good and more than I would ask for.  The restaurant and bar has a fixed menu, and was acceptable.  Parking is plentiful, a grocery (safeway) is about 1/2 mile away, downtown is about 10 miles away - but takes time in rush hour.  Airport is about 20 min away, but longer in rush hour.Room, is adequate.  Was recently remodeled, I think, but they used substandard material - unfortunate for the hotel.   The fake spray on sandstone spray on the sink, counter and shower looks fine from a distance, but is peeling already.  I feel sad to see such poor quality panel in the tub area, as it will be mouldy and difficult to maintain and last very little time.   Someone made a bad decision in the material for the remodeling - as it will soon be time to remove the panel in the tub again.  Temperature control did not work.  The thermostat was shut off, but the room was still hot at times...   Not sure how well it will work in the summer.   The staff was friendly.  Ahh.. the first night, I was placed on the 8th floor.  It was a ""pet floor"".  Some one left their two small dogs in the room and left.  They were barking and yelping for hours.  I finally found an ear plug and was able to sleep through it.  Called the desk, and they did send someone to the room, but couldn't do anything, as the owners were away.  They must have left the following day, as the floor was quiet then.The gym - a weight machine.  A broken stair stepper (need the left foot pedal roller replaced).  A stationary bicycle.  And a simple treadmill.  Towel and water in the small gym.  The pool was closed for the winter, and appear to be small, and not for laps.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Decent place - wonderful people,"Place is in the central area...so as another viewer said, it's not going to have the view or hot tub.  But the place is clean and the staff is nice.  Our workers have stayed their for a month now and everything has gone smoothly.  Raja (the GM) has been wonderful and is very accommodating to our guys and his staff takes good care of them.  We'll stay there again!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"nice property good services,free shuttle","I stayed there in march for a convention.Location is not so Central BUT THE FREE SHUTTLE SERVICE TO DOWNTOWN WAS VERY GOOD AND EFFICIENT.The shuttle  goes to downtown every hour and for the return tou should call and stay in one of the pick  up locations.The breakfast was good but the same every morning-coffee,tea,milk,orange juice,muffins,omlette,salami,fruit salad,cereals.The room was clean and big without refrigerator.i,ll stay again there!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good stay,"Good hotel if you are not picky, ppl are nice, trying to take u to the downtown (which is 10' away from the hotel by car) by shuttle every hour. Michael, the driver of the shuttle is very nice. Dont go there if you r dreaming to have a jacuzzi and exceptionnel downtown view",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel and restaurant,"Stayed here for one night, happened to be during a gun show so it was pretty hectic. A couple of people were looking at me for an uncomfortable period of time, but aside from that the check-in staff was nice and the guests seemed to be just the nicest people. We went to the restaurant located inside the hotel (The Palms?) and the service was really slow... the food was okay... our drinks were served in red plastic cups, which was a bit surprising, but I was totally fine with it.  Our server was really sweet, but the lady checking us out after our dinner was really rude and made me want to punch her in the face. But like I said, the guests seemed really nice, and the room itself was great. I would stay here again, but I wouldn't go to the restaurant. Too bad there are no places nearby to get anything to eat (the restaurant next door was closed when we went sometime during the early evening, 6 or 7 PM?).",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,WOW!,"I would like to thank Raja, for taking time to listen to my needs and help me with my stay on 2/22/2014, I am very pleased with his customer service, kindness, and understanding. I would definitely stay here anytime I am in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wonderful stay :),Had a great stay.Wonderful staff.So if your truck breaks down or your in the Denver area and need a friendly place to stay I recommend this hotel :)Fast shuttles. Great food at the Palm Grill and Bar Restaurant.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice Hotel,"I just came back home from APS convention, I stayed at this hotel during convention i used their shuttle service to go to convention center in the morning and was just phenomenal.Breakfast was delicious, hotel rooms were clean and nice Wi-Fi was amazing or all had a great experience of this facility and i will come back.thank you!!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,I expected more based on reviews....,"I always review hotels in advance of booking, and our recent stay at this hotel was no different. We were a bit early, arriving about 11:30. We waited about 20-30 minutes in the lobby while they found a room for us to settle into. We finally settled into the room, and found it lacking a microwave and fridge. We called down to the front desk, and they had both delivered to our room. To be fair, this is a budget friendly hotel, and the accommodations were decent for the price point. I was satisfied up to this point....until....Later that evening, my husband told me he discovered 'barnacles' on the shower wall while showering. I thought he was joking, and did not  understand what he meant. I checked it out, and there was mold/mildew on the shower wall that was FLAKING. It appears the housekeeper was cleaning the tub, but had not bothered to clean the wall EVER. It was late, so I showered, avoiding touching the wall.The next morning at breakfast (which was hot and pretty good), the guest relations director asked me how my stay was. I informed of the shower wall and showed her pictures I took on my cellphone. She was shocked, but then introduced me to the housekeeping manager. He told us that it would be taken care of immediately. This was on a Saturday. On Sunday, we saw the guest relations manager again....we told her that housekeeping did come the day before, but that the shower wall had not been cleaned. She again said that she'd notify the housekeeping manager. Again, it was not addressed. We were in town for business, so there was little time for us to chase down management about this issue. We finally checked out on Wednesday morning. The wall was never cleaned. I cringe at the cleanliness of the room overall, now that I think back on it all.  I would not normally be so critical, but management really dropped the ball on this one, and I hope that someone from this establishment will learn that follow up and follow through is important in guest relation matters.We had expected so much more from the trip advisor reviews...",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Eh...It was alright.,"This accommodation had all the bells and whistles associated with an economic hotel. The room and facility was clean and well kept, (although could use some updating), free WIFI in rooms worked great, and the free breakfast was decent and what is to be expected for a free meal. The shuttle service was very convenient for traveling downtown as well. All in all, it had everything you needed, nothing more, nothing less.However, I was fairly disappointed in the customer service given by some of the front desk staff. Upon arrival there was no friendly smile or welcome, just a monotone ""Name?"" in response to me telling them I had a reservation. We were then given some instructional notes and sent off to our room. Then the following day when I asked if the van outside was the shuttle I was told that I had to sign up for the service. I repeated my question because his answer had no relation to what I asked, then he said it leaves on the hour every hour. Again, his response had no relation to my question. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt and perhaps he was having a bad day, but still. I walked away baffled and told my boyfriend to ask him my question to see if he would have a valid response, and he finally did. It was like pulling teeth though! The shuttle driver was not that friendly either. We traveled in awkward silence and when asked where to be dropped off we told him the convention center and he dropped us off elsewhere. Being first time visitors, we had no idea until he already left. I knew that there were specific drop off locations, but he could at least have given us a heads up that he was not dropping us off where we thought he was going to. I will compliment the manager on being very friendly though. She made her rounds during breakfast every morning, said hi to everybody, and would even help clean up after guests that would leave their table a mess. I'm not sure I would stay here again, but if you're on a budget and are independent when it comes to traveling then this would be a good place.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,APS MARCH MEETING 2014,"Hotel has good conditions for us:Shuttle to city center is very advantage. Every half an hour, the service brings people to the convention center.Wifi connect is useful and not weak.Clean rooms is very Comfortable. Also the hotel is not faraway from city center.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Second stay:,"This was our second time staying at the Quality Inn Central Denver & as the first it was very pleasant.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very accommodating.,"Our reservation was marked for a smoking room which we did not want, and the office manager Steve Budson was very helpful in booking us into a non smoking room without any grief.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Amazing and Excellent hotel to stay,Recently i came to Denver and stayed with this hotel and had a great experience . i am from India it was my first time trip overseas the hotel staff was really helpful for everything.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Hotel Stay,"I had stayed at Quality Inn Central in Denver before and was very pleased, therefore I reserved2 nights stay 2-6 and 2-7. I was a little dissappointed at first when we checked in that eveningthe 2 people at registration were very rude. The room was nice and the breakfast was excellent,When we checked out on 2/8 the two people at registration were very nice. I filled out a formthat was not complimentary at all, I had a procedure at National Jewish Hospital and was a little out of sorts.  I will definetly will stay there again and would recommend this Hotel as a matter of fact I just did to my son. Please disregard the form I sent because it was actually a pleasant stay.Thank You",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A peaceful amazing and wonderful place to stay.,We were supposed to stay 2 nights and the first night we had to cancel due to a snow storm. We called and the staff was so nice and didnt have a problem with us canceling. We get there the next day early and our room was ready early and everyone was so nice. The hotel had a shuttle take us where we needed to go the whole time and we had such a nice time. We had a wonderful breakfast the next day and the Guest Relations Officer and another gentleman fell in love with my teacup chihuahua and they gave her a dog pillow and we were so sweet. I will be staying at this hotel every time we come to Denver!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Week End Hotel!,"We stay at this hotel every year during the National Western Stock Show and also whenever we travel to Denver.  Excellent value in this price range.  The staff is awesome, from the manager (who is hands on in service), front desk staff, shuttle driver, maid service, servers and all staff members!  Clean rooms, super fun bar and a staff that truly seems to want to give a good experience to all guests.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"No hot water for a week, housekeeping - steal, cleanliness Zero""","This is the second time we stayed here, giving this place another chance.  Last year we had no hot water for showers, for the full week we chose to stay at this locations. Since we had prepaid and I ended up quite sick, we did not elect to find another location. Promises were made to resolve the issues, each day....never to change.Here we are once again, a week without hot showers, only to be told it was to be resolved...not! Transformer failed for over 15 hours,....no electric, no heat and no apology for the inconvenience. Even the emergency lights ran out of batteries, that once we were trying to get out of the building from the 3rd floors, we had no way to figure out how / where to find the exit stairway......frightening experience!!!Toilet plugged, and then for 24 hrs no one came to resolve; and once they did, after the toilet flooded, the maintenance man did not clean up the floor mess!! We had to change out the room keys each day, to enter our prepaid hotel room. We needed to do laundry, only to be told that the front desk, nor the dining room/bar had change to make, to use the coin operated washer/dryer on the premises. We also qualified for an  upgrade, due to the reward program we are in, only to be placed on  a lower level, without city view. This is the lowest level of hotel hospitality, customer service and respect we have found, in all the travel we do. Very disappointing!! They do not even forward tips to their van drivers.....makes one wonder what this hotel is all about!!!Breakfast was minimal! And so is parking safety!Noise quarters!Cleanliness - most minimal by housekeepers:(",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice hotel!,"Was really happy that the shuttle took us a little futher than where it was suppose to go. The front desk including auditor was amazing! They are really there to help you and set you up. We stayed 2 days and the housekeeping was great as well. We had a huge room, 2 beds and a great view of the city! I loved the bar and grill in side was kid friendly as well. Breakfast was busy but they made sure everything stayed stocked up well.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"A bit off the downtown, 2nd best breakfast we had in US","We booked this hotel cause it was on the way we wanted continue next day when arriving for our US vacation.Room was very spacious so as bed. The only weak thing was that there was highway at the direction windows were facing so a bit of a noise.Very positive part of our 1 night stay was breakfast. Oh I wish we had breakfast like that in every hotel/motel advertising continental breakfast. Eggs, ham, bacon, fruit. Looking back - paradise :)",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Satisfied Customer,"I think this hotel is above the top.  The front desk personnel were very accommodating and met all our needs.  Very professional.  The rooms were very nice and again, the staff was very exceptional.  The staff was very top notch.  Love the shuttle drivers too.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Average hotel, good for price.","Our stay in this hotel was pleasant and we found the staff to be quite helpful and the shuttle bus was complementary, which is always a plus. However, we found the staff to be somewhat disorganized when it came to the shuttles. We were constantly left out in the freezing cold for over an hour waiting for pick up. Might make more sense to have specific pick up times at each of the stops, instead of the ""call and we'll be there in 15 minutes"" system they currently have.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Great service, nice people","The managers, front desk staff, and shuttle drivers were always very friendly and extremely helpful if we needed anything. The shuttle to downtown Denver was very convenient. The breakfast selection was good, and the rooms were large, clean, and comfortable. The staff went out of their way to make us feel at home, which made for a great family vacation. Great value/service for the price.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Hotel,I stayed there last week with my family and it was a great experience. Hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. Rooms were spacious and clean. Shuttle service to go downtown and to nearby areas was very convenient and easily available. We did not encounter any heating/cooling system problem during our stay. Very good selection of hot items for breakfast. Overall excellent value for money and I would highly recommend it.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good value, if you have a car","This is an above average hotel (for the price) if you have a car to use while in Denver.  This place continues to have temperature issues.  Our room was v. clean, but the heat in the individual rooms cannot be controlled.  This forced us to have to open our window to cool the room down at night.  This caused road noises to be heard, although we were on the 7th floor.  However, it was v. inexpensive and the staff were great.  As opposed to another reviewer, I found the breakfast to be above average, for a choice hotel property.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Amazing hotel with amazing staff,"I stayed here last week in one of the worst record cold weather in Denver. Temperature was below 0 whole time. I was very impressed with their efforts to accommodate our requests. I know there were only much they could do about Denver being record cold , but they way they handled it was pronominal. Even heat was working fine in my room , my kids were cold and I asked the desk to please send me a space heater. I found out later that hotel had very few space heater which they already gave to other guests.Eventually  they had to go to store and buy heater for me to keep my kids warm ( I guess they never had this cold weather before). They even gave us some hot apple cider and extra blankets for my kids. I could not thank them enough for their efforts and drive in snowy bad weather for my family to give them extra comfort. However ,later room was very comfortable and we shut down the space heater and slept really well. Breakfast was amazing, everything was very good about this hotel. I will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NO HEAT,"The place is kinda run down. They have a antique heating a/c system, the room never got out of the fourths I slept in my coverhauls. The breakfast was terrible. The night clerk's are usless no customer service skills. The bar is ok the food was far but nothing to write home about. I will not stay here again. Also I did change rooms and same problem no heat.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don't Stay Here!!! Dirty! Bad Service! No Heat!,"This is the worst place I've ever stayed. It is 5 degrees and they have no heat. They manager said ""its never been this cold and to not stand by the window!"" The breaker stoped working, so I had no power in half of my room. I had to wear my sweater, gloves and beanie and I used the beds blankets and I was still cold. They finally gave me a little space heater and I booked their suite. I could only imagine how crapy there other rooms are. I stayed in room 824. They have old furniture, blood stain on the blow dryer and towels that look like they have been used to many times.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Free shuttle, Best Breakfast and Conveniently located","I loved this hotel. Hotel is very clean from top to bottom. Staffs are very helpful. Rooms are not like typical tiny hotel room, very spacious and clean. Best things are : free shuttle to downtown, football stadium and complimentary breakfast. I felt very safe during my entire stay. Hotel is conveniently located, just few minutes drive from Denver Downtown. We will certainly back.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Right next to ACTIVE train tracks!,"The location is hard to get to. Our rent-a-car and phone GPSs could not find it correctly.Once arriving, the staff appeared to be busy doing their own things and it felt as if we were hindering them.  Our hotel info was given to us on small pieces of paper, rather than explained. We tried to use a shuttle then found out you had to sign up for it in advance and had to wait another hour.  Also, the shuttles don't run very late and it's hard to have fun in downtown Denver when your curfew is 10pm.  A cab to the hotel runs about $40.The rooms are small and could use a facelift.  The thermostat was very touchy and our room was either very hot or very cold.  Oh, and also (I'm surprised few people have mentioned this). There are active train tracks RIGHT NEXT to the hotel. The trains come through blaring their horns between midnight and 4am. I'm a heavy sleeper and was woken up by them frequently.The breakfast is free but you could find better food at the diner nearby or in an elementry school cafeteria.All in all, this place was decent, but you could find much better options in Denver. I suggest continuing your search.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,I was happy with our stay,"The hotel is old, so it has some issues - not very soundproof (you can hear doors slamming), thermostat old, but it was fine for the amount of time you stay in your room.  Rooms have a microwave and refrigerator, a plus when staying for several days.  They also have free breakfast and shuttle to major points of interest. They also have a restaurant and bar. Staff was very friendly.  I will stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,trucker,"really nice place to stay excellent staff,and hospitality especially betty and cj .will stay here again . rooms are very comfy. will defitily stay again.really liked driving around with cj he really knows the city well, mike and Richard were very hospitable too,taking me where I needed to go......",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Second time around not very good,"Stayed here twice. The first time wasn't bad, room was clean, everything worked fine. The second time, this last Wednesday, was not good. Room smelled, the what was unbearable. Tried to turn the cool setting on, on the thermostat and it only blew hot air. The bathtub wouldn't drain, hair dryer apparently didn't work. Probably won't be staying here again",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Early holiday vacation turned sour,"I stayed here once when a friend booked our rooms and had a decent stay. This second time I'm not impressed. There is a stain on a ""clean"" bed there are stains all over the floor. Blood stains on the couch, and mold on my shower liner. Oh and the bath tub isn't draining. I've stayed at some questionable places, but did not expect blood stains anywhere. Not impressed, and not recommended.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Trains, Fires, no heat, and theft.","We as a group had 3 different rooms. Overall the beds were ok except the pillows were about the size of a postage stamp. It was clean overall but had an off odor. None of our rooms had heat which made for some EXTREMELY cold nights.  In one room the blow dryer was hanging by the wires. In one room the shower would not drain so by the end of the shower you were almost over flowing the tub.  One evening something caught fire and the fire trucks showed up but the alarms were not going off which is a little bit scary. I had a small zip lock bag of vitamins,advil, and alergy pills stolen i assume by the maid because i never found them.  The train goes by ALL night and blows the whistle at all hours. I was woken up at least 3 times a night by this.  It was a decent price but we most definitely  will not be back. OH and who puts ice in milk i dont get that. The milk at breakfast was so watered down it tasted awful.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Exceptional Hotel Service and Convenience in Denver,"For your next trip to Denver for any sporting events or just a casual visit you will find the Quality Inn Denver Central  very convenient and the service exceptional.  The rooms were comfortable and lovely and the view of the mountains (west facing rooms) beautiful.  The hotel staff, including the manger, Steve Budson, was very attentive.  The best bet for getting to and from downtown Denver and the sports arenas is the free shuttle which runs on the hour.  We took it to and from downtown and it is was extremely convenient.  The complimentary breakfast was also delicious!We will return for future stays at this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A very nice hotel ,"I looked hard for the deficiencies that other recent reviews pointed out. Either they were there but so small as to escape my notice, or the management has stepped up and corrected them. Either way, we had a really good stay.The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was delicious. There were at least four staff making sure the dining area was clean.We come to Denver often for pleasure, whether it be shopping or sporting events. We will definitely stay here in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Helpful even after I left hotel,My truck was being repaired & all of the staff was very helpful with any of my requests.  I enjoyed the breakfast buffet. The room was always very clean & fresh. My stay was during the first part of Oct. & when I discovered I could not find the folio for reimbersment from my company Steve helped me resolve this problem a month later. Thank you so much.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not to be recommended,"This was the worst hotel we stayed in during our three week trip through the states of Colorado and Utah. The service at the front desk was dire (we even suspect that the lady we spoke to at reception was on drugs or under influence as she did not manage to answer the most basic of questions: 'how do we drive from here into the city center'). Furthermore, the room was smelly and very basic and the restaurant we could not test for dinner as they told us when we entered at 21.02 that 'the kitchen closes at 21.00'. Thus we had to go to the hotel across the road, the Ramada, where we were served decent food. Last but not least, the breakfast buffet is just shambles. There is so much dirt everywhere that we decided not to eat there at all. What was surprising is that there was enough staff around, but nobody, including somebody that looked like the breakfast manager, did not seem to care a monkeys about cleanliness in particular and service in general. Our advise, go somewhere else.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Horrible experience, do not recommend","We selected this hotel because of the high trip advisor score, and were astonished at the terrible ""quality"" of the Inn. Firstly, the hotel stinks. We were on the fourth floor, and even though it's non-smoking, it smells of years of stale cigarettes. The room also had this odor. There was a chair in the corridor that was missing the seat cushion, and had a very questionable stain on the arm. We bunkered down in our room and waited for our olfactory senses to deaden, when we started to smell natural gas. We opened the window, but the gas didn't go away. We called the front desk, who seemed less than concerned, and sent maintenance up about 20 mins later. He just turned on the fan in the room, and left again. It was then that we insisted on changing rooms.The 6th floor smelled worse than the 4th floor - cigarettes mixed with marijuana smoke. Luckily, the room didn't smell as bad, and the natural gas did not infiltrate. So we didn't die in our sleep. the breakfast buffet was filled with sketchy characters, and the front desk could not have been ruder on check out. She acted like she was put out that we asked for a receipt, and never made eye contact. Overall, I would never EVER repeat my visit to this hotel, and likely would never stay at another Quality Inn.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent Choice Hotel,"Interestingly enough I have been reading reviews of others and wonder what must be their problem that they complain about the smallest things and forget about the bigger picture that this is a 3 star Quality Inn and not the Marriott charging quadruple the money? Not being able to play on Facebook while others wait to use the computer and you are supposedly on a work trip and then going on to complain about it on Trip Advisor? Regardless, in my experience it was a great hotel to stay at for the price value proposition. My budget was $75 a night and in that I got a spacious clean room close to the city with breakfast and WIFI, what more could you want?The Front Office Manager Steve was particularly pleasant and worked tirelessly to ensure that we had a great stay. The rooms were very spacious, WIFI was fast and as advertised the Hot Buffet Breakfast in the morning was awesome. I will be back again and tell others to come here as well.Ram",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst hotel experience in years - had to go elsewhere,"The hotel set central air to ""seasonal"" settings, and cared less that heat poured into rooms with no way for guests to regulate it. We had to open the windows to let cool air in, but it also let in the interstate traffic noise and the sounds of multiple trains from the Denver station. The only thing the staff offered was a fan, which was of little use. We had to check out and find a room elsewhere.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Intrusive HouseKeeping, Rude Management","Apparently the staff @ this hotel have no idea what do not disturb signs mean, ive been here 3 days as my company is paying for the hotel.. Leaves me minamal choice where to stay in the 3 days i've been walked in on all 3 days with the sign up on my door.. The hotel offers computer use but disallow facebook gaming and or apps.. You can check your facebook but not do anything on it, seems pointless to me and trust me when i say your babysitted while on the computer the general manager said ""Can you read clearly, and hear me ok?"" you cant do that... I'd recommend looking around if your privacy matters to you.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Second time just as nice as first!,"I stayed here a year ago and was pleasantly surprised by the price, location, hot breakfast, and free shuttle to central Denver events.  This is not a 4 star hotel but we found the rooms to be clean, the beds comfortable, and the staff friendly. We would stay here again if we needed a room in Denver!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Friendly & Efficient Front Desk Manager,"At check-in I received with my room keys a note: ""We want you to have a wonderful stay with us. If there is anything you are not satisfied with, please let us know IMMEDIATELY!"" Once in the guest room, I discovered a couple of issues that I reported the next morning to the front desk clerk. My expectation was that the issues would be resolved by the time I returned that evening. I presumed that ""IMMEDIATELY"" also meant fixing the problems immediately, but that didn't happen. Upset about the hotel's seemingly lack of concern, I demanded to see the front desk manager, whom I then asked how long I would have to wait for the staff to do something?The manager, Steve, informed me that my wait was over because he was going to take care of my concerns personally, at that very moment. By the time I returned from dinner everything was in working order. I commend Steve for his prompt attention, his ability to not become defensive while under pressure and for his positive attitude while accepting personal responsibility for those issues. I found the other reviews of this property very accurate. I might not stay here again, but if I decide to do so, it will be because of Steve. He understands the meaning of hospitality!",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Frequent travelers,"My husband & our family travel to Denver frequently . We have stayed in many different places but find Quality Inn Central checks all of our boxes. We have gone to numerous sporting events and concerts over the years and the free-shuttle has always been a plus for us. The rooms are always clean and the complimentary breakfast provides enough variety to please our whole family. The staff are awesome. My husband is a diabetic,they went out and picked up a sugar-free syrup in time for our next breakfast! Betty,the guest relations officer , always greets us with a huge smile and friendly conversation. She is definitely one Quality Inn's finest! We have stayed here many times. The rooms aren't the newest but if you need a clean,reasonably priced room with a shuttle to any of the events...it's the best spot in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Enjoyed our stay,"We stayed at Quality Inn Central Denver for one night in August 2013, paying $91.95 total for a room with two queen beds.  It was easy to find, parking was good, and it has an elevator.  The website said ""microwave and mini-fridge can be rented from the front desk"", but when we asked about this at check-in the desk clerk gave us a room with a microwave and mini-fridge at no extra charge, as Choice Reward members.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Older Property Still a Good Choice,"This large older hotel in an industrial area of Denver is convenient to downtown due to a free hourly shuttle.  Furnishings are OK, if a little tired. The TV's are up-to-date flat screens with multiple channels.  Many rooms have good views of the mountains and downtown, my room had a direct view of the mountains and a tiny corner look at Downtown.The bathrooms are largely updated, with new tile and a great shower.  A decent complimentary breakfast is provided, don't listen to the complaints as it is more than adequate.  One complaint-the tiny paper cups for juice.Price was not a consideration as my stay was during the Great American Beer Festival when everything jumps exponentially.  Still less than most close-in hotels.The good: Staff is friendly and competent, the lobby and rooms are clean, the shuttle eliminates the problem of being too far from downtown to walk it.The bad: I was put in a smoking room, although the stench was not as bad as most places. Keep in mind that in Colorado, a smoking room can mean more than cigarettes. I smelled herb in the hallway.  Smells a lot better than cigarettes but some may object.  The furnishings show at least one updating but it wasn't very recently.  And the site is convenient but there is absolutely nothing in the immediate area.Overall, a good choice.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,little tired but worth what you pay for,"I stayed at this hotel because of a convention that was happening there. The rooms are a little tired and dated, but not bad. The cost for the room during this high demand period was too high, but it was worth the convenience to be right where I needed to be.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent Shuttle service,"The room was good but the hotel needs updating, It's dated and really in need of some TLC. However, the room was good, variety to choose from for breakfast, friendly staff who tried their best for you.  The shuttle was absolutely brilliant, it even took us and picked us up from the Bronco game!  Worth the stay just for that.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not much quality here,"What a shame, it started off so well.  We were warmly welcomed and checked in without a problem.The room itself was very clean, as was the bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable which allowed for a good sleep.  Unfortunately, the room was very hot.  I turned the thermostat down to minimum and went out for a few hours.  Upon our return, the room was still hot - the thermostat seemingly had no effect upon the temperature of the room.The lift was also painfully slow, often waiting for many, many minutes for it to arrive.  Sometimes, when it did arrive there would be no space so you'd have to wait for the next one.  It seemed like only 2 of the 3 were in working order.  When asking the passing room service staff in the corridor, it took a while for them to tell us in broken English that there were no stairs available as all the doors are alarmed.Breakfast was a joke.  In the hot section was the usual chemical scrambled eggs, some bacon soaking in some kind of a liquid and several pots of something rather stodgy looking.  Not impressed with this, wifey went to get some breakfast cereal, only to discover they hadn't bothered to fill up the milk, so she gave up on that and had a few lousy looking muffins.  Another option she considered was the fresh fruit, but again, there were just a few scraps left over which were only replaced a good while after she went to have a look.  In general, choice was extremely limited.Next time we're in Denver, we'll almost certainly stay elsewhere.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Hotel at reasonable rates,"Lots good to say about this hotel. Very attentive staff, clean rooms. Comprehensive free hot breakfast. Ample free parking. Very close to downtown Denver, Interstate  70 and Interstate  25  and the HIghlands area of Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good value, not so great location","Hotel was ok, located next to a railway track in a not so great neighborhood. Front desk was helpful and rooms were not bad. They have a restaurant downstairs; so that was convenient. They have an ice machine on each floor; so we didn't have to take the elevator. Overall nothing much to complain especially on a budget.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Monday Night Football,"We came into Denver for one night for Monday night football.  We booked online and didn't have any problems.  The hotel was easy to find from I-25 southbound.  We didn't have any trouble with parking.  There is plenty of parking available behind the hotel so I'm not sure why others have had problems.  We arrived before check-in around 2 p.m. and were able to get into our room right away.  The desk staff was friendly.  The room was very spacious and clean.  We would have liked a better view (we saw the freeway) but we weren't in the room much except to sleep.  There is a Village Inn across the parking lot where we went to eat.  However, beware that they don't have normal 24 hour opening.  They are only open from 6:30 until 3:00 p.m. One of the best benefits of this hotel was the free shuttle service to the Broncos game.  They were really busy and a lot of people were waiting.  We were in the lobby just before 4 and on the shuttle around 4:20.  It was great not to have to navigate the streets and find parking.  Our driver was named Chandler and he was so fun and friendly.  When the game was over we were able to get on a shuttle back to the hotel right away.The beds and pillows were comfortable and we didn't hear noise from other rooms.  We also never waited long for the elevator.  The tv in the room didn't have a guide and the one provided in the binder didn't seem to match up exactly so we weren't sure which channels were which.We didn't use the restaurant except for the free breakfast.  It was fair but met our needs.  They have hot and cold items.  My suggestions would be to have another waffle maker and also offer hot chocolate packets.  The line to make waffles was long....we didn't bother to wait in it.  Overall this was a nice place to stay and we didn't have any big complaints.  We would stay again if we were in town.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Warm and welcoming to me and my four legged companion.,Everything was very clean here. They went out of their way to accommodate us. Even bringing us a fridge.  They welcomed our dog and even gave her a little pillow to keep. The breakfast was good and the bar was open and friendly. We very much enjoyed our stay,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent value for money,"The location of the hotel extremely convenient; right by I 25, 2 mins from I 70 and about 5 mins from downtown Denver. The free breakfast is very good. Staff are extremely friendly and ready to help anytime. The other great thing is their shuttle service to Denver downtown. Enjoyed the ball game without the hassles of finding a parking spot downtown.Room was clean and nice. I used their conference center services and that worked out very well too. Upper floors have spectacular views of downtown/mountains. All of that for a great deal less than what I would have otherwise paid across the street.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Filthy,"I can only say that this place is so tired and worn out it's a mess. The chair in my room was so filthy I couldn't sit in it. The carpeting was disgusting and had lumps in it. The bathroom needs the mold cleaned around the shower. Mattress was awful. The nicest part of this place is the elevators. Parking seems to be a problem in every review I read, I always found a spot but it was crowded. This place sits in Globeville on a railroad track when a train passes it wakes you. The area is definitely the ""hood"" I wouldn't go walking around the hotel. There isn't much nearby since this is in an industrial area.Employees are nice, breakfast isn't bad same thing every morning but free. Best thing is a free shuttle into Denver. Hard place to find heading North on 25 easy to find coming south on 25.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The hotel mostly felt tired and dated.,"The overall feeling of this hotel is that it is a time warp. No fridge or microwave. I felt like I was back in the 80s! Spend a few dollars and come into the 21st century. Check in was fast and pleasant. The room was very clean. The hot water in the bathroom sink never got even warm, and had very weak pressure. The tub and shower pressure were fine, but also experienced a shortage of hot water. The chief complaint I had was that I I had to park in the Village Inn parking lot. I paid full price for my room. I did not pay to park in the Village Inn parking lot. VI closes at 6:00 p.m. so my 5 month old vehicle, with out of state plates, sat there as a tempting target. Quality Inn needs to ensure they have parking space for their guests. Perhaps not selling the entire parking lot for a rock show would be a good start. The 7th floor is supposed to be non-smoking. Room 719 smelled very much of stale smoke. The mattresses were AMAZINGLY comfortable. I did have a problem with the people staying next door. At 1:15 a.m. they returned to their room and were loud and obnoxious. After listening to their racist, homophobic screaming in the hallway for around 10 minutes, I phoned the front desk. The guy at the front desk assured me he would come right up, and get them to quiet down. Thirty minutes later, nothing had been done, so I called the front desk again. This time the gentleman working there did respond, and after a somewhat heated conversation, he was finally able to get them to quiet down. I was grateful to him for doing this, but I really wish he would have responded to my initial call. The best advice I could offer is to avoid the so called restaurant in the hotel at all costs. It is one of the worst ""dining"": experiences I have ever been unfortunate to suffer through. The name of this disaster is the Palm Grill Restaurant and Bar. I will write that review next.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,An ok place to stay,"We flew into Denver and drove to Yellowstone so we stayed here the night we flew in and again the night before we flew out.Pros:  Clean comfortable rooms, the bathroom had an extra mirror area outside the main bath so one person could put on make-up while another showered...that was nice.  The front desk staff was very nice, especially those working the first night we stayed there.  Also, they have a free shuttle that will take you anywhere within 15 miles, I think.  It leaves every hour on the hour and they'll pick you up when you call them.  We took it to the Rockies game.  It was nice to have so we didn't have to drive downtown and pay for parking.  Shuttle driver was very nice.Cons:  The location of the hotel is in an industrial area next to a highway and a railroad track so there is some noise associated with that.  The shuttle helps with the location though.  There's not really anything right around the hotel, but the shuttle kind of makes up for that.  Also, we happened to be there during the big rock and mineral, fossil and jewelry show.  The first day we stayed they were setting up for it and it was noisy on the side of the hotel we were in.  (They set up lots of tents in the hotel's parking lot.)  When we checked out I asked that the next week we have a room on the opposite side of the hotel.  They gave us a room on the other side so that was fine.  However, the 2nd time we stayed was during the show and there was practically no parking at the hotel....and it was raining so we had to walk far in the rain from the car to the hotel.  That was annoying since we weren't even in town for the show.  If the show is not in town I think there'd be plenty of parking.Also, the breakfast here was one of the worst we've ever had at a choice brand hotel.  They had scrambled eggs, pineapple ham, refried beans, biscuits & gravy, waffles (the only good thing there and there was only 1 waffle maker so there was always a line) fruit salad that my fruit-loving kids said wasn't very good, muffins, bread, etc., coffee, OJ, Milk and 2 kinds of cereal:  cheerios and corn flakes.  Very disappointing selection.  No yogurt or fresh fruit or juice besides orange juice with pulp, which my kids don't like.  They also didn't have a microwave which would have made the cold biscuits and muffins taste better.  What they did have were tip jars everywhere.  Why?  I don't know.  No one there ever helped anyone with anything.  I never saw them doing anything really.  It is a shame.  This location has a restaurant so I'm sure they have a full kitchen and could provide a much better breakfast than they have.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Everything about this hotel was good,"We stayed here on the first day and were so impressed we booked in for the last night as well. Check in was fast and efficient. The room was spacious and clean with a good view of the area. Our door wouldn't open and they sent an engineer within a few minuites. The breakfast was very good, one of the managers went to every table asking if ""all was alright"" which, we thought in this day and age was a nice thing to do. We would certainly stay here again. Its not far to the airport, we didn't use the shuttle though, so have no idea what that is like to get to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Taste of Colorado,"Hotel staff as a whole were friendly and helpful. Minor issues keycards did not work and took a full day to fix the machine, so every time we returned to the hotel we had to wait until someone could let us in to our room. Breakfast was great - hot eggs, biscuits and gravy, tortillas, beans, fruit, coffee, tea, juice, cereal, waffles and more. Excellent. Rooms were nice and clean.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good value hotel.,Basically this hotel is a good hotel because of the location and the value in which you get what you pay for ... Good price hotel and the stay was good .. Free parking and good location to the downtown ....,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Stay away,"Upon check in, customer service agent was rude...no parking for hotel guest (they had half the parking lot fenced off)..finally in our room to find dirty sheets on bed..moved rooms only to find more dirty bedding and dirty (stained) towels..hotel employees playing pool during breakfast..employees look very unprofessional (seen one employee weaing sunglasses on back of his head)..front desk told us that the General Manager will contact us about our stay..never heard a word for the hotel..on checkout I had to ask for a receipt,was handed a paper with ""here"" (No thank you or anything)...planning on staying here? DON'T! Customer service is terrible at this hotel!",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Definitely doing something right,"We stayed here for one night before driving to Boulder for college move-in. Conveniently off the highway, I would definitely stay here again. Check in wasn't smooth for either of our rooms. The first one, after waiting in line for a while when I actually got up to the desk the older gentleman behind it said one minute and disappeared. Five minutes later I flagged down another member of staff to help me. Our other room it took 20 minutes to check in. I don't know whether this was due to incompetent staff or difficult guests. The only other issue we had was that it took us about 15-20 tries each time to get our key card to work in our door, and the people across the hall were having the same issue. Considering the hotel was completely full and has multiple Tripadvisor excellence awards, you would think they could afford to update their door key card system. Other than this, the rooms were well equipped, the bedding was extremely comfortable and free internet and breakfast can never go wrong. We didn't use the pool but it looked nice!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 days, room wasn't cleaned while I stayed there. There was a girl at the front desk that was helpful by the name of Dina. There was also another lady there by the name of Betty who would not shut up (motor mouth) if yo see her don't talk to her or you'll be there for at least a 10 minutes or more. But all in all the hotel was good and the other employees we very curtious.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Exactly as it says - a quality inn, great service and lovely staff","The Inn is really convenient, clean and well managed.Ample breakfast and very helpful staff. Clean.As the Inn is set slightly outside of the city there is plenty of parking available and a shuttle bus service. We made use of the bus service, the drivers were very helpful and collected us promptly after a quick phone call.Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Decent hotel, great staff","I needed a hotel close to downtown, as this was both a business & family trip. Upon check-in, I had to go to 3 different rooms before I ended up with a clean, non-smoking, pet friendly room. The 8th floor is reserved for ""pet-friendly"" guests...the hotel should NOT put anyone but guests with pets on this floor. With 30+ rooms on the floor, there is bound to be barking dog(s). With that said, Ivy was awesome - friendly, professional, knowledgeable & helpful. The hotel is lucky to have her. The beds were comfortable & the room did not have any odors. The hotel is dated, but clean & comfortable.The room keys seem to only work once - you have to return to the front desk to have it reprogrammed constantly. Ask for a bunch of keys so your chances to enter your room are greater. We had a housekeeper enter our room after telling her not to enter...Use the security locks when you are in the room. The ""hot"" breakfast was not very good. There's a Village Inn next door. Liked the outdoor pool. Good sun, clean. Not the ideal pool if you want to swim laps. PLUSES: location, Ivy, pet-friendly, lots of free parking, outdoor pool, large comfortable rooms, free wi-fi, quiet a/c.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Decent staff, everything else dissappointing","Firstly, I was placed in a smoking room and was denied when I asked to be moved.  The stench was among the worst I have had at any hotel, even compared to smoking rooms at similar level hotels. The carpets were stained, shower tiles were missing or loose, the bedding was mediocre at best. The front desk staff seemed overworked and overloaded--the check in counter is far too small and understaffed for a hotel this size.  Nevertheless, the workers were for the most part very friendly and helpful, albeit they were clearly in a rush to get through the line.  The shuttle drivers were also friendly and relatively helpful (especially considering many people stiffed them and failed to tip).  The ""hot"" breakfast was one of the saddest attempts I have ever seen.  Other than eggs, some sort of strange pork mixture, and a couple of waffle machines (which are too crowded to actually use), there isn't really anything hot.  With that said, there aren't many cold items as well--there is a loaf of bread next to a singular toaster, a container of canned fruit, and muffins.  Most hotels that provide a continental breakfast present a better (in terms of selection AND taste) spread than this.  The worst part is how crowded the breakfast is--there is virtually no space to sit, or move, or breath.  At least there is a Village Inn adjacent to the hotel--but this also happens to be the only restaurant near by.All in all, the value is ok but this hotel has definitely seen better days.  None of the amenities are really sufficient to be considered as part of the hotel value, but it could be worse.  I would never pay full price for this hotel, but luckily you can get it pretty cheap on priceline.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Enjoyed my stay,"I stayed here for 7 days and I really enjoyed my stay here at Quality Inn. The rooms were at a decent size and the staff were warm and welcoming. The food was delious, I would definitely stay here again.. .Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,helpful staff,"We came from Canada to bring our daughter to Colorado School of Mines.  The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful and went above and beyond what was expected.  They helped us find our way around the City, gave us information about sites to see and made us feel very at home in the hotel for our week-long stay.  The breakfasts were great and we enjoyed a swim in the pool each evening to relax.  Looking forward to stay there again when we come back to Denver to visit our daughter.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Hotel -- Need new Housekeepers!,"My friends and I stayed at this hotel on our trip to see a Rockies game -- couldn't ask for a better location to Coors Field (did not take the shuttle). The breakfast was phenomenal with biscuits and gravy, fajitas, eggs, etc. The property itself was well maintained (save one broken elevator - I would've preferred stairs!)Our only complaint was the housekeeping. We asked the front desk for towels TWICE, once at night and once in the morning and never received any for our 2 nights stay. Even though we had our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door, the housekeepers still came in and made the bed - they didn't leave towels either! We spoke to the front desk staff about the issue, but it was never resolved.Overall a great hotel. I will stay here again on my next trip to Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice Quiet Central Location,"Nice location close to the freeway exit. Shopping, restaurants and attractions are close by. Clean location and staff was very helpful and friendly. Beds were very comfortable and the room was well appointed. I would recommend this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Free Shuttle,Nice hotel with reasonable rates and hot breakfast. Nice warm outdoor pool in the sunshine.  The free shuttle to downtown is a very nice extra but expect to ride in a crowded van.  Will stay there the next time I am in Denver.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place to stay,"The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. A very nice breakfast, almost anything you would want. The GPS did not give us the right location but you could see the hotel from where it brought you to. I would stay there again if I were in that area.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,nice and large room,"The room was large and comfortable, with a micrwave and a fridge. The hotel was nice, people at reception too. Breakfast was average but you would always find something to eat. The shuttles to downtown were very handy. Will definitely stay again here if I ever come back to Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Staff,Stayed at the Quality Inn Central for 5 nights.Extremely friendly and helpful staff.  Ivy at the front desk is a stand out!   She helped me with directions into downtown Denver and fixed a price error at check in.  After that she greeted me cheerfully by name for the rest of my stayRooms were basic but clean and fairly quiet.  Breakfast was more than ample and staff kept the area clean and well stocked.    Parking is self park and free which is somewhat rare in the Denver area.  I appreciated the security in the lot at night because is was somewhat dark.Location is kind of industrial with not much around but the little family restaurant next door The village Inn is great for lunch.  They close at 3 pm I believe.As others have mentioned the construction does make it difficult to get to but I felt it was worth it and will probably be back.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,nice property,"But the approach to the hotel was a pain, due to the road construction. Also, there could be more in the way of restaurants nearby. The staff were great, even with them being full the night before I got there. I had some vehicle problems, and they were more than accommodating with the help I needed.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great stay,"My husband and I stayed here the first night of our vacation in Denver. It was a little tricky to get to driving at night and with multiple road closures that Google Maps was unaware of. However, once we were there it was worth it. The hotel is very nicely decorated and very cozy. Our room was a standard room, but very nice quality and clean. The free breakfast was delicious and the man at the front desk even allowed us to print our Rockies tickets for free. Very friendly and helpful staff. We would definitely stay here again when we come to visit next time.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Top value - a sleeper!,"Not a Ritz-Carlton (not that I've ever stayed in one!), but gets a hearty thumbs-up for its class.  Perhaps one of the nicest of the many Choice hotels I've stayed in, at a very modest price.  A word to the wise:  considerable road construction (long-term and on-and-off) in the area renders the printed directions useless or worse.  Call the hotel before you get close to get updated access information from I-70 or I-25.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Find another place to stay,"We stayed at this hotel to be closer to the airport for a morning flight. It was dreadful. My family of 3 arrived about 9pm to check in. Ivy at the front desk had two hotel employees to handle the requests of before it was our turn. One of the requests was for cups to be put out for coffee. Ivy said she'd be with us in a moment and went to put out cups although there weren't any people trying to get a cup. She came back to the desk area and continued to appear busy. Finally another clerk, Mariana, offered to assist us. She found my name in the system but although the reservation made and confirmed weeks before was for a room with two beds, all that they had for us was a king bed. A rollaway was offered (warning: these are not sleepable).We went to room 828 and immediately called the front desk because the room reeked of smoke. We were informed the 9th floor is a smoking floor so we could come back down for a different room. We were assigned 409 which had just been checked out of so should be freshly clean. We arrived at the room and it was in the middle of being cleaned. We waited in the hall for the maids to finish. They were very polite. Mariana did call the room to be sure we were okay. The only way to use a rollaway in the room is to wedge it between the foot of the bed and the dresser. We did that and had my 10 y.o. son try it. The rollaway was like laying on rocks so he ended up sharing the king bed with us. Needless to say, this was far from ideal.  We were at the end of the hall but the doors do not offer any sound barrier so we heard quite a lot of opening and closing of doors all night. Then at 6:20am the garbage trucks came to collect right outside of our window. Yay! Cleanliness was sporadic. The air return is so caked in dust and grime that it's truly a wonder it worked at all. The carpet seems very old, and while it appeared clean, it had that grimy, almost slick feeling when you walked in it. The bathroom, thankfully, was clean, though beware of chaotic temperatures in the shower. We tried the free hot breakfast. It was fine for what it was. Cold biscuits, probably frozen pancakes, fruit, scrambled eggs, something ham-like, and the usual morning drinks. The restaurant where they serve breakfast is also a bar/lounge in severe need of TLC. Checkout was easy and when asked about our stay, I explained it was awful. The morning clerks were nice and did remove $15 for ""satisfaction"" without my asking. I realize Quality Inns are going thru a revamp and rebranding these days, but if I had not also experienced a great stay at a Boulder location during this same trip, there is no way I'd ever consider another QI.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dirty hotel. Not worth the free shuttle.,"Scum on edges of the small pool and stuff floating in it. Someone apparently flush the toilet in Salt Lake City, & I got a hot and cold shower every night. Wifi up and down - 20 mins to connect and it wouldn't stay. The outside of the hotel is very run down. The rooms are dirty. The bathroom mirror has been glued back together. There were stains on the bedding, & a chunk of something? I tried to cancel my second night right after we arrived, but was not able to since I booked it with an advanced rate. I have stayed in a lot of hotels from this chain, and whenever I have requested a refrigerator and microwave, I have received one. They're usually accommodating when you're staying more than one night. In this case, the manager told me that I would have to pay for one and berated me for booking my room incorrectly then requesting things. I got upset and he then offered me a refrigerator OR microwave...I chose the microwave....and they never brought one. The rooms have paper thin walls. You can hear the ice machine, every door slam, TV's. Rough area of town near houses with bars on the windows and a railyard. Nothing nearby. Shuttle driver nearly merged into a car downtown and scared everyone. Turned left on a red light. The restaurant was handy and the waitress was nice - because of the location, most places will not deliver. There was a girl at the desk named Amanda and she was very nice and helpful.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nicest Quality Inn that we have ever stayed at!,"This was the nicest Quality Inn that we have ever stayed at. Stayed here for a Denver weekend with our 2 adult children. Nice room, clean, comfortable beds, hot breakfast, outdoor pool, restaurant, bar, free parking, noon checkout. Friendly, helpful staff. Good central location off of I-70 and near downtown. 20 minutes from the airport. I used my Choice Privileges points for this stay...very low number of points charged for this hotel. I would rate the hotel as a 3.5*. Very pleased with our stay...we will definitely stay here again when in Denver. A couple of ""must see"" attractions in Denver: Mount Evans (highest paved road in America) and the Museum of Science and Nature (one of the nicest museums that we have ever been to).",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Value!,"We recently stayed at this hotel because of its close proximity to Grizzley Rose where we were going to a show.  We chose it based on reviews and we were not disappointed.  The rooms were clean and comfortable. We met our friends at the Palm Grill Restaurant & Bar (located at hotel) and had dinner which was great. Then we jumped on the free shuttle that took us to the grizzley rose.  Shuttle usually runs until 10:00 but they extended the hours for this particular show and came and picked us up around midnight!  This hotel has a great spread for complimentary breakfast and free parking, which is hard to find in Denver. Many compliments to Raj the General Manager, he was very helpful and accommodating. Thanks and we will be back for sure :)",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice Stay,"We had a nice stay at this hotel. Friendly and helpful staff, we had a smooth check in. The rooms were clean. A nice swimming pool. Had a great spread at breakfast. And convenient shuttle service. Would definitely recommend to others.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very good location and quality price. Good service but old and poor rooms,"booked for a busnisess trip from April 8 to11-2013Very accomodating personnel on the front desk. The weather was extremely cold and the heat did not function conveniently. Another mobile heat unit was added to the room quickly. The rooms was ok, the whisteling of the wind was clearly heard despite closing the window along with the thick curtains. The navette between the hotel and downtown Denver  was very efficient. Excellent buffet breakfast included.  Free Wi Fi access  in the lobby and in rooms. Free  hot coffee on the front desk 24/24. Not much to do around the hotel. The best option was to use the hotel restaurant for supper. The hotel was basically clean, not more than this. It could be better.Speaking spanish would be asset, since most of the presonnel seems to be Hispanic.Good price quality.Basic, Old, acceptable if your business contacts are in the same area. Better skip if you are used to normal standards hotel.Above all. It was not that bad for my business trip.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Comfortable stay,"Great spread of food for breakfast. Check-in was fast and staff was friendly. Room was very comfortable and beds were comfy. Hotel was located a bit far from main drag (16th street) but you can drive near the main drag, park, and take the free shuttle bus up and down the 16th street.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good location with free shuttles in and out of Denver, but not a lot of hot water.","Good free* breakfast, very kind employees/ bar staff. Great bartender! The AC in the room was a little weak, but over all it's a solid place for any business traveler, but maybe not ideal for a family. The area around the hotel had a lot of road work, and some locations in the near area are a little suspect, but like I said before the shuttle takes care of all driving so you wouldn't have to worry about getting lost in the shuffle. The pool was clean and relaxing with clean towels everywhere to spare, same goes for their gym, which isn't the biggest but it does have a tv. There is also an arcade which was fun enough. There are many worse places to stay I'm sure and if your looking for cheep easy and convent location I'd reconomend the Quality Inn, absolutely.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Amazing stay,Had a lovely stay at this hotel. Check-in was a breeze to start off (very friendly staff). Rooms were neat and clean. Breakfast was delicious and got me through the day very well. And the pool topped it off. Overall will recommend to all my friends! =),5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,complaint,"I booked this hotel through Expedia and paid to Expedia for four nights. When checked out on 26 June, I asked the girl to check out for me. She unfriendly said I don't need to check out, since I have paid to Expedia. After return the UK, I found out I was double charged. I reinged back the hotel, the receptionlist told me they didn't change me definitely. So I worried someone else is sealing money from my account, I cancelled my credit. Aftter ringing HSBC credit many times, they are sure quality Inn took this money away. I ringed the hotel, they claimed they have refunded tis money to my previous credit card and email me a document. I ringed HSBC to check, they told me they didn't receive this money definitely. Now I don't know where has the money gone. I have spent a lot time to ring the hotel and the bank using international call, I really frustrated with what happening in Quality Inn Denver hotel!!! Other staff are very friendly in the hotel, but the giril at reception really need re-trainning. My problem is still not being solved!!! I appreciate hotel Manager could help solve this problem!!!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Kind of hard to find,Hotel was a little hard to get too.   Breakfast was so-so.   The restaurant food was nothing to rave about.  Slow service.    Rooms were ok.  They were stuffy.   Rooms do not come with microwave/refrigerator even though they were big enough for them.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A Great Place to Stay,"My son and I stayed at this Quality Inn during our yearly Father/Son trip.  Even though it's off the beaten path, they offer great perks.  We showed up several hours before check-in, but the front desk people were amazing.  They got us in a room ASAP and even up-graded us.  The beds were extremely comfortable and each bed had more than enough pillows.  They offer free WiFi and the free breakfast is a full breakfast.  They also offer a free shuttle that runs all day to anyplace you would like to go in the Denver area.  Once we got to the hotel, I parked my car and we used the free shuttle service and I didn't have to use my car again until we left to come home.  The staff bent over backwards to be friendly and assist us whenever we needed assistance.  I would highly recommend this hotel if staying in the Denver area.  They had the best room rates and even offer an AARP discount.  Thanks to the entire staff for making this part of our Father/Son trip so enjoyable.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst experience ever completely unprofessional.,"So me and a few friends who are traveling musicians and promoters were in Denver for a local music festival with a reservation I had made a month before our arrival and had called to confirm over 5 times. We had a room booked for 3 nights well after 2 nights we come back to our hotel were they tell us our room is unavailable and said we had only paid for 2 nights. Now this is where our hotel stay became a living hell. They show us a receipt saying we had only paid 204 dollars for 2 nights to stay through Dina the front desk woman, she also checked us in at 4 am on the computer and did not give us a receipt personally when we paid 320 dollars for 3 nights and checked in a midnight. We had to argue with a man for 2 hours in the front lobby at 3 am on how we paid and refused to pay for another night. He then told us to go ahead up to our room and we would discuss it in the morning with the manager We go to bed at around 5 Am after we had spent 11 hours at a festival and were exhausted. We are then woken up by people from the front deck walking in and out of our room while I am indecent and one of my friends!!!!! I was in my underwear and I had 2 men walk in and out my my room! Then after I finally woke up and got up they show up to my door and tell me to pay I begin to get extremely upset and say no they need to go figure it out or I will report to the BBB. This was the worst hotel ever! And I stay at a lot of hotels if you want the most ghetto unprofessional place in all of Denver go here, Crap food, crap room, crap service. Oh and another thing I wasn't compensated for my time and the [--] I had to go through. That employee stole my money and she better be fired! Don't go to this hotel!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,First Rate Hotel and Staff,"The Quality Inn Central Denver hosted us for our event to include over thirty rooms plus three suites. The Quality Inn Central Denver also catered lunches and dinners for four days. The staff was friendly, courteous, and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The location was very convenient for our Super Conference on the Family at the Denver Mart. The catered meals were arranged beforehand and they were very accommodating to the special dietary needs of some in our group. The Quality Inn Central Denver will certainly be top on our list for future events.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Bad location & bad housekeeping,"Terrible location in the industrial ghetto of Denver. It is right by train tracks with no restaurants, gas stations, or shops nearby.  At other hotels the rooms are serviced by early or mid afternoon. At this hotel, we would return late afternoon before dinner and our room would not be cleaned and we were greeted with our unmade beds and dirty towels. We had to request housekeeping service 3 days of our 5 day stay. And they would leave 3 towels for a family of 4. I wish I would have paid a few extra dollars per night for a nicer location and hotel. Our bedding had old stains from day 1, the bathroom was old, and the bathroom door didn't lock. There were also weird lumps under the carpet....overall not a very nice stay.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Avoid at all costs if you have asthma,"We requested non-smoking rooms when we booked our hotel, but when we checked in, our ""non-smoking"" room on our non-smoking floor reeked of smoke. We tried two more rooms (the last two non-smoking rooms they had), and both of them had been smoked in. One reeked of smoke, and the other had apparently at least had some sort of cleaning, as the level of smoke was not unbearable. The worst part, though, was the attitude of the front desk staff when I requested a different room (after politely explaining that I had asthma and that the rooms reeked of smoke). If you're a smoker, you'll probably have a fine stay at this hotel. But if you have asthma or need anything more than basic assistance from the front desk, stay somewhere else.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A good choice,It is right off I-70.  Took 10 minutes to get downtown to 16th street.  The front desk was very pleasant and helpful.  Rooms were very clean and good size.  The bathroom was clean with enough towels.  The breakfast was done well.  I would definately recommend staying here. Even tho you are close to Interstate the room was quiet.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Budget Choice ...,"My hiking partner and I stayed here en route north to Yellowstone National Park, and I was impressed.  The weekend rate was super-reasonable; the room was spacious and spotless; and the ""free"" breakfast was better than average.  I was underimpressed by the swimming pool, but it was clean and there were fresh towels available for pool use only.  Although only a few miles from Downtown Denver, the hotel is a bit off-the-beaten-track.  Our car GPS in fact put us at the Ramada Inn across the street, but once one learns the way, it is fairly easy to find.  I can't quite rate this a ""very good"" property overall, but it certainly met my needs well.  I'll go back again, I'm sure.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,good choice,"This was our second stay at the Quality Inn Central Denver, and overall we were very pleased, but we did wish that the breakfast choices included healthier options, specifically skim milk, whole wheat bread, and bran cereal. The only other issue was that wireless internet service was difficult to access except early in the morning when demand was low. On the positive side, our room and bathroom were spacious and clean, and the staff, including the shuttle driver, was very helpful.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,3 star hotel-good value,"The staff was fine.  The room was spacious and very quiet. The beds soft and comfy. Free wifi and parking. Location is in an industrial park just outside downtown with a free shuttle.  The free breakfast had many more choices than other free hotel buffets but it isn't exactly gourmet cooking either. The ice machine on the 6th floor was inop the entire time we were there.  And, I disagree with some of the other reviewers, the inside looks a little worn and is in need of a facelift.  Go to the 6th floor - Soiled,worn (not dirty) carpets, tile in the bathroom needing re-grouted, draperies worn, etc.BUT, the value (cost) far outweighs these few annoyances.  That's why I rate this a overall 4 and would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A Surprise,"The staff at The Quality Inn Central Denver were extremely pleasant and helpful. They dressed professionally, always greeted me with a smile, never acted frustrated with a request or question and made my stay a wonderful experience. My room was better than I expected. I also had the privilege of having some meals provided by the Quality Inn and each one was perfect.  The food staff went out of their way to make sure dietary needs were met.  Of course, breakfast each morning was wonderful - so much more extensive than the typical cold cereal, fruit and toasted cheap white bread! Thanks, Quality Inn for a great overall experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality Inn Central Denver,"We recently attended the CHEC conference and stayed at the Quality Inn Central Denver.  This hotel was a pleasure to stay in!  The common spaces are beautiful and the rooms we stayed in were immaculately clean and well maintained.  The staff are very friendly and professional, and act like they truly care about making your stay as nice as possible.  Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,We were VERY pleased with our stay!,"We stayed four days and three nights while putting on a VERY intense Conference with long hours!  The Quality Inn and it's owner went out of their way to accommodate us in every way!  They were friendly & attentive, the rooms were clean, the atmosphere inside was updated and nicely decorated.  They provided custom shuttle service to and from our event as well! :)  the elevators were speedy too!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Surpised!,"I had been at this property many years earlier, before it was a Quality Inn. I was happily surprised when I walked in. It was clean and very well remodeled! The rooms were clean as well as the halls and lobby. It had a wonderful breakfast as well as very nice meeting space for our group. The staff was excellent. They were very helpful. It is definitely a great stay for a small price.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The Best Family Hotel with Superior Service near the Denver Mart !,"My husband and I coordinate a Christian conference held at The Denver Mart each June, and were looking for a new hotel for our volunteer staff, their families and our conference guests to stay during the conference. We could not have been more pleased with The Quality Inn Central Denver. The hotel has been there since 1972, but upon entering the lobby you would never guess it was over 40 years old. They have remodeled the entire hotel top to bottom. The lobby is beautiful, the ballroom that held all of our staff and their families for lunch and dinner was large and very nice, there are 4 elevators so you will not lose time waiting, the rooms are well appointed with very comfortable beds, plenty of great pillows and lovely bedding. I did not hear any noise from the area outside of the hotel, and the rooms all have thermostats on the walls rather than noisy window air conditioners like at some other hotels. It makes for a very restful night's sleep. There is also a small conference room, workout room (that doesn't look like a closet), game room, great hot breakfast buffet and fabulous outdoor pool. This all sounds wonderful, but I have not gotten to the best part. The staff at The Quality Inn Central Denver is above and beyond the most welcoming, gracious, helpful, professional staff I have ever dealt with in all my travels in the US and abroad. They truly want you to feel completely at home. They dress and behave completely professionally, but are not stuffed shirts or aloof like many hotel managers. Their operations manager even helped serve us our lunch and dinner while donning an apron and treating everyone as if they were in his own family bistro.The food was delicious, too, by the way. Oh, if you eat gluten free or have any dietary restrictions you cannot beat the Quality Inn. They served, bar none, the best gluten-free breads, pastas, and desserts I have had. This is no small feat! Honestly, I did feel at home. We work very long hours with the conference, and it was wonderful to ""come home"" each night to the General Manager, Mr. Prasad, and his staff's welcoming hotel. We look forward to next year, and staying with them again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Coming up short on a few things....,"I rated a 3 but I really feel like a 3.5 would be better suited for this hotel. I recently spent four nights at the Quality Inn Central, the hotel as a few strong points but comes up short in my opinion. The good; free parking, free breakfast, free (FAST) wifi, free shuttle, great employees, hot shower every time (except the ""H"" really meant cold and the ""C"" really meant hot water in the shower... room 723 please fix that or your guests are in for some rude awakenings). The bad; no ice maker... seriously? They had a cooler in the lobby where you could scoop ice into a bag and bring it up to your room. Another thing I found annoying was that the pool was located on the west side of the building so it didn't receive any sunlight in the morning hours. The ugly; the whole interior of the hotel. Seriously, this place is in desperate need of a facelift. New carpeting, fresh paint and a new comforter would really make it aesthetically pleasing. We had taken advantage of the free shuttle to downtown twice during out stay. I was a little annoyed because when I called before booking the hotel the front desk told me ""it will take you any place within a five mile radius except residential areas"" in actuality it stops at about a dozen hot spots in the city. On Saturday night it took about 40 mins from the time of calling to have the shuttle pick us up at the designated spot, the following night we stayed out past the shuttle hours and took a cab back. It was a $16 fair for two from downtown. I think it's important to point this out because using the shuttle saved us about $50 give or take.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Quality Inn Central in Denver, is the best!","I had the pleasure of staying at the Quality Inn in Denver for about 4 nights. Daniel at the front desk made sure my boyfriend and I had everything we needed for our stay. The staff was very accomadating and the rooms were great. Theres even a pool, a game room and a fitness center. Oh and free breakfast! but, make sure you leave a few dollars for the hard working employees that set up the breakfast and clean up after your free meal. Everyone here was great and I would recomend this hotel to anyone. Keep up the good work!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Perfect Hotel for Family and Business,It was business cum family trip this time. Stayed in this hotel for 3 days with my wife and 2 teen aged kids. We are very satisfied with everything.  Very close to Denver Downtown and Convention Center. We enjoyed free shuttle service everyday to go to Downtown and Convention Center. Hotel is conveniently located close to I-25 and I-70 ( 2 National Highways) intersection. Hotel was very clean from top to bottom. Rooms are perfect. Customer Service is awesome. Kids had enjoyed the swimming pool and game rooms all day long. Internet connection is also very good. Free Hot Breakfast buffet is the best for this standard of hotel. Restaurant food for dinner was reasonably priced and very good. We thoroughly enjoyed our entire stay. We are highly satisfied. Thanks to everyone associated with service and management.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Biggest bang for your buck.,"So my girlfriend and I stayed here for a couple nights and were not disappointed. You get a full breakfast buffet each morning and the rooms are very big. There is also free wi-fi. The rooms were cheap and we were comfortable. I have to say that, for what you pay for (as it is no 5 star hotel), you get more than what you paid for in return. The location isn't great as you need to drive like 15 minutes to the city center and you might feel a little uneasy parking your car in the parking lot at night where it doesn't seem to be very well lighted. But other than this, the breakfast buffet is great and the rooms are big and clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody. The value of what you're getting for what you paid for is second to none.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Comfortable,"Hospitality and comfort is the two most important qualities we look forward to and expect from a hotel,we experienced that right away,as soon as we checked in.Hospitality at the front desk (very pleasant staff)and comfortable room.Our needs were met,always!!BREAKFAST IS AN EXTRA BONUS!We recommend this hotel to anybody,family trip or business,Quality Inn is your place.(Elizondo family)",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,It used to be a nice place,"This is the 4th time we have stayed here. When we come to Denver, we have never thought about staying at another hotel. until now. We will never stay here again, unless they get new management. Corporate Lodging takes care of our hotel reservations. This is the 13th day of 14. It started out they didn't have our reservations, we finally got that straightened out. We got to the room, we loved the view. That is where the good stops. We told them when we checked in we would be here for 2 wks. On the 13th day, they tell us about 3pm. to pay for the room or get out. I told him we are suppose to be here for 14 days.The GM tells me we have stayed 4 hrs. over checkout, that he will give me 5 mins. to bring credit card down or he will send someone up to the room to help pack our things and put them on the sidewalk. My husband got hold of the Company he works for and they faxed over the form for the 14th night. They faxed it 3 times before they finally got it. We are not the only ones complaining, we talked to several people, that the front desk were rude to them. To top it off we were going thru the lobby to get to the elevators, all 3 were down. We asked where the stairs were, the girl at the front desk didn't know where they were. We finally found the stairs, we had to climb the stairs to the 9th floor. We will never stay there again.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great hotel - clean - perfect if you are going to a baseball game,"Clean, friendly and efficient. We stayed here for one night whilst going to a baseball game at the Denver stadium, and the hotel laid on a free shuttle bus to take us and other guests to the game. They also offer a free shuttle pick up service from various places in Denver. The hotel room was spacious and clean. The signs in the hotel led me to believe there was an indoor pool, but on closer inspection they directed me to the outdoor pool, which was not yet open (in May). Breakfast was ok - shame that the hotel uses paper plates and plastic cutlery. Get there quickly, before all the hot food and waffle mixture is gone. Would recommend staying here for a couple of nights, especially if you are going to a baseball game.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Needs updating and one of the more disappointing choice hotels we have been too,"We stay almost exclusively at choice hotels for the free breakfast and consistant rooms.  The first non-smoking room wreaked of cigarette smoke and they immediately moved us to another room which was great service.  The receptionist even came to the new room rather than making us come back down.  The room itself needed updating, but overall was a typical room and bathroom.  The TV was not working properly and I was too tired to call down to the front.  The breakfast was mediocre at best missing some of the normal ammenities choice hotels have like fresh fruit, granola, hard boiled eggs, and other items we are used to seeing.  They seemed to be full which make me wonder why they haven't bought new bedding and updated the hotel a little.  I can think of several other choice hotels that far exceed this one and are just as close to downtown.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,5 star service on a budget,"I was beyond happy with our night at Quality Inn. We were in town for the Colfax Marathon and from the moment we walked into the lobby I was impressed. Everything was spotless, including the parking lot. The employees at the desk were very friendly as were every other employee we encountered. Our room was immaculate and all the bedding, curtains, shower curtain, etc looked to be new, crisp, and clean. Even the floor around the base of the bed and behind the dresser was clean. (normally those areas don't get vacuumed very well) The hotel was completely booked up yet we never heard any noise from the other rooms. We were a little concerned at first with the hotel being so close to the highway that we would hear the traffic, but again, we didn't hear anything. While my husband was running the marathon my kids and I went down for the breakfast buffet. The food was pretty typical, but good. The lady that was working the breakfast area was very attentive and came by often to take any empty plate and asked if we needed anything. After breakfast we took the free shuttle from the hotel to the marathon area. There was tons of traffic and  roads were blocked for the race yet our drive was wonderful and got us as close as he could even though it took him a little longer. He could've just dropped us off on the main road and had us walk, but he took his time and made sure we knew exactly where we were going. We ended up checking out about 20 minutes late and they didn't even blink and eye. So exceptionally friendly.  We have definitely found our hotel of choice for when we are in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Would rate 3-1/2 stars,"My husband and I enjoyed our six night stay. Great welcome by Amanda, very efficient, very nice, at front desk. We met other front desk staffers, Steve, and Hotel Mgr.Hamid Hursan. Everyone on staff was helpful and pleasant. We rode the Q.I.'s free shuttle to downtown once, easier than fighting traffic and/or parking. Our king size bedded room, 219, was at the end of a second floor hall, quiet, away from ice and elevators. Bedding looked and felt new, very comfortable. Was a hotel/car pkg. deal at Expedia, and was as booked. Our non-smoking room was a good size. Housekeeping was fine. The whole second floor was nonsmoking, and no cigarette odor in the hotel was noticed, except outside, where smoking is designated at 25 feet away from hotel. We reported a couple of minor items in our room needed attention, and staff responded quickly. Hotel Mgr.Hursan learned that we didn't find sugar free syrup for waffles at the (included) buffet breakfast. He presented us with a new bottle, said to keep it in our room, and use for breakfast.  Coffee, tea, iron and ironing board was in our room.Two computers for public use are in the lobby, and free wifi in rooms. There were some areas of our room, and public areas of the hotel, which are in need of updating, painting, etc. It is not a five-star but we were not expecting this, and were not paying five-star prices. So, we were satisfied with the hotel overall. It is located in an industrail area, but only about ten minutes from Denver downtown. We visit Denver family periodically, and would stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The worst staff performance,"I could not check in on May 7, 2013, because their shuttle did not show up for almost 2 hours. They charged me and refused to refund.I booked to check in on 5/7/13, and made an appointment for shuttle pick-up. A shuttle (small van) came after about an hour, but it was full so my sister and I could not fit in. The driver told us that the next shuttle will come in 10 minutes. After another hour of wait in the rain, I called the hotel, and Mariana at the reception told us to wait more. Due to the rain, temperature, and 30 hours of train ride right before that night, we were getting hypothermic and sick, so we searched for a different nearby hotel that had a vacancy. I called Quality Inn and asked Mariana at the reception if we can cancel our reservation and get refunded because we can no longer wait out in the rain. She transferred my call to her supervisor, who told me that she will take a note of our situation for HER supervisor to process the refund the next day, and told me to call back and ask for Steve. I called Quality Inn the next day, and spoke to Steve (Mariana’s supervisor’s supervisor), who insisted that he can't refund our money simply because we didn't show up. He told me that he will ask Mariana and investigate this and get back to me the next day, but they did not respond until I had to file a complaint with Better Business Bureau. Yet, Steve’s response is a 25% refund. I cannot accept this as a resolution. It is very unprofessional for them to make us wait in the rain for almost 2 hours, and cancel our reservation yet refuse to refund us for the night we could not stay due to their issues. First, they lied to me about the shuttle schedule, second, they (Mariana’s supervisor) lied to me about it being okay to cancel my reservation and falsely promised a refund if I speak to a different supervisor Steve, third, they lied to me about investigating this and getting back to me with a resolution, and finally, they unjustifiably took my money for the night I did not stay. This isn’t simply a complaint about their shuttle service or a refund for the cancellation, but a complaint about their staff performance in general and a compensation for their misleading, unprofessional and fickle way of treating their customers. My VISA card was charged $106.32 on May 1, 2013 and I want a full refund.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,it's all about the people,"I was stranded in Denver having booked another hotel online sight unseen. I ran away from the place as quickly as I could. Luckily I spotted a shuttle going to the Quality Inn in Central Denver.  Kelly, the driver was kind enough to call ahead and I arrived to find Ivy had already taken care of the booking. During my stay I was helped by Daniel, Amanda, Nancy and last but not least Steve who is one of the managers. There's a sincere vibe that comes across in the way they go about making their guests feel at home. I couldn't  have possibly asked for more in regards to their kindness and courtesy. I ran into some personal problems while there and they helped me in every way they could. I definitely recommend this hotel. In my opinion Quality Inn scores the highest in all aspects of their niche in the industry but again, it's all about people like Ivy that make it speciaL I'm grateful to have met them all and look forward to my next stay. Next time I'll bring the wife and kids.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,In desperate need of help.,"I recently stayed at the Quality Inn Central Denver for one night because all other hotels were booked in and around downtown.  Thankfully we had other options for the rest of this trip.  Let me start with the positives.  The staff at check-in and check-out were very friendly and helpful.  And it is a quick cab ride to downtown.  And that is where the positives end.  This hotel needs a facelift in a terrible way.  The lobby is small and out of date with only a handful of places to sit.  The room we stayed in smelled bad.  It had horribly old carpet with stains.  The comforter was scratchy and looked about 10 years old.  The windows were filthy and so old that the freeway noise poured in.  Breakfast selection was mediocre at best.  Our toilet didn't flush properly.  And to top it all off, the shower had no hot water...at night or in the morning.  We brought this to the attention of the manager and he lowered our bill for us.  Still, I would not recommend this hotel and will never stay here again.  There are many other good options in Denver.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Less $$ then the Quality Inn at the airport,"We were originally booked for the Quality Inn at the airport.  We looked a little further out (aprx 30min) and found this hotel.  Service was good the breakfast was welcomed.  We arrived at about 8pm and the woman running the restaurant fixed us up with a nice sandwich.  It hit the spot after a long trip.  Room was nice, no complaints.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"""Quality"" Inn? You could do better!","Just stayed at the Quality Inn Central Denver for one night.This hotel has certainly seen better times and would desperately need a refurbishment.We had a queen room facing Denver downtown. You can hear the traffic on the freeway 24/7 which is really annoying. The carpets had lots of stains, the furniture looked really old and worn and the ceiling had dirt spots. Not what you would expect for a rate of USD 100.00 per night!Based on these circumstances, we would certainly NOT stay here again.On the positive side, however, the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately that could not prevent the bitter taste we acquired during our stay.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Amazing Stay!!,"We flew to Denver from NY on May2nd and had an amazing stay at Quality Inn. My fiance and I were going to meet his birth family for the first time and chose this hotel to stay. The rooms were great and we had an amazing view. We were there early and our room was not ready. Steve Budson ""Office Manager"" made sure we were able to check in early and was very friendly. We loved the staff and Steve remembered us by name which is unheard of. The breakfast was hot and sooo good!! We will definitely stay again next time we travel to Denver!! Excellent service by all! Thank You Quality Inn for making our stay so nice.Keep up the great work Steve and staff!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,3.5 Stars,"We stayed 3 nights for $80/nt incl all taxes.  I have mixed feelings. The location is right off  70W/25N, which is great if you're traveling through.  But it's an industrial area with only a Village Inn next door, which closes at 3. The hotel, though, does have a restaurant.   The hotel offers a free shuttle to many area attractions, but not the airport.  Staying here, then, necessitates a car unless you want to feel stranded.Staff is very helpful.  Even though the rooms do not come with microwaves, a night staff person happily heated my microwavable dinner in the staff kitchen.The hotel is old, but they are trying to update with a welcoming lobby, gorgeous elevators (!!), and nice carpeting. Our room was quiet with 2 beds, armoire, table/2 chairs, easy chair, and vanity area with coffee maker. The extra vanity with mirror was nice, even without a sink.  The bathroom was dated with a cracked sink and cracked tiles, but everything worked fine.  Everything was kept very clean.Wifi is spotty.  Sometimes it worked; one night we could not get anything,  but the next morning, it was fine.  If you must have access, two computers are off the lobby with limited free printing.The free breakfast was the best we've ever had. Served in the restaurant, the area is large.  Eggs, bacon, tortillas and refried beans, biscuits/gravy, real oatmeal (not packets), cold cereals, breads and pastries, fresh fruit mixture, and waffle maker.  Negatives: only orange juice and only whole milk.Could you do better in Denver?  Most likely, but you'd pay more. We were not dissatisfied.  It's just that the $80 was on the high side for our exclusively ChoiceHotel 10-day vacation in Colo/Utah.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Always a pleasure to stay,"As a frequent guest of this property, I always look forward to my stay. I am always greeted with a smile from front desk clerks Daniel, Ivon, and Betty. Check in is quick and warm and friendly. Management as well. Great restaurant and clean facilities. Couldn't ask for a better staff. Its home away from home for me.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Waste of money,The internet was too slow and sometimes dont work at all. I had to call multiple times to get hot water in the shower. Pool was closed when I was there. Breakfast is good. Free Parking is nice. Okay for a stay for a day or two if you dont use internet. Stay away if you need good internet or gonna stay for more than 2 days.,2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good and Bad,"We decided to stay at the Quality Inn because of its close proximity to Regis University and the reasonable price.  The first night of our stay was quite nice - very quiet, clean, nice staff, decent breakfast.  When we came back to the hotel after visiting the Regis campus the next day, we found a lobby full of middle school and high school age children checking in.  From that moment on, we did not have one moment of peace.  These groups of kids seemed to have little to no adult supervision and were left to terrorize the 6th floor.  The noise was unbelievable!  The kids congregated in the hallway around midnight for a pizza party, and no adult was in site.  We repeatedly called the front desk, and they would send someone up to investigate but the noise would just get worse the moment their staffer left.  It started up again at 6:00 a.m. with about 20 kids in the hallway, slamming doors, and screaming.  When we called the front desk again we were offered a change of rooms which would not have helped since we already endured a sleepless night and were getting ready to leave.  When we checked out, we were offered a 20% discount on one of our two rooms which really didn't make us feel much better about our stay.Since our daughter will be at Regis for the next several years, after the first night we were certain this would the place for our family and friends to stay when we came to visit.  After the second night, I am not so sure.  I could not understand why nothing could be done about the noise!  If the kids were not screaming in their rooms and hallways, you could hear them screaming outside if the parking lot.  Shame on the so called adult chaperones who allowed this to happen, and I was surprised that no one working at the hotel could get it to stop either.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Horrible!!,"This place is a joke! The rooms are old, nasty, and smelly. This Hotel is located in the worst ghetto and industrial area! A customer’s car was stolen from the parking lot and the staff did nothing to help him. Our shower was dirty and no warm water or heat in our room. They really need to renovate this old building. I wouldn’t recommend staying at this Hotel as there are many nicer Hotels outside Denver for the same price, but better quality!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,awful experience.,"My group just returned from a 2-night stay here - if I could give this less than a 1 out of 5, I would.Pros: The beds were comfortable and the rooms were a nice size with decent views of the front range.That's it..seriously.Cons: - Our keys didn't work to get in to our rooms. After a long day, I don't want to sit there running the card 30 times trying to open the door.- When we checked in (at 330pm), one of our two rooms wasn't cleaned.- Located in a awful neighborhood with nothing within walking distance.And the worst part of our stay -  we had the unfortunate of staying here during 4/20 weekend and the cannabis cup. I was indifferent on pot prior to this weekend...However, we stayed on a NON-SMOKING floor, in a non-smoking room...and our hotel was literally hotboxed. It was so bad that there were clouds of smoke leaking in under our door and through our bathroom vents. The hallways were constantly in a haze, and the smell was unbearable. Now, whatever, pot is legal in CO - but, if you have a non-smoking floor, make it non-smoking everywhere. If I got caught smoking my cigarettes in the room/floor, I would have been thrown out - this should be the same for the potheads. The security present wasn't doing a damn thing about this, instead we watched them walk in to the rooms and join in. When we needed a ride on the free shuttle to downtown, all of the staff at the front desk were bickering and being all-around unprofessional; then, to make matters worse, our shuttle driver was either drunk or high (or both?). We all thought we weren't going to make it safely to downtown. When we tried to express our unhappiness to the front desk, they completely ignored us (with the exception of one woman - whose name I can't remember - and was obviously pissed about the situation).The free breakfast was probably the best part of our stay, and that consisted of watered down orange juice, stale biscuits, and rubbery, awful eggs. The highlight of our stay was leaving the hotel. One member of our group opted to hang out at the airport for an extra 5 hours, just to get the f*** out of this hotel. I understand that this hotel may not be like this in the absence of a pot convention, however the customer service we received was absolutely terrible. The amount of guests not part of the pot convention had to exceed or at least equal the amount that were part of it, and we  shouldn't have been forced to be subjected to their ""lifestyle"". The unprofessional attitude along with the rest of the experience at this hotel makes me not only not ever want to stay at this location again, but I won't ever book a quality inn again either. Save your money and your sanity - go somewhere else!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Excellent Hotel, Great Value, Wonderful Staff!","We came to Denver on one of the busiest weekends for the city. Every hotel was booked to capacity including Quality Inn Central Denver. When we arrived we were assisted by an awesome front desk employee, Daniel, who made sure everything was perfect even though the hotel was very busy at the time. He was very friendly and helped my wife and I get aquainted with the local area. Overall our expierience was as outstanding as the service at Quality Inn Central Denver, especially Daniel at the front desk.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Needs some renovation,"Hotel has a good price quality ratio, and is relatively close to the centre, although not really easy to reach by car the first time. Service is friendly and breakfast buffet is very good for the type of hotel. The heating system in the room had difficulties heating to a decent level, and the tiles in the shower were loosing the color with the water from the shower. Also the carpeting would need renewing. Apart from these flaws, I would still recommend the hotel for a low cost accomodation",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great choice!,"I can absolutely recommend this hotel. It's very valuable and you get more than you expect! The rooms are clean and spacious, have refrigerator and microwave. The staff is very helpful and there is a complimentary coffee the whole day. Internet runs quickly. We really liked the hot breakfast, wow, every hotel should have this! We also appreciated the bar with reasonable prices and small game room. But best of all, the shuttle service to close locations makes this hotel a great choice in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellant Value,"This hotel is a great value for the money.  It is well kept and has a feeling of very expensive hotel without having to pay the money.  Beautiful decorating!  Friendly staff.  We had a problem with the TV and within minutes they had somebody in our room to fix the problem.  The hot breakfeast buffet was great, lots of choices and clean.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Value Near Downtown,We were quite pleased with our stay at the Quality Inn Central Denver. Rooms were clean. Front Desk was profesional and friendly. We got an excellent rate so I would rate the value as high. Plenty of free parking. It is located in an industrial area just outside of downtown but it is easy to get on the freeway and be downtown in 10 minutes even with traffic. The breakfast was a bit limited. This was probably the only negative. I would certainly stay here again if visiting Denver.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Better than expected save one detail,"I originally had booked another hotel. They made a mistake and there were no usable rooms.I called this hotel and got a great rate and a usable room.The hotel seemed to be undergoing some future updates so it seemed a little dated and not filled at all. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel staff amenable and friendly. It seemed to me that a transition had happened and few knew of this hotel which may be why it wasn't filled.The only glitch was with the computer. It kept kicking the cards back saying we had checked out or had not booked further nights. It did this twice. Once as we arrived about 12:30 AM after being out visiting family. The computer had not booked day 2 and on. I had to go down to the lobby to get this corrected. The last night, the same thing happened. The computer locked us out at midnight and our 1 am arrival was met with another trip to the front desk. We liked the size of the room and the convenience of the location and did not have any other problems.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Value,"This hotel is older but has been updated in many areas.  The lobby, elevators, and restaurant all appear to have recent upgrades.  Our room had a flat screen TV, nice beds and a updated bathroom.  Overall, everything in the room seemed modern, except that the outlets and switches looked like they were forgotten in the upgrade process.  They all worked fine, but they looked like they've seen years of use.The location is not ideal, but not bad.  I would describe it as “light industrial”.  Restaurants and stores were about a 1.5 mile walk one way.  If you don't want the exercise, they have a free shuttle service that works well.  The shuttle got us to Amtrak fast and on time.  The breakfast was very good.  It had a nice selection of hot food plus the typical waffles, cereal, and other usual hotel breakfast stuff.  The exercise room was adequate and well maintained.  It doesn't have a treadmill, but it had two other aerobic machines plus weight machines.  Pool was closed for the winter.  Wireless internet was free and worked well.  The front desk staff was friendly and helpful.  The value for the price paid was good.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Family Getaway to Denver,"I've read the other reviews and I will concede that the hotel is a little older, but it's not that bad. We had a few issues (temp of the room and smoking on a non-smoking floor), but once addressed with the front desk they were resolved immediately. The breakfast was really good!! My daughter and I loved the arcade. The restaurant on site has really good burgers. For the price and the second to none customer service, my family and I will be staying here next time we visit Denver. I also did notice the award plaques hanging on the walls from Trip Advisor for the past 2 years (well deserved!),.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good hotel in industrial area but close to town,"Stayed here two occassions at beginning and end of roadtrip.Showing its age a little, but well maintained with only minor issues.Ice machine on our floor was broken for both nights of our visit.Had minor issues with room keys not working and needing replacement, which was done promptly. Staff went above and beyond to help look after medication that needed to be kept at constant refridgerated temperature.Rooms nicely decorated - good tv, bathrooms well fitted out.Had two rooms for our group on both visits, and all the rooms were very clean.For a free breakfast, the included breakfast was very good.Staff always helpful when we asked for directions and recommendations for activities.Local area was very industrial with limited (almost nonexistant) dining opportunites, but downtown Denver only a few miles away.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worest stay ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When I checked in my bed looked like someone had just gotten out of it. and the room was filthy. MY second room was hot like a sauna and the staff gave us a fan which of one that did not work. The hot water would not come on. It is horrible to take a shower and in the middle it is ice cold water. The second room's mni fridge did not work. We were finally on our third day of being there put into a third room which was fine. I will not be staying at this hotel ever again.,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Started bad, ended great!","The first night was miserable! A balmy room with a temp in the 80s, no airconditioning. When I called to report it, the desk lady advised me to turn the thermostat off and open the window. Ok, that could work considering it is winter...except the window only opened about 3 inches. We left to go downtown and a few hours later the temp had only dropped inside the room a couple of degrees. 10 hours later, sweating and sleep deprived I went downstairs to express my complaint.  The manager hadnt arrived yet but the kind desk lady on duty imediately took action by moving us to an upgraded room. For the next couple of days she checked on us constantly. We never had another issue during our stay. The free hot breakfast was great and the free shuttle saved us a ton of money in what we eould have paid for cabs and/or parking downtown. An older hotel needing upgrades, but for the money it was an all around great experience!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,It'll Do - Friendly People in an older hotel,"Booked this for 3 days through a combo air-hotel site, no regrets.This is an older hotel that's had some refurbs but could use some more. Room was clean and large with flat-screen, nice bath area, firm bed, sofa and chair. Fabris on sofa-chair was a bit old but okay. I requested a micro-fridge which were promptly delivered at no extra charge. The AC/Heater controls were limited (fan speed only) and because temps varied dramatically while I was there, this was a minor issue - I opened the window to regulate it. Very good water pressure and plenty of hot water. LOCATION - be aware that this is near downtown (a mile north) in an industrial area, very close to the intersection of I-70 and I-25. Access isn't bad if you know how to get there (48th St or Pecos St exit). However, there isn't much around here. I found a fabulous Italian Restaurant (Patsy's) that's about a mile away (easy to get to), and there's a 7-11 a short drive away, but nothing within walking distance. I had a rental car so I could move around, but the hotel offers a shuttle service that will take patrons downtown and other nearby points.Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Breakfast was above average - very good ham and eggs -  with seating in the large regular restaurant area (didn't try lunch or dinner, menu looked limited but okay).Given the price and overall level of service, I'd stay here again.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Help in a time of need,"This hotel has been recently renovated. At the I-70 & I-25 interchange, they stepped up to provide clean and affordable lodging when our reservations at a higher priced chain were mistakenly dropped. The neighborhood is a bit ""industrial"" but the hotel itself was fine. The free hot breakfast included with the room cut food costs for our team and the help was great. This is a mid priced chain but the staff are equal to and exceed many high end chains. Thanks Quality Inn Central Denver!!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Hotel and staff,Booked for 6 nights and so glad i did.  Daniel at the front desk is a great asset to the place. He made time to get us in early after long flight and time change.  Our room was great until the 3rd night then it leaked in one spot but no big deal. 4th night came back and 2 spots but they was already in the works of changing rooms for us. I cant blame the hotel for mother nature's work at hand.  Breakfast is great except they need yogurt.  Very clean and all the staff is very helpful and polite.  Only downside we found was the cafe inside is not good. We ordered the first night and never again. We couldnt even eat what we ordered.  Eat next door at the Village Inn for excellent food.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don't bring your kids here!  (oh yeah...and the pot smell),"First, this is NOT someplace for kids.  Convenient to downtown but very questionable industrial neighborhood.  Vehicle security is questionable at best.  Security minivan parked out front but I've never actually seen the security guard.  Packs of kids hanging around parking lot in Summer plus frequent presence of attractive young women checking in alone (but accompanied by extreme age range men at breakfast) and paying cash.  You draw your own conclusions.  Even desk clerk acknowledged it as common.  Biggest issue is overpowering marijuana and lemon cleaner smell in the 9th floor smoking rooms.  Since the passage of Colorado's new marijuana laws (legalization under 1 ounce) this is starting to be a noticeable issue throughout the state but these rooms were far and away the worse I've experienced.  I'm on high dose pain killers and was exhausted when I checked in (very late) and still found it nearly impossible to fall asleep due to the muggy, overpowering smell in the room.  Hotel is older and the rooms are increasingly becoming in need of remodeling.  Carpets are worn and dirty and walls need re-papered in many of the rooms I've stayed in.  Beds are comfortable at least but hotel maintenance staff seems oblivious to even major discrepancies in rooms.  I'm a Choice gold member and after 12 years in the Marines, even I have found this place less and less tolerable to stay in.  Stayed here numerous times but doubt I will do so again.  At least not until they at least deal with the marijuana issue and preferably do some renovations. To many better choices if you need proximity to downtown.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place to stay in Denver,"Location was convenient but even better since they operate a free shuttle to destinations within 5 miles!  (took us to dinner on 16th Street Mall & picked us up) Rooms large & Comfortable - well lit mirrors outside of bathroom.  Nice view of downtown Denver.  Complimentary breakfast buffet was good, everyone friendly.  Excellent price. (included Breakfast & Wireless access)  We enjoyed our short getaway & will definitely use this hotel next time we visit Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,I would stay here again,"Quality Inn is very good in general, but this particular location is at the top tier of this price range of hotels. The staff is amazing, the rooms are clean and comfortable, and the price can't be beat. There is a very good breakfast as well. I have absolutely no complaints about this place.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice stay...,"I spent 2 nights in quality inn for a quick vacation in Denver with friends.Hotel is well located, close to Downtown with 10 min drive. Generally the hotel is well maintained, rooms were clean and spacious for a very reasonable price and with simple complementary breakfast which was an advantage. Staff were kind and helpful. only two negative points: the room were noisy since the hotel is close to the highway yet was able to sleep, and the WiFi was so poor.otherwise all went fine. so I recommend.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very Accomodating!!!,"We stayed here during the National Western Stock Show.  Given the high volume of guests, the staff did a wonderful job!!  A full, delicious breakfast was available everyday.  The rooms were large and very clean.  Extra towels and housekeeping service were readily offered.  The shuttle was prompt.  The hotel is somewhat difficult to access from the interstate but is perfect if u need to be near the Colliseum.  We will absolutely continue to stay here during the Show.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The best breakfast and most caring staff,This is my second time stay at this hotel and yet again most satisfying stay. Visiting almost after a year or so and I find still the same caring staff. Nice clean rooms and comfortable sleepI am really surprised to see the buffet breakfast just like a five star hotel menu and comes complimentary with room. Excellent work by the management team.Raja you deserve a pat on your back and thanks for the shuttle at such a short notice.I will recommend this hotel very strongly to all the visitors coming to Denver. Very conveniently located near downtown with free shuttle to downtown.Will see you guys next year,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Shabby and out-of-date,"Although clean, and with a helpful staff, this place has seen better days and they were long ago. Although room was on a non-smoking floor, the room smelled like it had only been a non-smoking room for a short period of time. Carpets and drapes must be replaced when converting a smoking hotel to a non-smoking one! Overall the room and hotel were shabby and old. The ""Fitness"" center was sad. We were impressed to see that there were eggs available for breakfast, but that was about it, canned fruit, super weak coffee and waffles were all that was available. And the restaurant was just sad. Empty bottles of Sutter Home do not make for lovely decorations. Location is very dismal with no restaurants very close by, although we picked it because of its ease of access to the the highways.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Homely customer service,"The customer service is just excellent. You find friendly smiles everywhere. Very helpful people. Betty and River Anne were fanstatic. They went all out to help. Hotel also has shuttle van to Downtown Denver. Very convenient.  Cheers, WeiYew Liew",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Stay,Stayed here for a few days last month. Hotel was clean. Front desk staff was nice and well informed about the area. Wireless internet wasn't very good. That was a little irritating. They have a restaurant and bar. Small but nice. I would stay here again Got a good rate when we called.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great,"Hotel is a little older, but the staff is so amazing they make up for it!  Bed was great comfortable and warm. The breakfast alone is worth the stay! Again I can not say enough about how nice, friendly, and helpful the staff was. We will definitely stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Busy Hotel, Average Stay","My stay at this Quality Inn my not reflect other folks visits.  During my stay there was a rock & gem show taking place at this hotel.  Tents took over much of the hotels parking lot, and the hotel was very busy, and seemed very understaffed.  Here's my review..Check-in was a bit slow, due to several people checking in as I arrived around 6:30pm.  The hotel lobby and first floor can really use a re-freshening, too many dark areas.  Across from the front desk is a restaurant and a separate bar, they both were very busy during my entire stay.  Parking the car in the hotels free parking lot was a chore, I found the only empty spot.  But I'm sure the parking situation was due to the tents set up in the parking lot for the Rock & Gem Expo and associated visitors.  I wasn't as lucky later on, and ended up having to park in the street for the night.Back in the hotel, the hotels hallways were kind of dark, and can also used a re-freshening.  Elevators seemed a bit slow, but then again it was very busy.  The room was nice, clean and usable.  Beds were clean, and provided a good night’s rest.     The hotel’s restaurant was a simple “dinner” atmosphere, but the food was good, nothing fancy, but good.  Same went for breakfast which was included with the hotel rate.  Which is a big step up for your everyday Quality Inn (major reason I gave it 4-stars over three).There is a train track that passes the front of the hotel, but don’t let looks fool you, it’s a little used track used by one train during the daylight to access local industries.  No trains passed the hotel during my stay.  Being that nobody on TripAdvisor mentioned the railroad, I don’t believe it’s ever an issue.  I chose this hotel because the price was right, and the great reviews of the free breakfast.  I would stay here again as well as price & breakfast reviews are comparable.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Decent hotel, not so decent location","The hotel was nice.  We didn't eat or visit the bar, but they looked nice.  The room was okay.  There is no way to turn on the vent for ambiance without it kicking out heat (December).  I picked this hotel online since it was right next to the interstate.  However, you must travel a couple miles to the nearest on-ramp and that sometimes took a while.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Perfect for doing business downtown,"I rendezvoused here with colleagues coming from various places, some local and some from out of town, for an important meeting downtown that we needed to arrive at together. The free parking allowed us to avoid the downtown parking hassles because we could leave all the cars in the the hotel's free parking and take their shuttle, which got us to and from our meeting very efficiently. The rooms were clean and well appointed, with a small sink/micro/fridge area in an alcove between the bedroom and the bathroom. Nice views from the upper floors of downtown Denver and the mountains. Breakfast had the usual cereal and waffles, but also hot scrambled eggs, biscuits, gravy, oatmeal, fresh fruit, cottage cheese and more. Staff was friendly and attentive. Recommended if you have business downtown but don't want to pay downtown hotel prices or deal with downtown parking.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Value - convenient location,"I expected a Walmart and got a Target.  It's in an industrial area and surprisingly hard to get to considering you can see it from the interstate.  But the staff was extremely friendly, it was clean, reasonable priced, and had a great breakfast.  There was two people behind the reception desk every time I walked by.  Every single worker asked me how my stay was going every time they passed.  Even though it was a serve-it-yourself breakfast, they had somebody walking around filling coffee.  The rooms were clean, and mine had a microwave and small refrigerator (not sure if they all do.)  They have a shuttle, but you really need a car if you want to spend any time in Denver.  I didn't expect a boutique hotel, and this isn't one, but it's a great value.  It's near the interstate, but I couldn't hear it and slept well.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Overall good.. Terribly understaffed,"The hotel is pretty good and lively on a cold December night. There were about 4 people in line at the reception, just 1 receptionist, and she was kept busy with returning innumerable phone calls.. Had to wait for about 20 minutes just to check in !!! The hotel is either terribly understaffed or the staff weren't to be found. The stay was quite pleasant otherwise and it was value for money",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"not a bad stay, but not great.","We have stayed at this hotel before, and had a great time then, but this time the air conditioner did not work, the room smelled of cigarettes, and the lobby smelled STRONGLY of cleaner. The breakfast was good, and the staff was friendly.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Industrial Area,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel thinking it was in the downtown area.  Instead it is located on the north side of Hwy. 70 and very near Hwy 25 in an Industrial Area.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced motel near the stadium with average priced rooms, this may be the place for you.  We ended up using Pecos St. to 20th st. when visiting the downtown area.  Less traffic and confusion of the Hwy's.  Don't bother trying to regulate the heat in the room by using the thermostat because the heat is controled by the hotel.  Rooms were very cold.  Tub stopper didn't seal down so water leaked out when taking a bath.  Had difficulty opening the door with the card key but reported it and they said they would have maintenance look at it.  On the plus side, the Staff was very helpful and the breakfast was very good.  Some days it included pancakes and other days they had waffels.  Loved the fresh fruit.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Clean Hotel - Reasonable Value,"The Hotel was reasonable value for money. Access to the hotel whilst it is near the freeway is a little awkward as there is railway line near the hotel. We arrived a little early when checking in and the staff were excellent, they let us cloak our luggage in a room to the side of the reception area.  Thanks people it was great!  Free onsite parking. Shuttle bus. Clean comfortable beds.  The complementary breakfast was good as was the breakfast area, which was the restaurant area. We also ate dinner at the hotel restaurant, it was good food at a reasonable price. There was also a sports bar/lounge next to the restaurant.   The hotel is adjacent to a business commercial type park from what we could see.  The hotel shuttle was great, the driver dropped us to the 16th Street Mall for a days shopping in central Denver. He also picked us up at a predetermined location and time in the afternoon, which was excellent.  We only stayed one night but we would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Place for a Great Price!,"We booked a room here for a week's vacation in Colorado.  The price, free parking and free breakfast were great benefits of choosing this hotel.  We did a lot of day trips around the area, so for us the location was just fine for getting around.  And it was great to start every day with a free breakfast downstairs.  This wasn't your typical fruit and muffin breakfast, instead there were freshly made waffles, eggs, ham, oatmeal and cereal.  The staff was extremely friendly every day and was there to answer any of our questions.  The room was clean and well maintained.  We utilized the free hotel shuttle into Downtown Denver and that was a lifesaver.  It was much easier than driving in ourselves and trying to find parking or dealing with a taxi.  We were there for the Great American Beer Festival, and this hotel worked out just fine for us.  We would stay there again on our next trip to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good value, great Breakfast","This is a well located economic hotel with spacious, clean rooms, free parking and a wonderful buffet breakfast. Service is outstanding, but appointments are basic.  Bring ear plugs and you'll have a perfect experience. Don't expect luxury if you're not paying for it.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Very good experience overall, great value.","Large, comfortable, very clean room, excellent breakfast. Exceptional value at the discounted $64 a night we paid.  One reception staff member was not inclined to be that helpful (or perhaps didn't know much of the area) but customer service manager and another manager circulated at breakfast and gave excellent, very friendly advice which guaranteed a great days touring (the wider area offers some very special day drives) - very impressive guest relations in this sense. Little to criticise except perhaps the fairly barren location - isolated if you didn't have a car and not much in the immediate location in terms of restaurants - we were discouraged from walking to more local restaurants due to safety concerns. Other guests  told the in house restaurant was good but this closes at 9:30 -  we were later getting in than that and had to resort to pizza delivery both nights as we didn't fancy more driving.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great City Hotel,"We stayed there for one night at the end of our vacation while waiting to return back east by train.  It was a busy Sunday with people coming and going to the Broncos and baseball games, but the staff never quit smiling and being friendly and helpful.  Our room was lovely, clean, and quiet despite all the activity in the lobby.  We had a nice evening meal in the restaurant and an excellent expanded buffet breakfast in the morning before leaving.  Doubt we will be in that area again, but if so, we would definitely stay there.  Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place to stay,"Our company was traveling here for business. Stayed here for a week. Great Location, it ended up only a few miles from where we were working. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and nice.  Only comment was they wished the pool was inside.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not bad for football game,"Stayed at this hotel for a Bronco Game as many were sold out.  It's a bit dated.  Though we had a non-smoking room, the floor still smelled a little like smoke.  Beds just ok, pretty clean.  Bonus was shuttle (but don't rely on this for after the game.........long line to get back to hotel) and the breakfast was very good with a variety of goodies.  Shuttle also takes you to downtown Denver which is nice.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Some good, some not so good aspects","The hotel itself is good for the price.  The rooms were large, clean and well maintained and the foyer was nice. There is a bar in the lobby and lots of activity, with people coming and going. The free breakfast was also a substantial and hearty one. However, there were some negatives.  Firstly, the hotel is not in Central Denver at all.  It is on the outskirts, and you need to drive or catch a taxi if you want to go into town or eat late.  The restaurant also closes at 9pm, so for late arrivals, there are absolutely no food options, unless you order take away or drive somewhere.  Still, the hotel provides a free hourly (pre booked) shuttle to major points, such as downtown Denver, which was good value.  The shuttle bus driver was also very pleasant and friendly - I think his name was Manuel.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Best breakfast,"Had high expectations from 4 star rating, but was a little disappointed with room- in particular a very low pressure shower that would change temperatures during shower, no heating in room ( but was bought a bar heater when we asked) and a running toilet. But the breakfast buffet was amazing- the best i have ever had, and there were other good services such as business centre and shuttle ( which was a necessity as there is nothing at all around the motel)",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice staff but....,"We were told the hotel was in Central Denver, but upon arriving it was overlooking the intersection of I-25 and I-70 and the train tracks. The room was okay, the staff pleasant enough. We ate a simple dinner in the hotel restaurant... again, okay and the nice waitress did her best. My biggest disappointment came the next morning at breakfast. While standing in line (yes, there were lots of people), I was greeted by a sign: ""Save the environment, don´t waste food"", only then to retrieve plastic utensils, plastic plate, Styrofoam coffee cup, and plastic juice glass!! While eating breakfast I was approached by the Hotel Manager who asked if everything was okay and I asked him why they used disposable everything and he responded because of the volume and they would need to hire a dishwasher!! Think 200-400 breakfasts everyday, 365 days a year and all that trash!! Made me lose my appetite!!",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Improve the restaurant and I'll return. Hotel itself is a 4,"First of all, I could not locate the restaurant on TripAdvisor otherwise I'd review it (the restaurant) with zero stars. The hotel itself is fine. The lobby is upscale for a Quality Inn. My room and the furnishings were older, but well maintained and in good working order. They initially put me in a room already occupied which led to a awkward encounter with the occupant as I walked in on her. They also offer refrigerators however the one delivered to my room didn't work.Other than that my 3 night stay was without a glitch when it came to the hotel side of the business. Without the restaurant I would give the hotel a 4.The breakfast buffet was very good for the room price. However, the restaurant for dinner is a joke. Please note the service was great, the staff friendly, and drinks in the bar very reasonably priced. It's the food. First night was pork chops, mashed potatoes, etc. Chops were OK, mashed potatoes were poor quality instant with NO attempt to improve them. Just plain with a little glop of gravy. Tried the mozzarella sticks the second night as an appetizer. How hard are those? -  Drop them in the oil, and serve them hot. Mine were luke-warm at best and I suspect heated in a microwave. I asked about soup of the day, the server's response was ""it's canned."" That folks says it all.............. I ate there a third night but won't even bother writing about it.I could excuse the hotel for the above paragraph except as noted here numerous times there is nothing around the hotel except industrial/commercial areas. Meaning if you don't want to drive to eat you're out of luck. The Village Inn next door closes at 3:00 PM....If you have other dinner plans, or intend to drive to a restaurant, then I highly recommend this hotel. The price is great, the breakfast excellent, the service friendly and helpful. I cannot, however, excuse the restaurant after eating 3 dinners there.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Best Value. I recommend it and I will be back.,"I'm a business travel warrior that stays on Choice Hotels every week. I tried this one for the price but it turn out to be the best Quality Inn in the country. i stayed three nights and the room was clean and comfy, the breakfast was the very best I have tried on a Choice Hotels location, it is located just by downtown. The staff was very nice as well. I will be back here for sure the next time I'm in town!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great value,"My husband and I stayed here 2 nights at the end of a 16-day trip in the West. This was one of the best hotels we stayed at. It is very clean, the staff is friendly and knowledgable, and the breakfast was awesome (eggs, ham, cottage cheese, waffles, cereal, pastries). The water pressure in the bathroom was also terrific, which I can't say for many of the hotels where we stayed, but I could say this here. This hotel is not in the heart of downtown Denver, but we found that restful. The hotel parking is free, and you can either take the the hotel's free shuttle downtown, which was very easy to use, or drive yourself if you have a rental car. We very much enjoyed our stay and found it a great value for $63 a night!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Great basic amenities, and a fairly reliable shuttle service!  It's all about the shuttles!","One should keep in mind my choices for my meeting.  Most of my hotel selections were $300+/night selections.  I was not interested in spending so much and got a room for three nights at $115/night.  It was a bargain for proximity to the Colorado Convention Center.I attended the ACEP Scientific Assembly from Oct 8-11, 2012.  I arrived 8am that morning and was able to leave my luggage in storage.  The Hotel allowed me to use the shuttle to attend my meetings before I had officially checked in.  The Hotel also picked me up from the Convention Center after my first conference day was over and before I had officially checked in.The hotel is in a decidedly industrial area, with a nearby residential area.  This is the main downside of the hotel.  The hotel is about 2.8 mi from the Colorado Convention Center, but probably closer to 4mi by vehicle.  Not knowing anything more about the area, I would not try to walk to get downtown.The exterior has a bit dated paint scheme, but it is well-kept.  There is a prominently labeled ""Security Van"" on the premises.  I had a rental vehicle during the time I was there, but really didn't need it because of the utility of the shuttle service.  The hotel seems to know that the shuttle service is an important service for them.  They will use two shuttle vans during heavy travel periods.  If there are a large number of people headed for the Colorado Convention Center, they will continue shuttling until all have been transported.  Otherwise, they will run the shuttle at the top of every hour, on average.  They normally stop shuttling until 9pm, but for my conference, they kept the shuttles going until 10pm.  They picked me up from one of my reception sites, The Tavern, at 10pm.  I was grateful.The morning breakfast buffet is very adequate and satisfies!  There are belgan waffles, fruit, meat, and eggs.  Western condiments of green chili and salsa were welcome.  It did not change significantly while I was there.  There was adequate comfortable seating and I met some other conference attendees while I was there.  Shortly after I checked in, I found that the room handle had fallen to the floor.  I found the tightening pin on the floor as well and was able to get back in.  I notified the front desk about this occurrence, and by the time I had returned, the room handle was firmly re-affixed.The rooms are reasonably spacious, clean, and well kept.  I had a double-double room. The styling is perhaps a little spartan, but the amenities were plentiful.  Free parking and WiFi are most important to me.  There was also a hair dryer, coffee maker, refrigerator, and microwave in my non-smoking room.  There was an abundance of pillows.  The room was kept clean to a fault during my stay.I think there was one time where I had to wait for an hour or so for the shuttle.  That was the only time where they fell down.  If one is traveling singly, and then there is a natural tendency to place transport at a lower priority.  When I was traveling in a group with common needs, the transport was never a problem.   For the price, I considered the hotel a bargain at $115 a night.  I was very happy with my stay.  I understand that others have got rooms for cheaper, and one might consider looking for the lower prices over a period of several weeks, days, and web sites.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent service,"I recently stayed at the Quality Inn Central Denver (three times over the space of one month) and I found this hotel to be excellent in all respects. The staff were outstanding and really could not have done more for us, the shuttle bus and it's drivers were great, really freindly and very helpful, the breakfast was really great. You are aout 10 minutes drive from Downtown Denver, but this means it a bit quieter here and you have the facility of the Shuttle bus which runs on the hour every hour between about 8am and 11pm. Although we didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening, the food that was coming out of the kitchen looked great. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great hotel at a great rate!!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Wonderful stay!,Had a wonderful stay!  Checked in late at night and checked out early next morning but the breakfast was more than your normal cereal and waffles very nice selection of other hot items...we got this room for $56 directly through the hotel website....awesome deal.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very pleased. Will be back! :),"This was a business trip and I stayed for just over a week. Location is very good and the rooms are clean and well maintained. Staff is friendly and made my stay very pleasant.  The restaurant downstairs serves ok food, nothing stellar, however, there is a Village Inn next door which is dynamite! :)",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Very Pleased... Would return, and also recommend.","Unfortunately my brother was in a severe accident earlier this week, so a relative and myself tried to find a hotel at last minute to get there as quick as possible. I typed in to find the one ""nearest"" to the hospital that he's in. This hotel was about 7 miles away, had the best reviews and is right off of the highway. I always, always, ALWAYS read reviews. From previously working for the choice hotel chain, and now working for a company (CLC) I deal with and see a lot of issues with hotels!  I always look for certain qualities and have high standards I guess.. And I have nothing but good things to say about this property. After the 9 hr drive-our check in was fast and friendly. Room was clean. The shower worked fine. Breakfast was out of a buffet, which is nice (more to choose from than most). During breakfast a lovely lady (manager?) stopped by to say good morning and see how we were. It was relieving coming back from a long day of hard chairs in a waiting room coming back ""home"" to a clean hotel room. Check out was quick also.. It's little things like that that I admire, keep it up guys. Not sure if you accept CLC guests but we'd love to have a hotel like you partnered with us if you already don't! Either way, I'll definitely see you again in a few weeks!!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Would not recommend,"We selected this hotel because the reviews seemed very good and downtown located. We stayed in this hotel for two nights and were very disappointed with the service.The hotel is located in an industrial area, next to the highway. If you want to go in downtown is really difficult .... The staff is rude and the rooms are old and poorly maintained.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Hotel is friendly, location is OK","I came here on a business trip, and stayed in this hotel since the office was nearby. Honestly, had it not been for this, I wouldn't have gotten much out of the location--pretty industrial, few restaurants or sights nearby. However, it seems like a good starting-off point for exploring the mountains, and the price was great.As for the hotel itself, it was very clean and the beds were comfy--I had a great night's sleep. Furthermore, the people working there were incredibly kind and helpful. They allowed me to check in an hour early and then printed out a map to help me get around. I didn't eat at the free breakfast, but it's a nice touch. I would especially recommend this place for people with kids, as it was very child-friendly (and pet-friendly).",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Nice Room, Friendly Service, Great Breakfast","We stayed here two nights based on the good reviews.  There were a few places in the area that were cheaper but the reviews for this hotel were significantly better so it seemed the smart choice.  The rooms were nice and clean, the beds were comfortable, and the people working the front desk and the breakfast station were very friendly and helpful.The breakfast spread (included with the room) was much better then expected.  Fresh Belgian Waffles, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, ham, biscuits and gravy, muffins, juice, and cereal.There isn't much going on in the direct neighborhood of this hotel...kind of an industrial area.  But it is right next to a couple major highways so getting to Denver, Golden or The Red Rocks is just a 10-15 minute drive away.  The main reason we were in town was to see a concert at the Red Rocks (which is amazing) and the money we saved not getting a Hotel that was closer was well worth it.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good Experience,"My husband and I stayed here during out trip to Denver.  I'll be honest, it's no high-class hotel.  BUT, we would definitely stay there again.  Breakfast was decent, room was nice.  Only complaints is that the change machine was not working and we needed to use the laundry facilities.  Also, it was close to large highways and not very far from downtown.Thanks to the very nice staff!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Close to airport,When i arrived the girl at the front desk was a little overwhelmed since she was the only one there. She handled it professionally. She was as quick as  she could be & remained friendly. When we got to our room it was clean and the ac worked great. Had a great night sleep and a short easy ride to car rental return and airport.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good place, good price","Very good experience at this hotel. The staff was professional, breakfast was great, and the room was CLEAN! It was a bit difficult to get to from downtown. The facility is in need of some updating in my opinion, but that did not take away from our experience. We would definately stay here again!  :)",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Reccomended,"High quality hotel, huge breakfast, easy to get from Ft. Collins, slighty more complicated from downtown. Cleaned but noisy the night we were there because there was a sport event on TV in the lounge and people stayed awake late!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not Ok,"Hotel smells like a geriatric home.Restaurant does not have much of a selection at all, especially if you make it a point to not eat crappy foods.Now, on to my main issue:I was awaiting a few packages--all replacement credit cards and my drivers' license, because I had lost my wallet at the airport--and informed four desk attendants, at different times, that the parcels would be arriving UPS.  Coincidentally, I met the UPS guy on my way out on our second morning, and signed for the first package.  My second package was supposed to arrive the same day, and I asked both people at  the front desk later in the afternoon if it had arrived.  I was informed that it had not.  My boyfriend left his information and our room number with the front desk because the third package to be delivered was for him, and we thought it would help in avoiding any confusion, since my name was on the room.  Boy, was I wrong.  Later in the afternoon I called the credit card company and they said the second credit card had been delivered.  Worried that it had been lost in transit somewhere, I cancelled the ""delivered"" card and was told to expect a new one the next day.  Early afternoon the next day my boyfriend received two packages, one of them being the ""delivered"" package from the day before.  The package that the front desk claimed had never arrived.  The package containing the credit card that I had to cancel, for fear that it had been mis-delivered.  Having to wait for the replacement cards and the drivers' license had already delayed our plans, but we were in good spirits because we knew our credit card company and UPS would not disappoint in fulfilling their duties.However, we were extremely annoyed when we found out that the hotel had had the package all along.  When we asked how could this oversight have occured--we checked in with the front desk at lest three times a day--the woman said ""Oh, we didn't know who the package was addressed to, since his name isn't on the room"".  Well, what about the note that we handed to the woman at the front desk yesterday afternoon, the one with all of my boyfriend's information including his phone number.  ""Oh, I don't know.  I didn't see a note"".  And yet she was able to call us, on my boyfriend's phone.  Perhaps it was because she saw the note, or else how was she able to contact us.What it boils down to is no one ever actually checked for the package.  Or they were so disorganized that they couldn't find packages that had been delivered.  Or it could be a combination of the two, and they are simply incompetent.In short, I would not stay at this hotel again.  However, if you don't mind the smell of a nursing home, greasy non-nutritious food and an incompetent front desk, then be my guest.PS, on my way out, they bribed me to leave a good reveiw by offering a $10 rebate/coupon.  Therefore, take all of these ""Excellent""! reviews with a grain of salt.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Spectacular hotel for the price!,"We recently went to Denver for a Broncos game.  We looked on hotels.com and read dozens of reviews at tons of hotels.  Many reviews scared me away.  We wanted a hotel with a shuttle to the game to avoid traffic.  This hotel takes you to many destinations within 5 miles for FREE.  The hotel was very clean.  The beds are awesome!  The bed felt new, it had a down quilt.  So so comfy!!  I have NEVER slept so well in a hotel.  There was a little road noise, but with the a/c on, we didn't hear the cars.  Speaking of a/c, it was not your typical noisy unit attached to the wall.  It was vented through the walls, just like in a house.  It was much quieter and worked very well.  The bed sheets seemed brand new, the pillows were really cushy.  We were nervous about the price of this hotel, but ended up being very pleasantly surprised!!  The staff was AMAZING.  The hot breakfast was really good!  nice variety, and free too!  The shuttle was great.  We went to the Broncos game, Elitch Gardens, and the 16th Street Mall.  When you're ready, you call the hotel and ask for pickup.  Be ready at the designated pickup spot, and they were always there for us in 10 minutes or less.  That may not always be the case, due to traffic/construction/lots of people....  They did their best, and we loved it.  It's not a high class area, but our car was fine out in the lot, and we had no problems.  Next time we're in Denver, we won't even look at another hotel.  This is where we'll stay!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Centrally Located and Pet Friendly with Helpful Amenities,Excellent place to stay in downtown Denver if you are taking advantage of downtown attractions. They provide a free shuttle service as long as you request it one hour in advance of your departure. We used it to go to a game at Coors Field. They give you a number to call when you want to be picked up. Hotel was very clean and appeared to be recently renovated. Staff was professional and friendly. Nice breakfast choices. Very pet-friendly hotel with only a small fee. Be aware that there are specific floors for pets. Because we did not call ahead to say we were bringing a dog we could not get into the kind of room we had reserved. They did put us in another type of room for the same price. Overall I would really recommend this hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great value,Hotel was clean. Rooms were quiet.  Nice hot complimentary breakfast with plenty of variety. Friendly staff. Free shuttle was very nice to have going downtown to a game. We would stay here again as the price for value was very good.,4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Experience for a Week! Great Value!,"We had to move our son to college so we needed a place to stay that wasn't too far from Downtown Denver, but not too expensive. This Quality Inn really was great.  The area is a little industrial but for Denver, it is pretty quick on and off the freeway. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the hot breakfast buffet is great! We realized I had booked a King with 2 adults, but when we got their I figured that our son would need to stay with us at least 2 nights before staying in his Campus apartment. They quickly changed us to a room with 2 Queens, did not charge us any extra and never asked when he would come or go. Also, they had a refrigerator and microwave brought up to our room upon request...in 15 min from when we asked. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. There is a shuttle too and from the airport, there is free parking and although it is old, it is a fine place to stay. You do have noise from the freeway, but we don't mind it, it is ""white noise"" us!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Okay stay,"Got a good rate and decided to stay here to save some money.  The first room we got was a double but I had booked a king.  It was okay but the garbage was on that side and the trucks woke us up at 4am.  They switched us to a King room because they had made a mistake however I wished the whole trip we had our double beds back b/c the king bed sank in the middle.  My husband and I were fighting to stay on our edge of the bed b/c it was so miserable and sunken in.  Both rooms were stuffy and smelly.  They seemed clean enough.   We never got a good night sleep though b/c of the bed.  I will say that it was quiet we never heard any noise.  The shuttle was mediocre.  One time it worked great with a really helpful driver and the other time they said they were around the corner and never showed up.  The free breakfast was the same every day and consisted of scrambled eggs, sliced ham, biscuits and gravy, canned fruit, yogurt, waffle (make yourself) and english muffins.  It was decent but got old.  It was always crowded and some of the people staying at this hotel were not the cleanest looking.The location made it easy to get on the highway for our day trips to Colorado springs and Boulder.All in all I would not stay here again but if you find a good rate and are willing to make some sacrifices it may be worth it.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,great breakfast,"We stayed here recently for one night. We thought it was a very good hotel. Our GPS told us that it was across the street from its real location, but luckily the hotel is a high rise so we were able to see it and easily figure out how to get across the train tracks. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The outdoor pool seemed very inviting (we did not go in). The fitness room was good, with a tv and an open door to the pool area. It had an elliptical machine, a bike and weight lifting equipment. The breakfast in the hotel was outstanding!! It had scrambled eggs, ham, make your own waffles, muffins, toast, grits, danishes, etc. Way more than what you generally find in a hotel. Everything we had was delicious!! It was a very large room (it is part of the hotel's restaurant) so there was room for everyone without having to wait for a table - a rarity in hotels.  The staff was more friendly and helpful than I generally encounter in hotels. The internet was a bit slow, but it was fast enough for emails. The room had a coffee maker with coffee/tea provided.  Only one complaint. In order to get hot water for a shower in the morning (6:30am) I had to let the water run for 10 minutes!! There was lots of hot water from the sink taps the night before. I did report it to the staff when we left, so hopefully the problem has been corrected.  I would not let this slight incident stop me from staying there again if we were back in town. The location is in an industrial area but if you have a car you won't care. The hotel apparently has a shuttle that drives you to anywhere downtown but we did not use this service. I would rate this hotel highly and we'll be back there - for the breakfast!!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great value!,"You can't ask for more for the price. Excellent breakfast, good location, friendly staff, pool - would definitely go back if I ever come back to Denver. The only criticism would be that the ice machine on the 9th floor wasn't working (apparently for a longer period already).",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Loved it!!!,Very nice hotel.  Great and helpful staff. Very clean and nice rooms.  One of the best quality inns I have ever stayed at and will definitely stay there again.  Excellent continental breakfast. Very affordable too. Thanks!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Not bad for the cost d,"Pros - good price, clean room, comfortable bed, friendly staff Cons- smells like a casino hotel, needs more towels, lobby and hallways can be updated, food for dinner was mediocre(I'm probably being over critical )Overall it's average.  We were here for just one night before we flew home. It served it's purpose.  Can't comment on breakfast bc we had to leave before it was served.  I've been in better but I've been in a heck of alot worse.  I rated it a 3 but it's more like 3.5",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality Inn for a QUALITY stay,"The staff is very attentive, continental breakfast is much more than dry cereal & toast-waffles, eggs, ham- oh my! The pillows are fantastically feathery & the pool water a perfect temperature! What a wonderful experience.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Kudos to staff,"When we were making reservations for hotels for our stay in Denver, the first thing my husband checked was affordable pricing. The first thing I checked were the reviews on cleanliness.  This hotel seemed to fit the bill.  We made reservations for two nights and after switching sides of the hotel away from Exit 273, stayed for two more.  Rooms were clean, beds comfortable, hamburgers delicious and beer in the lounge was cold.  On our 3rd night, we had problems with the lock to our room.  My thanks to the custodian who got us in to our room and later fixed the lock, and also to the gal on night shift who came up with keys to a different room, which we declined.  They couldn't have been more courteous.  I would also like to thank the waitress from the grill who was very patient with some exhausted visitors (us) who couldn't make up their minds what they wanted.   Finally, a special thanks to housekeeping.  It was really nice to come back to a clean room after a tiring day of seeing the sights in and around Denver.  If we ever return to Denver, this hotel will be our first choice.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Experience,"We had a great experience with this hotel.  The rooms were spacious, clean and quiet (we were on the 2nd floor over the bar and didn't hear a thing) and a great value for the money.  My family just wanted to take in the sights of Denver without breaking the bank and this hotel was just the thing!  The shuttle was most welcome and probably the funniest experience that we have had in a long time thanks to our cheerful driver Michael.  Service was excellent and we really felt that our opinion counted.  The staff were dealing with the overflow from a large convention and seemed to have it all well in hand.  I would definitely recommend this property and will stay again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Best Value in Denver?,"We came to Denver for an overnight ""mini vacation"".  The rooms were nice and comfortable.  The staff was excellent.  Special thanks to the shuttle drivers who went out of their way to make sure that we were quickly and courteously transported to our destinations.  The complimentary breakfast was excellent...eggs, ham. waffles, muffins, fresh fruit, juice and too much more to list here!!  Overall, we were very pleased, would definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,What a stay,"First off I would I stay in about 100 rooms per year at hotels. Some of them are horrible, and then some of them are like the Quality Inn Central. I would have to put this in the top 7 for Denver. This is my second stay, and it was just as great as the first. Dedra checked my partner and I in and she was helpful and pleasant, nothing but smiles. She took care of the shuttle reservations for us and printed us directions to where we needed to go. At the last minute we needed to take a shuttle to coors field rocky stadium, because our ride canceled, and we told Dedra at the front desk to call a cab, and she actually pulled a shuttle driver to take us to the stadium. ( Of course we went with other people, but they got us on that shuttle quick) We only had to wait about 5 minutes to leave, but got to the game on time. When we called to get a ride back there were at least 60 people staying at that hotel that went and all 3 shuttles were on there way when I called. We only ended up waiting about 20 minutes. On our second day, we left our sign for house keeping to pass our room up, and  we called down to the front desk, and spoke with Ivie. She said that she would send some up, and about 15 minutes later house keeping came, she gave us new towels and got our old trash, even though we didn't ask her too. For our stay it was pleasantly quiet for a busy hotel. The staff never seemed to be down in the dumps.  I have recommended this hotel to our office so when we come to Denver, this is where I would like to stay.During the night my co worker needed another blanket and we spoke to the lady that works the night and she sent security up with a blanket. I mean what is there to complain about, the people at the front desk worked very hard, because when checking in at 7pm there was a huge line, and a bunch of grumpy people that they were trying to take care of. And not once did they complain about it at the front desk, like I have heard at other hotels. I give this place 2 thumbs up!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality Stay,"We came to Denver for a Rockies game and stayed at this hotel because they had a courtesy shuttle to and from the game.  The rooms are very nice and clean. My only ""complaint"" is that the pillows are small and square like couch coushins. They were soft, but small which made sitting in bed to read or watch TV difficult. The nite-light in the bathroom was burned out, and when we took it to the front desk they said housekeeping had left for the day and could not get us another one. As someone who has worked in the hotel industry, I was disappointed to see the lack of motivation by the front desk to help. The shower head in the bathroom was old, and the water pressure wasn't the best, but it got the job done and the bathroom was clean. The shuttle to and from the game was hassle free and we enjoyed not having to fight the traffic and pay for parking. When we went down for breakfast, it was a wonderful surprise to see scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, waffles, and many other items at their breakfast bar. The food was great and the manager circulated making sure everyone had what they needed. I was a little disappointed at check out when I inquired about the botanical gardens and all they could give me was directions. The desk clerk gave me a number to call for Denver tourism for more information, which I called only to get a recording asking me to leave a message. In my opinion, if you're going to work the front desk at a hotel, you need to know more than directions to the area attractions, so you can better serve your guests. Overall, we had a good stay, and would recommend this hotel. I know we will be staying there next time we're in town for a game.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Family Co op Reunion 2012 Denver Colorado,"My family hosted our Family Reunion at this hotel.  Excellent service, Excellent staff.  Clean, and functional for our event.  Thank you to all of the staff for a job well done.  We will return.Family Co op Reunion Mile High Generation of Denver Colorado.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Fine for a quick stay,Stayed here for 2 nights to attend a show and chose the location because it was half way betweed Red Rocks and the Airport. It's close enough to the freeway that it didn't seem to be too far away from anywhere and there was always plenty of parking even when we got back late. The staff were great which was lucky as we had a smilar issue as a previous reviewer with our room lock not working and wasted a fair bit of time with Security trying to 'break in' for us and then having to relocate. Buffet breakfast was pretty good - waffles were great and there was plenty of fresh fruit to add to them. Would probably try somewhere else if we were staying in town longer.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pleasant Surprise at the Denver Quality Inn,"I had a wonderful time while in Denver staying at the Quality Inn.  It is not in the center of the downtown area, nor is it out near the airport.  However, they make up for this with their shuttle service, which will take you to a lot of different destinations within about a 5 mile radius.  This included the 16th St Mall, the Colorado Convention Center, stadiums, etc.  They leave on the hour, and you just have to call and they will pick you up on the next run.  Staff is super friendly, including the shuttle drivers, and a few that I remember fro the front desk are Patricia, Yvonne, Teresa, and a couple others that I did not get their name.  Great breakfast and Betty visits your table to see if everything is OK.  I would stay here again with no hesitation. Their prices are great!!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,met my needs,"The first thing I noticed walking in the hall to my room is that the hotel needs to be updated & entering my room confirmed that.  The furniture was somewhat beat-up & the room had an overall 1980s feel to it, especially the television & limited channel line-up.  That was the negative.  Also the location wasn't the greatest - in an industrial area.The positives included: free local calls, free WiFi (not the strongest of signals), decent free breakfast, friendly staff who tried to help within the limits that they were able to, permission to print pages off the internet such as boarding passes & tickets, a pool for those interested, and plenty of free parking.  For me, the best ammenity was the shuttle, saving me the aggervation of driving/parking at Coors Field, and it also makes other stops in downtown.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Dirty Hotel that needs updating,"Recently stayed here for a family reunion. The same dropped cookies stayed in elevator the entire 4 days I was there. Room bathroom was horrible. The bathroom sink basin was all cracked up, tiles missing in bathtub and the towel were thin and worn. The cleaning crew never wiped down the nightstand. The banquet room were we held our functions was dirty and outdated. The tablecloths were stained and flimsy.  They had standing air conditioners and fans. No central air. Location looks scary.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Fabulous service!,"We stayed at the Quality Inn during a family trip to Denver. We were looking for a hotel close to Coors Field and other major tourist attractions. We were delighted with the quality of the non-smoking room we were assigned. The room was clean and attractive. The shuttle service provided by this facility is absolutely second-to-none. The shuttle drivers go out of their way to get you where you need to go, and quick pick-up is only a phone call away. The free continental breakfast is extensive and delicious - plenty to eat for all members of your family, even the really picky ones. I would highly recommend this hotel. Granted, the location is a little industrial, but the service and amenities more than made up for it. We would come back again without a second thought!!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,A more than decent hotel for the price,"I recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights (July 8 & 9) during a combined holiday/business trip to  Colorado. Although I inadvertently booked a smoking room, the hotel immediately, at my request, were able to switch it to a non-smoking on the second floor (if I understood correctly, the rooms on the lower floors are newer).  My room was clean, beds and bedding were comfortable, wi-fi was fine. The hotel was not noisy and I slept well.  Breakfast was excellent -- among the best I've had in the Choice family of hotels -- with a wide variety of cold and hot choices, including porridge, cottage cheese and fresh cut fruit!The hotel was for me a wee bit difficult to find, in the dark with the GPS -- but I think Lily, my GPS guide may have been a bit confused :). The hotel does offer a free shuttle which worked well for me the two times I used it, both for pick-up and drop-off in Denver. Front desk staff were reasonable, with just a couple of minor things:- lack of clarity regarding the shuttle pick-up location. I was initially told it would pick me up where I needed, but when I later called for an actual pick-up I was told that I needed to go to a specific location.  The woman on the phone was at first very unhelpful in explaining where I could find the pick-up location, frustrating since I was tired and not at all familiar with Denver. However it eventually got figured out.- just prior to check-out I was unfortunately delayed because the last minute items from the bathroom and dressing area that I needed to pack in my bags were all wet.  I needed to empty out water, dry everything off, and pack damp items.  Grossness of grossness, I realized the water came from leakage in the ceiling in both those rooms.  Very yucky and very annoying and also because I had timed my morning in order to return a car rental by the required time. I advised the desk clerk at check-out who assured me I would hear from the desk manager via email (he/she was not on site at that time) but, 8 days later I have yet to hear something.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The service is like no other!,"I had a Business event in Denver and Raja was the most helpful and courteous manager ever. The rooms where clean and comfortable - we stayed 5 nights. The food at the Palm Grill was the best food we ate in Denver. The free shuttle service to downtown was awesome, pick up was within 20 minutes of the call. The staff overall were very professional and friendly.  Always had everything we needed and will definitely stay again. Thank you all and keep up the good work. See you next time we are in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Convenient Hotel with lots of extras!,"We stayed 3 nights here on vacation and it was a great stay!  The room was clean and spacious.  Beds were comfy.  Plenty of hot water in the shower.  My boys enjoyed the outdoor pool and game room.  I even used the laundry facilities which was convenient.  The breakfast was a large buffet with plenty of selection.  The weekends do get busy and the lines are long for the elevators and the buffet, but they move fast.  The shuttle service is nice too and saved us money because everywhere you go in downtown Denver charges for parking.  1 day of our stay our room didn't get cleaned, but it wasn't a big issue.  I only needed towels and asked and received at front desk immediately.  The staff is very professional and nice.  We didn't eat at the restaurant / bar area but it stayed busy.  The hotel is in an industrial area and there are a few fast food places within short driving distance and a Village Inn next door within walking distance.  Within 5 miles to downtown, Elitches, Coors Field, etc.  Again the front desk staff was great.  One supervisor, Ivy, worked all hours of the day / night and was still always pleasant.  She worked circles around others and was very efficient!  Overall it was a great stay and we will stay again if in the area!",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Never again,I Stayed at the Quality inn central in Denver Colorado in July 2012 from the 7th through the 10th I was supposed to be there till the 11th. I came in late after a night at Dave and Busters with my family and the Lady working at the front desk told us that we need to pay our pet deposit and our dog was barking and we had 16 complaints. She made us come back down at 1 a.m. to pay cause we were only charged for 1 night so my daughter came back down with me to pay. I asked if maybe I can get a receipt irritated cause it was so inconvenient to have to do this at 1 in the morning and she was super rude so I told her she did not have to be rude and she started biting my head off so I paid and went back up and told my husband and he went back down to talk to her and she apologized . So in the morning I did not complain to the manager. A little later I got a call from the general manager so I went down to talk to him and he called me into his office and told my husband he could not come in with me cause the room was under my name so I went in and sat down. He does not ask my side of the story and just started saying that I am under friends and family which is a privilege and I am being rude to his employee when tryed to stand up for myself he interrupts me over and over then he said that another dispute is I need to let people know that I have a pet when I check in and I had 10 complaints that she was barking. I told him I did let the guy that checked us in know it is not our fault he only charged us 1 night we did not look we just trusted and paid cause it was late and we had a long drive. He did not care he keept going at me till I was about to cry so I got up and walked out to my family that was waiting and he told my husband that we can stay just not leave our dog in the room and was upset that we had the do not desturbe sign up the whole time which is our right. We all went back up to get our dog so we could take her to my moms while we went to eliches and when we got back down they told us we had to leave they did not want us there. Later after we left my dad called the hotel and they told him I cussed out an 80 year old woman and made her cry when she was late 20s early 30s and my daughter was right next to me so I would not cuss when my dad asked why he would make me so upset I had to walk away so I would not cry all he had to say was no one walks away from him an we had 8 or 9 complaints that our dog was barking (so the number keept jumping). So my dad asked for the help 1-800 number they would not give it to him so he had to search himself for the choice hotel number when he called they told him he is out of luck and the lady hung up on him and he is is a calm guy did not even get ennoyed with her and called back to talk to the supervisor and he told him that all he can do is send it to the manager and put a note in the computer. So I got no help by anyone! Never again will I stay at any choice hotel or quality in!,1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Horrible with Reservations and Customer Service,"I had out of town guests in the summer of 2012 and was looking for accommodations close to my house.  I needed handicap accessible facilities for my 86 year old Grandmother and after looking at Quality Inn Central Denver on-line I drove to the property to ask about their accommodations for guests with special needs.  The front desk clerk let me up to see a handicap accessible room and it did not have a walk-in shower.  When I asked about the rooms with walk-in showers she said they ""did not have any that were unoccupied"".  I decided to book and she explained that I needed to call the central reservations number to make my reservation.On the call with the reservations attendant I was very specific about asking for a room with a walk in shower and also a connected room for my father.  My grandmother also suffers from mild dementia and both my father and I wanted connecting rooms in case she woke up confused. The reservations attendant needed to put me on hold a couple of times to confirm that they had the connecting rooms available.  After confirming that they did have availability and that there would be 2 rooms, one with a walk-in shower and a connecting room for my father I made my reservation.Upon arrival at the property they informed me that hotel policy did not allow adjoining rooms to be guaranteed.  That the policy was on a first come first serve basis, and they did not have any adjoining rooms.  Further there were no rooms on the property that had walk in showers.As you can imagine, I was very upset that I have my 86 year old Grandmother in town and the reservation was apparently a ""we will try to accommodate you"" vs. a ""you will get what you pre-paid for"".  I felt that the organization deceived me just to take a reservation and not necessarily the reservation I needed.  I travel for business a couple of times a month and have been doing so for years.  I have never had this experience before and as a result did not expect this situation to occur.  What is also frustrating is the way the Hotel manager on staff July 7th was trying to explain that this was my fault.  That I should have known that the hotel policy was a first come first serve basis, and that the facility had no walk in showers.  Explaining that (a) the reservations attendant and (b) the front desk clerk from my previous visit respectively said ""you are confirmed for 2 adjoining rooms one with a walk-in shower"" and ""I don't have an unoccupied room with a walk-in shower for you to see"" led me to believe that they did have rooms with walk-in showers and that I would have adjoining rooms.  At no point did he apologize and after 30 minutes was able to get rooms next to each other.After explaining this to my father and Grandmother we decided to take the rooms next to each other and not try and make other accommodations at the last minute.  So no shower for Grandma during her visit, and we were concerned each night about Grandma waking up in a strange place and not knowing where she was.I have not had experience traveling with people with special needs but this was really an eye-opening situation.  Also I don't usually post comments on sites, but the way the staff on site handled this was really frustrating and I hope by posting that others who have special needs can get a little more information and possibly some more questions to ask.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,I feel like I got more than I paid for.,"I was looking to stay somewhere for the night. This hotel was located right off the Interstate. There is a Village Inn located right next door but unfortunately it was closed on Sunday.  The bed was comfortable enough. I was on the 5th floor and had a great view of the city.  My favorite part of the stay was the breakfast. Scrambled eggs, ham, cereals, soft bisquits & gravy, waffles, pastries and other stuff I can't remember.  I ate till i was stuffed.  No complaints about the food.  It all tasted really good.  I paid under $100 for my one night stay.  I think I got more than what I paid for.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Fantastic,"Great for the thrifty travler. Close to downtown and Interstate but nothing close by to walk to. Great for the prices, Great Breakfest bufett. Nice and clean public areas, outside grounds and pool area very clean. Rooms are a little dated and older t.v.'s but you can't beat the price. Room had a fantastic view of the city.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don't Judge  a Book by its Cover,"Made reservation online, 2 weeks ahead, and saved a bunch by joining Choice Club, paying in advance - hint#1. Flew in from NC and we are only here one night - needing a place to sleep and adjust to time zone before hitting the 'real' part of out trip. NOT located in the best part of Denver - off major highway, close to what you need - restaurant on site serves less than average food with great service and there is a bar. Outdoor pool, smoking and non smoking rooms, free wi-fi - rooms have refrig and micro and in room coffee. There is also coffee in the lobby 24/7. Free excellent breakfastThe hotel is older but recently remodeled and well kept - room was average size, clean and well maintained - for $62.00 we were really pleased.Would stay here again for a night inna heart beat -",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent Quality.,I travel a lot and stay at many hotels along the roadsides of our country and this hotel has been about the nicest that I have stayed at. The rooms were very nice as well as the staff. The continental breakfast was better then what you would get at a good restaurant. Definitely worth staying at.,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Old and out of the way,"This hotel is located in an industrial park area just off the highway. It's very noisy. You can hear the traffic and the air conditioner on the roof or electrical closet in the hallway. We were on the 9th floor. The water pressure in the morning was terrible. Difficult to take a shower and flush the toilet.The room was clean but the toilet had rust stains in it. The walls in the bathroom had holes where they probably took something off and never fixed. This place would definitely fail the tests that you see on the TV show Hotel Impossible.The electronic door credit card type key did not open the door properly. It took an average of 5 or more times before it would open. On one day, the door wouldn't lock without slamming it several times. I reported it to the front desk the first morning and they said they would send maintenance to look at it. No one ever came. When I checked out I mentioned it again and they said they are aware of the problem and working on it. Not very serious to them I guess.The restaurant in the lobby is terrible. The burger was dry and the plate had a hair on it. The waitress acted like she didn't want to be there. Go to the Village Inn next door.The breakfast buffet in the morning was ok. The usual items. Eggs, Ham, Biscuits & gravy and waffles.I wouldn't have stayed here but I had to. I was evacuated from the fire area in Colorado Springs and this hotel had the only room available in a 100 mile radius.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"cheap, bad smells, horrible","We were put in this hotel for a weekend marriage retreat with the army. They put us in a room with two full size beds...called and asked for a room with one bed, they don't have any available. So on a marriage retreat weekend, we slept in separate beds. Classy. The hotel smells of a nursing home and crap. The beds are extremely hard. The bathroom door is about two feet in front of the toilet. Be prepared to pivot and step to the side to shut the bathroom door. Our room door has to be shoved open, it sticks and you have to bump it with your shoulder. The hotel staff is not equipped to handle large groups. The ""event center"" is a joke. Three adjoining conference rooms with peeling paint, harsh lighting and broken chairs. The bed sheets make you itch. The TV in the room is a picture tube and the reception on half the channels come in covered in snow. Our event director flat out told the group that the shuttle here is good for taking you somewhere but don't count on them to come back. He called and they said they would be there in 20 mins but an hour and a half later they weren't there and he took a cab. Classy.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Long but worth the read:,"Amazing, amazing place. Best hotel experience of my life. We booked online and were amazed at the price, we thought it was gonna be iffy for the cheap price for 2 adults, but boy were we wrong. The building was gorgeous. The staff was amazing and soo helpful. When we booked online, the only room available for the date we needed was a smoking room, when we got to the hotel, the lady at the desk found a non smoking room on a non smoking floor. Room was beautiful, spotless, huge and the AC worked amazing considering it was 100+ degrees outside. Ive never gotten such an amazing nights sleep in a hotel bed as i did there. Usually my back kills me when i sleep in hotel beds, not this one, and i was even sunburned and could still get comfortable. :)The facilities were wonderful, 24 hour game room and fitness room. My favorite part was the breakfast. This wasn't your usual muffin/juice/bowl of cereal breakfast, this was a full blown buffet. They had biscuits and gravy (which i had just woken up from a dream about lol) ham, scrambled eggs, cereal, oatmeal, fresh waffles (vanilla or spice batter) you could make yourself with their nifty speedy waffle makers, fresh mixed fruit, juice, milk, ice water, coffee. Just mind blowing, and the staff was so caring and helpful the entire time, even though they were packed.If i could give it more than a 3, i would give it a solid 10 on all sections. We will be coming back soon to go to Elitches and the Zoo, and i am definitely coming back here. They have my business from now on. :D",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Comfortable and Great Breakfast,"We just returned from Denver and stayed at Quality Inn Central Denver.  Our overall experience was overall good.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Clean and comfortable,"I booked my room on hotels.com and got it for more than 50% off the nightly rate posted on the door. I got way more than I paid for. The room was a good size and the bed was really comfortable. Everything was very clean and pretty up to date. I had a nice view of downtown and the mountains. The pool looked very nice, but I never had time to swim. I also liked having the free shuttle to take me to and from the Rockies game.My only complaints are there's no stores nearby and navigating the surface streets was kind of hard because of the interstates. The bar closed way too early and the air conditioning was pretty loud.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Would not recommend,"We stayed at three different Quality Inns on this vacation and this one was surely the poorest.  The location is not to great and did not give us a feeling of safety.  The facilities are older and they show it.  The staff was only OK.  Our room was usable, but it was small and in very poor condition.  Things broken and drab.  Looked like the door had probably been kicked in at one time, the screws were loose on the locks/security and would not tighten (they were stripped out).  Bathroom was in horrible condition too.  TV was old and very few channels.  For what it was, it was at least clean.  The breakfast was only OK and the staff did not seem that interested in making sure there was available food/drink considering the number of guests who were there.  Were glad we only stayed one night here and we would not stay here again based on this visit.  Sorry!",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good for one night,"Can't complain for the priceGood : Nice beds, big rooms ,complimentary toiletries ,coffee and tea in room.Could open windows .Free net and breakfast,shuttle friendly staff ((most of them anyway)  No so good things :Pool was closed ,maids did what they could considering they didn't fell happy with the work conditions, i was told that passengers  written complaints  were thrown in the bin,no surprise,when the rooms were clean only in the surface , i did find the bath tub wet and still with other ppl hair in it. No soap dish .Bad and noise A/C (couldn't use it )  Some passengers find ok to leave empty beer bottles and smoke pot in lifts. Maids made so much noise in corridors chatting about their job too much too long.Last day I was told the shuttle would pick me up from town but it didn't , I had to get a cab ,to go back and meet my airport shuttle on time.Breakfast was basic but not bad, served  in a very casual ,informal setting and service felt more like a domestic hangout than a 3 star Hotel they claim but ok ,need more variety  though I picked this Hotel for the location close enough from the venue i was visiting otherwise i would stay in the city.Not bad for the price though.3 days too long .",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good experiene,our stay was as planned nice. Only problem was that the 4th floor ice machine was broken so a few times I had to go up or down a floor to get fresh ice. other than that nice place. Breakfast was a deff PLUS my two yr old loved everything they offered. i give my stay 5 stars!,5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,cheap and that's about it,"Not within walking distance of downtown, infact way out. Pickups with the hotel shuttle are unreliable.The food is just edible, the rooms very dated but clean. People were in and out with pet dogs even though this wasn't allowed.Wouldn't stay again.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Quality sleep,"The reviews definitely led me to stay here. I kinda picked it on the fly via my smartphone because I knew I wasn't going to be able to drive farther than Denver. I also had to pick somewhere on a Saturday night that could accommodate my dog.I felt a little creeped out by the location, though. It's near industrial-ville and hefty trains. I was half-expecting an unsavory individual to come creeping out from the tunnels - but my fear was unfounded.The crowd staying there was mixed indeed. Groups, individuals, various ethnicities, etc. - it was hopping.When I checked in the super nicest guy was at the front - Michael (I think . . . I knew I should've written it down). He was Fab-U-lous! He was super nice and gave me all the great information about all the things you need to know when checking in but rarely get from many front desk clerks nowadays (time of breakfast, checkout, breakfast, locations of the pool, business space, etc.) I could've hugged him if he wasn't on the otherside of the desk. A+++ (especially compared to his compatriots who answered the phone when I first called [that lady seemed baffled as all other] and the guy with a stick up his butt when I checked out [felt like I was wasting his time]. Hey, .333 average is pretty good, eh?Lugged myself up to the 800 floor with my puppy. Seemed a comfortable place and people were coming and going. Got into the room and I already felt comfortable . . . until the hum that I thought was either a nuclear siren or a bomb siren, which I then thought was a soft fire alarm -- only to figure out, no, it was the insanely LOUD Ice Machine that I thought was going to hum itself to pieces. Once I figured out what the sound was I could take a deep breath and watch the policeman pull a piece of wood from the freeway (seriously, I thought he was going to get run over at one point). Unfortunately, though, it kept me from falling asleep a couple of times but the bed was so comfortable I was out before I knew it.The bed, sheets, and pillows were a dream. I coulda slept there all day!Breakfast was hopping, too. They had an interesting mix of fixings. The biscuits were delicious, as were the waffles. The oatmeal -- watery. The fruit mix was fascinating (fresh & canned). But, it was nice to have something to put in my belly.I'd stay again (but would be happier if the location could be changed ;P)",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Convenient location to downtown attractions,"Hotel right off of freeway and only a few miles to downtown Denver.  We booked this place because they offered a free shuttle to Coors Field.  It was easy and when we were ready to be picked up - we just called and they were there in no time.  The hotel is definitely older and could use some remodeling but it was clean and the staff was very courteous.  The included breakfast had many items - hot and cold - to choose from.  The only drawback was that there isn't anything within walking distance of the hotel - such as gas station, convenience store, etc.  These are things that are important to us but may not be to others.  The pool wasn't open yet so cannot comment on that and besides the restaurant, we didn't use any of the other facilties.  The bar was nice but the adjoining restaurant was understaffed and the food was lacking.  Would suggest eating somewhere else.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Dated room and facilities, pretty good breakfast","The motel is not located in downtown Denver as the name may suggest. It's about 10-15mins drive by car. The rooms are dated and require upgrading, but are clean and ok for a night. Pretty good in terms of value for money considering the warm breakfast buffet. If you're looking for a downtown hotel the Hampton Inn Downtown Denver may be a better but of course more expensive choice. Overall an average motel and acceptable for a night's stay.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Experience!,"I came through Denver while on a road trip with friends.  The customer service was excellent.  We wanted to know of a good place to eat was and Daniel helped us out by suggesting a great place that the free shuttle was able to take us to.  We had a great night enjoying Denver and when we returned and needed a toothbrush, Daniel was able to help us again.  What a great way to pass through a beautiful city and relax before heading back out on the road.  I look forward to staying here again so I may see more of what Denver has to offer.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great Place!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights in July 2011 and LOVED it! the staff was great, and understanding when i needed my passport to be sent to the hotel because I lost my license in Chicago- Midway airport.  The room and bed was comfy and being on the 7th floor, we had a great view of the city.  it was great, and we would definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don't Waste Your Money,"I selected this hotel because the reviews seemed reasonable, the cost was good and the hotel offered a free shuttle and breakfast.The rooms were clean, but in desperate need of updating.  Our room was hot during the day and never seemed to reach a comfortable level.The shuttle service was ridiculous.  What the hotel doesn't tell you is that the shuttle only (supposedly) runs at the top of the hour.  However, the top of the hour would arrive and no driver or shuttle would be in sight.  When asked, the staff would rattle off their policy about the ""top of the hour"" despite the fact that they weren't providing their service.  The staff in general had little knowledge about the area, the shuttle service or the services offered by the hotel.  Even when we received an answer about something, it would be contradicted by the next staff member we encountered.  Overall, this place just wasn't worth the hassle, despite the value.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,NEVER AGAIN!!!!,"Checking in was slow.  Even at 10 PM, it still took almost 30 minutes and there was only one person ahead of us and they were being helped prior to our arrival.  The staff didn't seem in any hurry even when the line grew to 3-4 more individuals behind us (5-6 people in line total).   Room smelled musty and stale, air conditioner never worked, and morning sun in our east facing room baked room to sweltering heat quickly in the morning.  I actually was violently ill for almost a week after staying here.This has to be the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in.  The only plus side of the hotel is it's convenient location to the intersection of I25 and I70.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Highly Satisfied, Excellent Hotel and Service","We paid half of same standard hotel of Denver Downtown, got same or more benefits than downtown hotels due to free shuttle service. free parking. Free hot breakfast was awesome. Room was very clean, customer service was excellent even though hotel was sold out due to Women's Basketball Final. First day of our  stay, we did not get extra towels/wash cloths etc.  due to mechanial problems with the washing machines.  Manager apologized a lot for this little inconvenience. Next day onwards during our entire stay, there were absolutely no issue. We are highly satisfied and definitlely stay in this hotel next time. It was our 2nd visit. Thank you Quality Inn Central Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Worst Quality Inn I've ever stayed in....,"I reserved and paid in advance for 2 Non-Smoking King Bed Rooms for myself and my wife and a friend.  At 10:30am on 3/31/12, we called the hotel and asked if it were possible for us to check-in early (as I had requested when paying for the rooms in Dec. 2011); the representative said we could check-in early, but not until after 1:30pm.  When we arrived at the hotel to check-in at 2pm (1-hr prior to their posted check-in time); the front-desk personnel appeared to be unorganized and genuinely unconcerned that the amount of time it took to check guests in (avg of 20 minutes).  At any rate; we were checked-in to our rooms.  Upon arriving to our respective rooms, both rooms had beds that were unmade, and my room hadn't been cleaned at all.  When my friend called the front desk to let them know that the bed wasn't made; she was told that the reason was because, ""check-in time wasn't until 3pm"" and since she had checked in at 2:30pm she would have to wait until cleaning services could ""get"" to her room.  After hearing the response my friend got from the ""Manager on Duty"", I went down to the front desk to ask for clarity, because I had a hard time believing that a hotel manager would make such a statement to a guest.  As I arrived at the front desk, I heard this same ""manager"" on the phone with someone I presume was another hotel guest, telling them the exact same thing my friend had reported to me.  I explained my displeasure t with the fact that neither bed was made, and that my room had not been cleaned at all let alone have the bed made, as well as the comment made by the manager.  The front desk person did offer her apologies stating that the Women's Basketball Final Four was in town and they had more guests in the hotel than they expected in a short period of time.  She did place us in another room, and offered to find another room for my friend (my friend decided to stay in the original room after the guarantee that the bed would be made immediately, which it was).  The 2nd room was clean and the bed was made.  However, there were NO towels, hand towels or face towels in the bathroom.  So, I called down to the front desk and spoke to the manager who assured me that 2 towel sets would be brought to my room.  Well, Sunday morning we woke, and were preparing to shower when we noticed that the hotel personnel did not bring the towel sets. This time I went down to the front desk hoping to secure towels only be told that the hotel was ""out of towels"" at the time and they asked me to check back around noon to see if they had towels available.  No towels were available at noon, 3pm, or 7pm either for that matter.  At this point, we were obviously frustrated.  Needless to say; we didn't get towels until Sunday night around 11:30pm!! Other guests shared with us that they too had gone without towels and some without hot water to shower during their stay at this hotel.  I stay in Quality Inn Hotels at least twice a month and I have to say that THIS Quality Inn Hotel is severely lacking in customer service and cleanliness.  I will never stay in this Quality Inn again and would caution anyone looking to stay here.  From this point forth, I will certainly pay the additional $30-$40 per night to stay at any of the other Denver hotels not named Quality Inn!!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Above and Beyond expectations,"We came to Denver to stay while my son had surgery and found this hotel.  The price was great!  Check in was easy and quick, Michael checked us in and was amazing.  Our room and bathroom were clean.  It's conveniently located next to a Village Inn, it was nice to be close to a restaurant and not have to drive anywhere.  When we checked out we left behind my son's Nintendo DS.  We called when we got home and they found it right away and promised to send it to us.  Somewhere along the way it was misplaced and we never recieved it.  I spoke with Steve who got on the situation right away and made sure that he kept me informed as to what was going on with locating the DS.  They could not find it and went above and beyond to help us out with getting another one.  The customer service at this hotel is excellent and the next time we are in Denver we will definitely be staying here!!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Best place, staff was great..","I really liked this place the staff was very nice and the breakfast was good. I wanna thank Steve the manager and Bianca they were awesome.. thank you guys..  If you wanna relocate to Colorado this is the place to stay it is centrally located so you can go out and explore.I am from Florida...thank you Steve and Biancasee you again soon,,,,",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Too Good For The Price,"Really is too good for the price but dont raise the price it was just right. I would  go back.  I never tried the pool because the beautiful front desk young lady mentioned it would be like an ice skating ring in this time of march. The room and bathroom was clean, my important items were left in the room when I went skiing and they were there when I returned, the bed was super comfy, breakfast was the same for the three days that I was there, but that don't matter to me we are in lent anyways. Overall it was excellent place, nice and quite. You can forget your toothbrush, they'll provide one but bring your own if you are going to judge and complain about the one that they are going to provide you with.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Everything we needed,"I came to Denver for an event at a downtown hotel, but that one didn't have a room available the first night of my four day meeting. So I found this one online and the price was good.  The room was very spacious, the front desk people were prompt and helpful, and there's a nice restaurant and bar off the lobby.  They have a shuttle service downtown, which I didn't get a chance to use, as I had already booked downtown for the rest of my event.  But I wish I'd have just stayed at the Quality Inn Central, because it was half the price and the room was bigger.  The breakfast was good.  I am vegetarian, so I brought my own soy milk and had their oatmeal and fruit.  I have no complaints about this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,The Best of the Best!!,"Once again our whole family made our track to the big city of Denver from the western slope of Colorado.Upon arriving at the Quality Inn,we were met with smiling face from Betty who remembers my family from past stays.Meeting our every need,which isn't so easy with my three grandsons,seven total with our tribe.Not only Betty,but Ivy,Steve,and not to forget Phil and the big boss,who greeted me,the grandfather Alvin Smith,with a smile and a hearty hand shake. In the evening for a few adult beverages,barmaid so cheerful.This is what all hotels should model themselves after,no dought about it.As I said this is the best if the best.Thank you so much and see you all next time !!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great place to stay! Highly reccomended!,"We stayed here the weekend of 1/28/12 we did not have a good experience mainly due to lack of communication between hotel staff. Since this incident, the hotel has stepped up and made things right. The GM of the hotel Raja went above and beyond our expectations to try and make things right...for this we are extremely grateful. Rooms, are very clean and homey :) we would recommend this hotel for a comfortable stay. One of their shuttle drivers by the name of Josh, was awesome, and if you need a shuttle ride, I highly reccomended him. He's a great friendly guy :0)",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good price,"I stayed at the Quality Inn earlier this month for a total of 9 nights after booking through booking.com. I had booked a King room with microwave and fridge, but on my arrival, I was told that such a room did not exist as King rooms do not have a microwave and fridge. I was given the choice of a King room or a Double Queen with microwave and fridge. Due to the length of my stay, and trying to keep costs to a minimum, I needed the microwave and fridge.The room was clean and tidy, and although the building itself is somewhat dated, the room was in good order and the fridge and microwave were both very new and clean (the fridge still had some of the delivery packaging in, it was that new!). The room was at the front of the building and as such a little noisy from the I70-I25 intersection right outside, but this didn't concern me too much. The windows were quite draughty, but nothing that couldn't be remedied by closing the thick blackout curtains. Television was dated (in fact it had a date of manufacture on the back as 1998) but it worked and did the job. There were plenty of power sockets in the room, something I am not used to and essential nowadays for charging laptops etc.. I was a little disappointed there was no safe in the room, but very small safety deposit boxes were available in reception, though they didn't look like they could house anything large. I left my valuables crudely hidden in the hotel room and nothing went missing at all.Breakfast was the most disappointing aspect of the hotel. Polystyrene plates, plastic cutlery and paper cups surprised me to say the least. I must admit I was expecting real flatware. During the second weekend, the hotel was very busy and it was not possible to get a seat at breakfast straight away. Although this only happened on two days, this was somewhat frustrating. The selection available was mundane, but the dining area was kept generally clean although I did see plastic cutlery dropped on the floor, only to be picked up by staff and placed straight back in the containers for guests to use. The price of meals in the restaurant in the evening looked reasonable, but I did not eat there. The bar also looked nice, but again, I did not make use of it.The hotel offers a free shuttle service, however, as I had a hire car, I did not use this. There was ample parking at the hotel at all times, even when busy.The hotel itself is in a fairly isolated location with nowhere to walk to other than a Village Inn restaurant next door. I did not visit this, but overheard other guests saying they found the food there to be good. Federal Boulevard is around a 5 minute drive away and a whole wealth of fast food and other restaurants can be found there.Overall, I felt that the hotel provided very good value for money and the only disappointment was breakfast. I would stay there again should the need arise.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Average Quality Inn,"The room was clean and comfortable and the price was just right. The location didn't feel very safe though and the car park feels up very quickly. If you were like me and didn't really care much about visiting downtown then the location is acceptable. Otherwise you might want to stay somewhere more convenient. But for the price it was great. There is a lot of rooms and I was put in one of the higher floors, so once inside I did feel safe. Though there was some complete idiot running up and down the lobby outside my room which was very annoying.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Two days  with alot of Snow,"We arrive late on 25th of october at the Hotel. The weather was bad and we had been a little lost because the signs a not so well display. At the reception the young guy wasn't very kind and try to give us the room as quikly as he could amd was not very helpfull about informations like restaurants near by and some store where we could find some drinks and food to bring to the room. The room was a little bit older and certainly need a a modernization. But by ourselves we find a grat bar and restaurant in the hotel on the other side of the road at the Holliday Express. They still ope until 10 pm and the bar have good music and a lot of folks having good times dancing country, salsa, latin rithms and etc. It was a good choice and we recomend, because the bar at Quality inn closes at 9 pm. After that in the mornig we were surprised with the attention from the girls at the front desk that help us with all the information we need and offers us a free shuttle to the 16th street , that I recomended a lot. We took the Van and all the drivers were very good and helpfull and also very concious about the time the needs from the different guest. Resuming different team and much much better. So because of these people I recomend the stay and say don't miss Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Good Price, No problems!","Went to Denver, CO for 5 days booked hotel through Booking Buddy. At first sight the hotel was disappointing...it wasn't amazing to look at, just OK! After checking in I found the staff very helpful and pleasant. The room was large, clean and well tended by house cleaning staff. I paid very little for my stay there and was not expecting luxury. Was expecting a clean room, nice bathroom, sufficient towels (white fluffy ones), plenty of pillows, warm blankets I wasn't afraid to handle ( nice white comforter on bed) windows that opened, handheld shower head, nice size bathroom appointed in ceramic tiles and stone..maybe a lookalike stone. I got all of this plus a breakfast that covered full range from eggs to waffles. What I didn't get and expected was a flat screen TV, pay per view...was disappointed. wanted to watch movies on rainey day...went to bar in hotel instead which was fun too. So, would I go back, sure. I'd book online through a booking service like Booking Buddy.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Poor Experience,"As others have said the location is not really great.  There is nothing around in this rather industrial area.  It's easy to get off 1-25 south to get to the hotel.  Not too bad from I-70 in either direction.  The hotel is older, kind of an 80's throwback, but it was pretty well taken care of.  I will also say that my room and bathroom were both clean despite the age.  When you view the hotel from the outside and it's location, you would expect the worst on the inside, but it was taken care of for the most part.  The TV was very old, but not really a big deal since I wasn't really there to watch TV.  I didn't hear my neighbors which was also good.Back to the location.  Yes it's true that they do offer a free shuttle to downtown.  However, I was only able to use it 1 out of the 4 times I needed it.  I found it was not very convenient and more of a hassle.  We ended up taking 3 cabs in total to and from.  Cabs to this place run between $15-25 off meter depending on how you haggle.  It's probably worth it to get the fare off meter.  Anyways, we spend about $70 combined on cabs!  Not worth it.  Drop the extra cash on a true downtown hotel and not have to worry about cabs or unreliable shuttles.Customer service was good for the most part until around 8:00 pm at night when we were in the lobby waiting for the only shuttle we were actually able to utilize.  After we were waiting for the shuttle (15 minutes late to depart), we witnessed one of the most horrific breakdowns of management and customer service I have seen in a hotel, let alone a major chain.  Two of the three front desk attendants began verbally fighting and screaming at eachother.  One male attendent began screaming at another female attendent.  They yelled back and forth, but the male was far more vocal, loud and began insulting her telling her to ""just go back to Mexico"" and other things of that nature.  His mannerism and tone was very aggresive and almost seemed like he may physically assualt her.  A second male desk attendent turned his back to the entire situation and acted as it was not going on.  Please understand this was at the front desk of the hotel, in the lobby, with patrons at the bar and restaurant both at witnessing distance.  I decided to defend the female employee without knowing what the true cause to the situation was.  I approached the front desk and directly told the male employee to ""cool down your tone with the lady"".  He proceeded to tell me, ""Sir, I am handling the situation.""  I countered telling him regardless of the situation that they were both exhibiting the worst customer service I have ever seen and telling him he was creating a hostile and uncomfortable situation for all of the guests.  He then calmed down and stopped his verbal harrassment of his female co-worker.  Such chivalry on the second male's behavior.  What a ------.  Soon after my intervention, and our shuttle was ready to depart, both males walked outside and smoked a cigarrette.  The non-attentive male proceeded to explain to my friend that the female desk attendent was new and inexperienced and they constantly have to do her job, somehow justifying the manner in which his male co-worker treated their female counter part. It was poor,unprofessional and showed a lack of control and management.  Unfortunately this staff meltdown combined with location and expensive taxi fares left a terrible impression on my view of the hotel.  I will not stay again.",2
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Pleasant Stay Denver Central,"I stayed for one night on September 29, 2011 for the annual GABF downtown convention center.  One of the perks that this hotel offered, is the shuttle service to downtown.  The shuttle dropped off a group of us at the entrance (really convinient).  Since I stayed out late I also got to enjoy the check-out at 12:00 most places have people check-out at 10:00 or 11:00 A.M.  I got up in the morning and had a mild breakfast and went back to bed until 10:30 A.M. that made the stay more pleasant.  This hotel served its purpose for me, thanks!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Keep Looking,"Affordable, that is the best thing i can say about it. we arrived in denver only to find out the shuttle to the airport was $50, we took a bus into town and waited for the hotel shuttle at a designated drop off point , where we waited an hour while the receptionis and the driver sorted out thier miscommunication, Irritated and ona time schedule we hopped a cab, beware this hotel is close to nothing at all. so if your from out of state or without a vehicle. the money you saved by booking this affordable room will rapidly vanish on cab rides and would be best spent in a slightly more expensive room downtown. My expierience there was average as far as rooms and cleanliness go, I spent all night listening to a bunch of kids from a rave arriving about 4am,opening,closing and slamming doors socializing from room to room all night long, when i went down to get some free hot breakfast and return to my room to eat in peace and prepare for check out, I was stopped by the hotel manager telling me i cant take the food to my room, It was against health code.... RIDICULOUS. i took it up anyway, and will never return",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Don't stay here,"We were looking for a hotel near the train station.  The hotel is not near it, and the driver couldn't find the interim location of the train station while Union station is being renovated.  The driver couldn't find the address we had for the location.  The restaurant is 0 stars.",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Thanks for an EXCELLENT stay,"Just a short note to say my wife and I have all good things to say about our  four day stay (September 15 through 18) at the Quality Inn.  Even though the hotel was crowded with the “gem” event…all went very smoothly. Everyone at the front desk, the breakfast area, and the bar area were so very friendly and helpful.  Church information and directions, approval to stay a couple of hours extra because of a medical problem, etc. Thank you, Bill & CarolHamburg (Buffalo area), New York",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,We loved it here! Easy to see from I25 and I70!,"We stayed here two nights, at the beginning of our stay and the end. We were so happy to be coming back at the end. The building is very easy to spot from the road. The breakfast had waffles, eggs, and more on it and was well stocked. The water was always hot and we slept very well at this hotel. We are already looking to book this hotel for our future Denver visits. It was so easy to get back on the highway .We have also stayed at the Marriot Downtown and this one I liked just as much! And saved a buck too!!Soo happy here!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Avoid it like the plague,"The Quality Inn Central is located in an area of Denver that looks like a third world country.  I couldn't believe the amount of slums there.  I didn't feel safe.  There is nothing within walking distance.  When I checked in my room had a very strong mildew odor.  The ""gourmet"" breakfast was a joke.  The eggs were tasteless.  Someone said they were instant eggs.  The ham had a funky taste and was dripping in grease.  The rolls were cold and tasteless.  Since there are no restaurants anywhere in that area, I had dinner at the hotel.  What a mistake; I should have known.  The service was non-existent.  I asked for directions to the Convention Center and they told me to look it up on the internet.   Since I couldn't get decent directions I took the ""free"" shuttle to the Convention Center.  The guy drove like a maniac, literally burning rubber when he took off and when he turned corners.  He had the radio blaring so loudly that no one could talk.  When I got ready to go back to the hotel I called the number they gave me for the shuttle, but gave up after 45 minutes and took a cab back.  The pillows were awful.  There was no workout facility.  The bar was supposed to be open to 10, but I went down at 9 and it was locked up.  There is no room service.   Avoid this hotel!",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Great value for the money,"Renovated older hotel.  Room was comfortable and clean.  Had 2 rooms, one with older TV and remote that didn't work well.  The other room had nice, large flat screen TV.  Free breakfast was very good with a better selection than most.  Not the greatest area if you want to go for a run or walk around the hotel, but the good news is that you didn't have to.  They had a wonderful and dependable shuttle service at no extra charge.  We went to see the Rockies play, and they dropped us off and picked us up right across the street from Coors Field.  Other guests in the hotel were just going downtown and they were able to take the shuttle too.  Sure made transportation around the city easy.  They seemed a bit understaffed at the front desk at times, but the staff was very helpful and customer service oriented.  We would stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Convenient to Regis U, sort of quirky, but a good stay","My son graduated in May from Regis University in northwest Denver.  Although we spent four years searching, we never found any decent accommodations near Regis.  The Quality Inn Central is probably the best combination of value and location we've discovered.  Driving directions below.This is a largish hotel, over 200 rooms, and not new.  The current owners seem to be engaged in a process of upgrading the property.  At the time of our visit, two new elevators had recently been installed.  They featured what appeared to be solid rock wainscoting and ceramic tile floors -- interesting decor choices -- but aren't they awfully heavy for an elevator?  The third elevator was not in service.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The price was right and included a good, hot breakfast buffet with lots of choices.  But, we had repeated problems with the key-card door lock.  The management was extremely friendly and accommodating, but the lock problems persisted.Now my son is back in Denver, looking for work, and sharing a house with old college friends in the Regis neighborhood.  If we go back for another visit, we will definitely book at the Quality Inn Central.  It was kind of a fun place to stay.Driving directions:  The hotel is somewhat isolated, across a set of train tracks, and bounded on the east and south by I-70 and I-25.  It's an easy exit from I-25 southbound at exit 48.  Otherwise, you'll exit I-70 West at Pecos street, turn north to 48th Avenue and right (or east) on 48th to the hotel.  To get to Regis from the hotel, head back along 48th to Pecos, hop on I-70 westbound to the next exit (Federal) and turn right (north) on Federal Boulevard.  It's two blocks to Regis (on your left).  About 10-12 minutes.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Good place for the money.....Good breakfast.....Great hotel staff!,"It took a bit of time getting checked into our room but once we did, all was well. The first room we stepped foot into smelled like smoke. They promptly put us in a different room, which smelled great but was not clean. We then got a 3rd room which also smelled of smoke. Finally the 4th room was great, clean and no smoke smell. They even included a fridge and microwave free of charge for all the hassle. We did not initially book a room with it b/c it cost an extra $10 a day and we were on a budget. I will say that the staff was very accomodating and were truly trying to resolve our problem. The manager even sent one of his staff with us to the last room to make sure we were satisfied with it.  I give them an A+ for customer service.They have a free continental breakfast which was great! The pool was heated and warm and my kids really enjoyed it. The room's are a little run down, but clean and roomy. Which is most important to me. If you're looking for a place that is upscale, etc. then this is not the place for you. I would reccomend this place because you can't beat the price per night plus free breakfast and free shuttle transportaion, which we used to go to the ball game one night. The only thing I wished they had was a fitness facility. The area of town where the hotel is located is kind of in a warehouse district area so there is not really great place to try and get out to exercise unless you were to drive somewhere.......",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Horrible Service!!,"This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The service was horrible, we never had clean towels and took hours to get them (finally went to buy my own) but couldn't wash them because only one washing machine worked, room service took for ever some days not showing up,, same breakfast everyday, even though we were told it wuld be different. For $75.00 a night a rip off and I would never recommend staying here EVER!! Everyone in my group complained about this hotel.. EVERYONE",1
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice hotel,Was a little worried when we arrived as far away from downtown. Staff were really helpful and they even have a free shuttle bus.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"Eh, average",This hotel was perfectly average. The room and inside were clean. I really liked the free shuttle service. We took advantage of it several times to go to the 16th street mall downtown and not have to worry about parking. It's pretty old and some updates are definately needed but overall it was ok. My major complaint was the ice machine was not working on my floor. That was a pain.,3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Nice for a Quality Inn but average overall,"We stayed here for just 1 night after arriving in Denver since we had a late flight. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere with not much around it besides a Denny's. It is a short drive downtown, but a car is required. Had trouble logging into the hotel's wireless network and the front desk had you call a 1-800 number for help. The room was older and the bathrooms could use a little update. Besides those things, everything else was very good. The check-in/out was fast. The hot breakfast in the morning was above average with a wide variety of foods. The A/C worked well. Bed was comfy and hotel staff was very nice. Overall it was a slightly above average stay. For the low cost, it was worth it.",3

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,I was absolutely satisfied with this hotel and will be back during my next visit,The hotel is very conveniently located very close to city. Got the room for half the price what I would pay staying at city in similar star hotel. Rooms were very comfortable and absolutely clean. Well done house keeping. The best part for me as a business travel was Hot Cooked Breakfast which was complimentary and the shuttle service to city  FREE OF COST. I felt staying in the city.Staff was very freindly and the GM and the owners who are present most of the times were very helpful and always willing to help.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,staff goes out of the way to help you,"Our stay here was during a very busy time as some soft ball event was going on. The ice got over in the ice machine (with people filling ice to take along at the event all morning, grrrrrrrrrr). When we told this to the front desk, we were told that they had made arrangement for extra ice in the lobby. We really appreciated this proactive behavior.We had some loud group staying on our floor, when we complained downstairs about this, they requested them to lower the noise. But kids never listen!!! So the guy downstairs was kind enough to promptly change our room and get our stuff shifted within 10 min.Will stay here if we visit denver againPS: the free shuttle service to downtown was a big help too!!!",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,worth every penny,"We made a last minute booking and since we were on budget we were not expecting anything exceptional.But we were in for a surprise when we got there. The rooms were normal but spacious. The best part was that the bed was super comfy. And not only did we have coffee machine in the room but refrigerator n microwave too But the biggest surprise was the breakfast. Usually complimentary breakfast just have cereals , canned juices n breads, but here we had bacon, eggs, danish, cupcakes etc. My daughter was delighted getting fresh waffle early morning. She also loved spending time at the poolside.If you are looking for luxury on budget, this is the right pick!!!",5

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Would recommend staying here if you are looking for a good hotel on a budget. Great for families.,"We found this hotel last minute based upon tripadvisor reviews. Before booking on expedia, we thought we would check it out in person. The hotel is not in the best neighborhood or location, but needed something clean and affordable for a week. And, it met our expectations. The person that helped us was very friendly and accommodating. Once we mentioned that we found the hotel on expedia, he was willing to drop the rate to match if we booked directly with them vs. online. Overall, the room was clean, maybe updated in the 90's, and included free breakfast in the dining room every morning. Breakfast was typical fare: cereal, fruit, eggs, and a pretty good make-your-own waffle bar. This saved us some money and time in the mornings. Room also came with a microwave, refrige, and coffee maker, which was a plus for us. Bed was comfortable.Would recommend staying here if you are looking for a good hotel on a budget.

Everyone - from the front desk people, to the waiters, to the shuttle drivers, to the manager - was extremely friendly and helpful.- Good value.  At $58 a night, the price was hard to beat.- Rooms are comfortable and fairly clean.- Shuttle service was a huge help as we were traveling without a car.  The shuttle will take you to and pick you up from anywhere within a five mile radius of the hotel.  There's usually about a half hour wait, but the service was invaluable to us.- Food was surprisingly good.  Salads were fresh, service was friendly, and the free breakfast was hot  - worth getting up for.Cons:- Location was terrible.  Very sketchy area of Denver, right on the train tracks, wouldn't even have felt comfortable going for a run or walking across the street.  Nothing worth visiting in walking distance.- Loud at night.  The hotel is right between two highways AND on the train tracks.  The train woke me up with it's whistle at 2 am both nights we stayed there.  Sleep quality was not great.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent wholesome experience!,"Recently stayed at this Hotel under new management. The place has improved tremendously from before.  They have very efficient room service, courteous and ever helpful staff, good quality, free delicious and hot breakfast, and comfortable rooms.  Their shuttle service is also good. This makes for an excellent experience overall.  We enjoyed our stay very much.  Now I would love to come back again while visiting friends in city, and recommend it strongly.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent value and amazing staff,"At Denver for a large convention. The Quality Inn Central about a 15 minute taxi drive from the centre oft an is a very good place to stay. One would not need a taxi as there are a number of shuttles to anywhere in downtown about every 15 minutes but more often than not on request.One particular incident of note that would not be routine was when our group of 4 wanted to go out for a dinner meeting (reservation) and the shuttles were delayed due to a baseball game in town, Mr. Aurobindo ( who we later found out owned the place) Drove us in his own car. This was something that was appreciated by us.Breakfast was good and the rooms are good value and large. An excellent stay and would Gladys stay there again and recommend this again.",5
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Mixed feelings about this place - good value but a few major downsides,"This hotel has some very good points. It's very good value for the money, the rooms are spacious, the beds are comfy and it's not at all noisy despite close proximity to i-25 and i-70. Most of the staff were kind and helpful, except one receptionsist who was abrupt and completely unhelpful but i think she was the exception. The breakfast is fine, not fabulous but not bad at all. The 3 big downsides that would put me off coming back again are the smell of cigarette smoke, the wi-fi connection and getting back on the shuttle bus. The first room i was put in stank of cigarette smoke (non-smoking room) although this was swiftly changed by Brandon, who was lovely. But several times during my staff the elevators smelt of smoke, as did the hallways - this is one of the problems of a hotel that still has smoking rooms available, it makes the rest of the hotel smell too. The wi-fi connection doesn't work well the higher up the hotel you go as the signal strength gets very weak so you keep losing connection. this is Ok for the occasional user, but i wouldn't be able to stay here on a work trip with such an unreliable connection. The other final word of warning for single travellers is about the shuttle bus. It's great to get into town, but be careful about getting back. I was told by the driver (who speaks very little english) that he's collect me where he'd dropped me off, but after waiting 30 mintues there, i phoned the hotel to be told that collection was at a different place. So i went there and wound up waiting on a streetcorner for an hour at night on my own. The hotel receptionist, who i called twice more to ask for an update, was totally unhelpful and just told me to wait and wouldn't even confirm if the shuttle was coming or not, let alone when. Denver seems a pretty nice city and the shuttle did show up eventually, but still, i don't like being left standing in the street at night in unfamiliar cities when i'm travelling alone.  So, it's a nice service to get into town, and fine to get back if you are with someone, but be very careful relying on the shuttle at night if you're on your own.",3
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Very Friendly and Surprisingly Good Value,"We arrived in Denver with no reservation on a weekend when the summer had gone on very long, there was the Denver Marathon and the football game was at home.  There were very few rooms to be had and this was about our tenth try.  The fact that they seemed to be the only hotel with rooms was a little worrying but it was absolutely fine.  We were very efficiently booked in at the advertised price over the phone and welcomed on our arrival.  The room was large and well appointed.  There was a general problem with the air conditioning and as the hotel sits on the junction of two highways opening the window was not an option.  When we asked about the air conditioning, two fans were immediately taken to our room.  The bar was fairly lively (a footballing crowd from Nebraska doubly excited by the forthcoming game and the sight of a contour).  The breakfast was standard but good and as much as you wanted.  The pool area was clean but a bit bleak.  The hotel is on the edge of town and that made it easy to find, easy for getting out to the sights but with no local entertainment or restaurants  However the drive into and out from the city was easy and takes about 15 mins.  Taxis are about US$30   Public transport always seems to have a bad reputation in the US and normally when I ask in hotels I get the ""why would you want to do that?"" look.  Here the receptionist pulled out a map and time table,  There is a local bus nearby and although the walk to the bus stop looked like a muggers paradise we had no problems and the bus driver and passengers were very helpful in showing us where to get on and off and chatting in general.   There was free internet in the foyer.  The hotel is easily located for journeys to or from the airport.  I can see this hotel hasn't always had the best reputation but it does seem that the current owners are trying hard and successfully to run an efficent and friendly budget hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,"This is a very friendly, clean and accessable hotel.","Everything at this hotel was exceptional, from the service ,to the beds , to the breakfast.

"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Excellent staff and service. This is why I would stay here again!,"The room was clean & bed was comfortable. It included a microwave/refrigerator. The front desk staff were friendly, welcoming, accomodating and all around outstanding, Especially Betty. She was warm, caring and made me feel like family. I've traveled a lot and never experienced such compassion from a hotel staff. Kudos to Brandon as well, who was a new employee! The breakfast was good. They also had coffee all the time in the lobby and 2 computers. They did offer free shuttle service to downtown.  It ran approximately every half hour to 45 minutes. When I wanted to return to the hotel, I called for the shuttle and didn't wait long.  The only downside was that the restaurant wasn't open for lunch/dinner every day.  It was only opened Thurs, Fri and Sat nights.  There wasn't a big selection of restaurants around there.  The Village Inn next door, which was similar to a Denny's and a restaurant/bar across the street at the Holiday Inn.  Also, there were no shops/convenience stores around so if you don't have a car, get what you need when you are downtown.  With this said, I would stay here again because of the quality of the staff. :-)",4
"Denver, CO",Clarion Hotel Denver Central,Boys night out,"I finally decided to take my two boys out and the Colorado Avalanche game. This was a spontaneous decision and I haven’t saved up for it, so I had to look for price rather than quality. Well I got both with the Quality Inn Central in Denver, CO. The location was less than 10 min from the Pepsi Center. The room was quit big enough for us and vary clean. The best part was breakfast. Breakfast is included with the room and is self serve… you also have the opportunity to make your own waffles (the boys loved this part). The service is outstanding the staff made sure that all of my concerns and need were taken care of.5 Stars from me!!",5

They told us that if we wanted to check in early then we’d have to $10 to check in 30 MINUTES EARLY, we only paid $60 per night so why would that be policy? So the boys came back out and told us so I went back in to talk to them because the rooms were in my name and again they were ignoring us when we talked to them, when we told them that we felt like they were being very rude and giving us terrible service one of the girls said that her manager told her she doesn’t have to smile or be nice and that we need to leave.

Close to the airport but would not recommend until they got new staff.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Average moderately priced hotel.,"Probably slightly below the quality you expect from your average LaQuinta.  The hotel is showing it's age a little.  They contract with a shuttle service that services @ 6-8 hotels and you should know that they do not start until 5 a.m., which means you're on your own for 6-7:30 flights.  The hotel staff did give us the number of a limo service that was very reasonable (only $27) and he was right on time at 4:15",3

Got to this hotel and the clerk refused to use the credit card that the reservation was made with because he didn't have it in person. I had to pay with my credit card. No breakfast due to COVID, except little cereal boxes. Hardly any snacks available in pantry. Called front desk from my room. Phone rang a dozen times with no answer. Room had weird angled walls. Bathroom didn't have a door that closed and locked. It was more of a closet door. No rails for holding onto for shower and tub.",2

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Meh,"Our recent stay was fine. Not good, not bad. First off be prepared to wait a long time for the shuttle to pick you up from the airport. The shuttle they use is used by multiple hotels along tower road. We waited approximately 45 minutes for the shuttle to arrive. Be prepared for there to be no social distancing on the shuttle. The hotel itself appears well kept, check in was quick as we were the only ones checking in at the time. Once we got to the room I immediately smelled a foul odor like sulphur in the hallway however the room itself smelled fine. Be prepared for a minimal at best breakfast. Cold cereal, milk, OJ and coffee were the options. If you can’t eat dairy you’re SOL.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointing,Clean facility but very disappointed with service level.  Booked 2 rooms and couldn't get a shuttle for all 4 of us unless we left an hour earlier or later than needed.  Shuttle in was jam packed and went to multiple hotels.  Asked if others wanted to go at the same time would they have another shuttle.  They said NO.

May, one of the front desk personnel, let someone into our room just based on them knowing our first and last name. That isn't right and is violating our privacy and compromising our safety. She then proceeds to tell us that it is their policy if they know our name they can let them in. We were very loyal customers and the fact that she was so rude to us when we were trying to resolve the situation is in fact why we will never come back. It's very unprofessional and she refused to take responsibility for her bad decision making. When we asked to speak to a manager she refused to give us a name or number to reach one. She told us that she had already spoke to a manager and they told her that she did everything right.

The next room, we walk in and immediately smell something like pet urine. I think, is this a pet friendly room or something? I call the desk again and he says it is. He never told us this when he moved us to the other room. And I have allergies. Again, never apologized, did not say one word about our inconvenience.So after dirty and smelly rooms, we left.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A stay to write home about,"Our experience with this hotel began before our stay did. Because of a confusion with our reservation I called the hotel before we left home. First I was put on hold while I listened to an ad about La Quinta having no tricks to offer. That should've given me pause right there.Once a human answered my call, I began to explain my question, and was interrupted by ringing on the line. A lady's voice thanked me for agreeing to listen to a promotion. What? Well, having some extra time, I listened for a bit before I asked if I was still speaking to someone at the La Quinta in Denver. No, I was talking with a super-friendly lady in Florida who wanted to sell me a great vacation deal. Hmmm.I answered a few questions, quite charmed by the southern-style hospitality, but as her spiel went on and on I saw my time was running out. First I tried politeness, and when that was not effective, I hung up.Still needing my question answered, I redialed the Tower Road La Quinta. I was  again stating my concern when a phone rang on the line, and someone with the same suspiciously gracious southern voice picked up. Incredulous, I redialed the hotel, and told them I was going a little crazy and they were NOT to transfer me to the number in Florida. And guess what, they didn't.So much for ""no tricks"".When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with friendliness and an attractive lobby. Our only initial disappointment was that there was no luggage cart available. Our rooms were on the fourth floor, and we were  with our elderly parents who do not travel light. However, bright spot! the elevator was working, so with two heavily laden people and two trips we got everything to our fourth floor room.Now we encountered our next issue. Our key card wouldn't work. Here we were, half our luggage in our room, half in the hall, and we couldn't get into our room. Back down the four floors to the lobby my husband fetched a new card. That one didn't work either. Another trip down to the lobby, and this time he returned with the man from behind the desk carrying several cards, none of which would open the door.So we were told to return to the lobby and someone would be sent to break the door. Never mind that our laptop and one of our phones as well as other luggage was stashed behind that door. We had to trust it would all be fine. After 15-20 minutes in the lobby we were invited to return to our room with a door that now worked. And our luggage was intact, to our relief.Everything after that was an anti-climax. Lukewarm water from the bathtub faucet? Every light in the room switching on suddenly while we were dozing off? By then nothing surprised us anymore.To be fair, the room was clean and fairly quiet and nicely arranged, all items of importance to us. Nevertheless, we don't see another stay at a La Quinta in our near future...",3

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Close to the airport without airport prices,"I stayed at the La Quinta Inn Denver airport in advance of my trip out of town. I was worried about the weather and wanted to ensure I'd be able to catch my flight.  I was not only pleased with every aspect of my stay, but I was happy to find that they had a shuttle that could get me to the airport and back to my car when I returned.  And it was less expensive than the airport parking!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Hotel for Dog Lovers,"It was clean, despite the large number of dogs, and the staff was friendly about it. There weren't any extra or hidden charges related to them either. We heard a dog bark here or there, but the rooms are well-built so it was not a noise problem, either.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great airport hotel,"There are many hotels on Tower Rd serving the airport, and over the years I have stayed in many of them. For the most part they are rather blah because travelers use them for a single night. The La Quinta was a delightful surprise. It’s rooms were larger than most and felt like a place one would want to stay more than ine night. Our room was very spacious, clean and quite comfortable. It c  as me equipped with a microwave, coffee maker and fridge. It’s bathroom was a step above most. The staff were friendly and helpful. It’s wifi was easily accessible. We’ll stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,No hot water for you!,"the price was right, but getting into the room the hair in the sink, the transparent toilet paper, the mattress cover that only covered the middle of the bed, most of all the luke warm water pretty much made up for the price.  Dirty, we won't do this again.  Dogs barking was not pleasant either",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Bad plumbing,Usually we love this hotel for early flights out the next morning. This time the lack of response from staff to call us back and let us know they could not fix the shower/tub that would not drain was a disappointment. We were already in bed so did not want to move to another room. We hope this was just a fluck and will still use them or try one of the other Wyndham brands.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Dirty,"Hair on bathroom counter and lots of hair on the floor. There was so much hair that it had formed into clumps that were floating around on the floor. I spilled water and when I wiped it up the cloth came up dark brown. Nice hotel, but very dirty.",2

The hotel is located so that it's easy to jump on a couple of main highways the entrances and exits at the hotel make it easy to access the parking lot,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,LaQuinta limits the size of families,Pretty good. Could use a little more focus on individual guests based off of reservations requirements. When you arrive late at night the last thing you want to do is hunt for and find missing extra sheets for the pull out bed when you have 4 small children.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,hotel,"This hotel has been newly remodeled and they have done a very good job.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Smelled like sewer in hallways.,Beds were not comfortable and pillows crinkled like plastic. Breakfast was very busy and ran out of some food after opening only one hour. The staff was very friendly and other than the smell the rooms were clean.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Good place, shaky shuttle service","Returning to the Wyndham from the airport was a near disaster with more people attempting to get any  number of motels than there was room in the shuttle. On cold days, be prepared with warm clothing because it may be long and chilly day as you wait for the shuttle. Run quickly when you see it.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Remodeled rooms,The website says”Remodeled” but when you show up to check-in yes lobby was remodeled and suites were remodeled but staff was not knowledgeable including management knows according to front desk staff.,1

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Can’t be beat, great hotel","From the friendly service, great accommodations, comfortable beds, clean all around, to the breakfast this is a great hotel and very convenient to the airport.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Thank you!,Thank you for renting a room to three young men from Michigan yesterday.  My son and two of his hockey team mates were stuck in the Denver airport for longer than they had anticipated.  They were not able to check in due to the length of time they had arrived at the airport before their flight.  They were stuck sitting outside of the TSA check point with equipment bags and their personal bags.  They called the La Quinta and inquired about a room for the day and explained their situation (and their ages....all three boys were 18) and the staff agreed to rent them a room for the day.  They were able to take the shuttle van over and spend the day relaxing (and studying for mid-terms!) at the hotel.  They would have been stuck at the airport from about 9am to 6pm if it hadn't been for you!!  So for this mama from Michigan...I send you my thanks!!!,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,LaQuinta Denver Airport,"Very nice stay.

Lovely garden area to complement the nice, neat hotel exterior.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Probably won’t stay again,"I had to catch a 5:30 am shuttle to the airport. I only grabbed a bagel from the breakfast offering. I had a question for someone at the desk, but there was no one available. Someone came out of the back room right as the shuttle driver appeared so I had no time to ask my question. I called from the airport to resolve my question.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Mixed bag,"This hotel is attractive, convenient, has a great breakfast, is well priced, and has some wonderful benefits like a lovely enclosed courtyard with a swimming pool, a delicious hot breakfast, and some of the most friendly and helpful employees that I have encountered. However, two things marred an otherwise delightful visit. On check in, the male desk attendant was rude and unhelpful. HIs unsmiling and impatient ""hello""made me want to walk out the door. When asked about the most accessible access from my handicapped husband, he glared, then eventually surlily directed me to a door and elevator that was far away from our room, and required working our way through two sets of doors to even get to the elevator. Boy was I surprised when we finally arrived at our room and found a very convenient back door and elevator just across the hall from our room.The room was clean, comfortable, well appointed, and easily accessible for my husband's scooter. The beds were comfortable and we slept well until 4:30 am when a group of about 4-6 people gathered in the hallway laughing, talking, slamming doors and banging bags around with no regard to others who might still be asleep. Because of my unpleasant encounter with the front desk on check in, I chose not to report the noise disturbance.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice comfy hotel with some room for improvement,"Our experience was a bit mixed ... The hotel is very comfortable with comfy beds, nice rooms and good facilities ... Pool etc. Breakfast was also good, though really didn't like all the disposable items.Our arrival was also a bit inconvenient...the shuttle bus only runs every 20-30 mins with no timetable so we took a taxi for $30 and despite booking a room for 4, the sofa bed was not made and we had to go down to get all the sheets from front desk.  Absent these experiences would have been a 5.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Very nice hotel, great staff","Had a late night arrival so stayed here - left my car a few days before - a 'reverse park & stay'. Very nice, accomodating staff. The property is very nice - comfortable rooms. I absolutely wil stay there again. And can recomend this hotel to anyone traveling through the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Conveniently located.  Very pleasant staff.  Other guests were a pain.,"I have stayed in many LaQuinta hotels.  This was one of the worst stays; however, that had to do with other guests having no respect for anyone and thinking partying in halls (with yappy little dogs in tow) was appropriate.  Other than that it was fine.",3

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"An Outstanding renovation in 2017 moves to lack of service,with the new Wyndham Flag, failure in service","I checked in on Monday 8/26 and was assigned 235 around 5:30.  The air was off so I turned on the unit and went to dinner.  Came back around 6.     The public areas Could of been cooler they were a little stuffy.   Going back to my room it seemed cool and about 8pm the unit without touching the  thermostatic started pumping out very warm area from the heater side.   The temp rose to,almost 80 and nothing I could do would bring the cool air back.   I call the front desk and they sent up a guy to work on it.    Before he arrived the unit started to kick out cool.    He arrived and while he was there it started kicking out heat again so he said they would move me to a new room.I am not giving the rating due to the issue but what happen from a service and the guarantee of a good night,     First none of the six carts could be found.    They assigned me 220 which was a good walk .  I had surgery two weeks ago and am limited on weight for the first 4 weeks of less than 5 lbs.   I went down stairs and explained I needed a cart the guy at the desk said they were all out,  the guy that came up and arranged for the new room had been called back to the next door room 236. Which had a mechanical issue with the door.    I explained to the two desk clerks I had a lot of luggage and bags of books and purchases  and needed a cart due to a weight  restriction.    The tall guy said I would need to look for them.  There. Was. 2. Clerks and he didn’t offer any help in moving,    The lady said she had moved,me to a closer room,  204.     Guess what it was right next to the elevator and all night long there was people coming and going.  They said that was the closest room and they were aware it would be really noisy because there was a gift for me on the night stand.   Ear plugs photo below.When I checked out,they ask and I told the, didn’t get any rest and the desk clerk said she would share the info with management,   It has been over 24,hours no refund of the,points, no call from management to discuss the situation.  This hotel has gone down hill compare to the high rating in 2017 I left.   The breakfast was ok but the purpose of a hotel is a,quiet,night and that was no where close,to,what I had,  the lack of any help by the 6’ strong young desk clerk for,this senior,citizen was no where to be seen by him or the lady that checked me out other than sorry.    Wasted points since they didn’t provide a good quite night,   I will be calling corporation in the morning.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great stay!,"We stayed at La Quinta Denver Airport after looking for a hotel that was close to the airport, and that was dog friendly.We booked directly with La Quinta and I called a few days prior to our stay to request a 10 am early arrival and a suite upgrade for my Wyndham status. The person I spoke with at the front desk put me on hold while they checked into the request and confirmed the suite upgrade and said they would allow the early check in if available at arrival.We got to the airport and went to the shuttle pick up spot and waited about 10 minutes for the shuttle and were whisked away by ourselves to the hotel. When we got to the hotel, we received a warm welcome to the hotel by the front desk agent and were allowed an early check in to our suite.The suite was located on the 2nd floor and was spotless and was very spacious. For dinner, we walked to the Ruby Tuesday next door (about 40-50 feet away). Breakfast is served daily in the lobby from 5-9 AM and features many hot options (eggs, biscuits/gravy, sausage) and a make your own waffle station, along with cereal and pastries and fruit. They also have coffee and tea out and throughout the day. If you’re looking for a hotel near the airport, I would come back here again!",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Customer service,"First time in Denver! It was a quick trip. Great stay. Clean rooms and comfortable bed. A little noisy in the hallway. I wanted to give a 5 star rating because of the two people that worked the front desk. Essence was very pleasant and helpful. I was waiting for her to finish helping the guy  in front of me and I smiled the whole time because she was doing a an excellent job. The gentleman had lots of questions. Jordon, who worked the night shift was pleasant and very helpful as well. When you walk into an establishment and you have an individual that’s rude, and poor customer service skills it sets a bad tone. Zoe is the reason I gave 3 stars. She has a bad attitude and horrible customer service skills. Really don’t know what her problem was, but she was my first encounter upon check in. I really had to ask myself, “is it me, or is she really rude?” Well I know it wasn’t me because few days later an employee confirmed my thoughts when he/she said “Zoe is a handful!” I  didn’t have to give any names because they knew exactly who I was referring to. Please send her back to training or place her somewhere she does not have to interact with people.  Your employees are a representation of your company!!",3

We had booked a room with 2 beds and a crib for our family of 5...  they oversold and gave us a king room but didn’t bother to tell us that at check in.

Thank you for accommodating young men of this age - many area hotels would not! The boys were impressed with the newly renovated, modern decor and they especially enjoyed the 24-hr gym and pool facilities. They felt the hot breakfast was adequate, could have been a little more upscale. But the location of this hotel was perfect - right next to restaurant options - and the hotel shuttle was reliable with airport pickups on the hour and half hour. Chevk-in and check-out was a breeze. And front desk was so helpful in responding to phone inquiries! Thank you so much! They'll be back!!",5

The pillows and bed were very comfortable which I rarely find in any hotel I stay.  The breakfast did have the make your own waffles that I expect and they had make your own egg biscuits which I have not seen in any place I have stayed.  The front desk person in the morning made a call to get me on a shuttle to the airport.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU RESERVE YOUR SPOT EARLY.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Close To Airport And Convenient For The Area,This La Quinta is close to the airport and convenient when you have to cover areas both north and south of Denver.  The rooms are OK but if you are a lite sleeper early morning flights can be disturbing. I generally stay at another hotel in the area but they were sold out so I tried the La Quinta.  Not disappointed but not really impressed.  The first floor rooms can be a bit noisy from both the halls and parking and should be avoided.Breakfast was nothing to write home about with other hotels of similar value offering more choices and better quality.  The coffee and the fresh fruit were good at least.  The bottom line is they are average.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Bait and Switch,"We're Hilton Diamond members and this stay was booked through AMEX concierge services.  This was our first stay in a La Quinta in over a decade, and it'll likely be our last ever.  This is a great hotel if you like being lied to and enjoy rude staff.  Additionally, the potential infectious diseases from the dried blood all over the lobby are a nice touch, if you're into that kind of thing.We arrived around 1020 at night, and had to wait for the apparent lone front desk lady (Danijha) to get off the numerous phone calls before we could check in.  We expected it to be busy as they were sold out.  What we didn't expect was the price change when we arrived.  We booked on thing, then called to verify and were apparently given 'wrong information that we were incapable of understanding.'  The front desk lady was slightly civil at first but became increasingly rude.  She gave us three different prices and four different stories for why 'we were wrong.'  I asked if a manage would be on duty in the morning and was given a curt 'no managers work weekends.'  The other staff member (Jordan) threatened to cancel our reservation and refuse service to us because we questioned the rates we were being given at the hotel during checkin (we had already paid and they wanted more).  When I inquired as to how many other customers have had this problem I was told 'allot.'  I then asked why it's so common and Jordan replied that I was 'incapable of understanding' in a VERY hostile manner.  While we were there waiting for my credit card to be returned (as I refused to be charged additional monies) we observed several other customers treated quite shortly and rudely.As an added bonus we received phone calls starting at 110pm on the room phone.  When we answered the caller hung up.  One can only surmise that they calls originated at the front desk.Bottom line, don't stay here unless you enjoy being treated poorly and the old bait and switch tactics.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Potential theft of CC number,"Hello,I recently stayed at the La Quinta early this month (June).  The hotel was fine, and our stay was enjoyable.  However, after returning from our vacation, and reviewing my credit card transactions, I noticed two fraudulent charges.  The card with fraudulent charges, was only utilized for our hotel stay.  And coincidentally there were two charges for $90+ at the same gas station on the same day, in Denver.  This review is mostly meant to make management aware of the issue, and if this is a reoccurring incident, I hope they will look into it.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Night Stay at La Quinta DEN airport,The staff were extremely helpful and the room was very clean.  The shuttle to the airport was easy and really did a great job getting me to the airport. The shower was great....hot and made you feel real clean. The bed was very comfortable and quiet....no problems.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient,Great location close to Denver Airport. Super easy check in.  Plenty of parking. Located not far from all kinds of shops and restaurants.Room was clean and comfortable.  Nice staff.  Good hotel breakfast the next morning to give us a head start on the day.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Does everything well ,"Like probably everyone else, we stayed just one night but as we had a late flight the next day, we spent a few hours downtown before returning, picking up our bags and finally departing. This was made easier by the helpfulness of the staff and the availability of the airport shuttle to enable us to connect with the A line from the airport to Union Station and then finally to connect with our flight. The rooms were large, felt newly fitted out and were super clean. Nearby restaurants were convenient though without a car, choice was limited. Breakfast was above average. We were very happy with the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Nice, Comfortable, Helpful","It was a very nice place with a helpful staff. The bus will take you to the hotel from the airport as soon as you get on, but it only leaves the hotel every half hour. Totally fine, but just plan accordingly.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great stay, EXCELLENT hotel","This is a very clean, modern LQ. Fast airport shuttle, right next to a Ruby Tuesday's not even 100 yards, very nice rooms. Fast check-in. Breakfast starts at 5am which is great for an airport-area hotel. We look forward to returning.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient stay,"Definitely the best LQ experience I’ve had since the merger.  I arrived really late, after 11pm, and the front desk staff was present and friendly.  Parking my rental car was a challenge, but the staff helped out with tips for finding the last few spaces, and I literally found the last space in the lot!  Property is fairly new and the rooms were clean and in good repair.  WiFi was strong which is always a plus. Walking distance to a Ruby Tuesday, Village Inn, and another Italian place.  Breakfast was the higher-end LQ fare, with sausage, potatoes, scrambled eggs, and biscuits/gravy added to the usual suspects.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Sleep 'n Fly,"After a fun-filled week in the Denver area, I turned in my rental car and spent the night at LaQuinta Inn & Suites.  The reception area is well-appointed and very clean. Nice area for lounging.  Computers available to print out boarding passes.  Attentive and friendly staff. Clean and comfortable rooms. No hallway odor noticed. Everything seemed clean and fairly new.  Shuttle bus is prompt in arriving to deliver you to the Denver International Airport - about a 10 minute ride from the hotel.  However, the shuttle only stops once and does not deliver to individual airlines - so it's a bit of a hike to ticketing or security.  Price exceptionally reasonable for the time spent there (for us, anyway).  Only downside was the coffee.  Undrinkable!  Rest of the breakfast bar - even at 4AM was okay.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent Hotel,"Everyone was extremely friendly and the room was very impressive.  Hotel is half a block from Ruby Tuesday and 1 block from Village Inn, which is very convenient for those who shuttled it to and from the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Quick Stay,"I needed a spot close the airport and this hotel nailed it.  I arrived very late in the evening (after 11pm) so it was hard with finding a parking spot but once I got into my room, everything was very nice.  I was only there for a few hours because I needed to leave early the next morning for a 6am flight.  I checked out at about 4pm so I could make the quick drive to return my rental car before making my way to the airport.  This hotel provided me with a good night's rest with a perfect location.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,My dog and I love this place,"When coming to Denver for business or pleasure, if possible we stay at this Laquinta location. I love the extensive grassy areas for my Jack Russel puppy and I love the ease of securing a dog friendly room.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice hotel,So recently stayed here for one night clean hotel but there are some cons about this hotel. first off the customer service when I checked in and out was not very welcoming and when checked out I get no how was your stay was everything ok nothing. Now onto the room i thought it was clean but then when I walked around I found things worth attention. First off the bathroom faucet was dirty will show in pictures below I also came across the top sheet of the bed had dog hair not very clean. Overall I would not come back to this location do to the customer service and room not being clean among other things I found.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Loud, locked out, terrible food","Arrived about 10 pm and checked in. A loud dog was already being complained about by several people near my room. After I couldn't get to sleep I called the front desk about the barking dog. Room was changed,but key wouldn't work. Had to walk down to the front office 3 separate times to get a working keyBreakfast was awful. No milk for cereal, which was all I wantedNo one available at check out. Rang the bell several times. Finally the shuttle driver told us all just to leave keys on the counter because we had to leave",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Long wait for shuttle, then was full",We had to wait a long time in the cold at the airport for the shuttle (20 - 25 min) and then it was too full for us to get a ride.  So then we had to wait for the next one.  Otherwise the staff and hotel were ok.  Options for heating water in the room were minimal.  The room was fine.  Carpet was kind of a crazy pattern.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice pool and hot tub daystay,"I really enjoy visiting this hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful, they serve an expanded free breakfast, and the have the BEST pool and hot tub of any hotel I have stayed in in the Denver metro area. The pool and Hot tub are enclosed in its own attached building, with large glass windows to view the outdoors, with easy access from the rooms. The only drawback is the tv service the hotel uses, which is Dish, which in my opinion only, for lack f a better word, sucks the signal was out for most of out stay on all but a few religious channels..but we were here for the pool and hot tub, so I guess thats' a moot point.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Relaxed stay,"Relaxing stay, true heated pool and whirlpool. Relaxed atmosphere, pretty quiet room and hot bar breakfast. Staff was friendly and professional! Some staff didn’t understand English but as long as I pointed out an issue it was immediately fixed. Great value for the price!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great location for Denver Airport,"I’ve used this hotel on a number of occasions when traveling via Denver airport from and to the UK.It’s a good location with good shuttle bus service to and from the airport.I’ve always found it to comfortable, clean and with friendly staff.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Overnight stay,"Check-in person was uncaring and did not make a good impression of LaQuinta Hotel staff.   Family has stayed at this location many times and never treated with nonchalant ""here are your key cards-have a good evening"" dismissal.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Aweful Hotel,"The front desk staff clearly don't like their jobs... they are short, rude and don't care about the needs of your guest. I've stayed a La Quinta hotels all over the country and other hotels around the world. This is by far the worse hotel in regards to the staff treatment of guests that I've every experienced. This was a three-day stay and we thought about leaving after the first night. The second day my wife and I were away from the hotel nearly all day. We returned to the hotel at approximately 9:30PM to find that our room had not received housekeeping services. We called the front desk and were told that housekeeping was not available and ""must have forgot your room."" I was then told, ""just use your old towels."" We went and had to sneak into the indoor pool area to get fresh towels for our room. The staff really appears to only be working for a paycheck because they consistently and repeatedly do not care about your guest. I would highly suggest pre-employment and random drug screenings for the night-time front desk personnel. You could smell the marijuana on his clothes and he clearly appeared, as my physician wife stated - ""Baked."" I will never stay at another La Quinta or Wyndham hotel ever again!!!!!!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,BEAUTIFUL,I stayed at the La Quinta for a week  because my daughter was getting married.the staff and service that we received was great. the grounds were beautiful.i was able to concentrate on the wedding but not the room.i can not wait to go back. it was centrally located with easy access. i can not wait to go back.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Quick overnight,We had a 6 am flight needed a close hotel with a shuttle. They picked up at 4:30 am no issues. Worked out great could use bigger in room TV. Check in fast and efficient set up shuttle for us. Had already started breakfast.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Best hotel on 6000 mile road trip yet,"To our surprise, this is a Laquinta, which is a brand I was never a fan of.  But since Wyndham has taken it over it turns out to be the best room of our 6000 mile road trip with our small dog.  Extremely comfortable bed, very well maintained, well designed and decorated room.  I highly recommend this pet friendly hotel.  Staff was also very friendly, room was spotless.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent choice,"I am not sure what the negative reviews are about.  I stayed in a King, room 306, and the room was fantastic.  Clean, large, comfortable.  Room had a Refrigerator, microwave, coffeemaker. This was a terrific choice.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Shuttling to and from DIA,"With the exception that early restrictions forced the original Denver airport hotels to be built way too far away from the airport, the LaQuinta (now LaQuinta by Wyndham) is one of the best of the Tower Road complex of a dozen or so hotels. All the hotels are about the same, so the key is which hotel's shuttle bus is most dependable. LQ's partnership with Western Shuttle is working.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disgusting,Thus the worst hotel that you are anyone you know could stay at. This is my second time staying at this hell hole (not by choice) and the first time it smelled so bad you could smell it before you pulled up at the front door. The mattresses are yellow and stained as well as the pillows the carpet is slick and black. The second time the lights were out on the front door and it was a lot of people just standing around smoking weed in the pitch black. It was the worst stay of my life and I travel for a living.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,comfortable and clean,the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. The lobby was very nice and the staff was friendly and helpful. We were flying out in the morning and we were able to leave our vehicle there while we traveled for a small fee. Some places in the area offer this service for free.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,untrained front desk staff and uncomfortable beds,"untrained and sometime rude staff at the desk, terrible nights with uncomfortable pillows and mattresses. all night a noisy pump is working and the elevator rings each time it passes by the floor. it's clean though.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great value!,"Great place to stay, Very clean and up dated. I highly recommend staying here. They do offer FREE airport shuttle also. The staff did an excellent job. The pool area was exceptionally clean and it's open 24 hours",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,False information. Terrible front desk staff/manager.,"I was on the phone with La Quinta inquiring about their parking policy. They said it was free for the first 7 days and then $10/day after that. I asked if it was the same if I booked through Expedia as they could not match the price and was ensured that it was. When we got to the hotel, the front desk attendants told me parking was $10/day. I told them of my conversation with La Quinta and they said that was not their problem and that if I wanted to leave my car, it would be &10/day payable right then or I could go park my car at another hotel. When I asked for a manager to help, I was told there was none on duty. They were unwilling to help in any way. If there is a difference in policy from corporate to an individual property then I as a consumer should not have to pay for it. Then to top it off, when we got into our room, all the towels were covered in hair!I have had an issue with a La Quinta in the past and this is the last straw! Never again! Note to anyone thinking of booking, get it all in writing!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Location,"This hotel is located close to the airport and worth the extra money to be close to one of the busier airports in the country. The shuttle service was great and on time which we appreciated both late in the evening and early in the morning. The front desk even offered to keep our ski bag behind the desk so that we didn't have to cart it to our room, a small but appreciated gesture. Our room was newly renovated and very clean. It was rather large and had plenty of space for us to re-organize our things after a week long skiing adventure. Breakfast had lot's of options and the staff were freindly. Will certainly stay here again if I need to be close to the airport!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great value with ease of transport to airport.,"No problem with the Park and Fly package, great transport to and from the airport.  We were able to check in early with the friendly staff who explained our pickup plans and signed us up for the VERY EARLY pickup up time for the early flight.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,bad experience,"Breakfast was good and the room was clean... that's all I can say was good.  TV didn't work, desk outlets didn't work, squeaky headboard with every move made, pokey pillows, microwave broken, the worse though was the NO Toilet Paper and the front desk would not bring any when I called and asked for some. To top it off the front desk staff exhibited no sign of remorse or compassion on my plight.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great location near the airport,This hotel overall was exactly what we needed. We had an extremely early flight and just needed a reasonable place to sleep for one night close to the airport. Location was great. Safety was never a concern.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Birthday Holiday,"Overall a very pleasant and comfortable place to stay.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Efficient and friendly even in severe adversity,"I stayed there during the bombcyclone blizzard of 2019.  It  was totally full and weather extreme, airport closed. Despite this, the hotel functioned well. Clean, very comfortable.  The front desk staff kept their cool and were friendly and efficient.  Despite the travel problems it was a true respite from the storm.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Hateful front desk service. 😡,"I can’t understand why my debit card was been declined so I try to explain the lady that I had already paid for my stay, she got mad and start yelling at me in front of people and my kids. Why ??? I wonder if they realize that a business survives from customers and that their pay check come from them. There’s not reason to be hateful or ugly with customers. Yes I know that some customers aren’t the best sometimes but I didn’t consider that I talked to her ugly, and that guy named Travis that wait on my when we check in take my money for 1 night stay and didn’t wanted to give me my room key till I pay for the 2nd night. I explain him that I wanted to use cash since I didn’t got time to go to the bank before I came and even make an offer to leave a deposit if I need to, and no he didn’t give me the key and make wait for over 30 min with my kids till someone else told him that what he was doing was completely wrong????? What is going on with customer service. Oh and to be clear just Front Desk, the cleaning staff and the rest of the staff are very friendly",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver Airport La Quinta - overnight stay,"The free shuttle service ran very smoothly, I didn't have to wait long to be picked up. When I called for shuttle information, the receptionist gave me very easy to understand directions. I was able to find the shuttle with no problem. Check in was also very fast. The room I had was recently renovated, updated and comfortable. Water pressure in the shower was high and toiletries were provided. I was able to get a good night's sleep. There was a decent variety of food at breakfast and several kinds of coffee. Shuttle back to the airport was prompt and efficient. Overall an excellent experience!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great overnight stay before early trip from DIA,This is my go-to hotel for Tower Road.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Poor customer service!,"Had to get room keys reset everytime we needed back in our room! The girl at the service desk kept telling me to keep my card away from electronics, that is funny in my back pocket next to NOTHING! Wow",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disgusting!,"Never had the need to write a review before but this hotel has got to be the single most disgusting one we have ever stayed at!  Sofa bed had food all over it and chip bags.  There was hair all over the bedding and stained pillows.  Front desk attendants didn't seem to care too much.  Message to manager left unreturned.  We'll cross La Quinta off a list for a long, long time.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,we were happy with our visit,thank you for up dating the hotel it is a pleasure staying here again it was time to fix the rooms and public areas. The Hotel is just so well located to the Airport. The Staff is very accommodating and pleasant. Keep up the good work and we will be back soon again.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,works in a pinch,"unless you have no other options go elsewhere. Staff does not go out of there way to be welcoming or accommodating. Rooms are so-so and not so clean, beds need replaced (our experience)Hotel does provide shuttle to airport and she was great! staff should take lessons from her.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay while flying to and fro from DIA,"Very nice, new hotel - clean, quiet, reasonably priced.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good choice for airport hotel,"I needed a hotel after my evening flight got canceled because of a snowstorm, and this was a good, reasonably priced choice. There is a newly remodeled lobby complete with a welcoming fire in the fireplace. The room was clean and modern, with a big TV, nice big bathroom, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, desk etc and comfortable bed. The breakfast buffet had a lot of choices, from eggs and sausage to waffles to cereal to bagels, as well as apples and oranges. Yes, the eggs were pre-packaged circles and not made-to-order omelets, but at the price point they were fine. The shuttle service was prompt in the morning and as prompt as could be expected during the snowstorm. Be aware that multiple hotels use the same van, so you need to keep a sharp eye out for the right one. There are several places to eat within easy walking distance. I would definitely stay again if I needed an airport hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good Value,Used LaQuinta's park stay fly option which was competitively priced. Hotel was in very good condition.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice! ,"We only spent one night here at the fifth floor. The hotel is very nice, newly remodeled with very comfortable beds. A size smaller than a queen but very comfy. Breakfast was adequate but nothing to rave about, it can get pretty busy down there as we noticed around 8:45 am when we left. Staff at the reception was very nice, the guy working the night of Thursday January 10th around 11 pm was extremely nice and accommodating. Sorry I forgot his name, but after a 10 hour drive it was great to be greeted with such good manners. Would definitely return.",5

Service waa good, rooms nice, breakfast normal for LQ.I would like to say that this hotel does have lots of receptacles for pluggibg in devices and such.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Front desk,"I was at your hotel last week with my friend overnight because we had an early morning flight. Nice room, great amenities, but what stood out was the front desk clerk Zoe. She was so helpful and friendly. She spent time with us explaining where everything around there was. You rock Zoe!!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great airport option,"Great location for a next day early morning flight. Fair price. Clean rooms.  Attentive staff. I had to leave so early, the front desk prepared a nice “to go” breakfast for me. Only complaint was thin walls.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay close to Denver Airport,"This hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We arranged our early am shuttle to airport upon arrival the night before. Bathroom and room were spacious and clean and comfortable.If i ever need a hotel to be near Denver Airport again, I will return. Their student (college) student rate was less than the AARP rate! Call hotel directly to get better rates than online or thru call center!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Stay,"Check in was easy and smooth.  The rooms were clean and modern.  Had my bills ready to go at 2:30 in the morning as we had an early flight.  Shuttle service was on time, and dropped us off where we needed to be.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Raw Sewage Odor,"The entire hotel smelled like raw sewage and it got worse as the night progressed. When I called the front desk to ask why, I was told they had no idea. They recommended I open my window, in 30 degree November weather. I called the Denver Health Department and reported the situation. We frequently fly in and out of Denver, but we will never stay here again.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Low end hotel,"We stayed overnight before an early flight.  The hotel seemed nice when we arrived, but we soon found it to be 'low-end' in many respects.  For example, there was a lot of noise in hallways that kept us awake.  Paper products in the room were cheap.  Breakfast was what you'd expect in a cheap motel (circular egg things, watered down coffee, etc.).  With all the hotels available at DIA, we would not stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Fantastic stay! ,"We have 3 small children and had an overnight lay over so we shuttled to the hotel. The shuttle staff was extremely friendly and understanding of my kids. The hotel was nice and clean. Looked like it has been remodeled. The room was nice and spacious. Tv didn’t work in the living area were my kids were but the other one did and they made do. The shuttle was on time and nice in the morning. The breakfast was great and abundant. The staff kept refilling without any issue. We stay at la quintas all the time. This is the best one we have been to, we will definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"New Remodeled, Big Room, Thin Walls","The La Quinta is in a great location near the airport and also near a few dining options. The newly remodeled rooms are nice and the bed was comfortable. I was also impressed with the size of the room and bathroom. Only point off is that I could very clearly hear everything happening in the room to the left of me. I believe this was part due to the the connecting door having a large gap between the door and the floor, letting noise flow freely. My neighbor wasn't being overly loud, but I had to turn on a white noise program on my phone to go to sleep.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice place to get stuck in two days from a snow storm,"I arrived in downtown Denver on a Saturday night from a scenic train from Oakland,CA. I decided to stay near the airport for lower rates and better access to rental cars, forecast was for 1 to 3 inches of snow, but a blizzard moved in with 4 to 6 inches and I couldn't take a rental car to explore around the area. Discovered this newly remodeled motel (see picture of the lobby) had a first class pool and exercise area so I just stayed here the whole time except for walking across the street to one of the two restaurants available within walking distance. The next morning when I was leaving for my flight I made the mistake of leaving my IPAD on the table in the lobby. I called from the airport and they were nice enough to mail it back to me in Vicksburg. I highly recommend this place to stay at in the Denver area, for its lower cost and nearby access to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nicely renovated and remodeled,The clerk on the desk went out of his way to walk us to 5th floor and open the room when we having issues getting the card key to work. Didn’t get his name but he was the only one on staff the evening of November 14 at 10:30 pm.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Shuttle never made it,"Scheduled the shuttle for 6:30 to catch flight at DIA. Front desk kept calling and was told 2 or 3 minutes. At 7 another companies shuttle dropped a lady off, but said it was not our shuttle. He was with a different company.  5 minutes later he came back and picked us up and then went around to his scheduled pick ups. Never saw the La Quinta shuttle. Have had shuttle trouble there before. Also, they never get the wake up call right.  Adios, La Qunta.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent Stay,"Stayed overnight using the ""park and fly"" option. Lots of parking spots and seemed very secure. Shuttle service to and from the airport was on time and efficient-drivers were friendly. Was not able to sample the breakfast due to early flight.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay somewhere else,"The TV didn't work, even after I called and someone came to fix it.  Three minutes later it didn't work again.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport stay,"This was a great place for the price. We used the week of free parking for our stay and vacation.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice hotel,Nicely remodeled with a very modern decor. Nice fitness center with free weights. Breakfast was good.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Beautiful Location,"One of the cleanest and nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. Will definitely be visiting again. Hotel was very nice. Room was spotless. Took the shuttle in the morning, it was reliable and prompt. The girl at the desk that checked me in was provided great customer service.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pet Policy,"We usually try to stay at La Quinta because if traveling by car, we have a pet and appreciate your pet friendly policy. That is all I have to say, but the Trip Advisor post requires more characters and apparently I did not use the minimum to exit. I am thus not impressed with Trip Advisor, but am very happy with La Quinta.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pretty good but dont like dogs in the  restaurant,"Shuttle good, check in quick, room big and clean. The hotel had a new fresh appearance. Dinner next door at restaurant was convenient and an Italian  restaurant 200 yards away. We thought the breakfast was poor quality compared to some other La Quinta and don't like to see dogs in the restaurant.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent as always,"I have stayed many times at this La Quinta, and always have excellent experiences.  The business trips with meetings in the conference room run smoothly and personal stays are nice.  Always friendly staff and clean rooms.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice hotel stay,"The stay here was great, rooms nicely furnished, better tv premium channels than a downtown Major chain hotels, breakfast was nice with free shuttle to airport, I will stay here again. I am a travel agent and would put my upscale business clients here and know they will be satisfied.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pet friendly and has a great breakfast selection!,The lobby was beautiful and would book there again. I am a fan of all La Quinta's but this one stood out with the fresh paint and updated rooms. I was impressed as well as my partner and dog! Great job!,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay near DIA,We stay here when we fly out really early from DIA.  The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.  We haven't had a chance to experience the breakfast yet- leave way too early for it!  Would definitely recommend!,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,BED,The mattress was very bad.  The mattress pad was hard and wrinkled under the sheet which made it hard too sleep.  Reminded me of a pad under a childs bed to prevent them from wetting the bed.  Also was not told we could not park car while flying for 2 days.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great room, but...","I was in Denver for a one day business trip so instead of hassling with traffic, I decided to stay at the La Quinta Denver Airport as it was close to my meeting location.  The hotel is relatively new and it is in great shape in terms of the room and the breakfast area. My only complaint was that there was some sort of machine or equipment that was making a droning noise most of the night and I was only able to get about 3 hours of sleep.  When I went out of my room this noise was in the hallway and in the breakfast area, so I know it had nothing to do with my room itself.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Airport Hotel,"Very nice airport hotel.  The rooms were very clean and spacious.  The hotel was quiet and everything appeared newly renovated.  Beds were comfy. Made an appointment for the airport shuttle and it was right on time.  The breakfast was hot with a variety of items, including eggs, bacon, potatoes, biscuits, waffles, yogurt, and fruit; and started at 5am for early flights.  For the cost, it was a steal and I would stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Surprisingly Nice!,"My husband and I needed to stay close to the airport for a very early departure in the morning.  We chose this hotel as the accommodations and the price seemed to be the best of the mix.  We were happily surprised to find a very nice lobby with comfortable seating.  My sister and her husband came over and it was like being in a nice living room as we sat by the fire.  The room was even more of a wonderful surprise!  Everything was new, nicely furnished, particularly comfortable bed.  The size of the room was great!  Nothing was cramped and we had everything we needed.  We were really impressed as we were expecting a bare-bones hotel just to get through the evening with a bed and shower. Instead we had a lovely, clean and comfortable stay!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Sewer gas odors, not a good experience","We arrived here in late evening, dog in tow, in route back east.  We previously have stayed here and thought we would give the property another chance.  When I walked into the lobby this time, there was an awful smell.  When I inquired about the obnoxious odor, the front desk attendant told me they were working on the sewer pipes and it has been going on for some time.   Since it was late, we decided to stay.  After lugging our luggage and dog to our assigned room, we found the door key we were given did not work.  Upon entering the room, the toilet seat was broken.    Not a good start.   On the positive side, the room was large, the bed was comfortable and they do accept dogs for no extra charge.   Breakfast is the typical La Quinta mess hall spread.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A great option among Tower Rd hotels!,"I always price compare LaQuinta because they give us a 12% military discount...sometimes it is not the best rate (Spring Break 2018), but we were traveling at non-peak time for this trip and I was pleased with the price.  Their free breakfast is always great!  My flight was to depart at 6am and they have a 24-hr free shuttle, so I was able to get the 3:30 a.m. shuttle.  It was a quick ride at that time of day, just keep in mind, this shuttle is not exclusive to LaQuinta...they pick up at other hotels, so give yourself some extra time.  Otherwise, the accommodations were clean & comfortable and within walking distance of restaurants.  I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointing,"Stayed here night of October 9 after getting stuck in Denver overnight due to weather and without our luggage. Booked through American Airlines.  Arrived at 8 pm and when getting ready for bed, discovered there are no amenity kits with toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving items, shower cap, etc.  Asked at desk and was told I could buy them in their store, but not everything was available.  The next morning at a 4 am wakeup, we discovered there were only hand towels in the room--no bath towels.  We didn't have time to get more towels before leaving, so used hand towels for shower!  When I mentioned the lack of towels when checking out, the desk seemed indifferent.  On the plus side, the breakfast was excellent and the shuttle service also.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel near the airport,"Stayed here overnight, came in at 11:00pm. Check in was easy, I had reserved the room, prior to arrival. The room was beautiful, new hotel I think. Great breakfast in the morning, and shuttle back to the airport. I would definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Inexpensive, convenient & safe","On a recent overnight trip to Denver I stayed at this property. I liked everything about this hotel except that the door between the adjoining rooms was so thin that I could hear snoring from the next room. Except for this one thing, this hotel is a very good value at the location.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,I.f. from Alabama,"The room was not clean. Had dog hair in the carpet. Mattress was wore out and AC didn't work well. We ask to be put on fifth floor, but was assured the room had been deeply cleaned. Not worth the high price you have to pay.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice,"The hotel is very conveniently located near the airport, with restaurants right next door.  So we were able to walk there. The rooms were very clean, lobby is beautiful and service was excellent.  Nice breakfast also starting early for those with early flights.  Free shuttle to airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Comfortable rooms, good location, shuttle service, decent breakfast","Everything was fine w/exception to the front desk staff -- when our door key cards were not programmed and we had to return to the desk to get them keyed after wandering the halls looking for our room (for some reason, the rooms were not in sequential order) and finding out they didn't work, the nighttime front desk clerk didn't even apologize for the inconvenience.  The mornring front desk clerk was pre-occupied w/the computer she working on and I don't believe ever made eye contact with me for the 3 interactions I had with her (checking out, asking about shuttle, and business center).  It's too bad because otherwise I would have given a 5-star rating.  Maybe mgmt may want to investigate why these particular employees don't seem happy -- could be they need some morale boosters or maybe management itself is the problem, not sure.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver airport,"Hotel good overall, fairly quiet and pool/hot tub nice. The only issue I had with this hotel is that when they remodeled they installed a new heating/air system that did not allow for the fan to be put on continuous use. I am a light sleeper and like to run a fan for to cover up any small noises.  When I fly I do not have access to a fan like when I drive.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very recommendable,"Pet-friendly hotel near Denver airport. Lovely room with everything you could want for. The only downside is that breakfast is open only until 9am, not ideal when you arrive very late the night before like we did. Otherwise everything is perfect!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent!,"This hotel was fantastic! Much better than a lot of higher priced hotels. It was modern, up-to-date, extremely clean. Had a nice courtyard, pool and exercise room. It is very pet friendly, has a computer and printer for use for free. The staff was very pleasant and very accommodating.  I would definitely recommend this hotel, and would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Hospitality Oriented,The staff is always friendly and very helpful! The location is about 20 minutes from the airport. The breakfast is always good. Love the make your own waffles bar! Ruby Tuesdays is a very short walk away.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel,I was able to book this room at the last possible minute after a storm closed DIA causing me to miss my connecting flight home. This is a very nice clean new hotel. The breakfast started at 5am so I was able to eat prior to an early flight.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great for a quick stay.,"We stayed here before catching a flight out of Denver. The room was very nice, very clean and comfortable. It was a little pricey though, like all of the hotels near the airport. The bathroom doors are a little strange but everything else was great.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great room and service.,We would give our stay at this LaQuinta a 10.  Very nice place and kind people.  Would like to see fruit on the menu for breakfast.  Will stay here again when in Denver. We appreciated the military discount and they all thanked my husband for his 26 years of service.  That was so NICE.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Last minute reservation at end of vacation,"Called hotel to make reservation for our last night of vacation before flying out the next morning from Denver International Airport. Was given price for night and said I would take it. Somehow between accepting the room and giving my credit card number over the phone the price went up. ??? When I questioned the price discrepancy I was told sorry the price went up while we were talking. Did I still want the room? I took the room anyway because I was tired and did not feel like calling around for another room. Hotel has been recently remodeled as promised and room was clean and nice. We stayed in a Deluxe King room on the first floor. Hotel is pretty noisy but I expected this being near the highway and the airport. Front desk staff was very friendly on check in. Free breakfast was nice. Had waffles, eggs, cereal, yogurt, fruit, and more to choose from. Would recommend this hotel if looking for something close to airport.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay and Go,"We stay at the La Quinta Denver-Airport when we have a early flight out of DIA on the following day. We keep our vehicle at that facility, on our return flight back we stay another night before going home.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Clean Comfortable Perfect Location,"We stayed after the Denver game on Sunday night. Quiet, clean, spacious and comfortable. Staff was efficient and check-in was a breeze. Bed was great. Shower was nice. We were on 4th floor, no tub, but we didn't need one. Great value. Breakfast was hot and ready at 6 am, we grabbed a quick bite and headed to the airport. We always stay at La Quinta if there is one in the area.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Needs Work,"The hotel needs work… night staff was not friendly, did not want to be there. The bed sheets were old and needed to be replaced. The bathroom needed two rolls of TP ""not one"". There was no shampoo in bathroom.  The bathroom sink moved all over the place, needed to be replaced. The back of the bathroom door needs to be repaired and then painted. The pillows were very soft... Need a couple of pillows with different hardness.  D Tirado",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay afyer cancelled flight,"Our BA flight was cancelled as we were boarding and we managed to get a room here.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A Pleasant Surprise,"Appeared to be recently renovated, if not new.  Attractive interior from reception/large breakfast area to the rooms. Way above average LaQuinta.   Either there were no pets in rooms (doubtful) or the insulation is terrific as we never heard any pet sounds.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Hot Mess,"Night desk service was so bad, not helpful, seemed like we were a bother. Breakfast  was not ready at 6:30 and the eggs looked like and tasted like they had been rewarmed from the day before. In the morning we found dirty underwear in our room. which needless to say was disgusting, we notified the front desk on check out.  Morning staff was very friendly and apologized and said management would call us....no one ever did and because of the lack of response to someone else's dirty underwear in our room, I feel the need to post our experience on Yelp and TripAdvisor.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Nice Hotel,"Very clean and pleasant staff.  Stayed one night before our early morning airline departure.  I wish breakfast had been put out earlier than 5:30 a.m., as we had to leave at that time and only coffee was available.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,The Worst Ever and Here is Why,"I am normally loyal to La Quinta, but this property has to be the worst of them all. They missed the mark of so many levels. I do not blame LQ for the people  who choose to stay with them, but I do blame them for the quality of the rooms, the lobby, the grounds and the staff, PLUS how the staff reacts to concerns and complaints.We arrived September 5, 2018, checked in for four nights and went to our room which was the furthest from the front desk only to find it was the wrong room type. We hiked back to the desk, got a new room and moved our luggage to room 112. This room happened to be an adjoining room with room 110. We should have stayed in the original room.We noticed right away as we entered and unpacked:•	Room door did not fit properly and had to be pulled three times to close completely, resulting in three loud thumps.•	No luggage rack.•	The closet door would not stay open and slammed shut on its own.•	No water cups.•	The bathroom had a split door and both had to be pulled closed and thunked.•	One bar of soap.•	There were only two very small dresser drawers, perhaps 4” X 12” apiece, that could not possibly accommodate two adults with belongings meant for four nights.•	The TV would turn on, but had no channels loaded. We loaded the channel lineup only to find the remote would not move channel up/down and the volume did not work. We unplugged it eventually and got it to work. We never could get Netflix or streaming to work, as the screen advertised, to work.•	And we were given only one room key card and had to visit the front desk again.It had been a long day for us, so we went to bed about 9:30 PM. Room 110 had the light on and left it on all night long. Normally, this would not present a problem, but the adjoining door was not a good fit for the frame and light showed around the entire frame (about two inches on the floor edge). Room 110 decided it would be a great idea to turn on TV and leave it on ALL NIGHT LONG. Had we not been exhausted, we would have dressed and gone to the front desk one more time.In the morning, we complained to the front desk and we were told that Room 110 was checking out. Okay, good. Problem solved, except it wasn’t because the front desk was not truthful about the check out. We had breakfast, went back to the room and the key cards were no longer programmed. We had to go back to the front desk. To this point, none of the encounters with anyone at the front desk had been pleasant and this one was no different. The male clerk acted as though we had done something to the cards when he said, “I programmed these myself.” A more appropriate comment would have been, “I’m so sorry this happened.”We were gone all day Thursday, September 6th, returning about 6 PM. It had been another long day, so we got to bed around 9:30 PM. Around 4:30 AM on Friday, toilets and showers started. Newer hotels are more soundproof, but not this one. Suddenly, at 6:00 AM on September 7th, the alarm began ringing in Room 110. It continued for 45 minutes. My man went to the front desk where the alarm could easily be heard. He complained and was offered a new room on an upper floor. He asked to see the room and was given a key card. He went there and the key card would not work. He walked back; the clerk was once again snarky acting. The clerk recoded the key, my man visited the room again and still it would not work, so he went to hotel next door and made reservations for the remainder of our trip.When he told me we were moving, I began to pack and I will admit, I was not quiet about it. The alarm ringing in Room 110 was the final straw for me. I turned on the TV, a bit louder than I normally would have, but it was obvious the neighboring guest HAD to be awake. I didn’t do anything to mitigate the noise from the doors in the room. That should have been handled by LQ long before we arrived.I went to the front desk to check out, thinking my man might create a scene. The desk clerk was on the phone and asked the caller to hold while she spoke to me. I told her we were leaving early. She picked up the phone and told the caller that Room 112 was checking out and she would call back. I asked who was on the phone since it was obviously about us. She said it was the Manager who had a complaint from Room 110 about excessive noise. I told the clerk that we had complained a day prior only to be told that the excessive noise from room 110 would stop because they were checking out. I told the clerk they left the lights and TV on all night both nights and we were not given a satisfactory resolution. My final statement to the clerk was that she had a real problem in Room 110 and it needed to be investigated. Have you heard the phrase, “Hello Wall”? That is apropos here. The clerk never asked how she could solve the issue, never offered another room, never seemed concerned that we were upset, never apologized for our complaints having been ignored. What I find hard to believe is that this LQ was not in an isolated area. It is surrounded by many hotel properties with similar pricing. The one we moved to had a better room layout, was larger, much quieter plus less expensive. And I was pleased to find a staff with customer experience at the forefront of their approach. So skip the LQ and reserve the Fairfield/ Marriot which is right next door.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great staff, exceptionally clean",This was our second stay at this hotel. The rooms are modern and very clean. The pool is great and the common area at the entrance is lovely. It had a nice selection of larger rooms for families that needed parents and kids in one room.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very comfortable stay,"Ours was a late night arrival at DIA.  The shuttle trip between the airport and the hotel was easy, as was the trip back the next morning.   (You may sign up for early morning shuttle returns to the airport at the La Quinta front desk.)   The hotel has a pantry near the front desk where you may purchase snacks, drinks, and even frozen meals.  Really great idea as there are fridges and microwaves in the rooms.  Slept reallly well, the bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast was good.  The waffle machine, as always, made the meal feel special.  :)  I'd recommend the La Quinta at DIA.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Did not get what we reserved,"Room only had one bed and a pull out sofa that was not at all comfortable, was promised a 2 bedroom suite for a maximum of 6, (repeatedly by reservations person) the room was low quality.  Would not recommend. (TV did not work, had to be reprogramed)",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay for DIA,"We have to come from Cheyenne to fly out of DIA and usually have early flights, so our trip usually starts by staying here so we just have a short trip to airport for early flights!  They do have shuttle - but we usually do long term parking.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great option in the DIA area,"This hotel was a great choice for a place to stay so we could catch our very early morning flight out of DIA (and not make our Denver host lug us out to DIA in the middle of the night).  It was very tastefully remodeled, and the floors in the room were not carpeted, which I loved. My only complaint was that the bathroom floor was not as clean as it should have been, and we also seemed to get a lot of noise from the room above.   Other than that it was definitely a good choice, especially for the price.",4

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Family VACAY,We picked this hotel as it is close to DIA.  We were picking up a family member who arrived early in the morning.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean and comfortable,Pleasantly surprised by this upgraded La Quinta!

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice hotel but some issues.,"The hotel appearance was nice however, I had to have my door key recoded daily. This became a real pain after a days work and being on the 5th floor. Returning to my room after work only to find out my key didn't work, then having to go to the front desk to have the key recoded. The fact that the elevator was sooooo SLOW didn't help the situation. The location of this hotel has nothing at all around it other then more hotels. Plan on using Uber to go eat or to look for entertainment.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice!,"We stayed one night before our flight out of Denver, Co. It is a very nice hotel and beautiful property. We did not hear a single plane go over. The only complaint I have is that the mattress seemed to be an older one not very supportive but I slept OK anyway. The bathroom  doors are French style with no locks on them. Otherwise we had a great stay with a good hot breakfast in their gorgeous lobby. The employees were friendly and helpful. There is a Ruby Tuesday restaurant next door you can walk to for a nice meal.  Rooms are large and the A/C worked great. Airport shuttle available but we had a rental to return. I would definitely stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Room was nice,Decent size. Went back and forth to get the key to work. Airport shuttle was on time and and very nice driver. Front desk was helpful. Some of the breakfast was out at 4:30 and that was nice. Pool was perfect temperature and lots of towels.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great rooms,"My recent stay at LaQuinta Denver airport was great.  The hotel is fairly new, everything still looked new and well kept.  The rooms were very clean and the appliances (refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker) were clean and without odor. The front desk staff were very helpful.  Although, the hotel doesn't have a dedicated shuttle, it provides airport transportation through a third party vendor.  The airport shuttle company (Western Union) ran frequently and their drivers were friendly as well, especially Ms. Shannon.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Dissatisfied,The front desk agent seemed bothered that he had to wait on us. The room had two nonfunctioning tvs and the entry door was very difficult to open. A/C was not working until maintenance checked the circuit breaker and turned the power on.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Conveniet for Denver Airport,"We have stayed here a couple times now and really enjoy the hotel for its cleanliness, friendly staff, and shuttle to the airport.  My only negative is they need to take off their website that it is free to keep your car there for up to 7 days  and then they will charge you.  We were only parked for 3 and we were charged $20.  So I'm a little confused on that point.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great staging for our flight home,"All of our needs were met at this hotel as we were ending our vacation and returning home.  A relaxing hotel with a lot of space, good staff, good breakfast, walkable places to eat, convenient shuttle to the airport, etc.",4

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,One night stay,"Clean, comfortable, quiet and friendly!  Convenient location.When calling for airport pick-up, it would be most helpful if the hotel assistant would please be specific as to which van to look for.   A contract van for several hotels was used with very little logo to identify a L.Q. pickup.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Newly remodeled, but minimal customer service.","Arrived mid afternoon and was greeted by desk attendant, & directed to room. Asked for 5:00 airport shuttle &was put on 4:30 list (unbeknownst to me).  Room was clean & comfortable. Got 4 am wake up call. When we arrived at the lobby at 4:45, we discovered we’d been put on the wrong shuttle list and it had already departed. Thought we’d grab a muffin & juice while waiting for the next shuttle, but there was nothing out on the breakfast bar. So much for free breakfast.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,great,"couldnt have asked for better service they had clean and comfortable beds, the ladies at the front counter we so helpful they even had a take out menu for me since I dropped off my car at rental earlier, Shuttle service was fast and friendly",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great overall, but a couple of problems","Everything was great EXCEPT the key cards had to be reset twice, and I could hear into the adjacent rooms. I could hear people's phone conversations as if they were next to me. Thankfully, I brought a portable Bluetooth speaker and used the fan app on my phone to block any noise at night. Otherwise, I would not have slept.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel!,"Very bright and airy hotel, clean, and quiet. Loved the spacious and nicely decorated room. Bed was a little firm for my taste, but not hard. Appreciated having the fridge and microwave in my room. It's next door to Ruby Tuesday, which made it easy to walk over to for dinner. I will definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Relaxing end to a rough day,"Long but productive business trip was over and my boss and I schlepped to DIAro return home. Only, the flight got canceled, and the airline said our comfort that night wasn't their problem. To make matters worse the hotels my boss thought to call first were booked, as it was a Friday night. I called LaQuinta. The shuttle was slow getting us, but not terribly. The staff at the hotel were awesome, treating us to a welcome and assuring we got a wakeup and a shuttle just as we needed. Plus the hotel is really well appointed. The lobby is very classy and new, and the rooms were comfortable and very well maintained. This hotel was just completely reno'd earlier this year and it shows it. The area is very quiet, with a few restaurants but not much else besides other hotels. I will definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Quick mini vacation,The facility was redone in January 2018 and it still has the new appeal.  Rooms were very clean as well as the bathrooms.  Lobby was nice and big.  Indoor court yard was nice and relaxing.  Facility is smoke free although smoking is allowed in the courtyard.   More than once we refrained going to the courtyard due to numerous smokers in the area.  It is a very nice courtyard,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great La Quinta, but lacking customer service","This is a very nice La Quinta, clean and new. The rooms were clean and large, with a large bathroom. Stayed here as I had two dogs, and they never charge extra for them. Only had a few complaints.  First, the breakfast was not great.  Second, even though I called 2 weeks in advance to reserve a ground floor room for the dogs they put us on the second floor.  Luckily my dogs are not spooked by elevators, or it would have been a problem. Need to make better notes for specific customer requests.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Mile High Quality,"Great value, airport shuttle, nice walking area. Restaurants within walking distance. Nice common area with large screen TV and seating. Front desk personnel were friendly and helpful with directions.",5

Convenient to airport.  Shuttle Service fine. Nice grounds around back of hotel.  Lobby area for sitting is pleasant.  Would stay again if flying out of Denver airport in the morning.  Breakfast was fair.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful!,"Haven't stayed in an LQ in a while but was pleasantly surprised with this experience.  This chain has really come along!  Wonderful experience, clean spacious rooms, no hassle check in or out; courtesy vans from DIA, excellent breakfast offering, quiet and welcoming.  My only complaint is they advertise themselves as a smoke free property, but when I went out to the veranda in the morning for some fresh air and coffee the smokers drove me back inside.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Business Travel,"Needed a site close to the airport. La Quinta DIA fit the bill nicely. Clean room, helpful and friendly staff. They set up the breakfast counter early for the folks that have to be at the airport for those early flights.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Love the renovation, but...","I’ve stayed at this La Quinta before.  It’s quite convenient if you have early/late flights out of DIA.  The shuttle is reliable and the ability to park your car here is quite handy.  I loved the renovated look.  The lobby is more welcoming, and there’s lots more seating at breakfast.  However, we stayed during a bizarre night that had some unruly guests.  We endured about 2 hours of yelling/talking before it got quiet enough to get some sleep.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Front Desk incompetence lets this really great (value) hotel down,"Denver International Airport Hotel has usual LQ layout w back yard. Room spacious, place clean and modern, WiFi good and all amenities as expected. Decent breakfastand breakfast/cleaning staff courteous and professional. Negatives - Front desk a big let down. Check-in despite booked online hold to card and LQ membership took over 20 minutes. Despite payment no receipt or invoice provided, including on check out when it was specifically requested. Front desk unable to advise where to walk in basic area.Membership wrongly shows booking cancelled and no reward points so continuation of front desk incompetence. Gym aircon turned off with key lock box to its controls so at 11am expected to work out in heat-box.",3

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Stay,"We had a very enjoyable stay at this LaQuinta location.  The hotel was very clean and up to date.  Our room was very nice and comfortable.  Location is close to the Denver Airport, the reason for our stay.  Also close to eateries.  The pool and hot tub was clean.  We had to leave early so we didn't get to take advantage of the continental breakfast, but at 5am they did have some food available.  We really enjoyed our stay and if we are in the area ever again, we will definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Saved by LaQuinta,I wrote an awesome review on the previous page but was then taken to the Trip Advisor page to write another.  There is no way I can duplicate my first writing.  The place was awesome.  The 24 hour pool and hot was a lot better than the 7pm lol shutdown we had in Vegas at another place.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,too much money for what you get,"We arrived very late at night.  No elevators working.  Hauled our own bags up the stairs only to find out our key cards didn’t work.  Finally got in the room - TV didn’t work, so desk staff had to come into the room at 2 am to reset.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Best of the budget hotels,"La Quinta At the Denver Airport is clean with modern/updated decor in rooms and lobby. Airport transportation was on time. Price was good that night. I have stayed across the street at the quality inn for more $$ and La Quinta is much nicer. Nice garden patio area in the back, however it was occupied by smokers. Breakfast was uninspired but good for a few calories.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,LaQuinta DIA,"Beautiful grounds. If you call and book through their agency you will get mis-quoted on the price. There was a nice $30 upcharge upon checkin. I repeated myself several times to booking agent, as she spoke very broken English.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Terrible front desk and shuttle service.,Terrible front desk and shuttle service. Travis was extremely rude and highly unprofessional. Shuttle took two hours to pickup from the airport. Travis told us it wasn't his fault and demanded that we contact the shuttle company ourselves and then threatened to cancel our reservation. Highly unprofessional.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Refrigerator Noise,"Room 327 had a very loud refrigerator. Made it very hard to sleep, which is rather key for a hotel that caters mainly to those using Denver International Airport. Otherwise, the new decor, the size of the room, the bed and bathroom where all very nice. If only we could have done what we really came to do, which was sleep before an early flight.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great hotel & location, lousy breakfast options","If you want a protein based breakfast, you won't find it here.  Otherwise, this hotel is new, clean, well staffed, conveniently located, and has the most comfy beds!  Rooms are spacious, quiet, and clean.  Next door to a Ruby Tuesdays that has a large salad bar.  Easy access to off-airport parking (Canopy parking on Tower Road).",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Nice!,Nice hotel and excellent location. Rooms were spacious and clean. Staff was friendly and accommodating.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,This place sucks,"My room was filthy.  It was not cleaned after the last guest checked out.  I arrived at 11:45pm, and was told there was no more room available, and I would have to wait several hours for the room to be cleaned.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,It was ok,"Stayed here with the family.  It was just ok.  Staff was not very friendly or attentive.  The breakfast could use some work. Same things every day. Eggs, sausage, and waffles. Will not stay here again. Pool was good. Hot tub was nice.  Had the do not disturb sign on the door for 3 days, took it off the 4th day so we could get clean sheets and clean towels. They totally dismissed our room. Though the day after that we had the do not disturb sign on the door we only had one more day to stay so we decided not to have them come in and clean.  Housekeeping put a note over the do not  disturb sign saying that ""We see that you had the do not disturb sign and could not come in to clean"".....duh, we had it off the day before.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Lovely accommodations, free breakfast",I would have expected to pay more for a property this lovely with a robust breakfast buffet and free airport shuttle.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice and clean,"The hotel was great, room was large and clean. The staff was not the best not really friendly or helpful at late check in or when questioned about why you could not key in from outer doors. Was told there was a problem and only way in was front lobby door. This is a large hotel with limited parking in front so this made long walk from parking your car.The location is great and will stay again as I am sure the door entry issue has been fixed.",4

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Senior Trip,"We rented three rooms for a night stay prior to our flight.  When we checked in one of our room’s door was still open.  My husband called to make sure it was ready, and they said yes. Turns out, only the beds were made.  My husband called again to let them know that the room was NOT clean and they ended up sending a maintenance man.  Now we’re confused, the maintenance man is confused and we still have a dirty room.  So the maintenance man takes the trash and apologizes and says I’ll go get somebody up here.  30 mins. later a housekeeper arrived and whipped our room into shape.  A bit of confusion, but the stay was good and they had the breakfast ready by 4:30am.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful Place to Stay in Denver,"Excellent hotel, easy access to Airport and other points of interest. Lovely, clean rooms.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,No working shower,"Shower did not work in the morning before going to the airport.  Disapointing for the price of a one night stay for convenience to the airport,  They seem to rwly on their reputation and not their amenities.",1

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent,Other than the bed issue we had it was a  perfect stay. I'm sure it was and ooops for the day on the why the bed wasn't perfect but everything else was amazing.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Exceeded Expectations,"Great service, building, and rooms are beautiful.  Best LaQuinta I've ever stayed at!  I'm thinking it's a newer hotel but it was great!  Inadvertently made reservations through Reservations.com.  I know, I was deceived.  They got the reservation wrong but I called the hotel before we arrived and they sorted it all out.  I will only call the actual hotel instead of booking online from now on.  Thanks, La Quinta!!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Not so great, but adequate","There were strips of the curtain missing, that was kind of unwelcoming. The worst parts were the shower: the tub was so clogged that taking a shower involved standing in a foot of water. Also, the people in the room above us sounded like they were dropping furniture all night. Very noisy.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very handy 'stay and fly',"Newly renovated and clean, comfortable accommodations.Shuttle to the airport around the clock made it easy to 'stay and fly'. Checked pricing at several motels, and this value was by far the best! Would definitely stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver Airport,"Nice place to stay when catching next day flight out of Denver. Nice hotel at a moderate price within walking distance to a couple of good eating places.  Rooms are well appointed, breakfast is pretty basic.  Shuttle to airport is very timely and efficient.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,night before Seattle trip,We enjoyed our stay and especially being able to leave our vehicle while we were gone.  The rooms were clean and comfortable. The proximity to the airport and the shuttle service made it very convenient. We would definitely recommend this La Quinta to anyone needing to fly out of DIA especially early in the morning.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Paper thin walls and no hot water,"Beautiful renovations but the i could clearly hear the entire conversation of the guests next door at 2am.  Also, I had no hot water for my shower.  The rooms were nicely done so I don't know why they did not invest in noise cancelling walls.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,one problem after another,"coming home from a Mexican vacation we called the hotel to see where to go to catch the shuttle.  In an hour and a half time the shuttle NOT ONCE came past where 10 of us including a very tired 7 month old infant  were told to stand.  We made 3 phone calls to the hotel and ended up taking two taxi's to the hotel costing a total of $80.00.  While checking in late that evening a customer came up wide eyed saying she had been stuck in the elevator closest to the lobby.  The employee said her apologies and said they forgot to lock the elevator since it wasn't working properly.  Again thank heavens it wasn't us with a baby along.  We walked to the far end of the hotel to get on the functioning elevator to go to our rooms on the 3rd floor.  As luck would have it, our son in law was having stomach problems and needed to get into the room.  Our daughter unlocked her room finding a uniform of an airline employee, we think the individual was in the bed sleeping, I opened my door across the hall and found a lady eating from a to go box with a german shepard at her feet.  Scared the heck out of her and me.  I made our apologies as our son in law ran to the stair case and hurried to the lobby rest room.  The employee at the desk made apologies and gave us new room keys.  I am glad that the woman was clothed and that the dog was not protective and bite my leg off.  Needless to say, I think our next trip we will find a more reliable hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Waiting in the cold,"I stayed at La Quinta on a return trip from FL in Feb. It was the least expensive and I based my choice on that and it's location. The hotel shuttle from the airport was run by Western and didn't say La Quinta on the side plus we stood out in the 10 degree weather for 20 minutes waiting for the thing. The room was ok, seemed clean, although the entire facility is definitely in need of a face lift. It certainly isn't fancy but it was reasonably priced and came with a basic breakfast.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great to start/end a Denver trip,"The hotel was clean, rooms stayed warm and cozy and far enough from the airport not to hear too much noise. Stayed on arrival and departure...both great.  Airport shuttle does not always say LaQuinta, which cost me a cab ride for $30, but when I did use the shuttle after figuring out how to spot it, the shuttle service was excellent.  $30 cab fare for a 4-mile trip was a learning curve, but I also never called to inquire about what the shuttles actually ""look like"".  Anyway, it was a great stay and we will be back there for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointed,"I've stayed in many La Quinta's before and this one in particular two other times.   I was completed disappointed in the entire property except for the front desk staff.  First room unacceptable, no bedding provided for sofa bed and the King Suite did not have a separated bedroom, but a glass partial partitioned wall. Second room, better, but sofa bed still not made and missing mattress pad.  The king bed had the worst mattress I've ever encountered in any hotel.  Breakfast room extremely chilly and food mediocre. I've had better at McD's.  It was an embarrassment to me as I had bragged about how I can rely on the quality if LQ.  A huge letdown.",3

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to fly from,This is a great place to leave your car while you travel. The airport shuttle can be as long as an hour 30 minutes to pick yo up from the airport though. Please review the process with them to expedite,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Ok Hotel,This looks like it was a very nice hotel when it was new however the age is starting to show and it looks like it's not being maintained properly. The bathroom facets were leaking and the tub was fill of water. The ceiling in the lobby had water stains and some of the tiles were missing. A few doors didnt close all the way and there was poor patch and paint jobs all over. The Continental Breakfast was not as good as other hotels I have stayed. But it was very clean and the staff was very nice. I will probably try a different hotel in the same price range next time,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great stay before flight,"Shared a 2 bed suite with my sister before flight out the next morning.  Really nice room, no noise except people leaving the next morning could be heard in hallway.  Very clean and spacious.  Highly recommend.  Unfortunately, we incorrectly thought breakfast went until 10am so we missed it - our own fault!",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Can't Beat It,"LaQuinta hotels are almost always my hotel of choice.  For the most part, they are updated, excellent places during a business trip.  The LaQuinta at Denver airport, however, is a stand-out.  Beautifully appointed, I thought I was at a much more expensive place.  The fact that it is not terribly close to Denver, proper, can be a problem, but the area is growing up around it.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Service,"Extremely satisfied with how the staff helped with last minute meeting set up, accommodating us with a table and chairs, coffee and water...

We will return here if we fly from Denver again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Less pricey, not worth it","Not clean, no apparent manager with concern or attention to what customers are seeing. Did not do breakfast because there was concern about cleanliness there!  The room we were finally put in was contemporary and nicely decorated, but seemed that the linens and towels were old and thin, and bed was akin to a hammock.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel!!!,We checked in late with no issues and our room was perfect! Clean and comfortable. Breakfast was available early so we could eat before our flight. It was very convenient to the airport. They had a shuttle available. I would highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Take caution!,"Staff was very young and obviously inexperienced, lacking customer service skills. We had to pick up from front desk items missing from the room ourselves 3 times. Undercooked breakfast. Young and old should be very cautious during this properties renovations!",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Cancelled flight, nice hotel.",There is construction in part of the hotel but the place was clean and the service exceptional.  Our flight out of Denver was cancelled for two days but since we had stayed there before we decided to pick this hotel for our forced stay.  It was worth it.,5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Bad timing for a remodeling,Major remodeling of the lobby in the middle of the holidays ? seriously ? very unpleasant experience. The staff didn't make anything to try to compensate all the hassle to use this hotel. It was a chaos to get inside and bring all your luggage using the side door.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice staff and rooms,"We really enjoyed our stay. Our flight was cancelled, and even though we were bummed out about losing a day with family in Montana our stay here was very enjoyable. the complimentary breakfast was delicious, and the staff made us feel important!",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta hitting on all cylinders with this remodel,"Well, this is what it looks like when an older property undergoes a flawless remodel.  Congrats, La Quinta!  The room was just beautiful and rated up there with the four-star and rare five-star accommodations we try for (if we can get a reasonable deal).  Room fixtures, furniture, carpet, paint and hallway carpet/paint really well done and flowed together into  a very, very pleasant experience.  Staff very nice and competent at check in and out, but that's all the contact we had with them.  We didn't partake of the breakfast but it looked ok--was close by the relocated front desk so we saw it at check-out.  Looked like standard breakfast items.  Just there for a night, but we usually look around at pool and gym anyway for future ref.  They looked nice.  Was worried about soft bed at first then saw that it was just soft top to mattress and when lying down made for firm, good night's sleep. Recliner was nice touch to stretch legs after drive down from mountains.  See note at bottom on bill error that got fixed quickly.  We have been in/out DIA maybe dozen times in last couple years.  Glad we took a chance on this one and will bookmark it for future trips.  A few minor nits:  --lobby/checkin had been relocated somewhat at tail end of remodel (rooms already completed, though)--no big deal -- shower on/off had been left in ""on"" by prior guest or h.k., so got a surprise cold start to shower--my bad, but I don't take contacts into shower (ha). -- fridge worked well for our cokes and wine, but was little unlevel so rocked when opening/closing door--bet maint. could adjust the feet underneath -- on checkout, did not notice had been charged higher rate than quoted on senior rate last June; reported it few days later, forwarded them my June confirmation email, and they got difference credited to my card promptly, so cannot complain",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient,Stayed overnight for early flight and picked LA Quinta because we could leave our car.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Vail to home,"Had a awlful time entering hotel with my luggage. Not clearly marked as to where the entry was, how difficult to enter etc. The staff was very helpful after I finnally entered the ""LOBBY"".

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Ski weekend,Top notch facility with renovated rooms. Very clean and quiet. The breakfast was quite good. Enjoyed the waffles made fresh. Ruby Tuesday restaurant is next door and offers a wide range of drinks and eats,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Worst Hotel Experience,"Worst hotel stay I have ever experienced.  TVs did not work in my room, nor 2 other rooms of people that were staying in my class.  The AC/heating unit is horrible and the room goes from freezing cold to burning hot and back again within minutes throughout the whole night.  The beds and pillows are horribly uncomfortable.  The first 2 nights in a row my trash was not changed and was overflowing.  There was one day when there was no breakfast set out.  I travel a lot for business, and I can say this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Gross sheets...horrible hygiene ,"Upon arrive staff was nice. When we arrived at our room and lifted our sheets back, we found at least one stain on every section of the bedding (fitted sheet, sheet, comforter & duvet) ON BOTH BEDS in our room. So after contemplating calling, we did politely and only asked to have a change of sheets. We had to ask her to go back twice because she didn’t bring us correct sets of sheets (extra pillow cases instead of sheets). Then the new sets were stained too! I politely pointed this out to which she replied “sexy” (obviously joking about this). I am not an unreasonable person, but I do expect clean sheets or a fix for these continuous problems. We did not ever get unstained sheets or anything for all this trouble.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay at hotel,I was very happy with where the hotel is located & it was right next door to a couple of restaurants. The staff was very friendly & my daughters loved the cookies at night.  The room was clean & spacious.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport preflight stay over,"Great place for staying at and being shuttled the next day for a flight.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,DIA LaQuinta,I enjoyed our stay - clean room and apparently being renovated.  Décor is classy.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A week A away from Home,"We stayed at this Hotel the week of Thanksgiving for our Anniversary. I was greeted by the young lady at the desk, check in was a breeze. The room was clean and had a great view to the mountains.Beautiful bathroom and very spacious room, we didn't feel like we were in each others space while in the room.  I believe they were doing some work on the lower level of the hotel but we never heard any noises which was a plus for us we wanted to relax the whole week. Breakfast was served daily with hot and cold items everything was clean and good. We will definitely book again when we travel back.",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Excellent, 5 star if were not remodeling","We drove to Denver and stayed overnight so we could fly to Mexico the next day.  Hotel was very nice with large rooms, clean and nice amenities.  We chose this hotel because we could leave our vehicle at the hotel lot and get a free shuttle ride to the airport.  The convenience of being able to shuttle to the airport and leave our vehicle at the hotel while we were away was fantastic!!  Even though we left early morning before breakfast they still had muffins and fruit out already so we could grab and go.  They were great at providing warm cookies, water and coffee when we arrived.  Super nice staff.I would give this location a 5 star but the were in the middle of remodeling the lobby which made it a bit confusing when you arrived as to where to check in at.  Also the elevator and lobby access was blocked so you had to walk around outside to get to the front desk.  Well marked directions but and inconvenience.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,always enjoy my stay,"Have stayed at this property a few times when flying out of DIA .  However this time we chose to stay at this property on the Thanksgiving weekend as part of our short ""mini-vacation"" only a few hours from home. Although this property is under construction currently , the stay was still very pleasant.  The front desk staff rate a thousand kudos in my opinion for how friendly and customer service oriented they were on a short staffed holiday weekend. The indoor pool and hot tub were ofcourse a huge hit with our young grandchildren .  This property is very pet friendly which was also important to us.   My only recommendation is that it would be nice to have the usual type of book(s) in the room that tell about the facility and nearby area.  With the construction , this property was not up to it's usual on ambience in the lobby and breakfast/ front lounge area / main level restrooms, however the staff clearly did the best they could under the circumstances of dealing with major construction.   I will certainly continue to utilize this property.   The housekeeping staffing was greatly decreased on the Thanksgiving holiday itself, therefore we did a bit more ""self service"" than normal, however the staff that was present were all without exception friendly, professional and top notch.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very nice.,Enjoyed the hotel and staff greatly. It's being renovated and will be even better in the future. Will definitely stay again when we need to stay at DIA.  A good value and convenient to good food and services.,5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excelle,"Important was for me to have a Shuttle Service and  being able to leave my car at a safe place. Difficult was to find the place at  DIA  where I had to meet the shuttle bus for La Quinta Hotel . Finally I found the right Island.  It would have helped to have a voucher or information when I checked in, about  where the pick up is when I had to return to La Quinta to pick up my car. (It was in the middle of the night!).  But now I know .....and all in all it was a good experience, so that I would recommend la Quinta and also use it again for my family .~~~",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Don't book until renovations completef,"see comments above.  Service was below par, mainly due to renovations and Staff trainees.Plumbing was also a problem...running and noises toilet.  Trying to submit this response. But system not accepting comments. Another frustration.. c W at. Another",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Love LaQuinta,"As always, our stay at any LaQuinta, is pleasurable!  Everyone was pleasant, and everything was clean. Only drawback was this location is undergoing a renovation, and finding the front desk was a little tricky. I try to stay at LaQuinta every time I travel!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Worst Hotel Experience Ever!,"Had a reservation for a king room with the instruction that we would be arriving on a late flight from the East Coast.  Arrived at the hotel at 12:30 am and had to wait ten minutes behind two other parties.  When our turn came, we were told there were no King rooms,  We responded that room type didn't matter.  After ten minutes of the hotel representative looking at sheets of paper and comparing them to the computer screen we asked if there were ANY rooms.  She replied that she didn't think so, but she was going to go check.  She came back and told us no.  We asked if she could find us a room at a nearby hotel (making it clear we didn't have a car).  She called a few places with no success until she found a nearby property with availability.  This property was $70.00 more per night than the price we had been quoted for La Quinta.  We asked if La Quinta would pick up the difference.  She called the manager at home who, judging from the way the conversation went, said no.  The representative then made another call to a hotel that had a room and (great news) it was cheaper.  We were told it was just down the road.  We headed out on foot carrying our luggage.  It is now 1 am (we had been up 21 hours at this point).  The ""just down the road"" ended up being a mile on a four lane road with no lighting and no sidewalk.  Luckily our bags were not that heavy, we are physically fit and we were wearing comfortable footwear.  The whole experience was beyond believable.  If it hadn't happened to us, I won't believe customers could be treated so poorly.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Under construction,Had we known this hotel was under construction we would not have stayed here.  Room was nice and very clean.  Noisy old heat system noise was aggravating.  Inadequate staffing.  Non existent lobby with a matching breakfast.  Previously stayed here and always pleased.  Very disappointed.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,The best is now way ahead of the competition.,"First let me say I have stayed at this hotel since it was the only hotel out on tower and that goes back a lot of years.     I stayed in room 302 and this room was outstanding .  The rooms are all remodeled and they look fantastic.  Better than the competition,Also I want to address value that some gave low marks.   If you book a room the day of the stay you are going to pay more and I checked last night and this was one of the least expensive in the surrounding 10 hotels for 2/9/2017.If you want to save even more join AAA, LQ returns, and book 2-3 weeks earlier.    The glass divider in the room makes it even nicer in the suite very cool design and remodel.   Secondly the free breakfast is like all hotels too many carbs for a diabetic or those on protein diets.     Room is quiet, 302 and staff has been excellent.   JOy checked me and did a super job.All the staff has been friendly, professional and quick to respond.Thanks LQ for a very restful stay.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Still great under construction,Hotel was under some construction during my visit.  The exterior and lobby were still under construction so they had a detour from the front door. They still offered a continental breakfast.  They had  beautiful remodeled rooms.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Remodel in progress,"Hiccups occur with remodeling a property while still open for business. My review is regarding our room. Our coffee pot had not been cleaned out, it was bad. No fan in bathroom, which is a must to help control stream and odors. The elevator hadn't been clean for some time apparently. Attention to little details help during remodeling for the traveling public.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not a good surprise,"I have stayed at this hotel before and it was a good experience, but my last stay there...just may be my last. It was under construction and everything was a mess. It was hard to even find out where to get into the hotel. The tub leaked water and there were about three inches of standing water in the tub when I got to my room. I was not very impressed and felt that it was not the quality experience I should expect for La Quinta.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,The besst,"Even though there is a lot of construction going on, the staff and rooms are just right! Always professional and rooms normally excellently cleaned. Thank you for all you to make my stay worth it. I just wish they had told me that there was construction before I arrived... but either way.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,OK ... But Way too Expensive for One Night,"My family had an early flight from Denver, so we stayed at this location ... as it was the only LaQuinta site in the entire metro area that allowed long term parking. We checked a few other locations, just to verify the online information ... yepper, no other LaQuinta allowed stay and go packages, and most did not offer any shuttle service to the airport.Upon arrival to the hotel, the staff was friendly ... the rooms seemed comfortable ... and the overall experience was appropriate. However, for one night ... the cost was over a couple hundred dollars ... WOW! Considering that they were not responsible for any damages to our vehicle or theft, it seemed funny to be paying so much for a non-liability contract of sorts. Heck, I have stayed at other LaQuinta's in urban areas with stay and go packages ... for only an extra $20, with special parking at the back of the hotel.If we did this trip again, we would gladly park at the airport and pay the fee, which is less than the hotel fees. Plus, then we would not have to wait for the shuttle ... which by the way was late about 10 minutes for our pick-up in the morning.  Not a big deal for us, but another family and a Delta flight crew were visibly upset over the tardiness.Bottom line ... good hotel, with solid amenities.  For the price, though, go somewhere else in the metro area.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,a good hotel but poor house keeping,Hotel was good to very good except house keeping for our day to day room service was not up to the standard I would assume this hotel is use to giving.  Example we came back to our room on 9/19/17 to find the used towels were taken away but no new towels were left and we had no toilet paper so my wife went to the front desk area and found a housekeeper standing the who she was of work and could not help her so she had to get the person at the reception desk to get us the needed supplies.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Renovation,"While this hotel is under renovation, the staff and manager are doing a great job informing the guests and making arrangements to satisfy their needs.  I do feel this hotel is way overpriced for the type hotel it is.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,In renovations but quiet,Took me a while to find the entrance as they r renovating the lobby and other areas. I had to wait a few minuted as they were just moving the reception's computer from one place to another. Breakfast was at  the temporary  reception area the following day.  if you will be bothered by this  may be avoid it during the rest of September  17,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Avoid at all costs,"I stayed there for one night while traveling on business, the room had a bad smell, the furniture was filthy and felt sticky, I requested a ""non-smoking"" room and they put me in a room marked ""non-smoking"", but you couldn't escape the stale stinch of years of smoking, the bathroom was also filthy, the shower had hairs in it and on it, very disgusting, I'll stay in my car next time.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Overnight to visit friends in Denver and then fly home,"Stayed two nights at this La Quinta after 12 days of touring National Parks north of Denver.  Our room was remodeled and fresh.  Beds, linens and towels were comfortable.  Location was great for visiting friends and made car rental return and airport access easy.  Their hot breakfast has something for everyone, eggs, sausage, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juices, pastries and a waffle machine for hot waffles.  There are several restaurants in the area, to include a few you can walk to. Downtown is easily accessible--but like D.C. , avoid rush hour.  Staff was super friendly. Yes, we'll go back for pre-flight stay.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful Hotel,"What a great place to stay at. Wasn't too far from the downtown Denver/Aura area and was surrounded by other hotels. We stayed at a La Quinta the night before and wanted to try them out again since we loved their beds. Checking in was a breeze, I wish I remember the young ladies name because she was such a sweetheart. Made check in a breeze and even gave us a room on the top floor. Rooms were updated and I was nervous they would be noisy since they were close to each other but we had no issues. Clean, comfortable, and updated.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great for a layover or early flight out of Denver International,The room was nice and clean.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The is a restaurant next door..  Hotel is convenient to Denver International.  Some renovations going of out front and in lobby or I would have given it 5 stars.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta sticks it to hurricane stranded customers .. No compassion at this hotel!!,"We are currently staying at the hotel. 09/10/17. We where traveling back to Florida when the hurricane hit. We are stranded with Nothing! No luggage. No clothes. Have been sitting around the hotel for two days. Mostly praying that we have families and homes to go to...... We received a voucher from the airlines for a reduced rate. Tonight the hotel informed me that our voucher is only good for 2 days and if we want to stay tomorrow we would have to pay the 199.00 rate per night. Or take the shuttle back to the airport get another voucher and come back, all before check out of course.We do also have the option of finding another hotel..... We have no car, by the way.So needless to say I went on-line and found another hotel down the street. And my 70 year old mother, with a heart condition, and I are going to pack the couple things we do have and walk down the road to the Microtel Inn!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointing experience,"We are LQ regulars therefore had a expectation about this hotel which wasn't met.  The person who checked us in was un-welcoming, the bed was too soft and the bathtub either hasn't been renovated with the rest of the room, or was done poorly.  Otherwise, the décor was very nice.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel by the airport,"The accommodations were beautifully renovated. The room was modern, clean, and attractive. The staff was neglectful and would talk amongst themselves rather than the customers, but the place was very well kept and was a good value. But as a warning, they'll put away breakfast 30 minutes before the sign says it's over...so get there early!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,always a nice place to stay,"Hadn't stayed at this La Quinta in a while , while i was away they renovated the place, everything was new and clean, staff was on top of game, food was hot and tasted great, grounds where well cared for, no trash laying around, pool was clean, plenty of towels and deck chairs, fitness room had plenty of equipment,",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Tremendous Support and Accommodation,"This stay at the DIA Lq was a real boost during a very difficult trip. We arrived much later than we had originally planned, as our elder Cocker Spaniel had presented with Vestibular Disease (loss of balance/coordination) late the previous night. After a night in the Emergency Vet and carrying her in/out of the vehicle all day, we asked at check-in for a room near an easy exit/elevator. We didn't really expect a ground floor room at 8:30pm. But the front desk staff (who was swamped at that time) was so kind and accommodating.  After a 5-7 minute wait for my turn to check-in, with all 3 stations/attendants checking folks in, and each guest having requests, I didn't have much hope for our own. But the young girl helping me greeted me with a smile, heard my request and not only gave me the last 1st floor room, it was also just 2 doors from from an exit. It was such a pleasant surprise. Thanks Lq for being a gpreat place for pet owners.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Renovation provides nicer rooms,"We stayed here with our dog on the way out of town,  The rooms are spacious with new carpets and apparently new room furniture.  The bathroom was small and there was mold on the shower/tub tile.  The breakfast leaves very few options for people that want to eat healthy.  This property is better than your average La Quinta, but still is lacking in service, cleanliness and breakfast options.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good business option,"I stayed for 2 nights on a business trip.  Nice, clean, quiet and safe hotel.  Breakfast was biscuits eggs and sausage patties.There are 2 restaurants within 3 blocks walking distance as well as a 7-Eleven.Beds are big and comfy.  Rooms are big as well as the bathroom.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great deal in a great location,"Stayed here on a early flight overnight.  I wasn't disappointed!  What a great value!Clearly an older hotel that has undergone some renovations, but it was clean and comfortable.  The continental breakfast was well stocked and offered enough of a selection to cover most breakfast needs.  The shuttle service was prompt and super friendly. An added bonus is it's within walking distance to Ruby Tuesday's for quick and easy dinner grab.  Based on my one night here, I would absolutely stay here again.  It's not as ""fancy"" or ""new"" as the Hampton Inn, but for the cost, comfort and service I would say its a fairly comparable experience for a much better price.  On a side note, we had paid more to stay at the Days Inn on the arrival night.  Don't make the same mistake we did!!  This was a much better choice!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A Recommended Stay!,"We enjoyed our stay here.  Our vacation ended with a great nights rest that offered amenities that went above and beyond what we were expecting!  The staff was friendly and helpful, .and courteous, thank you for our wonderful stay and for caring for our families needs.  Our dog was treated well here., a very big Thank you  to tge staff at the Denver LaQuinta.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Business Stay,"overall ok. had construction noise throughout the day. noisy neighbors slamming doors, music way to loud for 2am. Staff at front desk seemed not very happy. Rooms were nice, had issues with air conditioning unit as it would blow cold air, then when room was cooled, it would switch to heat mode and heat the room up along with being loud when running so just shut if off. Might stay again",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Nice,"This hotel was close by the airport, clean, easy to find, and restful.   It was far enough from the highway that it was quiet.   The shuttle did not have any markings indicating La Quinta, but the driver did announce La Quinta at the pickup point.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Andrew is the man,"In all of my experience with La Quinta (and it's a ton), never have I had a better service than with Andrew. Fast, friendly, on the spot with my Platinum bag and helpful with someone new to the area. I don't know if he was just in a good mood, or if this is how he always is, but you'll absolutely see me back because of him.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful,Our family gathered in Denver for a vacation in Steamboat Springs. Staying at the airport allowed us to meet multiple flights. We are grateful to the amazing staff for all their help and support. The hotel was a very relaxing place to gather prior to driving to Steamboat.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Our trip to Disneyland,We had an early flight out of DIA on 7 August. We were taking two of our small grandchildren to Disneyland. We stayed overnight at  La Quinta Denver on Sunday night the 6th of August. They have a Stay and Go parking package. You book a night and leave your car and also book a return night when you come back. We had a very late return flight on 12 August. I was glad to have a room waiting for us.  This is the second time I have used this package. They also provided transportation from the La Quinta to airport and on our return flight transportation back to La Quinta. This package worked great for us!,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent Customer Service,"We always stay at this La Quinta when we are in the area.  The staff is very accommodating and friendly, the rooms are comfortable and clean, the kids love the pool area, and the garden area is charming.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Over night,The room was big. It got a little chilly so I turned on the heater then it set off the smoke detector off. The bed was like sleeping on plywood plank. The free breakfast was just a waffle maker toast and milk in the fridge with some apple juice and orange juice out of the machine. The coffee was like drinking hot water.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A GREAT place to stay,"Let me start by saying that I've been a La Quinta Returns member since 1994. I strayed at this hotel several years ago and that prompted me to return this trip.  Prior to my recent retirement I spent roughly 150 nights per year in hotels all across the country. This was the eighth night of a five week road trip and hotel number seven of sixteen different hotels we stayed in. Spacious room, clean, air conditioner too cold, even if it is set at 72.  Very well laid out room. Nice bed and pillows, nice shower, fridge and refrigerator in a beautiful custom made cabinet.  Nice and clean building with good parking.  They have complimentary  cookies in the afternoon. Nice breakfast.  Nice ladies in the breakfast room, constantly refilling everything that needs to be refilled.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stranded in Denver ,"We could not get outta town the day we arrived in Denver. FAA Control Center was down for the day, so we needed a place quick. La Quinta came to our rescue!Got a great room at a good rate.Loved their style. Lovely room. Their Arrival Staff could not be better. Well done!Breakfast the following morning was good. Great job on the shuttle too. Very convenient with excellent service.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Loud & Rude... Not the greatest of stays... ,"A week before our trip I reserved our room at this location. We were quoted a rate using our AARP membership. Upon arrival at the airport, the shuttle was waiting which was great. The gentleman was friendly enough and drove carefully stopping at other hotels to drop off along the way.  We arrived at the hotel and check in was quick. The girl at the counter with the big bun on her head wasnt very friendly but she wasn't overly rude either.  This location is under construction and thankfully so because that means they haven't addressed the elevator and soon will, Yay! - the elevator is gross! The elevator is dirty and outdated, it looks like an elevator at a big city parking structure. The hallways are long and of course our room was wayyyy down near the end... this is ok, I'm fit and love to walk but the redecorating is depressing; gray paint all the way, no art on the walls and black and purple casino patterned carpet...but the hallways are clean.  Our room was attractive, obviously redecorated, and nicely so. The bathroom is a good size with modern decor and nicely stocked (the bathroom tissue is a loose roll, no holder... it's weird) The bad thing that night was it took forever to get to sleep because 1) the light on the microwave is a blaring bright blue that lights up the entire entryway AND reflects off the wall mirror right in your face in bed... Nothing a towel can't take care of... But here's something a towel cannot possibly rectify:  until about 4:30 am we were treated to doors slamming, kids crying and screaming; dogs howling, growling and barking... Really?!  I have nothing against kids and dogs, I have kids and pets and they become agitated just because let alone traveling. But hotels, please... isn't there a way to accommodate appropriately?  When I reserve a room I'm always asked how many in my party and if there are kids what ages... If I have a pet obviously I'm going to mention this. With that said, knowing how kids and pets can be, can you not have a designated scream, cry, bark, growl, howl floor or section of a floor? So needless to say we didn't get much sleep and we had flown in for an appointment the following day that we were late to and very very tired at but if that wasn't enough when we finally did get up and get ready to leave we found that we had no hot water! Later on that afternoon around noon I called the front desk and asked for a manager, a gentleman transferred me to a manager's voicemail where I explained our experience so far. I left my phone number and today, four days later, I have not received a return phone call.  That evening when we returned to our room I called the front desk and spoke to a young lady by the name of Jiane, she was very stand-offish and not friendly at all!  I explained the situation, yet again and mentioned to her that I had left a message with the manager and received no call back. I mentioned that I felt that $152 a night was quite a bit for not having rested and for not having hot water. She offered to move us to another room, which was pointless since we were checking out in a few hours. She said, in her very stand-offish way that she would apply a discount. (at least I think that is what she said, she talks so low). Also, when we initially reserved the room the person who reserved the room told me that because we are Oregon residents and we are tax-exempt to be sure and mention that upon check-in which we did and the girl upon check-in told us that she had ""no control over that"" those were her words. She told us to return in the morning and provide ""proof"". I mentioned this to Jiane on the phone and she also told me that we had to provide ""proof"" that we are tax exempt in the form of identification. I told her we had absolutely no problem with that and the following morning we stopped at the front desk and gave her (Jiane) the proof she requested; she made a photo copy and when I had to ask (because she doesn't provide information) if she'd apply it, she said she would. She is even more stand-offish in person! What an absolutely boring, un-personable young lady!... She's not even nice, she has the personality of a brick, she barely speaks and when she does it's short, and really, really quiet. I feel for the hard of hearing that deal with her. We checked out later that morning. Today, I checked my credit card statement and not only was there not a discount of any type, but the rate I was charged was higher than what was quoted on the phone when I initially placed the reservation PLUS TAX!... And as of yet, no call back from the manager. UPDATE:  I called the front desk and spoke to a young lady named Rebecca. I explained all of the above. She read the ""notations"" on our 'account' and said that a discount will be applied. (whether she did it herself or Jiane did it, she didn't say, but whoever did it, thank you) She was very energetic, friendly and vivacious on the phone. She was understanding and concerned and profusely apologized for EVERYTHING and EVERYONE.  She said she'd leave a message for the manager. She didn't mention the tax exemption. (NOTE: we purchased a new vehicle on Thursday in Denver and tax exemption applied... What does that tell you? It shouldn't be such a big deal for a hotel - La Quinta in Westminster has honored it numerous times) Do I discourage you from staying here? NO, absolutely not: comfortable beds, good breakfast, near the airport, 24 hour free shuttle, pet friendly. Will I stay here again? No. We're retired and we travel quite a bit. Most hotel employees are friendly whether they feel they like you or not... They represent the hotel as the face that welcomes you when you walk in that door or when they address your concerns; we definitely did not feel welcomed. Why did I choose this location? I chose it because it is near the airport and provides late night shuttle service which we needed as we were flying into Denver to purchase a vehicle, therefore, we had no transportation upon arrival. Also, because the AARP rate was within our budget.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,July stay,Great stay as always. Never had any problems at any location and the rooms are always nice and cool when I arrive. Nothing worse than entering a hot hotel room in he summer. Slept like a baby and the wife was pleased as well.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Clean, friendly, hard to sleep well","The hotel staff are excellent and very friendly. The courtyard is nice to relax in. It was hard to sleep with all the random lights from microwave, click, huge gap under each door that lets in a lot of hallway light. I used towels to block all the lights to be able to sleep.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Third time wasn't the charm!,"Our most recent stay was the third time we'd used this hotel recently but this is the first review I've done of it.The previous two stays it was fine. I'd have given probably 4 bubbles, maybe even 5, for either of the first two stays.This last time everything was fine. Room had been recently redone, was clean, everything seemed ok, but.....When we returned from dinner at a nearby restaurant neither of the elevators was working. They had been fine when we checked in. I asked at the desk and was told that they wouldn't be repaired until the next morning because a part was not available and neither was safe to use. We are oldish with bad knees and hips so the elevator is more than an important convenience for us. When I told the clerk this she graciously comped us the room. Luckily we were on the second floor, and luckily the elevators were fixed after breakfast but before we checked out so we didn't have to hump our luggage downstairs.Then, about 10:30 p.m. my wife went to shower and the water was luke warm at best. Another call to the desk, and maintenance was sent. Maintenance came promptly and fixed the shower. It was a simple adjustment that allowed the water valve to open more fully and allow in more hot water. Took maybe 10 minutes to fix. I asked the guy why it wasn't properly adjusted and he said that it must have been overlooked 2.5 months ago when they refurbished the rooms. So either no one had rented that room in 2.5 months or other people like cold showers or are too lazy to complain.?When you look at my photos of the tub you will ask yourself, ""Why, why, did they make the rest of the room so nice and leave this worn, stained, and shoddy tub when they had refurbed everything else in the bathroom and the rest of the room???""Both of the times we had breakfast here the eggs were cold despite being in the typical warming dish.We are in and out of DIA somewhat frequently and always need a hotel before we fly and sometimes when we return. We are undecided about whether we will take another chance here or look elsewhere.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very accommodating ,"Check in was a breeze. Room was very spacious and beds were comfortable. We stayed 1 night before leaving for a super early flight. Their free shuttle to the airport runs 24 hr, just let the check in desk know what time you need. I think it runs every 30 minutes. Was very timely and got us to airport in less than 15 minutes. The business area was easy to use for printing our boarding passes. Despite the check in attendant, Stephen, being the only person working on a very busy night he was super  curteous helped us with all our questions and any amenities we needed. It's rare that you find an employee who doesn't complain or have even a single negative word to say when they are clearly swamped. We did not have time to utilize the indoor pool area but it did look to be nice and big. Lots of manicured grass areas with seating to sit and relax or have a friendly conversation in. Will be staying here again when back in the area.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice room,Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Room was spacious and clean. Noise was a bit of a problem. I could hear outside noise and hall noise quite clearly. There weren't enough condiments to go with the amount of coffee provided.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Kids love it!,"I live an hour away from the airport and the kids actually request this hotel due to the proximity to the airport, the pool (not to be understated) and the general nice attitude of the staff.  The price/quality ratio is just perfect.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good place to rest and repack before flying away from CO,"This is a new modern and very fresh hotel, many La Quinta are a bit aging, but this is a newly minted gem.  The bathroom had a mirror and countertop oh so cool, see photo.  The breakfasts are filling and good choices exist for a healthy start to your day.Great bus to airport included in room.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Really nice place near airport,We just needed a place to stay the night before  our flight. This hotel far and away exceeded our expectations. The room was huge and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was friendly. There is a free breakfast but nothing too exciting about that.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta is a good option at DIA,"Hotel was nicely refurbished, clean and comfortable at a reasonable price.  The breakfast is a bit under whelming but not bad.  Refrigerator was loud enough at start up to wake me up.  Grounds were very nicely maintained.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not too happy,"Stay somewhere each week as a rule. Not sure if I would stay at this location again. The elevators NEVER work at this location! No points, nothing off my bill... very disappointed! The last three times I have stayed here one or both of the elevators did not operate. Just not acceptable, especially since no one offered to carry bags up 4 flights of stairs for me!!",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent airport hotel.,"Very clean, comfortable rooms, near restaurants, 5 miles or so from the airport, great staff.  Has a very small gym and pool very nice.  Small courtyard that I walked in to get a little exercise outdoors.  Would use this hotel again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean,"Friendly staff, very clean room, warm cookies in the afternoon.  Room mostly quiet except for one noisy barking dog in room near us on the first night.  Did have to deal with broken key reader at back door do we had to walk back around to front if hotel to get back in after walking our dogs.  Hotel looks quite new inside.  Would stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,I have been coming here since it opened,"I was here along with six other people for a two-day business meeting. My room was comfortable and hospital-clean. The breakfast was excellent and included a waffle machine and eggs and sausage patties along with yogurt, fruit and cereal. The Sales Manager, John Webster, was very helpful with organizing our conference room and our catered lunches as well as reuniting me with my lost glasses. The front desk and the cleaning staff were very friendly and efficient. Altogether, it was a thoroughly pleasant stay",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,One night stay,Great hotel and price. Perfect for a night stay before early flight out of DIA. Would definitely book again. Had an airport shuttle available but did not use. Pet friendly a big plus. Warm cookies at check in counter. Great breakfast that started at 5am.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Consistently Good Experience,"This is my Go To hotel for safe, consistent, cost effective experience. Rooms and facilities are clean and well kept. Staff is very accommodating. Most La Quints's are conveniently located to public transportation.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Some cons but overall good,"The good: The hotel is very close to the airport and there are some dining options around.  It is a somewhat isolated area except for other hotels and apartments.  The hotel is undergoing renovation and we received a newly renovated room, in fact we were told that the wing where we stayed had been opened a few days before.  Paint, floor, bathroom, everything was brand new.  It was very convenient to have a microwave and a fridge.  Our room was facing the courtyard and it was very quiet.  Except for the renovation issues, the room was very nice.  The breakfast was convenient (coffee, juice, breads, waffles, oatmeal, apples, yogurt, etc.).The not so good: There were no vending machines in the vending room since it had been recently renovated, however; the front desk person was very helpful and gave us free water bottles and some snacks.  Our room had a strong smell of paint or some other substance used in the renovation; also, every surface in the room was covered in a white dust (also linked to the renovation).  We did tell the housekeeper, who was very gracious and told us that they've been trying to wipe the dust for days.  We didn't notice much of a difference later. The day we were leaving, the construction crew doing the renovation had a section of the parking lot cordoned off and we had to wait for them to move the equipment out of the way to access our car and leave.  There was no place to put soap, shampoo,etc. in the shower, other than the floor.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Will stay here next time we are in Denver,"Close enough to the airport, but far enough away that you don't hear the jets.  The Front Desk staff was very accommodating and moved us to a new room when we discovered that all the electrical outlets in the bathroom were not working.  Issue: The GFCI's were found to be already tripped and would not reset.The only con is the Housekeeping needs to be better or the recent renovations will be for naught.  Examples: Bed sheets looked like they were merely turned inside out, dust was on most surfaces, and container of Strawberries was found in our fridge. Renovation issues: Door sweeps on most of the 4th floor doors were missing where they were on the 5th floor and paint on the inside of the Bathroom double door in Room 410 was bubbled either by over paint or most likely by solutions used for cleaning.Again, we would stay here again and hope the property is as good as it was during our stay.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Superb,The room was absolutely wonderful. The staff pleasent and quick in their duties. Wake upmcall was made pefectly on time. I am definetely staying there in two weeks. The remodeling should be done by then.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great,"Booked a room, on line, had a cold,  ended up putting the wrong date in. Still, was given a room. Thanks!The was room was just great. The one wall behind the bed was deep purple my favorite color. There was no carpet, but tile that looked like wood. ( loved that).Wonderful amount of lighting. Very clean. I am not a modern person but this room was super nice.My only trouble was there was no tea bags, in the room.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,good for one night,"the rooms are nicely decorated, microwave, coffee maker. Bathrooms look a little beat up, but the big thing is that there is NO food, no vending machines, no soda machines. Good for a quick stay. The work out room is almost non existent, but was empty when I went so I was able to use the treadmill",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Enjoyable,"Rooms are large and clean.  We stayed here our first night after a long flight, and decided to book for our trip back home.  We arrived early and was given our room in minutes.  Very relaxing and even used the workout room and pool/spa.   There are several choices close by to have meals.  Staff is very friendly and polite always ready to help.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Short Trip,"We just stayed over night to catch an early flight. LQ is always our first choice, the price was right, location was perfect. Hotel has been updated rooms were nice. Our door to the room wasn't hung right, but no issues with locking or closing. They have attempted to update hotel, I believe it was good enough.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Birthday adventure ,"Stayed her with my cousin mid May I enjoyed my stay but the breakfast was less than desirable and the last day the hot water was out the location was perfect because was very easy to navigate  from , it's a quite hotel but comfortable I really can't say it was the best place to stay but I would stay there again",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Hotel,"We always stay at La Quinta, but this time we saw the nice renovation. The rooms look awesome, new carpet, furniture, paint, curtains, etc. The breakfast very good to start the day, very balance and delicious.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Rip Off Pricing,Convenience of staying by airport and being able to park car at LaQ while travelling far offset by pricing . I'm an Elite member  - no AAA or AARP discount allowed . Paid $50 more than I have ever paid to stay at a LaQ . Room was not carpeted . Staff was great .,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,My door doesn't shut?!,"We stayed here on the 18th of april, room 205. Brought all of our luggage to the room, went to leave the room to take a walk and our door didn't shut! You could push it right open. We tried shutting it several times, and even tried slamming it. Went to the front desk to ask for a different room, they were booked. They gave us 30 percent off for the night. How comforting to stay in a room where anyone could just walk in at anytime. Let alone not being able to leave the room without taking all of our belongings with us.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Okay Stay,"Kind of loud.  Redoing the rooms and we had to have someone come and hook up the television because it hadn't been done correctly.   Room had thin walls and was loud without the television to drown out the noise New decor looks straight out of the 80's with purple wall and crazy carpet.  If you just need a place to sleep before an airport visit, it was okay.  The shuttle was reliable and the breakfast was convenient.  Staff is nice.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Convenient, Clean, And Close To Airport","While traveling we often say at a La Quinta.  This La Quinta is convenient to DIA and has a shuttle starting, I believe, at 0300 hours. The price is reasonable, the hotel is in good condition, and our rooms as we stayed there twice, were in excellent condition with comfortable beds.  I found the staff helpful and personable.  The breakfast is typical La Quinta which is to say it is what I would expect of a La Quinta. In the future should I fly into/out of DIA, I would again stay at this location.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not as expected,"I stay at the Laquinta hotels when I can, I read the reviews before booking this week's trip in hopes the renovations had been completed. The staff was friendly and courteous, but as for amenities that I look for and as to why I choose Laquinta. The hot tub was out of service the entire stay, the fitness room appeared to be unexcessible due to construction. The rooms are very comfortable as normal and clean for the most part. I did not mention to management that the tun rails were not being cleaned because I had noticed the same hairs on the tub all week. The reason I didn't is as a customer I do not feel I should be required to notify hotel staff when their people are not doing an adiquate job.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Always a Friendly and Pleasant Stay,"We've stayed at this La Quinta many times and always, without exception had great service. The remodel is coming along nicely and we like the fresh, new look. Make sure you're in a room that has been fully inspected as some of the electrical was not working well in our room.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,First try--winner!,"Needed to overnight in Denver. A relative stays with this chain so I thought I'd give them a try. Was warmly greeted (thanks Trista) and given a room. Property has lots of free parking, free Wi-Fi, and free breakfast. It is under reno right now, but that's understandable and forgiveable. The room was nicely decorated and comfy yet modern. There's plenty of closet space, but limited TV channels. The neighbor's doors closing sound like they are slamming, so don't be too surprised when it happens at 5am. Otherwise the room is fairly quiet. All in all, a good stay and worthy of a repeat stay. Did I mention they have freshly baked cookies every afternoon?",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Recent updates make this a much better value.,"We have stayed at this La Quinta many times and I have reviewed it before.  But they have made so many changes that they deserve a new review.There were two issues I have had in the past and both have been addressed.  First they offer a fly/park option,  While it's a fair deal, they often ended up with so many cars parked at the hotel, you couldn't get a parking spot.  It happened to us once before where we had a room, but not a parking spot anywhere near the hotel.  Now they limit the number of fly/park customers so that you can stay and park at the hotel.  That is a big improvement.The second is major.  They are remodeling the entire facility.  The rooms were very dated the last time we stayed.  The carpet was stained, the walls damaged and the place just had a run down appearance and feel.  No more.  It is now very modern with all surfaces and plumbing fixtures replaced.  It feels and looks like a brand new hotel.The place is now very modern.  It is now a bargain as the finishes are that of a much more upscale hotel.  The rooms are large, the furniture new, and the place is very clean.  Heck, even the breakfast seems better.  I would not hesitate to recommend this La Quinta.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Hotel. Quick Stay,"Tried this hotel for the first time while in Denver because I had an early morning flight.  The hotel was easy to find, and had decent parking.  Big lobby with nice front desk staff that made check in easy.  Didn't have time to use much in the hotel as I was in and out but they did have some restaurants right next door that you could walk to.  This La Quinta was also undergoing renovations like the one I stayed in the night before in Grand Junction but its a nice upgrade. Nice carpeting in the hallways and the rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Would recommend if in the area.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Horrible,Stayed on the way out couldn't find my reservation for three rooms! On the way back got told one price then put on hold and rates got jacked 30 bucks per room!!!! Beware!!!!! Park and fly was good but the staff not so much and reservation people are incompetent!,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Easy convenient hotel,"Stayed at this hotel at the very beginning and the very end of a ski trip.  Lovely, clean accommodations and wonderful breakfast bar.  24 airport shuttle allowed us to return the rental car the night before dearture and take the shuttle - which makes getting to that 5:30am flight much easier!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Under renovation,Check on the status of the renovation before reserving.  We were in one of the rooms that had not been renovated yet and it was kind of old and dumpy. Will hopefully be better after the renovation is completed.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay & Fly,Nice convenient location for a stay-in-and-fly-out.  Hotel currently under much needed renovation; results look good.  Located on hotel row near DIA.  Two decent restaurants in walking distance. Fresh cookies in the evening.  Breakfast service starts early (5-ish).,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Robert: the best shuttle service experience ever!,I had the best possible shuttle service with Robert as my driver. He was absolutely pleasant and went above and beyond to make sure I understood where to go once I was at the airport. His driving was also very safe and it was the most comfortable experience. He then was picking up an elderly couple that he had dropped off a week or so before their trip to Hawaii and he had clearly established a good relationship with them the week prior. His kindness and friendliness was the perfect touch to an amazing time in Colorado. Thank you!,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Part of excellent trip support,Traveling?  A great place to stop before catching a flight from Denver International Airport.  Prompt and friendly shuttle to airport.  Supportive and friendly staff at hotel for any needs while traveling.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Good, clean rooms","I had a good overall stay here. I was greeted promptly at the airport by the shuttle. It was a quick ride to the hotel in a modern shuttle. Once at the hotel, check-in was fast and friendly. I was given a room on the top floor of the hotel. It was clean and relatively quiet, other than some noise from the hallway and the elevator by the room. The bed was of decent comfort. The shower was fine and had decent pressure and good temperature. I wish La Quinta's would give lotion as a bathroom amenity, though, especially in Denver's dry climate.Breakfast in the morning was plentiful and included eggs, a self-making waffle machine, and biscuits, yogurt, a variety of cereal, juices, and coffee. I was happy with the offering. The shuttle back to the airport was quick and easy. Overall, I had a good stay here, and would recommend this hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,good rooms after a long flight,"Rooms have coffee making and as seems usual in the US, a microwave. Breakfast , a good buffet,included in the price. All day( and night) access to coffee in breakfast area at reception, which was usual. Useful comfortable lounge area when waiting for transport. Efficient regular transport , free, from Airport and return. Rooms, large, bed comfortable, large walk in shower with a good long bar to grab would be useful for less able visitors, bathroom area large for wheel chair moving.although near airport, NO NOISE!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent Hotel close to DIA,I stay here often..The front desk staff is always helpful and friendly. The rooms have been renovated and are very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. Breakfast is included with every stay and free shuttle to airport.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Perfect one night stay a free shuttle ride away from Denver airport,"When you arrive after midnight in Denver & are headed to destinations beyond Denver, this hotel fits the space between landing and breakfast.Hotel feels slightly dated though clean and fairly comfortable.We overslept for breakfast purposes so can't comment fairly.Free shuttle is essential. I wish I had singles to tip the driver.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful stay!,Last-minute reservation.  Everyone was nice and hotel was clean and lovely.  We were able to leave our car at the hotel and the shuttle service to and from the airport was perfect.  I highly recommend this hotel and we will be staying there again.,5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great stay!,"We recently were delayed in returning to the East Coast due to Storm Stella, so we booked a room here. We enjoyed every moment of our stay. The front desk help was wonderful in keeping our luggage until check in, arranging a perfect room, and offering help in any way. We will definitely stay here when returning to Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay here when flying out of DIA,We like the LaQuinta at DIA. A good place to stay when flying in or out and need to stay in Denver for the night. Appreciate their military discount too. The breakfast is adequate and served early for early flights out.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great price,"Booked my room through trip advisor. Ended being through expedia to make a reservation. Upon arriving at the hotel it was never updated with the hotel. But the girl working at the counter took care of it with the exact room we reserved through expedia. Room was clean and comfortable bed. The prices were better here then the other hotels in the areas. Breakfast was nothing special, but that isn't the reason we stayed here. Great price and comfortable clean rooms. I would stay here again.The hotel also has a pool and hot tub.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great value, close to airport, convenient transprt","Good value, clean motel, very friendly and helpful staff, always greet customers!

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Keeps getting better!,"We have stayed at this property dozens of times over years and can see the improvement. We can tell they are under new management, both by the change in staff and in attitudes...keep it up, we can tell it is changing!!! rooms are clean and fresh, staff welcoming and friendly, a great stay overall....and they had cookies!!!! what a nice touch!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,mile high without the smoke,"I have stayed at this property several time and it is always a great place.  The people are friendly and warm and it is a very inviting place to stay.  This facility is close to my work and a short hop to the airport.  With airport shuttle if I have an early flight I return the rental and use the shuttle in the morning, this way I do not have to mess with a car return.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Always stay at LQ!,"I only stay at LQ...it is the best! The overall quality of LQ, its service, location make it the only lodging for me. Thank you for the free shuttle from DIA and location next to Ruby Tuesday and other establishments.  LQ @ DIA is a sure thing...every trip!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver La Quinta,"Hotel was very nice, rooms very clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in or near the Denver Airport. Staff was very helpful. Hotel was being renovated and will be lovely when fully complete.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Short but sweet,"The room was great. The attention to detail in the room was hands down wonderful. Asked at checkin about shuttle service - glad I did, because it runs often, but you must sign up for a spot on the van.  The driver was friendly and prompt.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Beautiful New Decor,"Wow the renovation of this hotel is spectacular.  We thought it was nice and not outdated before, but when we arrived the change since our last visit was spectacular.  New decor, new rooms, new bathroom fixtures and all!  Well done and relaxing.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,great,"the parking program  best any were in the world very liberal . The staff made me feel as if I was a regular with them . While sitting in the lobby I heard one desk agent address on man on his arrival by first name . Even though it was my first stay there I too felt like an "" old timer "" with them .",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Checked me out.,This motel will cause me to question staying at LaQuinta inns and suites. Between the poor upkeep of the facility and being checked out in the middle of my stay so I can be charged for a higher rate I am not sure If I will come back to this facility or not.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean the fitness area,"The machines in the fitness center have probably never been wiped down and judging by the water stains in the drinking fountain, the entire area is likely neglected. Common areas need extra attention.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,J. Dirksen,"Chose this hotel because of the location and they had a stay and park deal for the airport. Told front desk we needed shuttle at 4:00 am and they said no problem be down here at 4:00 am. We Got to front desk at 3:58 and no shuttle out front and NO ONE present at front desk. I had to go searching for someone to help me and then she said, your shuttle already left, it leaves promptly at 4:00 am! I was standing there before 4:00 am and there was no shuttle and no one to help. Stay somewhere else that has a more professional staff and save your self a headache and missed flight. Rooms are dated and not very clean and Bathtub was nasty and had hair left in it and mold around the tub in the caulking! Nasty!!! Will never be back here again! Not happy with his stay at all!!!",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great vaue,We stay at LaQuinta when possible.  Best value for the dollar and no hassle about our dogs. The rooms are always clean and fresh. Easy check in and out.  Pleasant surroundings especially at the Denver Airport property.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,airport convenience,"good location with easy access to airport, average accommodations but is pet friendly! Very noisy - be aware that if you have an early wake up time ask for a quiet location. don't expect much for breakfast but its something to get you going.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Overnight Stay,"Stayed here to take advantage of the shuttle to/from airport.  Front desk staff friendly and helpful.  Stayed in a renovated room that was large and very nicely decorated.  Room and bath were clean, the bed comfy and two nice restaurants within easy walking distance. Only drawback for us is the gap between the bottom of the door and floor which allowed hallway and neighboring room noise.  We could hear and understand most of the conversation from the folks across the hall and muffled TV noise from the adjacent room.  This was disappointing as we were in bed early due to an early flight the next day and it was hard to fall asleep.  Once the neighbors went to bed it was a quiet nights sleep though.  Doors could use some type of under door seal that would help with this issue. Breakfast was nice and filled us up before our flight (suggest setting out some mustard packets for making sausage biscuits).  Our overall stay was nice and we would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Lovely Hotel and Great Staff!,This hotel is a great choice if you need to stay in the DIA area. The staff was friendly and helpful and very fun to stop and talk with. The pool and jacuzzi are nicely maintained. This hotel is desperately in need of a recycling program and breakfast generates WAY too much trash but the food options are nice. We brought our own mugs/cups and utensils which is a wonderful option if you can plan ahead that way. The best thing about La Quinta is the option to bring our dog and for that we are very grateful. The refrigerator is a wonderful asset in the room too. We had a great time relaxing here! Thank you for being so kind!,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Cheerful front desk ladies,"The front desk ladies were cheerful when they checked us in.  It felt like a nice warm welcome. The room was clean.  The mattress was actually comfortable but soft. I prefer hard mattress.  So I slept on the very side of the bed, but gravity pulled me to the center of the bed. Bathroom is clean with hair dryer.  Breakfast starts at 5am on weekdays and 6am on weekends. They had variety of choices such as eggs, sausage, fruit, muffins, bagels, yogurt, waffles, oatmeal, variety of juices, etc. They had a van that took their guests to the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent,Great room and total package excellent. Booked by airlines due to weather. Staff very pleasant and helpful. The Internet service in my room was nonexistent and the staff contacted their provider to resolve the problem.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Tired hotel,"Shower was good, but bed was saggy and a bit lumpy; hair dryer did not work; breakfast was meager and unappealing. We stayed here when our flight was cancelled out of DEN; rate was good but hotel not so.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient location to airport,"Due to snow storm, I was stranded in Denver an extra day.  The hotel was comfortable and I appreciated being able to leave my car and shuttle to the airport.  The shuttle was on time and efficient both directions.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Clean, nicey decorated, close to the airport","My family stayed here during an overnight layover. The woman who checked us in was very helpful and friendly. The beds were comfortable, and the room was clean. It's a nice place to stay if you are stuck in Denver and want to be close to the airport!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Comfortable, Nice, Clean",We just did an overnight here on our way to Winter Park and it was very nice.  The breakfast in the morning was really good and we would stay at this location again if we had the chance.  The bed was super comfy.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Average Accommodations,"The DENVER - AIRPORT La Quinta is nothing to write home about. Overall it's not bad, but it's not great either -- and the breakfast leaves a LOT to be desired.  But if you need an affordable option that is less than 15 minutes to the airport, it works. However, be forewarned that the room doors are lacking in sound muffling qualities -- everyone who walks by sounds like they are in the room with you -- so if you're a light sleeper, it might not be the best option for you.   If you have the ability to do a short drive, the La Quinta Inn DENVER GOLDEN is much, much nicer (at the same or lower cost).  The drawback is that it's about 30-35 minutes from the airport.  But if that's not a concern, then it's a much better La Quinta to stay at.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,BEST HOTEL to park your car for a trip!,I love this hotel for parking our car when we go on trips of 4 or more days.   They have a park and fly rate that is completely reasonable. The ease of taking their airport shuttle to DIA and back to get your car when you return is GREAT!  The hotel offers a continental breakfast and the rooms are always clean and accommodating.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta near DIA,"We drove from Albuquerque to Denver and arrived at sunset. We were exhausted and after dropping family members at their DIA parking we needed a La Quinta without driving too far. When our iPhone said we were 5 miles from a La Quinta we were thrilled. The staff was friendly, a great restauranr was across the street and we fell asleep by 9 PM, cozy and happy.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,All basic needs met,The title explains what I look for in a mid-priced hotel The La Quinta was fair to us in a season where rip-offs abound. Thank you management and staff! NUMBER ONE COMPLIMENT A GREAT BED LINENS AND MATTRESS  This is so important to a couple that has a Beautirest Foam mattress at home.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A shelter in a time of storm,"We had a nice night stay at the Hotel and took the shuttle to the Airport.  Hotel was nice and clean and room was nice and warm.  Temp outside was in the teens and snow.  We left our vehicle parked there and when we returned, it wouldn't start.  The General Manager went above and be on to help us, even offering his car to try and jump start ours.    When we found out our vehicle was going to have to be towed to the dealership, he made sure we had a room available for the night.  And this was 2 days before Christmas.  The staff was very helpful and caring.  We will definitely stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel,"Hotel accomodated our vehicle parking while in cancun.  The stay at hotel was very nice, first night bed downstairs very comfy and clean. Returned 10 days later to room upstairs bed was stiff, staff stated they were in middle of remodel,  staff treated us great and hotel very clean.  Food good for the type.  Would def stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Welcome haven on Christmas Eve,"When a flight delay caused us to miss our connecting flight, Airport Accommodations put us up at La Quinta for the night (well, at least for a few hours!)  They sent a shuttle to pick us up.  We arrived late, cold, exhausted, and hungry, to an inviting lobby with a pleasant desk clerk.  Our room was warm, clean, and comfortable.  We had not eaten all day, had no transportation, nor any idea where to get something to eat.  The desk clerk provided us with options that could be delivered, and we were able to use the lobby computer to check out the menus before ordering.  We were also able to get butter, salt, and pepper from the breakfast area when none was brought with our order.  Then a wonderful hot shower!  (even though we had no clothes to change into).  Our early wake up call came right on time, and the shuttle arrived promptly at 4:30 a.m.  Even at that early hour, the shuttle driver was friendly and not grumpy, getting us to the airport on time and wishing us a safe flight and Merry Christmas.  I don't know about the breakfast, since leaving so early, we did not get to eat breakfast, nor use any of the other amenities.  But we definitely recommend this La Quinta to any other stranded passengers who need a place to sleep.",4

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Quiet, not pricey","It's a nice hotel that falls within someone's budget. The hotel needs some updating, but is in really good shape. The bathroom could have used a bit more attention with the cleaning, but overall we would stay there again.  Plus it's right across the parking lot from a Starbucks!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very comfortable,"I have stayed at this hotel at least 3- 4 times a year for the past 6-7 years.  While it is due for a renovation, I have always found it to the spotlessly clean, well maintained, and the staff is excellent.  I especially appreciate that La Quinta is pet friendly and this hotel has always been very accommodating of my pet needs; the cleaning staff was very considerate of my cats in their kennels.  The staff is very knowledgeable of local spots of interest and gave me very reliable taxi information.   I especially like the hotels location near to several restaurants and a convenience store, and the desk staff is always ready to give friendly advice on nearby spots to eat and drink.  My only fuss was that this past summer one of the elevators was out of order, and there was a shortage of luggage trolleys.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Ready for the remodeling ,"The hotel is still fairly nice and clean...but is ready for the upcoming renovations. The hotel front staff is excellent. The rooms are nice size. My only complaints are:1. The breakfast is exactly the same every morning (unlike similar hotels from other brands that mix it up a little each morning).2. The in room TV has limited channels...very basic offering of choices.On the plus side, it is very convenient to DIA and there are several good restaurants within a short distance.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,My stay,Great stay.  The hotel is a little older but the hotel is in good shape.  The staff is very professional and helpful. I am going to be going back to Denver for work again and will be staying at this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good Airport Hotel,"I especially like the fact that even though DIA is not particularly a ""red-eye"" airport, the La Quinta Shuttle Service is available all night long for late-arriving flights. Our room was clean, quiet and the breakfast is good.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Decent hotel,"The rooms are large and spacious, but have a strange layout.  My room's bed felt old and worn out - far too soft for my personal preference. Bathrooms also looked outdated for a hotel that appears brand new from the exterior.Breakfast was decent - with all of the standard fare. This hotel contracts out their shuttle service and I waited a long time for their shuttle from the airport. Called the hotel twice while I waited nearly 50  minutes for the 30 minute shuttle intervals.  But the morning shuttle to DIA was on time and efficient.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Place,LaQuinta Inn Denver Airport is a great place to stay. The rooms are spacious and clean. The beds are comfortable. The pool is big and perfect. They have a 24 hour shuttle. You let them know at check in what time you need to leave and you even get a wake up call.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Business as usual,"On my frequent trips to/through Denver, I find this hotel most convenient and hospitable.  LQ buildings are built smart.  When I want to work at the hotel, I find the accommodations reliable.  The surroundings are peaceful.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,a stay before a flight,"La Qunita is perfectly placed for a nightly stay before an early flight the next day. Nothing fancy but very accommodating with routine shuttle to the airport, a nice breakfast and large rooms. The shower was hot, the sheets were clean and the floor was swept. Coffee maker provides weak coffee so use 2 bags. Did not use the pool or gym.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Decent airport hotel,"I have been staying at this location rather routinely.  The awful sewage smell that did assault you as you walked in the front door was much better on this trip, i am much relieved by this.Front desk is consistently helpful, rooms are clean. Some downward decline, but still a clean, decent place to stay. convenient to the airport and dining locations.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver Airport La Quinta rocks!,"Elizabeth at the front desk checked me in late at night.  She was kind, professional, & courteous.  She helped me with a billing issue & it only took a couple of minutes & she did it with a smile!  Keep up the great work & I will be sure to tell all my friends about your hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Friendly, Comfortable and Clean",We stayed one night at this hotel. Hotel staff were friendly and efficient at both check in and check out. Our room was very clean and the bed was quite comfortable. We would definitely stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient Airport Location ,"I've stayed here twice recently when flying out of DIA early in the morning. I avoid the morning traffic, the rental car return is nearby and there is a gas station on the way.The hotel is clean, quiet and comfortable.I have two more trips to the Denver area before year's end and plan to stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Best way to Denver,"This hotel is a fantastic idea if you would stay out of Denver, rich and various breakfast, beautiful rooms, a lot of nice people, and a fantastic free shuttle bus from/to airport!A must for travelers that want visit denver neighbors!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Review of night stay,"I landed at the Denver airport and stopped at this hotel.  It was surprising that it was SO busy after midnight.  The front desk clerk had one person come up and was verbally assaultive regarding a problem, there was a line of people trying to check in and the clerk was fabulous.  He was very calm and helpful to all of us!  Great job!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Average at best,"Just got back from a weekend to Colorado and the La Quinta was average at best. This is a hotel by the airport, so it is worn and showing it's age. Nothing crazy - torn carpet, really worn out bed, but it was pretty quiet. Only noise issue was the toilets. They are the ""super flush"" models and are pretty loud when someone flushes one at night.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Manager was excellent,There was a car in the parking lot going off every 45 minutes with an alarm.  The front desk did not resolve the problem. BUT the Manger Pete did return my call and refunded the one night stay.  He assured me he would advise staff how to deal with the issue if it ever came up again .    5 stars for a Hotel that calls you back and makes it right by the customer.  The car was not registered to a guest so a tow truck could of been called to haul it away.  I am sure in the future it will be handled properly.  JoAnn,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Works for an Airport overnight.,Hotel is close to the airport. It is about 10 minutes away. We had a car to return so we did not use the shuttle but they were running at 4 AM. :). The rooms were okay ours could have used a little repair but for a quick night it was okay.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Affordable & Pleasant,"The hotel was fine, the staff was fine, the guests were not fine. Too many people smoking dope outside came into the lobby and elevators, making the place stink. The smoking area needs to be MUCH further away from any of the doors. Perhaps all the Colorado hotels need to improve their air circulation systems to cope with the dope-heads? Ugh.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Too loud,"Unless you want to feel like you are a part of every conversation in the hallway, or want to have walls so thin that you are awakened by the wake up calls in other guest rooms, keep looking.   Simply put, this place is loud.  Its comfortable, so if a good night's sleep isn't important to you, its a decent choice.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Aging - not gracefully,"We've been staying here for years, every year I review it, & every year my review goes down. I'm sorry about it, but...The place is starting to look & feel unkempt. Everything in our room worked (except a light wouldn't come on), but it wasn't perfectly clean (dirt on the closet floor, scuffs in the bathroom etc). Lots of dings & ceiling stains. And the rest of the hotel definitely showed signs of untended-to wear & tear (& dirt). The one ""business"" computer was out of order (as it was last time we stayed). And ~ as if the breakfast isn't sparse & unhealthy enough ~ the coffee machine was not working; they did provide coffee in urns, but there was no plain hot water so oatmeal &/or tea was out of the question.In general we really like LaQuintas, partly because their pet policy is fair & intelligent, & this one is very convenient to DIA. But, really, it needs some serious TLC in order for us to continue staying there without feeling insulted (especially as the price has gone way up since last year).",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Quite reasonable for the price,"I found the La Quinta Inn to be a fair choice for staying in Denver.  Located on Tower Rd near the airport, I was only about half an hour away from the majority of Denver.The staff was courteous and made the check in and check out a breeze.  The room itself was fair sized for its type, although the king-sized bed was a bit firm for our preference, but not a deal-breaker.  The foldout sofa bed was surprisingly comfortable and I had no issues using that.  The breakfast was better than average, sporting sausage and egg patties along with waffles, pastries, fruit, yogurt, and cereal.  If I had to complain about anything, the plumbing took some getting used to; the faucet shot out water pretty hard if not eased gently and the shower took a lot more turning of the dial to get hot water than it would appear.  Minor gripes and nothing serious.Overall, I found the hotel a pleasant place to rest for a weekend trip to Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Skip the airport shuttle!,"The hotel is okay but don't get scammed by their airport shuttle service! I asked for Delta departing but the non English speaking driver refused to take me to Delta departing! Instead he dumped me off in baggage claim, several streets away from the terminal! The 10 minute ride took 35 minutes! I'm 70 and not familiar with the airport! Thanks for nothing LaQuinta!",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean and friendly for fast visit,"We stayed here for one night prior to catching our flight home.  Clean hotel, and friendly staff.  We were able to sleep in and have quick access to the airport.  We will definitely stay there again.  Only down fall was we could not print our boarding passes, as their pc was broken.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Lovely Stay,"This hotel is a very good value for the cost. Most of the staff are friendly and nice. There were some that left you wanting to talk to a tree instead. I am glad they are pet friendly because I brought my dog with me from NJ to Colorado. There are plenty of good restaurants around and close to a downtown or ""mall"" like area. If you can rent a car or bike. I enjoyed my stay. I only wish the breakfast was more than cereal, bagels and waffles. But oh well! If you are looking for a good place, this is it.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great stay,Hotel is very clean and rooms are spacious.  The views are award winning from the 5th floor.  You are greeted at the front desk with smiles and a very friendly staff.  Breakfast is ready at 5am which is a plus.  Highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Place,"While traveling for leisure, I stayed here for only one night. Had I been staying in Denver longer I would have gladly extended my stay. The room was clean and spacious, the staff was friendly, and the breakfast was good. If you are looking for a property with easy access to I-70 and/or the airport, this hotel is great.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Fast and friendly shuttle from the airport, quick check in","I stayed at La Quinta Inn on a long layover in Denver. The shuttle from the airpot was quick and the driver was friendly, I hardly had to wait at the pickup area outside the domestic terminal. The hotel is only about 5-10 minutes away. Check in was extremely fast, which was nice at the late hour. Room was big and extremely cold from the AC. Nothing special to note. As far as using this as a transit hotel, it fits the bill for me. I will note that the elevator is infuriatingly slow. I ended up taking the stairs, it was so ridiculous.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice room.  Helpful staff,We travel with our dogs so we often stay at La Quinta.  The dog area was adequate but the doggy bag dispenser was empty.  I needed a stamp and they didn't have any.  I think it was just an unusually busy weekend and they were running behind.  The room was nice but I got about 10 bedbug bites.   Overall it looked very nice and I would try it again I just didn't get them at their best.  If you want to get into Denver you have to take the shuttle back to the airport where you take the train into town.  They thought this would be about $9 per person.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Hotel  stay at LaQuinta near Denver airport.,"Emergency stay in this  hotel due to airport schedule. Not up to the LaQuintas quality I have received before.  Breakfast selection poor, needed some eggs, sausage, bacon  or something for protein. Only enough coffee in room for 2 cups for 3 people.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,One disappointment for satisfied customers,The sofa bed was very uncomfortable in an otherwise very satisfactory stay. Our previous stays at the same hotel have always been comfortable and enjoyable. A simple upgrade of furniture would resolve the problem.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Horrible !!!!!!!,"I stayed there in order to catch an early morning flight.There was only one person working the desk.  This was my second time staying there and the same situation both times.I paid to leave my car there while out of town.  When I arrived back at DIA, I waited over 40 minutes for the shuttle. Finally, a driver for another hotel took pity on me and drove me to the La Quinta.When I arrived, I went inside to speak to the front desk person about the lack of shuttle service.  She never apologized and acted as if I was an inconvenience to her "" leaning against the counter""......wow !Great job ........",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Mediocre hotel, good service","I had reserved a king room, was assigned a 2 queen room.  Was immediately moved when I called the front desk.  Got into the king room, looked OK on the surface.  Opened the closet, no laundry bag was in there.  Opened the refrigerator, was full of food from previous guest.  Tried to open a night stand drawer and the front came off.  Tried to call the front desk, but phone was dead.  I reported everything the next morning at the front desk, and everything was remedied by the time i returned to the room that evening except the night stand drawer was missing (not a problem).Breakfast was skimpy, the only hot item was waffles, no eggs, potatoes or meat.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great meeting,I held a meeting at this hotel and was very pleased with all aspects. The facility and the staff were great! The staff accommodated all of our needs with smiles and quick service. I will definitely use this hotel for future meetings.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Title of Review?,"Thank you very much.  It's always a pleasure to stay with you and very predictable good service. Clean room, clean hallway, elevator and lobby.  Walking distance to some great restaurants.  Brightly lit hallways and gym.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Ok for a flight stayover.,"Certainly acceptable for a flight stay-over. Otherwise, no reason to go. Typical of overnight, breakfast offering places. Near enough to the airport to get shuttle transport. Otherwise no amenities, nor was there food nearby.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,very well cared for property,"This was our first time to stay at the Denver International airport location the accommodations were great, they have a very nice patio area with a gazebo and tables and chairs outside, within walking distance to 2 restaurants, they have shuttels to and from the airport",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Use to be good Has gone down the tubes,"The facilities have really gone downhill since I was here 1 yrs ago. Ice machine on every floor didn't work, elevator was scary and slowwwwww. and the room had one bar of soap and one little shampoo pretty poor. The staff was friendly and accommodating but really needs an update",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,An excellent choice,"This hotel is an excellent choice for anyone passing through Denver airport, in particular.  We have stayed several times and have found it to be comfortable, clean, with easy access to the airport and rental cars.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay somewhere else!,"My friends stayed at a La Quinta in Page, Az on our road trip and they said it was clean and like new. When we had to stay near Denver Airport prior to going home, I figured it was a safe bet. It ended up being a terrible end to our trip. The hotel has a decent lobby area, but the elevator, hallways, and rooms are dated, old and dirty. The room was not clean, there was lots of hair on the floor of the bathroom, the floor of the shower was filthy, the pull out sofa sheets had not been changed and had stains and more hair. I did not even want to shower there and hated having to sleep there. Only positive was that the front desk check in person was nice.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Decent Airport Hotel,"We needed a suite hotel near the airport to accommodate my husband, granddaughter and myself and this turned out to be a reasonable choice. The suite was large, consisting of a bedroom, a sitting room with a fold-out couch and a good sized bathroom. There was also a small refrigerator which worked out well for us as we had an early morning flight and were able to purchase sandwiches to eat on the flight and refrigerate them overnight. It's not an elegant place but we felt the room was reasonably priced for its size and proximity to the airport. The hotel staff was pleasant and their airport shuttle service was extremely helpful. Because of our early flight, we decided to return our rental car the night before. After dropping off the car, the rental car agency shuttled us to the airport and we were able to pick up a hotel shuttle back to the hotel. In the morning the shuttle returned us to the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Poor attention to maintenance,"Have stayed at the La Quinta on Tower Road many times and, lately, have had a rash of maintenance issues. This time, the shower would not drain and brown sludge started backing up around my feet. Disgusting! I reported the incident to the front desk and the agent seemed disinterested.Step up your game, La Quinta. Guests shouldn't be required to get hepatitis shots before staying at your hotel. I will bypass your facility on future trips to Denver.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,So grateful for the staff and service at La Quinta DIA!,"Because of a flight cancellation, we arrived (with two young children) into Denver at 1:40am. Knowing that we were arriving too late for our friends from Boulder to pick us up, we booked the La Quinta at the last minute. We were impressed with the service every step of the way. As we walked into the La Quinta tired and bleary-eyed, we were warmly greeted by the man at the front desk. Our room was all ready and was wonderful (comfortable beds, clean, spacious). Because of our late arrival, we overslept and missed breakfast. The front desk was extremely accommodating and led our small family into the kitchen so we could get breakfast. As we ate, several staff members came to check on us - one even brought coloring sheets, crayons, and blow-up beach balls for the kids. Smiles all around. Despite our crazy flights, we felt so welcome and cared for at the La Quinta DIA. It was, by far, one of the best hotel experiences we've had in a long time. Thank you!!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Staff sold our booked room and would not own responsibility,"We booked an Executive King Room and when we arrived at 1:30 am, were given a room with two double beds for our family of four, with not other options.I made a booking through a reputable online booking site and received a confirmation, ""Your room is paid for and guaranteed.""  La Quinta had the room available the day of the reservation, but staff sold it to another customer, prior to our late night arrival.  When my two growing boys, my wife and I opened the door, the first thing we did was call the desk.  We were told that it was the last room available, but that the manager in the morning would ""take care of us.""This morning, the front desk manager admitted that her staff had screwed up, but said the hotel would only give the online booking site a 40% refund.  The General Manager was in the office behind the desk, but would not come out to discuss the matter.  Ultimately the GM granted a 50% refund.The hotel management acknowledged that they should have held our room, the online booking site representative said they should have held the room, but the most they would ""own"" was 50% of the $188 total.  That was disappointing.  Everyone makes mistakes.  It is how we deal with our mistakes after the fact that are the measure of our reputation.  La Quinta DIA has really ruined their reputation in my mind.  The room was clean, the hotel in good order, hence I did not give it a 1-star rating.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very disappointing,"For almost $180 a night you unfortunately will end up in an older hotel with below average rooms, poor quality bedding (very cheap pillows and a sheet and thin blanket), and very thin walls. In the room next to mine, there were 10 very loud people who partied well into the night.  Despite calls to the front desk, these guests were there for the next 3 nights lining the hallway with their garbage. Poor sleep aside, the staff was kind but when I got home, I noticed I had been charged twice - an unexpected  $500+ on my credit card. Calls to Angela the Assistant General Manager could not resolve the charges so I called my credit card company.  The location is near the airport and the shuttle was very helpful,  but otherwise, there is no way I would ever stay at this hotel or a LA Quinta property again.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Anopther Boring Night,"So boring I received a good night sleep.  The bed was heaven.  The room was spotless.The breakfast was, as usual, great.  Good choices,, hot food, not over cooked food.  The personnel were helpful and professional.  I am 100 percent Military disabled.  I have a comfort dog and La Quenta always welcomes our pet.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport nearby is the only plus,"Stayed here for a night. The staff is efficient; no problem with that. But for $150/night these following points aren't acceptable:-No outlets near the night table-Ice machines on my floor and the one below didn't work and, with the slowness of the elevator, getting ice turned into a 10 minute ordeal-There was a long dark hair and spill on my comforter -The elevators took forever at times-No amenities in the rooms except for the single-serve coffee maker and hairdryer -Window wasn't washed. There were smudges all over itI knew I should have made note of everything since I know I'm missing a couple things.You're getting the bare minimum with this place wrapped in a nice building that is near the airport.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Personal,Shuttle to the airport 24 hours a day. Clean large rooms with small micro wave and fridge. Staff is friendly. Nice desk with work space. Pool is indoors and there is a decent gym. It about a 15 minute shuttle ride to the airport. I could not detect any airport noise. This a newer hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A Few Minor Glitches but a good choice!,"We stayed one night before a flight.  The hotel looks well renovated.  Our room was clean and comfortable.  We wanted to do some laundry in the guest laundry which is a very nice feature.  The soap and softner dispensing machines were broken and there was no notice so after trying to get them to work, we finally had to go to the front desk and buy the soap.  They should put up a sign on the machine to let people know this until they are repaired.  The pool and hot tub are great.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Family Trip to Kansas,"I stay at a lot of LaQuinta Hotels and this is by far the worst condition that I have stayed in.  I would not stay again at this Hotel, because everything, yes I mean everything needs a major overhaul of the rooms, hallway and lobby.  I would be embarrassed to offer this lack of quality to your guests. It definitely should not carry the points value that it does.  Compare it to your Ft. Collins Hotel, or your Hayward, CA. remodel. Shame on LaQuinta. Shame is what you are bringing on the LaQuinta name.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean convenient airport hotel,Great location next to airport - free airport shuttle twice an hour.  Staff very friendly. Room was clean and had a microwave and refrigerator which was helpful. Free breakfast in morning was perfect before leaving on an early flight.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a place next to the Denver airport. The hotel also has a smallFitness room and indoor poolWhich I unfortunately did not have a chance to use,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta Denver,"Plus:  Less than 15 minutes to the airport; clean rooms, steps away from Ruby TuesdayMinus:  No microwave or refrigerator if you will be there for several days. OK:  Good breakfast, but not the best La Quinta has to offer.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not a nice stay at all!,"We would not ever go back to this hotel!  And we would not have stayed the night had my husband not been sick.  There was hair in the bathtub, hair on the side of the toilet, hair on the bathroom floor, nail clippings on the carpet, cobwebs in the window sill, dead mosquitos on the a/c and a half full soda bottle in the trash can.  The tub was peeling some sort of paint.  I was so surprised because the hotel had been rated well when we booked it.  I spoke to the desk clerk and was given a 25% discount for the room condition but it was not really compensation for the discomfort of the dirty room.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Extremely disappointed.,In need of more courtesy. I was appalled how disrespectful and unhelpful the staff was. I let them know I was an elite member after I checked in and was never offered elite member gift or upgrade. Failed to replenish breakfast food.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A bit disappointing for a La Quinta,"We have stayed at a lot of La Quintas, and are usually very pleased.  Not so much here.  This was especially bad because we were there for over a week.  It was all of the little things that made it less than great.  The cleanliness left something to be desired, the beds were a bit too hard (the usual LQ beds are great), we were right next to the elevator whose noise tended to wake me up, the key cards kept failing to work, and when I went to the desk clerk she just said that they were ""touchy"".  After putting up with this for two days I asked to see the manager, and he gave me brand new ones that finally worked properly.  The breakfast was minimal, no eggs, meats, or even non-instant oatmeal.  The toilet also had very poor flushing, need I say more.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A Night in Denver,Had a good sleep on a very comfortable bed with wonderfully soft pillows.  Good breakfast in the a.m. The only problem we had was with another guest who removed our laundry from the dryer and left it sitting on table.  We had allowed for 30 minutes to dry.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Reliable stop in Denver,"I stay at the LaQuinta airport hotel any time I pass through Denver.  I can count on a clean room, swimming pool and hot tub, and a quick continental breakfast.  I catch the shuttle to the airport right out front.  It's convenient and easy.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED!,"Stayed here last year and in spite of the obvious needs of this hotel I thought it was OK. Stayed last night and this place is a disaster. Clogged sink, dirty towels and the breakfast tasted old and stale. Not to mention the girls softball team running up and down the hall. Coming back to Denver later this year and I guess I will have to find another hotel. For the price they charge for a room here you would think they could do a little maintenance and clean a little bit.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,One Night Stand,"Everything you should expect in an airport hotel.  Efficient, clean, quiet.Would recommend for a one (or even 2) night stand.  The airport shuttle was on time,good service and no hitches.  Left early so no breakfast, but instant coffee available in the lobby.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Clean, comfortable and affordable stay near Denver airport","I was one of a party of 3 adults who stayed one night at the La Quinta Inn near Denver Airport and found it be very pleasant.  The front desk recommended a very good restaurant close  by(walking distance) and everything was very convenient and the front desk personnel were friendly and helpful.  The beds ere comfortable too! Overall, a very good place to stay for a early morning flight.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,On The Fence...,"I stayed here one night for the shuttle service to the airport before I flew back home the next day. When I arrived at the hotel, I was impressed by the exterior and the landscaping. During check-in I was also impressed with the large lobby area. Check-in was painless and the worker was courteous. She told me where to catch the elevator to and told me directions to for getting to my room on the 2nd floor. Once I left the lobby area, that's where things started to go awry. The hallways seemed quite dated. The elevator was incredibly slow dated. I proceeded to my room and was met with a large room. It seemed rather dated and tired-looking. It also smelled either of mildew or stale smoke (even though this was a non-smoking hotel and I had to sign papers during check-in acknowledging this). The HVAC system sounded incredibly large and I had to leave it on high the entire time to keep up with the room temperature. The TV was nice but I wish there would have been a greater channel selection. The bed was a bit on the lumpy side and the pillows were less than stellar. The shower and bathroom appeared in good shape and I had no complaints. There were large gaps on the hotel door that made the room sustainable to increased noise.The breakfast was pretty slim pickins' with mainly cold items, fruit and the typical waffle maker.The shuttle to the airport was a bit interesting. The shuttle arrived about 5 minutes late which isn't a big deal. When the drive got out to the back to load the luggage, I left my bag with the other and he laughed at me and made some comment in a different language. I looked back and I could tell it was about something I did. The shuttle driver didn't talk to anyone other than getting to the airport barking orders as to who goes where - it was pretty awkward. I understand the hotel contracts this out to Western Transportation, but it's still an extension to their brand. In all, I got what I paid for... I just wished I paid more for something else now.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,First Stay Won't Be The Last,"I enjoyed my experience and stay from beginning to end.  The ease of making reservations, their shuttle service, a warm and speedy check-in, well appointed clean room, made my stay relaxing and trouble free. I will recommend this hotel to my friends and will visit it again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Last leg of Out West trip,"We had never stayed at a LaQuinta Inn... But we had to have a hotel with a shuttle than ran very early in the morning, as we needed to be at the airport by 3:30 am. The rooms were very large and clean, the shuttle was on time and the hotel lobby very nice! We will definitely give other LaQuinta Inns a try !",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,mediocre airport hotel,"I usually like La Quinta hotels, but this one is sub-par, with disorganized staff, no baggage carts (at first), very poor breakfast.  Rooms were OK, but I wouldn't recommend this one, when the airport area is jammed with other hotel options",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Be very careful booking this hotel,"I booked the DIA La Quinta for one reason - free parking while I traveled. I reserved the room and there were several mentions about the ""free parking"" but no obvious way to SEPARATELY reserve parking. I checked in and was told I couldn't get parking with no explanation as to how to do it or where in the process it was offered. My second issue was the noise...and it wasn't from the airport. There were parties throughout the hotel. Across the hall there were at least 10 people and dogs coming and going until very late.  Then at 11:30pm the fire alarm went off and everyone got up stood in the hall wondering what was going on.  There was no direction or announcements, no sirens or flashing lights and no smoke. Eventually everyone went back into their rooms.  So I got about and hour of sleep and gave up and went and stood in lines at the airport.Even though the room was comfortable and should have been convenient, I won't stay here again due to the parking issue.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,not my favorite la quinta,"The reservation process was efficient and helpful; the on-site hotel experience, however, was less than positive. The desk clerk at check-in was scrolling through her phone upon our arrival. The room was marginally clean; the tub was stained, and there was water standing in the tub upon our arrival at midnight. There was hair (that did not belong to either of the parties in our room) in our bed. I can only hope it was clean.... The breakfast offerings were minimal, and inadequately stocked for the crowd. Staff appeared to be nonchalant about the lack. Housekeeping staff was in the process of cleaning rooms as guests were headed to breakfast; housekeeping carts were blocking the hallway, and again, staff appeared nonchalant about the inconvenience. I had to wait several minutes to check out as there was no desk staff to be found. Overall, while the location is good, this is not what I would expect for $125/night!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Unreliable shuttle,"We waited over an hour for the shuttle at the airport....others waited over 1 1/2 hrs!! I called after 35 min and was told to call back if it didn't arrive in another 20 min!!Then a beat up dirty bus showed up! The shuttle services 4 or 5 hotels do you get to wait for all those pick ups and drop offs. If you want a dedicated, reliable hotel shuttle DON'T stay at La Quinta! That's a shame because the hotel is clean.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Unreliable shuttle service,"You can't be an airport hotel unless you have reliable shuttle service. This La Quinta does not. Everything else was right: friendly staff, clean room, comfortable beds, great courtyard, excellent pool area, but we waited 30 minutes for a shuttle at the airport that never came. I called the hotel and they told me look for a ""Western"" van. I guess we were just supposed to know that. Anyway, they never came so we called a cab. The next morning the shuttle was late and overcrowded. The driver unfriendly can almost left our suitcase. He said it wasn't his job to load it. Some people didn't get on and had to wait even longer. We left 2 hours early and still had to run to catch our plane. Don't stay here if you don't want to wait for the shuttle.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Terrible Experience,"We had a reservation for the La Quinta near the Denver International Airport.  When we called around 1 PM to see if room was ready (we had requested early check in, fridge, and not near “pet friendly” rooms) the front desk woman indicated that there was one room ready that met our criteria and there would probably be more ready by the time we arrived based on where we were at that point.  When I got to the check-in desk, the front desk woman acknowledged that I was the one that called about the room, but then says that the other front desk person just gave our room away.  She noted that she should have put a flag on the room.  The other front desk person, who smirked when hearing that he had given our room away, came over and said he would put a priority on them getting a room ready for us.  He indicated that it would take about 30 more minutes which would mean we would have a room at about 2:30.  We opted to wait in the breakfast area in the lobby of the hotel.  At 2:45, my husband approached the front desk lady and she indicated that she was getting ready to call and check on the status of our room.  They had told us the room number that was being prepared for us at this point and let us sign up for the morning airport shuttle after we asked to do so (we asked, they didn’t offer). At 2:55, I approached the front desk, and the front desk guy, who acted annoyed, says they were working on it.  I noted that it was now only 5 minutes before the “normal check in time” and he responded that they were totally booked up the prior night and for the upcoming night.  At 3:00, the two front desk people left with two new front desk workers arriving.  No indications were given to us as to the status of our room or whether the information had been passed onto the new personnel coming on duty.  Shortly after this, my husband walked past the room number that we had been previously provided and noted that the cleaning staff was vacuuming and doing other cleaning in that room. At around 3:40, my husband again walked past the room number that we had been previously given and noted that the door was now closed and the cleaning crew had moved down the hall.  When he approached the front desk to inquire about the room that we had now been waiting on for nearly two hours, they indicated that the room wasn’t showing up on the computer as having been cleaned, yet.  She offered us another room (for the first time today, even though we had been waiting in the lobby for almost two hours, at this point).  They dispatched another staff person to check on the status of the original room because it did have a fridge, which we had originally requested.   For some reason, this La Quinta has pet friendly rooms on the first floor and only first floor rooms have fridges, making our request impossible to meet, but no one had mentioned this until just now!  We had just stayed at a La Quinta in another part of Colorado that had fridges on other non-pet friendly floors. At this point the other staff person returned and confirmed what we already knew; our original room had been cleaned and was ready.  We moved our stuff into the room and my husband ran the rental car back to the drop off site.  After nearly two hours, you would think this room would be spotless…think again.  There were stains on the bed spread, there was pet hair all over the floor, and the room stunk.  When my husband returned, we approached the front desk again and asked to be moved to a clean room that was not a pet friendly room, even if it meant no fridge.  To the front desk person’s credit, she immediately got us new room keys and the new room was what you would expect from a nationwide hotel chain.  The only negative, in this part of the story is that we were now in a lesser room (no fridge), but we were still charged for a room with a fridge.   Had the original front desk staff noted that the only rooms they had with fridges were pet friendly rooms and they could offer us a second floor room with no fridge, immediately, we probably would have jumped at it.  That also would have saved a nearly two hour wait in the lobby for a less than desirable room.  After frequenting La Quinta’s many times in the past, this experience will make us think twice about doing so in the future, and we will definitely not stay at this one again, especially when there are numerous other hotels in proximity to the airport.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great,The hotel grounds were nice with a gated patio area and hotel appearance was pleasant both indoors and outside.  Check-in was easy and staff was friendly.  I've stayed at other La Quintas before and they weren't as pleasant as this one.  The hotel also beat out most of the others in the area near the airport for price.  Room was clean and bed was comfortable.  Continental breakfast was good and was ready as early as we had to get up (before 6).  My only annoyance was that the doors and walls to the hallway are not sound proof so you could hear EVERYTHING.  Not sure if they can do anything about that.  Altogether I would stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Disabled Traveler...be prepared to ask for what you need, even when they say they have an ADA approved room.","This hotel had many things going for it.  Great location near the airport, great front desk staff, the room was clean and well appointed   HOWEVER...There was no bath seat or bench provided in the room.  I had specifically asked when I made the reservation if the ADA room was fully appointed with all I would need, including a bath seat, hand held shower, hand rails etc.  Upon arrival I noticed that there was no bath seat.  The room also had no tissues and a very small  counter space in the bathroom.  The limited space by the sink was taken up with the coffee maker on one side and the ice bucket on the other.  I found this situation more common than I like.  ADA may be the law of the land, but it is not  the current reality of staying at this La Quinta.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay at LaQuinta Denver Airport,"Bright clean room, very comfortable with welcoming staff.  Good value for a mid-priced hotel.  Very convenient to Denver airport.  Keeps you from having to fight Denver traffic.  Will definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Needs Improvement,"I have stayed at this hotel whenever I fly in/out of DIA for the past 8 years.  It has gone down in customer service, cleanliness, facility maintenance and shuttle service.  In the past I thought La Quinta was top notch.  I feel that in it's current condition, it is average.  An example is that they no longer have lotion and we had to ask the front desk for shampoo and soap!  The park and fly option is great, but waiting over an hour to be picked up at the airport is not so great.  I caught a ride with another hotels shuttle.  They were gracious enough to drop me off.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Hotel,"I always stay at La Quinta when in Denver.  The hotel is always clean, comfortable and has all the amenities--a great breakfast, large, clean rooms, WIFI, exercise room to loosen those knots from sitting on a long plane ride,  and located next to a wonderful restaurant.  Couldn't ask for more.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good place,"Made reservations, and once I walked in I was greeted by a nice lady at the counter. I got checked in and proceeded to my room. Once in , The room smelled clean, no bad odors, all fixtures worked, bed was clean sheets were clean, bathroom  was clean, some base board tiles needed addressed. Bath towels were clean no stains. Overall a good place to stay.Will stay again in future.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Another great LaQuinta,La Quinta is my go to chain for moderate price and clean facility. This hotel is close to the airport and perfect for late arrivals or early departures. It is also close to I-70 and 490 for easy access to nearby cities and to mountain ski and hiking areas.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean and safe,"This is a slightly above average LaQuinta and is clean and safe.  The bed was a bit lumpy, but the room was quiet and clean.  A limited breakfast buffet was served in the morning.  For the price, it was ok.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not a typical LaQuinta,"First room we checked into was not cleaned completely. Upgraded to a suite. Second room we checked into was not cleaned completely. I doubt this is a coincidence. Management is obviously not training and overseeing the housekeeping staff. Noisy, lots of road noise. Breakfast was below average for La Quinta. There are better choices in the area. I will not stay hear again.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Might do it again....,The stay was just okay.  Breakfast was basically continental style.  Would have preferred breakfast eggs and sausage or bacon.  Getting tired of waffles.  Decaf tea would have been nice or hot chocolate being available.  Room was okay and staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful.  And what is with the exit lights at ankle height?  Must have been a strange code inspector.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Awful Experience,"I arrived at 11 after a long day of work and a drive halfway across the state. When I checked in, it was pretty apparent the staff was for the most part interested in chatting with each other rather than helping me. I got my room keys and headed up to the room where I found both beds with hair in them and they didn't look like they had been cleaned at all.I brought it to the attention of the one staff member still at the desk at which point he truly made an effort to find me another room to stay in. After about a half hour, he told me they were sold out and all he could offer me was a refund that I will have to call hotels.com to get. After calling a dozen other sold out airport hotels, I have given up and now I'm spending the night at the gate at the airport.Not recommended.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good Facility A Few Problem Areas,"I love La Quinta hotels in general.  I've never had a bad stay and this location is no different.  The beds are comfortable, the rooms and bathrooms are clean and the staff is friendly and helpful.  There are a few areas that could stand improvement however.  It seems in many locations certain areas escape the watchful eye of management.  Here it's the elevators and the pool/patio areas.  The elevator near the back of the hotel could use a really good cleaning, and lightbulbs.  It's easy to see the grime around the corners and buttons and nearly all of the lightbulb were either burnt out or missing.  The pool itself is fairly nice and the water is clean.  The tables and chairs are dirty making it clear that the area is not on a regular cleaning schedule.  The outdoor chairs and tables are about the same but you expect a certain level of wear with outdoor equipment.  Also, the ADA chairlift by the spa looks to be pulling out of the ground.  The battery is missing from the unit so it's probably out of service but there's no sign or anything telling the guests that.  All in all it's a decent stay, luckily it's just an overnighter so the rest doesn't bother me that much.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Helpful Staff,Was very impressed with how helpful the staff was in assisting with a needed early check-in.  They were the only hotel I found that went the extra distance to help.  They get five stars for caring and customer service.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointed with this hotel,"Although the grounds and the lobby of this hotel are excellent, we found the lack of complimentary guestroom items (lotion, etc.) as well as the generally ""shabby"" appearance of the elevator and guestroom bathroom area, lack of newspaper and sloppy breakfast area were disappointing. Hopefully they were just having an off-day! Otherwise, we love LaQuinta!",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,best La quinta lobby,"lobby was totally amazing     I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is staying overnight in Denver. Short hop to Denver airport. Quality restaurants within walking distance . The staff were very friendly . the lobby. elevator, the hallways and the rooms were very very very clean . In other words the hotel was spotless.",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A good clean hotel close to the denver airport,Clean rooms with good service at a reasonable price.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Perfect Location near Denver Airport,"Good value there are many hotels near by. I always stay the La Quinta. The staff is excellent. Two restaurants next door. Gas station across the street, important when filling up my rental car on the way back to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Slipping... Needs TLC,"We've stayed here several times over the years prior to flights at DIA. It's very convenient to the airport & does offer ""park & fly"" options. This is a nice hotel & we've always been pleased, but this visit we felt a definite slippage in service & maintenance. Desk staff seemed more interested in talking with each other than with us... one of the main elevators was out of order (which made for a long walk with our luggage)... several main hallway doors were propped open with what looked like washcloths... the ""public"" printer was out of paper & toner. Our room was ok & everything worked, but the pillows were a bit lumpy, & out-of-the-way areas were dirty (obviously rarely attended to). The breakfast - as always & apparently standard - was mostly white fastfood, with wimpy…",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Quick Stay- Clean Rooms and Close to Airport,"I checked in for one night before an early flight this past weekend. First off, it's extremely convenient and close to the airport, and there was a gas station on the same block to fill up the rental car before returning it the next day.  I checked in around 10 PM and I had to park on the other side of the building. Upon check-in I had to sign a document that I abided by their No Smoking policy and signs were posted everywhere. I didn't receive any documents about what I was paying or told any other policies. I booked through Expedia with a book now and pay later so I just figured I'd get a printout in the AM. I was placed on the 4th floor and when I exited the elevator I was hit with the smell of marijuana, so clearly people didn't take their No Smoking rule seriously either way.There was also a dog barking that could be heard through the hallway and into my room. Although I could hear the dog when I got to my room, the smell didn't follow. I was tempted to complain but there were no other disturbances and the dog stopped barking a few minutes later. The floor was otherwise relatively quiet. The room was clean, and quite spacious. I got a king size bed which was comfortable, and the room also had a couch and large desk. The bathroom was spacious and clean. There was also a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker. I didn't use the TV or internet as I had an early flight. Unfortunately I had to miss breakfast as I checked out at 5 AM, breakfast was 6 AM- 10 AM. I was hoping food items would be available, but it was no problem. I didn't sign any document agreeing to the price when I checked in so I asked the clerk at the front desk for a printout. She said she couldn't since I booked through Expedia and that they would just email me my receipt. I left with the hope that my price was correct and had to put my trust in an internet site and not in the actual hotel. Thankfully upon checking my credit card charges that they did charge the correct amount.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Beautiful property, staff needs more training.","Room was clean and nice although quite austere. The grounds were well manicured. It was a very short stay so I did not see all of the hotel.24 hour trip had me checking in at 3am. Prior arrangements purportedly had me in a quiet room. Or so I thought. The front desk clerk had to be cajoled to give me a room that was quiet. (i called ahead to arrange that) It took me two phone calls just to get them to assign me a quiet room at the end of a hallway. Upon arrival at 3am I stumbled into bed without thinking about the location of the room. It turned out that my room was clearly one of the noisiest. It was adjacent to the breakfast area. At 5am the shouting, loud talking and barking from that breakfast area permeated my room. Having just gone to bed two hours prior I was not happy. The manager handled my complaint in a professional manner. The front desk clerk also apologized for his behaviour. I am sure he did that after the manager spoke to him. Non-the-less, they did handle my complaint in an apologetic manner.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Great location, good value, great transport to DiA","Chose hotel based on their Park and Fly as we were able to leave our car.  Transport to and from DIA was timely, friendly drivers.   We were picked up at 3:30 AM !!!  Breakfast was a nice selection including waffles for the other mornings that we were not flying.  Great staff at the desk.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good place to stay,"Nice hotel, close to good Italian restaurant, gas, places to eat and Denver airport.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,recent stay at the La Quinta Inn at the Denver DIA property,"We stayed at this property on March 23rd, 2016 when the snowstorm shut down Denver Airport at various times throughout the day...flights were getting cancelled, tempers were flaring, etc. Front desk personnel who assisted us was RAY GONZALES - he answered any questions we had, helped check us in, assisted us later with other items, etc....Ray kept his cool when individuals were getting upset because of no rooms, the room rates, the shuttle van having a hard time getting to and from the airport because of the overwhelming amount of snow and the roads hardly passable and shut down here and there, etc....Ray - kept a smile on his face and was professional as he dealt with the various people coming in and out of the LQ property.  I hope that Ray will be rewarded and recognized in some manner because of keeping his calm amongst the storms!  I am just now able to do this since I flew out of the country the very next day and just returned. Thanks Ray!  Diane",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient,"Location is convenient, facilities and price are good , continental breakfast is fine, heating and air conditioning sounds like a freight train in 325. I would return and use this hotel again if I come back to Denver again.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Beware of 4/20 in DIA Airports,"Hotel was fine; however, one of the guests apparently thought pot smoking near or in room 420 during Denver's 4/20 Festival (Pot smoking day) would be cool.  The entire 4th floor reeked of pot.  Staff was quick to provide us a new room and try to find the source of the pot; however, it's tough to get rid of that smell and the cops were not called.  Hotels in Denver need to get serious about prosecuting these folks or be prepared to lose business.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,I was pleasantly surprised,"The room was very large with a desk, fridge, microwave, sofa bed, king bed.  Free breakfast was okay.  The hot tub was nice and hot.  Pool was only 5 ft deep at the deep end.  Convenient for the airport.  Two restaurants within walking distance.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Reasonable Pricing,"The bed was quiet firm, but the pillows where nice and plush. Our room has older outdated decor. And the bathroom is in disrepair, in need of a new toilet and bath basin, due to cracks and stains. The mini fridge and microwave are a nice add. It will do in order to catch an early flight out.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver stay,"i was very disappointed with our stay at this hotel.  I have stayed many of times before and things have gone down hill fast.  There is a sewer gas smell though out the hotel.  Our phone was broken, the bath tub dripped.  The carpet was very dirty as well as the sofa sleeper.  I usually stay 7-8 times a year at this hotel, but may have to find another place.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport Travel,"La Quinta has always been a great hotel in my opinion.  The only problem this time was that they had a van from another company picking up passengers at the airport and the La Quinta sign was nowhere to be seen on the black van.  That being said - Be sure to look for a black van or Bus that says ""Western"" on the front.  The property itself was great.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Easy access to the airport,"My friend had an early morning flight out of Denver International Airport and the drive would have put us in rush hour traffic with potential for unexpected delays, so I decided to look for a hotel near the airport and avoid the hassle. La Quinta on Tower Rd. was great! The staff was sweet, the room was clean and quiet, the breakfast was yummy, and the drive to the airport was short and easy. I will definitely stay with them again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,I won't stay again,"I stayed here for the first time on a trip to Denver. The price was the lowest at the time I looked for hotels near DIA. The room was clean, the staff were friendly. There is a morning breakfast but it's comparable to the cheaper chain hotels. I didn't eat there because it did not have much variety and I didn't see any staff available to keep it up when I walked through. Mostly cold options and fruit (a self serve waffle cooker but nothing else).The bathroom doors were broke and didn't shut right, you can hear the rooms next door or above each time they flush and you have to leave and drive to get to anything to eat or anything except sleep. I will spend a little more to stay in an updated hotel with more conveniences the next time. Even though this was at the time the cheapest in the DIA hotel area, it was still over priced in my opinion.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Our stay was just fine,"Clean, quiet and comfortable room.  Staff pleasant. Pet friendly.  We had our own vehicle, so no shuttle experience. Very happy with Trip's $89 base rate here. I'd return in a second for an airport stay.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Needs some updating,"Have traveled to Denver to ski each of the last eight years.  For six of them have stayed my night before departing back home at the La Quinta by DIA.  Generally have been happy with the stay, but this year I did notice that the hotel is getting ""aged"" and is in need of some updating.  Had room on second floor.  The carpeting and bathroom tile look old, the entry door had a gap in it so that you could see into the hallway (not good).  I noticed this gap (between the door and the door frame) when back from dinner, and rather than get another room at that point, I just propped the ironing board up against the crack when in the room for the night.  Also can hear noise in hallway more than I remember, as besides gap doorframe, is also a large gap at bottom of door to the floor.  Elevator is one of slowest you will see, but I just take the stairs generally unless hauling the luggage.Other than this, check in and out was efficient and breakfast was good enough for me.  There are more newer hotels on Tower road, and I will likely consider another one next year on my ski trip unless an update to the property is done before then.",3

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good Choice for Airport Convenience,This was the best deal when comparing several chain hotels for an airport stay.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Horrible Incident!,I stayed at this hotel and needed to take a flight at 6 am. I needed to be up and at the airport by 4am. There were people that were partying on the floor I was on and it was so bad that the cops were called and they had to kick those people out. That was at 3 am at that point  I had been up for 3 hours because of the noise. They should've squashed the problem before 3 hours of partying.  The rooms were fine. Pillows were very flat.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Terrible choice,"If you are just going to Denver for the night to get back on a plane, I suppose the location isn't bad. But if you want to see any part of the city, you're out of luck. This hotel sits in an island of sorts; a few other chain hotels, miles from the city. I'd rate cleanliness a 4 of 10, the whole place smelled like raw sewage, and a cabinet in my room opened to the structure on the hotel (pipes, insulation, trusses, scary blackhole-ness). It was very disconcerting. I had to pay for my own room because the front desk agent couldn't figure out how to charge the company.  Overall cheaply appointed, even in the meeting room. It was not a good experience.",2

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Quiet and Clean,My wife and I decided to stay at DIA the night before instead of driving to the airport for a 7AM flight.  Hotel was clean and quiet.  Price was good.  Located near several parking lots and parking was available at the hotel as well.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Couldn't be better,"I'm a flight attendant for a major airline.  I stay at this property one night every week of the year.  It is a great property, in a great location.  The lobby, rooms, and  pool area are always neat and clean.  The great people they employ just make it even better. and the people just make it better.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Really Good LaQuinta Stay,"I am a bit surprised by the negative comments. When we travel West with our dog, we prefer LaQuinta for the price and Dog friendly no fees!! Easy check-in, King Executive Room on 5th floor was huge and clean. Bed had a good mattress, and frig is larger than expected. For the price, this is a keeper.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Still good though missing some things !!!,"I was so impressed the last time I had to stay here, I rebooked another stay.  The first room was on the fifth floor so I asked to be moved to a lower floor.  When I got to the room, the TV would not pick up a signal, so I was changed back to my original room.  The bed was lumpy, the water pressure trickled out of the head and the door in the elevator was filmy that told me the details are not being watched closely.  I will admit the staff was quite helpful.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,It's alright,"I stayed here because my flight was diverted back to Denver and the coupon the airline gave me was practically worthless.  This La Quinta is older, like 1980s style.  It's clean.  It was also quiet.  Those are the nicest things I can say about it.   The breakfast was subpar for a La Quinta.  Starch Starch Starch and more Starch.  Even the coffee was terrible.   And the rooms are overpriced.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta DIA,Nice room with microwave and small refrigerator.  Nice TV was quiet for good sleeping.  Parking is at a premium though.  Lots of places to eat in the area.  Allows pets!!!!   No hair in the bed and the drain in the tub drained quickly.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,You should get what you paid for I paid alot,"I hotel rooms were not cleaned well just a wipe off and I had to go down everyday and get towels, Kleenex, and everything I needed.  The pillows were not washed and smelled.  The floors were never vacuumed as there was stuff left when I arrived on the floor.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Staff was excellent,We stayed one night and the staff was so helpful and nice that when we returned the next day we decided to stay again.  The price and location were perfect for having to be next to the airport. They made our trip that much easier.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,a good nights sleep,"Very nice rooms, comfortable, good size and our dog loved the kingsize bed, The only problem (and this was NOT the fault of the hotel) was that a sewer main had blown somewhaer on Tower Road and the small seeped into the lobby and halls of the ground floor, but the room itself was free of any oder.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Got little sleep.,Stay the night checked in at midnight after getting in from the late flight. Was looking for a good long sleep. Kept getting woken me tonight by this noise. Call the office numerous times nothing was done about the problem I complained at checkout and I got a small percentage off my bill. I didn't even get four hours of good sleep. I'm so disappointed and my stay here I've wanted to attach the video that has the sound recorded on it but this will only let me attach a pic and it the sound you needed to hear. The video sounds like it's an engine running but it was like a hammer drill or a good hard water hammer that didn't stop for a long time. I was in room 337 checked in on 2-5 and out next morning dang sure didn't get and needed rest.  So dissatisfied on how my stay was handled.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,No frills hotel,"My husband and I were faced with a cancelled flight in a snow storm in Denver and had to scramble to get a room close to the airport. Pros: reasonably priced, nice lobby, 24 hour airport shuttle. Cons: very tired rooms (about 16 yrs old), uncomfortable beds, bare bones accommodations. I guess they offer free bfast but we had to leave so early we didn't get to partake.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Nice, dog friendly hotel near the airport.","I stayed here the night before my flight home.  I had my dog with me, she had just had surgery at CSU.  We were allowed to check in early which was very much appreciated.  The room was spacious and very clean.  I had a nice view of the courtyard.  I didn't try the breakfast but the area was nice looking and very clean.  The desk people were very helpful and friendly.  I took the shuttle from the airport to the hotel, it was ok. They share a shuttle service with a group of hotels nearby so it was quite crowded.  I chose to take a taxi to the airport the next morning so I didn't have to try to get my dog/crate and luggage across 7 lanes of traffic to the terminal.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Overnight stay to catch a early flight,The Inn has always been clean and the service has been great. The shuttle runs early to get us to the airport to check in for an early flight. Staff is helpful and willing. I left a cell phone in the room. When we called the staff told us that they had it and I could pick it up when we got back. They did have it. The storm covered our car that was parked and we had to borrow a snow brush to clean the car. This was extra and greatly appreciated.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Noise, Noise, Noise","The rooms are typically La Quinta. Nicely appointed for an overnight or a few days stay. Clean, mostly. The rest is typical of these box-style hotels. One slow elevator. Uber-thin walls. It was nice to know my neighbor had to pee at 5:15 am, and the other guests in the halls elevating their voices at 11 pm. I always travel with ear plugs, but the ability to hear details through the walls in most hotels today, including this one, is ridiculous. It's funny how an entire industry migrates to the same things, so that nobody stands out. Who makes these crazy-slow elevators all these hotels buy? Who supplies them with the microwave eggs for breakfast? Who sets the same all-carb nutrition program for the ""free"" breakfast? Everyone has the same stuff. It's nuts. Why doesn't someone break the mold, innovate, do something different, and create something of value. What do travelers want? A good place to sleep = comfortable bed. Clean, above all. Updated and not showing excessive wear. NOT to hear your neighbors evening activities or drunks yelling in the halls late at night. And something nutritious (vs cheap) to eat on their way out. So, someone provide that and you'll get my consistent business.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,FREE parking is a scam,We saw on reviews that Free parking wasn't really free.  I called to verify and was quoted an $85 night rate with FREE parking while we were gone for up to 7 days   When we arrived we were told that the call center made a mistake and we were charged $159 .  There is 24/7 shuttle to the airport but if you have an early flight will leave with NO breakfast.  Shuttle back to the hotel from the airport is every HOUR.  Make sure you have warm clothes to wait in the cold.  It's been over 2 1/2 weeks since our stay and the manager STILL hasn't returned my call.  I would NOT recommend this location.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stuck in Denver..Very Helpful and Friendly Hotel...,"We were stranded in Denver due to The Jonas Storm. After a very early and tiring flight from Bozman, Montana we arrived at about 8:00 AM in Denver. I was embarrassed to call La Quinta and ask if there was a community area we could park our luggage and exhausted bodies until our rooms were ready. We were told our room was ready! YES! A shuttle picked us up within minutes! Don't laugh but we were lugging ski equipment and those automatic doors were heaven that morning! Our room was clean, spacious and we appreciated the desk work area. The housekeeping staff kept our room immaculate during our three day stay!The desk staff was friendly and very helpful. They  even took the time to help us understand the Denver bus system. One gentleman made some excellent suggestions of things to do in the area that helped us forget our frustrating situation!The breakfast is nothing to get excited about! Liked the in room coffee better.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stayed before flying out of town.,Usually this is a good choice but this time the internet and the television didn't work properly and the staff was indifferent about the problem. If you have to leave early don't plan on breakfast or coffee.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Customer Service!,"We had our United flight cancelled and the people at La Quinta were amazing in accommodating us.  1. They gave us the discounted rate even though we lost our voucher.  2. They provided us FREE toiletries because United lost our luggage.  3. They provided great general customer service.  Fantastic value and great people!  Thank you, La Quinta!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Filthy Room,"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past and it has been very nice.  This time however, it was terrible.  I pulled back the sheets to find that they were nasty with bodily fluids.  I called the front desk to have someone change the sheets, but he was working alone. He delivered sheets, but we had to change them ourselves.  The sheets were the wrong size, so I asked for a different room.  We walked into the new room and the toilet seat was broken.  We then left the hotel and found another one.  We won't be back ever!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,VACATION STAY,"We used this hotel for a Stay and Go Airport parking. We had an early flight out of Denver to San Juan, PR for our Disney Cruise vacation.  The hotel provide transportation to the airport and return transportation a week later back to the hotel. We stayed at the hotel for another night after our return flight home. This is a great program and we didn't have to worry about your vehicle. Thanks!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Room great, Shuttle not","We have stayed at this lq several times.  This visit we had a king suite which was wonderful.  We especially liked having each area on separate thermostats--we like a cool room for sleeping.  Our floor was quiet, the linen were nice.  I'm having to deduct because the airport shuttle service was not good.  We turned in our rental car, took that shuttle to airport in order to be picked up by the LaQuinta shuttle.  (Our last visit they had their own shuttle.  Not so now.)  We went to correct waiting spot as directed by front desk.  When the shuttle failed to arrive after 25 minutes I called hotel desk.  She said essentially ""keep waiting"" and didn't offer to contact the shuttle dispatch.  Fortunately, a nearby hotel kindly let us ride with his pick ups.  Next morning, shuttle arrived on time.  But he put us all out at first unloading spot--correct  east side for us, but long way from our airline.  The other passengers were even further away as they wanted the west side.  In 20 years riding airport shuttles have never encountered that.  LaQuinta I hope you correct this problem.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Special Find,"We needed a place close to the airport for an early flight.  What a find!  Staff was outstanding.  Enjoyed the pool.  Restaurants close by (walk).  They shuttled us to the airport with no problems whatsoever.  Only disappointment was that the breakfast hours used to be early enough for our flight, but when we got there, we found out they were later on weekends.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful experience!,This was a quick trip for an unexpected family emergency. The staff was accommodating and empathetic. The room was immaculate and very comfortable. We will make a point of staying at this hotel again.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,No Breakfast nad not clean,"Breakfast, toast only, there was no muffins, bagels, and pancake maker was broken. Carpet did not appear to be vacuumed. Doors are so loud that when they close you can hear every one leave their room.  Our experience at anther La Qunita Inn on the way was also unpleasant.  No more La Quintas for us, two strikes and your out.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nothing special.,"This LaQuinta was average, and nothing special. The Staff was very pleasant, and the room very average. The wifi was free in the room and did the job. The room was clean, but the beds were not as firm as we would have liked and sagged toward the middle - both beds. This hotel shared a shuttle with several other hotels on this mini-strip 8 miles away from the airport. It was still adequate for our purposes. However, there weren't any fast food places within 5 miles, although there was a Ruby Tuesdays just across the street. The morning breakfast was just a little better than a continental breakfast, and nothing to write home about.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good value near DIA,"Used the park and ride to DIA for our recent trip to Cabo San Lucas.  Rooms were quiet and clean, good breakfast bar, prompt shuttle to and from the airport. We had two couples, only had to pay the shuttle rate on one room ($129 vs $84).",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place near DIA,There is shuttle service to and from the airport which runs every 20 minutes.  Pets welcome.  A Ruby Tuesday across the street as well as an Italian restaurant.  Left very early so can't comment about the breakfast.  I will stay here again.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good value and close to Denver Aiport,"My husband and I had a good experience here. Our flight was cancelled and we did not make the reservation until after 11PM.  We were treated warmly when we arrived.  Our room was clean and more than adequate.  The breakfast was fair. We arrived at 8:30, just before it closed at 9AM.. Some of the items were gone.  Waffles were good. Coffee fair.  There is a shuttle to the airport. Good price.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta Denver International,Convenient location. Excellent Continental breakfast. Clean rooms with WiFi. Shuttle to the airport runs at 10 after the hour and 20 before the next hour. There are two restaurants within a couple of minutes walking distance from the hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Comfortable,"Needed a hotel near the airport because of an early morning flight.  Was very impressed with how friendly and efficient the check in was.  The room was very nice, only complaint was that it took the heater a while to warm the room, otherwise it was good.  Overall a great hotel at a decent price.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great value,"Had a great stay here not to far from Denver centre. Staff really friendly and helpful , breakfast was good a shame was no hot option. Rooms where large with good amenities .late check in available and parking .",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,An Oasis for Holiday Travelers,"Flying in late night is often part of holiday travel.  La Quinta is minutes away from baggage claim.  Family members can check in, be comfortable while they track your flight progress, and be waiting for you at the airport.  LQ is only minutes away from a good night's sleep.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great stay,I had a wonderful experience at this hotel everyone went an extra mile to see to my comfort. Everyone was very kind and thoughtful. Even the shuttle drivers were great . My check in was easy and fast check out the same and they were happy to fax receipt to office for me. very good stay and thank You again for a wonderful stay. Merry Christmas to all,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean and nice,"The La Quinta at the airport has nice large rooms, modern and clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. The price was low compared to the two surrounding hotels I looked at on line. We will stay there again next time we fly out of Denver, Colorado.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Had a bad experience,"This was one of the worst experiences I have had in a hotel.  Arriving around 8PM, we were in bed by ten, because we had an early flight out the next morning and had to be at the airport by 5.  Needless to say, everyone walking down the hall were talking and we hear every word.  Then at 1:45 AM a couple checked into the room beside us banging luggage on the door frame coming in. about the time I started to drop back to sleep, their little dog started barking.  When I got up that night, I realized there was a 1/4"" crack lighting around the door.  No stripping was on the door.   When responding to the question of How was your stay? the next morning, with ""It was pretty noisy."", we got the response, ""Well that is what happens when you stay on the first floor.""",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Happy with Room and the rate,"I thought this was an excellent value for a clean, quiet room. Staff was efficient and answered all my questions. Breakfast was nicely displayed and the shuttle  was there on time.  I would return to this hotel again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Such a bummer!,"We spent the night at this hotel before leaving for a 5 day trip. The smell in the hallway was disgusting. The room was not clean (black hairs behind toilet and in tub, urine on side of toilet), but the most disturbing thing happened upon our return. We had parked our car in the LaQuinta lot (paying extra for this service) and when we got back the car battery was completely dead. We went to the front desk to ask if possibly someone could jump our battery (I had battery cables with me) and the desk clerk said no. When I asked if they had a maintenance person that maybe could help, she replied that he was on break and maybe when he got back she could ask. After  calling Triple A and finding out that they could be there in 75 minutes I went back to the front desk to check and see if the maintenance person had returned from break. The desk clerk at this point became rude and said that he was still on break and wouldn't be able to help. By now, it was 9:30 on a freezing cold night and we had a 3 hour drive to our home. My daughter went to the hotel next door and immediately returned with a man who worked there and who had a portable battery charger. We hadn't even parked in his hotel's parking lot and he was willing to help us. Needless to say, we won't be returning to this hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wont even stay there.,We usually stay with LA quinta because they are economical and pet friendly and military friendly. That being said I was so disappointed I have called this location on two occasions made a reservation and ended up cancelling it. The staff is so rude. They act like you are bothering them by asking questions. I have worked for different hotel brands in the past and that is not how you treat guests. So we will be taking our business elsewhere when staying hear Denver. As a military family we fly home often and its nice to have a place to stay and not make the drive to COS. Very disappointed.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel near the airport,Great hotel near the airport. The extra paid to upgrade to a suite is well worth the money. The extra space was really nice. Nice location plus has a shuttle to the airport. Within walking distance to a couple of restaurants as well.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,comfortable and clean,Had a nice stay at this hotel.  accomodations were clean and beds were comfortable.  overall a pleasant experience. close to airport but pretty far from the Denver city center. breakfast was good but needed some protein choices.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disgusting,"Bathroom dirty, dirty towels, dripping tub faucet, dirty doors going into bathroom. Couldn't put clothes in dirty drawers. Something all over the side of the night stand. Food all over the bedskirt. The worst thing was when my kids pulled back the covers to go to bed and there was dried blood on the sheets and it was soaked all the way through to the mattress pad.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay if you have an early flight the next morning,We always use this hotel to stay if we are flying early the next morning.  It is very comfortable and the price is right.  They will shuttle you to the airport and you can pay a little extra and leave your car for the week if you choose. Nothing flashy but very friendly and the bed is comfortable.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Financially a good choice,A very reasonable place to stay. Very friendly staff. Rooms comfortable and spacious . Not fancy just right for an overnight before your flight. You can leave your car for an extra fee.It's a three minute walk to Ruby Tuesdays which is a little nicer than most I've been to or a four minute walk to a little nicer restaurant DiCiccio's a funky Italuan place.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Well worn, though friendly staff",Just spent the night before flying out. The room was a bit careworn but the bed was comfortable and the desk was large. Typical La Quinta layout. TV was on the blink (snow?) and the breakfast was below average. The price was decent and I didn't spend much time there so it get's an average rating.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Updated yet Dated,"The location of this La Quinta is without a doubt convenient for travelers who need to get to the airport, however, compared to other hotels in the area, it is showing its age.We reserved a suite and found it to be the oddest hotel room we've ever seen. It has a nice, spacious entry way with a bathroom on one side. The entry way leads into another spacious area where there is a couch tucked towards the back of the room, desk, small sink, a very ancient and small refrigerator, and a TV sitting in a recessed area of the wall. A wall of levered blinds (many of them broken, all of them in need of a good dusting) separates the ""living"" area from the bedroom. This room would be 100% better with the blinds removed. Other than the dusty blinds, the room was clean and had obviously been renovated not too long ago. The bed and pillows are comfortable. The workout facilities are pretty typical for La Quintas - it gets the job done, but nothing spectacular.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Ideal for pre-flight stay,"A little ""out in the sticks"" i.e. Not close to settlement,  but only 10 minutes from Denver airport so ideal for a pre-flight overnight stay. The hotel lobby is welcoming and the desk staff are very helpful. We were allowed to bring our mountain bikes into our room to pack them up ready for flying. The room was spotless and had everything we needed. There are restaurants  fairly close by to accommodate most tastes and in the morning we had a good breakfast to see us on our way. Would definitely use this hotel again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Survey of LaQuinta Hotel DIA,"Excellent quality for the price.  Rooms need some updating as they are getting used a lot and good update with some new carpeting, drapes, etc.  Parking is good and restaurants available. Also good shuttle to DIA",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Excellent stay at La Quinta, as always",Our stay at La Quinta was friendly and comfortable. It was good to be able to relax in the pool for half an hour before going out to eat at a nearby restaurant or sitting i  the gazebo in the pretty garden. Staff members found my credit card and management kept it safely for me until my return a week later. Who could ask for more?,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointing Blast from the past ,"I needed to be in Denver for an early meeting but didn't want to wake up at 3am to catch an o dark 30 flight so I decided to grab a late flight the night before and rather than go all the way into town (DIA is far from downtown, practically in Kansas) I opted for an airport hotel. I had see the ads in TV for La Quinta but never stayed at one. I was expecting something a step up from a Best Western or Motel 6 but it was basically the same thing. I don't know if it was just this particulate LQ or what. It started with weird bifold doors going into the bathroom with dated tile and peeling paint on the ceiling in the shower. No outlet in the lamp or nightstand to charge my phone, had to reach awkwardly behind the night stand and unplug the cheap alarm clock to plug in my phone. I like to use my phone as an alarm because I don't trust those cheap things they put in hotel rooms. I didn't think the place would be that old considering DIA is only 20 years or so old, but I felt like I had entered a time warp to the 1970's Popcorn ceilings, lamps that looked like they were that old, weird hutch thing built into the wall with the microwave and mini fridge. Bathroom that didn't look like not had been updated - ever. Breakfast (I know it's free) was sparse and lacking. Insulation in walls didn't have much sound dampening, I heard people closing doors and walking down the hall several times during the night, reminded me of staying at a Motel 6 in college. On a positive note, the bed was reasonably comfortable and appeared to be clean. I would have slept well but for the noise in the hallway. I guess if you are really tired and you really want to be close to the airport this is a good choice, but what I didn't realize when I booked it was that there are several options on the same street near DIA that are probably similarly priced.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver stop over,I stayed here after missing my connecting flight. Nice hotel and was clean. Maybe a little dated but ok. Breakfast was offered but i didnt have it. Free shuttle to the airport which was on time. Vending machines availale for drinks and snacks.Friendly and helpful front desk staff.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,So-so for the money,"Everything about this hotel was just average.  Nothing great.  For the price would have liked more options for breakfast, more comfy beds, and more comfy carpet.  Many of the ice makers were not working, always had to go down to the first floor to get ice.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Shuttle Service,Main choice for hotel selection was the 24 hrs. shuttle service to the airport.  The breakfast is early on weekdays but not the weekend. Heater was noisy in the room.  Two double beds were comfortable and had plenty of covers.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great value.,I selected this hotel because it was priced better than some of the neighboring properties.  I wanted somewhere close to the airport for an early flight.  The room was large with a newly renovated bathroom.  All the amenities of higher priced hotels at a great price.  One of the best work spaces of any hotel I have ever stayed at.  Large work surface with numerous electrical outlets.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Comfortable and Accommodating,"I stay a a lot of LaQuinta Hotels because of their great points system.  I recently stayed at this LaQuinta on Tower Rd. while visiting family and friends.  This hotel is among the nicest LQ's I have experienced. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.  Staff could not be more accommodating and the common areas are very pleasant. Coffee is available all day and the complimentary continental style breakfast is adequate.  The yogurt, fruit, cereal, waffles and pastries are fresh. We spent some time in the outdoor atrium area which was very pleasant.  There is a Ruby Tuesday right behind the hotel that was convenient for dinner. A short walk beyond that was what looked like an upscale Italian food restaurant.  The complimentary airport shuttle was clean and efficient as well.  I will definitely stay at this hotel again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Night before flight,"With rain and possible snow in the forecast we chose to go the Denver a day early to catch our morning flight.  Our daughter was traveling out of the country on an international flight so we needed to be there.This La Quinta is comparable to most that we have stayed at.  The breakfast bar is fair standard waffle, bagel, yogurt, and cereal with an apple setup.  The hotel was clean and the employees were all friendly.  The wifi connection was good.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Needed a place for a early flight.,"Denver Airport is a very busy place, especially in ski season.  Most hotels are over priced.  This property has a decent breakfast, but son't believe it starts at 6:AM, maybe 6:15.  Reasonable for what they offer, clean and not smelly.  Ill stay again if need a quick place before an early flight.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Easy stay,"This hotel offers a stay the night, park your car for the week deal.  It seems pricey but when compared to a night plus the cost of parking elsewhere, it was a no-brainer.  Friendly staff, easy check-in and check-out and comfortable room.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta Denver airport,An upgraded hotel.  Very clean and quick check in.  Room was large and bright.  The mattress was comfy.  Also had a recliner.   Coffee maker and microwave.  Soap and Pantene 2 in 1 shampoo.  One drawback was that there was quite a bit of noise.  Bring earplugs.  Walls seemed thin.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Nice Hotel for the Price/Superior Customer Service from Lexi--WOW, Stay Here!!","We stayed at the LaQuinta near the Denver Airport on both 3 October and 5 October (2 rooms on both nights); this hotel has a great location near the airport, and a free shuttle to and from the airport.  The hotel has a great free breakfast, and the rooms are quite nice.  However, the best asset of this hotel is the front desk associate named Lexi.  She was awesome in researching our LaQuinta returns information (she spent a great amount of time giving me my returns information, a brochure on the program, and even told me I'm getting close to Elite Status), getting us 2 rooms next door to each other, making sure we got on the list for the next morning's shuttle, and even called us a taxi cab to take us downtown Denver to a restaurant.  Lexi went above and beyond to make sure our stay was the best ever--she should be rewarded as she made us feel so very special.  Superior customer service is so hard to find these days--it is worth far more than all the fine amenities a hotel room can offer in larger more luxurious places.  She is the best!  We will always stay while in Denver at the LaQuinta Denver Airport location.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Close Stay Before Flight,"Nice hotel, very clean and comfortable rooms/beds.  Hotel staff friendly and helpful.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Huge room!,I arrived late after a difficult time with car rental and was delighted to find the nicest reception at this hotel. Extremely helpful and kind. My suite is huge!  The bedroom is enclosed with shutters and the bed great  (I have a bad back). Wish I could stay longer. I'll return.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful for unexpected overnight,"The staff were so friendly and understanding. We got a perfectly clean room where we could take showers and get some sleep. Our flight was cancelled due to the tornado in the area and the next flight wasn't going out until midnight. We were able to check in at 9:30 a.m. and out at 9:00 p.m. and only paid the one night rate. Highly recommend staying in this area as there are several restaurants and even a convenience store in walkable distance. They have an airport shuttle, too.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good hotel to stay at,The staff is very friendly and got me everything I needed. The only down fall is they have a continental breakfast.  The rooms are clean and they have a every nice court yard.  Quit even in the day to sleep. Working nights that important. All in all it a nice place to stay,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Well Worth It,"We were to fly out of Denver International and wanted a room close to the airport.  We decided on Hyatt House.  We saw a room for $125, for an additional $100 we got a suite with a full kitchen, refrigerator, small ""living room"" with a sleep sofa and a separate bedroom with the shower and bathroom off of it.  The only issues we had was the refrigerator was very noisy and the TV in the bedroom had closed caption on it that we couldn't remove.  These were of no significance but thought we'd mention it.  the wifi was great and there are places to eat on Tower Road.  The rental car drop off is 5 minutes away and they offer a shuttle to the airport as well.  the one thing I will say is the breakfast in the morning leaves a lot to be desired.  Most everything appears to be microwaved.  Stick with the bagels & toast and have your eggs cooked for you instead of the prepared eggs and pancakes.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Poor,No bathroom toiletries or toilet paper available. the shower curtain would not close properly causing water to go on to floor. sink drained slowly. would not recommend or stay there again. not worth the money I spent.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,GREAT STAY at LaQuinta,"The service was quick and efficient. Everyone we interacted with was friendly and kind. The room was great, large, clean and comfortable. We love the breakfast at LaQuinta, great choices and good food! The check out took less than a minute and the check in and out hosts were very nice and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Comfy and Convenient,"I made reservations last minute and found the hotel clean, comfy and semi-affordable. The front desk staff was amazing at check in and out.  Breakfast was ready before 6AM which was perfect given my 610AM departure for the Airport shuttle. Nice work!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay at LaQuinta,"The stay was very pleasant.Rooms were very clean. The Staff was very friendly and helpful. The shuttle service to and from the  Denver airport was on time, and very efficient.  Could have a few more options at breakfast, but great stay other than that.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful place to relax!,"I loved this hotel.  I was so tired and worn out from a lengthy visit with family, that I took a night off.  The hotel was very clean and the staff very helpful.  The set up of the room was awesome with a wonderful desk area to work my computer in. They had a nice exercise room, a clean pool area, and a place to do your own laundry.  I was very impressed with what I got for the price. I did not see any of the things listed in the negative reviews. I love the free shuttle to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great for a one night stay,I had to make a stop over before a flight out of Denver and this was a great place to do so .  They had free wifi and breakfast that included waffles.  The service was great but my only issue was that the room didn't seem as clean as I would have wanted it.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very unsatisfied!,"This hotel was bad (1) smelled of sewer (2) staff are thieves (3) service horrible (4) breakfast = toast, cereal, waffles, bananas and yogurt. Had better at a Motel 6. The moral of the staff seem very low. We have stayed at many La Quinta hotels in different states, but never have I been disappointed like I was with this location. On a positive note, the grounds and the exterior was very well kept. We did enjoy the heated indoor pool.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not good!!!,"This hotel doesn't meet the minimum expectation. The bathroom didn't have a lock. They didn't provide  basic necessities like body cream, shampoo.  Breakfast was horrible. Will never go back to that hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient,"We got into Denver late at night, a free shuttle brought us to the car rental agency. The hotel was about 10 minutes away. On Tower Road, within walking distance from our hotel were other hotels, a gas station, and restaurants.Upon arrival, we checked in, they asked if we needed a wake up call, or the free shuttle. Check in / out was quick. The staff was friendly. The room was clean. The bed was very comfortable. The room was a good size. The hotel was full, but quiet, we seldom heard anyone in the hallway.A self service breakfast offered among other things, milk, water, juices, coffee, tea, muffins, bagels, waffles, yogurt, fruits, breads. Hotel staff restocked as needed, there was always enough to choose from. While eating breakfast, I witnessed a child handling multiple muffins, taking them out and returning them back to the case they were in because he would find one that looked better to him. As a parent, I do understand children want to pick their own foods out, its a good idea to teach them to locate and use the tongs that are available. I'm glad I was able to get a muffin right after staff had put them out, before anyone touched them.Being a pet friendly hotel, I had made a note under the comment section when I reserved the room on line that I wanted to be in a non pet room due to my husband's allergies. When we checked back into the hotel after coming up from Chicago Springs, I verified with the staff about the room, she said that they can't guarantee the room didn't have pets in it prior to our stay. Then another staff member shook her head to the one waiting on us and said that it was all set. So now I wonder, which one was right, do they not know which rooms the pets have stayed in, or do they have one floor that pets are not allowed on. . .",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great solid hotel,"I live in Denver near downtown, and flew into DEN latish a few nights ago, and had to fly back out early the following morning. So, instead of driving home and back out again, I just stayed overnight here. The room was just what we expected, and the free shuttle service to the airport was on time and got us there quickly. Great solid hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Bare bones and cleaning not well done,"Close to the airport, free shuttle, complimentary breakfast.  Housekeeping staff seemed overworked and frazzled.  Elevator slow and iffy; alarm often ringing.  Front desk staff not helpful.  I offered to pay cash to clear my account the night before; clerk said she couldn't do that.  When I paid the next a.m. at 5:00 - clerk was annoyed it hadn't been accepted the night before and said it was because of laziness on the night staff's part. Rate was $100.00. Don't know what neighboring rates were.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean and quiet,"Just right for a night coming to or from the airport.  Clean, friendly staff, and a quiet atmosphere all make for an excellent stay.  The shuttle to and from the airport is a very convenient service, and the breakfast is adequate.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Convenient and a good value,"Really convenient to DIA, and room was just fine. New furniture, and super shower. TV was fine. Really, my only complaint was I never go the requested wake up call. Luckily, I had set my iPad and also the alarm in the room. Breakfast was ""average"" -- not up to say, the Hampton Inn standards, but it sufficed. Strange to see the cheap plastic knives bend 90 degrees as I tried to spread cream cheese on the bagel.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean,"Has a pool, rooms were clean and decent. Need food options, only close to 7-11 and Village inn. ok prices, fairly quiet. Nice shuttles. Enough parking but needs to feel more safe. Easy to find and get around.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Close to airport, clean rooms, great front desk service","Location: Tower Road - Right off the main access to the airport (Pena) on  a street lined by hotels. Airport is 10 minutes away by car or shuttle.Staff: Helpful and friendly. Easy check in and check out. Good advice on nearby places to eatRoom: Very spacious and comfortable. Good natural light from the large window. Bed was just the right firmness, and pillows and sheets were soft. Bathroom was clean and well laid out. Blow dryer right on the wall. Bath products were basic but decent. Towels were soft.Amenities: Pool and hot tub were great! Well maintained and spotlessWifi: Free, easy to connect to, with a strong signal.Breakfast: Pretty basic -  mostly pastries, bagels, cereal, yogurt and a waffle maker. Fruit wasn't exactly appealing. Eggs or some sort of protein would have been nice. Decent coffee.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,rest and quiet,"While, at first blush, the hotel appeared to be plopped down in the middle of nowhere, the convenience to the airport(shuttle leaves at very regular intervals) and the quiet environment made it a very pleasurable stay.  I judge my hotels on the basis of degree of quietness and the comfort of the bed, and I was happy with both.  We will stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Plan for a more filling breakfast elsewhere,The breakfast is standard useless fare. There's no protein and very few fruit options. Basically it's a buffet of sugar. Everything is ok. The room's are ok and the staff are decently nice. But the food is not great.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Kathy,I checked out of the hotel in Cherry Creek that was the worst and fled to La Quinta where I knew I would be taken care of in a quiet and clean environment.  I would have stayed in a La Quinta throughout the entire trip but none were available where I thought I needed to stay.  Next time I will just check in to the nearest La Quinta.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport overnight,"Excellent front desk customer service, but room very tired and shabby.  In much need of a makeover.  No updates or add ons providing convenience outlets for plugging in and charging electronics. Clean, but sub par for the high price.  Gracious front desk manager reimbursed us for taxi ride we took due to extensive wait for hotel's contract shuttle.  This was unexpected and much appreciated.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Comfortable and Clean,"Close to airport with free shuttle.  You must reserve your spot ahead of time.  Bed was quite comfy and bathroom was clean.  They have a fitness center and pool, neither of which I had time to use.  I did look in both locations and they looked fine.  They have a breakfast in the morning but since my flight was quite early, I wasn't able to take advantage of it. They morning clerk gave me a muffin and a piece of fruit to take along to the airport, which was great!  All in all a comfortable, if older, hotel but it was fine for my one night stay.  There are many restaurants within walking distance and several others reachable by car.  We have stayed at this location many times and have always been treated well.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Close to the airport,"This place needs to be updated but our room was clean and comfortable.  It is close to the airport which is something convenient.  They also have an indoor pool area which is clean.  The breakfast is a basic one.  The down side is that our door was not sealed properly and we were able to hear everything that was going on in the hall, almost as if it was opened, something that La Quinta can repair.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,First and last stay at a La Quinta Inn,"Our flight was canceled until the following morning and we wanted to stay near the airport.  We had a choice, but wanted to try La Quinta for a change.  The room was clean but noisy, could hear the air conditioner units running like an old pick up truck all night.  And the wall were paper thin, could hear what was going on in the hallway, with the TV on.... The beds were some what but not super comfortable, but that I expected.  There were vending machines in the hallway, but they either didn't take credit cards or were empty Luckily,  there was a 7/11 up the street, oh thakn heaven!!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great location to DIA plus a nice hotel,Stayed here with my wife as we had a very early flight out the next day.  This hotel has a 24 hour shuttle and quiet a few places nearby for dining.  They also have a stay and fly rate that I will definitely consider for future travel.  The check in was great and the staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.  They recognized my elite status and gave both me and my wife a drink and snack.  The room was upgraded from what we reserved and we were very pleased with the cleanliness and size of the room.  We left early the next morning and did not have the opportunity to have breakfast.  We will definitely stay here again when we are in the area.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not as nice as they used to be...,"All good things must come to an end, they say. Have stayed at this facility for many years and has been consistently good. the last several visits we have noticed a decrease overall. check in and out takes longer, not as clean...the air conditioning is a disappointment. its a hundred degrees out---i want good AC! i literally woke up sweating at night. staff is friendly, but not enough of them.had a suite under the elevator. made noise allllll hours.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Way too hot!!!,"Energy efficient air conditioners are a joke if you like to sleep comfortably & cool.this staff was very friendly, it's not their fault about the a/c units. But when you are a paying guest, you should be able to turn your thermostat to whatever you want. W/ 5 floors of rooms , I am sure there are people who like to sleep w/ the temp below 70. It doesn't matter what temp you set it at, it won't go below 70. Thank goodness I brought a fan with me. We had a suite & the bedroom wasn't even blowing cold air. It said it was 67 in that room, but the room was stuffy & the unit was blowing lukewarm air. I had to sleep out on the fold out couch away from my husband because at least that thermostat was blowing cold air, even if it was 70. This stay was very uncomfortable. If you want to be energy efficient in your lobbies & halls, that's fine, but let your paying guests use the rooms at the temperature they can sleep comfortably at. The properly is also old & stained & smelly. I won't stay here again. I would've slept more comfortably outside camping than in a stuffy, hot room.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not a good value,"This hotel is not worth the savings, pay a little more and get a nicer place. Check in took over 40 minutes (at midnight) because there were several customers ahead of me that had been over booked and they had no rooms for them, even though they had paid and had confirmation numbers. The single desk clerk was scrambling to find them rooms at other hotels. Eventually she gave them rooms here that were reserved for other guests. She said she would send them elsewhere when they arrived. Bad business practices! The hallways smelled like sewage. The room wasn't dirty but it was not clean either - it appears they forgot to sweep the bathroom floor, YUCK! The toilet had huge cracks in it, but didn't leak thankfully. It is VERY LOUD here. The slamming doors started at about 4:30 AM and continued all morning. You can here TV's and people talking as well. The breakfast was adequate at best - heavy on gluten and carbs. The only protein choices were dairy and small tubs of peanut butter. Bottom line...I wish I had forked out another $20. I will never stay at a LaQuinta again.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Just Needed Sleep,"I was in Denver to accomplish some work at the airport.  After working over 24 hours straight, I just needed some sleep.  I called Hilton Hotels as I am a gold member of their Hilton Hotels rewards program.  The representative I was talking to kept asking, what is going on in Denver.  She said she was looking 10 miles from the airport and could find nothing.  At one point, for about 30 seconds I had a room at a Hampton Inn on Tower Road, before it vanished.  After about 15 minutes on the phone with Hilton Hotel reservations, the manager I was working for said he would find me a room.  After another 15 to 20 minutes of him talking to several people, I had a room at the La Quinta Inn.First there is a shuttle to and from the airport to the hotel, which was a great pleasure.  The front desk staff were very friendly and a pleasure to be around.  Upon entering the hotel there is a strong smell everywhere, almost like a sewer smell trying to be masked with a Lysol aroma.  The only amenity in the bathroom besides towels was a single bar of soap!  No shampoo, no conditioner, no shower cap no nothing.  Bed was pretty comfortable, pillows were terrible.  There was a card in the room showing hotel offered free wifi, but did not use it, also did not turn on tv, so have no idea what channels are offered.  Only amenity I used was the alarm clock.  It worked well as I needed to catch an early morning flight. There are several restaurants within easy walking distance to the hotel.  I ate at Ruby Tuesday's which was very nice.The free morning breakfast offers fresh fruit, yogurt, dry cereals, juices, milk, coffee, toast and muffins, and I saw a few people eating waffles.  If you drink hot tea as I do, there is none.  That was the only downside I saw.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Too Hot,"Staff: Front desk staff was friendly, helpful, pleasant, efficientA/C: No matter how low I set the A/C, the room temperature would not go below 68. That should have been okay for me, but even with all the covers off it felt warm to me. That's not cool enough for me (I sleep at 64 at home). I didn't sleep well. For that reason, I don't plan to stay here again.Appearance: Nice-looking, CleanBed: Good, comfortableQuiet: The room was quiet.Bathroom: Nice-looking, Clean; Good shower; plenty of hot water quicklyBreakfast: I did not look at it. I went out for breakfast. Internet: The Wi-Fi worked well and was fast. There were enough outlets for all my electric devices.TV: Good; worked well",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great rooms for an overnight stay,"We stayed at the La Quinta before an early flight out in part because of reasonable cost and proximity to the airport. We were very pleasantly surprised with the quality and size of the room, which gave us a great night's sleep. In the morning they served breakfast starting at 5, which is terrific for an early flight. Unfortunately the quality of the breakfast was lacking compared to its competitors and we didn't even finish our first cup of coffee. But the accommodations were otherwise really good. The breakfast cut a star off my rating.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good for shuttle service and walking to restaurants,"We stay here every few years. The room was fine once we got the one we asked for. One staff member seemed unsure where the rooms were and another was annoyed that we interfered with his checking his cell phone. Phil was very nice, but was busy fixing the mistakes of other staff members. You will not hear any of the usual ""how was your stay"" or ""enjoy your trip"" or ""hope you stay with us again"". The rooms are large and we never experienced the sewer smell others mentioned. We could walk to several restaurants. Probably stay here again because there will be a whole new group working the desk. Hopefully they will be better trained.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice hotel,The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The pool was very clean and pleasant. It was nice that there were towels at the pool.The grounds were very well kept and pretty landscaping. Location convenient to airport and shuttle service was excellent.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A little dated-but has the 3 C's,"Its convenient, its clean and its cheap. A decent continental breakfast is included. They allow dogs, which is a plus for my wife and I. The front desk is quite helpful, and there is an airport shuttle.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,This Hotel Has Gone Down the Tubes,"I have stayed here over the years and there is a sewage smell that they always tell me they will fix, well never has been and I wont stay anymore. Room and carpet were not clean, bath fixture leaked profusely. This hotel has just gone down the tubes. Also, for $159, they are price gouging and this place is not worth the money. The rate should be from $75-$105 a night for the quality. I felt like I was in Motel 6.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Ok for the price ,The price was right and it was close to the Denver airport.  That's how I chose this hotel. Upon check in they said their system was down. They sent me to a room that was already occupied.  The second room was decent and clean. Breakfast was included but not as great a spread as some of the other hotels of similar sort. Not hugely impressed but it served the purpose. It was ok for the price and location.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Dog-Friendly Place,"My family of 4 (including our dog) stayed here recently.  We had requested a first floor room near an exit to let our dog out easily.  Upon check-in, they put us on the second floor.  We requested a first floor room again, and they thankfully accommodated us.The hallway near the exit door had air which smelled like sewage blowing through the vents.  However, this was improved the next morning. There are several restaurants nearby for food options.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Hotel,Hotel is nice and the lobby/breakfast area are very spacious and welcoming. We were in a double room and it was very spacious. Hotel is located next to some restaurants as well. Would return again next time.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great!,Beds were super comfortable and room was very clean! Everyone at the front desk was very friendly! I did not eat breakfast here so can't comment on that. Great for a quick stay. The shuttle to the airport was Grady to catch both at the hotel and at the airport. Ruby Tuesdays is right next door.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Exceeded expectations!,"The hotel was super clean and very nice! You can tell that they keep up on the hotel! The staff were welcoming and helpful. The room was a nice size, we stayed in king extended. For being pet friendly you could not smell any lingering odors...which was a great relief. We will definitely stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good hotel for a one night stop over,"We stayed here for the 3rd time, we were once again pleased with the hotel we had a king room, which was very clean and quiet and the bed was very comfortable the breakfast was ample to get you started in the morning. We did'nt have to wait long for the shuttle when we landed but l must admit the shuttle could do with a revamp it was better when they had their own shuttle its become a bit run down.l would use this hotel again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A fine stay,"I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and the size of this hotel.  It was well cared for and maintained.  We enjoyed our stay very much.  Having a restaurant in the hotel would be nice, but fortunately there was one close by.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very Convenient and Relatively Inexpensive,"We stayed here because we had a morning flight the next day and the hotel provided reliable free shuttle service to the airport. The room was clean and spacious. The staff at the front desk were very knowledgeable and helpful. The price was right at $120, taxes included. We would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Decent place for an overnight,"My colleagues and I travel to the Denver/Colorado Springs area monthly, and stay at La Quinta the night before flying home from Denver. The rooms are average, but confortable for an overnight. Good hot water and pressure for shower in the morning. Breakfast is typical Continental style. Pool, whirlpool, and workout room all look good, but haven't used them. Only complaint from several of my traveling companions have been dogs in adjoining rooms (yes LQ is pet-friendly) being noisy during the evening/night. I haven't experienced this personally - guess I've just been lucky.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta  Denver - Airport ~ A great experience,"We were happy to find a La Quinta near the airport so we could prepare to fly out the next morning without rushing.  We were so pleased, but not surprised with the inn.  We stay at La Quinta often and always enjoy it.  Especially helpful was the assistance getting our boarding passes and luggage check in.  Great facility with great employees.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Loud noisy rooms!!!,"I'm certain they have absolutely no insulation in the walls between the rooms!  We literally heard toilets flushing, doors slamming, and normal conversations of folks just walking down the hall. We had a very hard time sleeping. I would not stay here again, and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone that's looking for a good nights rest.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great location to all parts of the city,"Very caring staff, attentive, great location for getting around the city........ cleanish!!!  Family had a great time......... This will be my hotel for me when I come to Denver. money well spent.Great location to all parts of the city.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Front desk checked someone else in on our reservation!,"This wasn't a simple case of giving away the last king room before our very late arrival (we'd booked a king suite for 2 adults and 2 kids) - they literally checked someone else in on our reservation. I saw the paper with my name and address and someone else's signature. How does that even happen?To the night clerk's credit, we were comped a second double room, but my 6'1"" partner and I had a rough night's sleep in a rock-hard double bed. (At least the kids were happy though, since they got their own room & separate beds instead of a pull-out.)The airport shuttle is shared among multiple properties and took forever to pick us up from the airport. Luckily we were the first stop on the hotel end of the route. (We used Uber the next morning to get to the car rental facility.)Breakfast was average - waffles, cereal, fruit, bagels.Denver was the start/end point of a road trip - we canceled our second reservation here (at the end of our trip) and stayed elsewhere.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Perfect location for airport travelers, but some issues came up","The hotel is one of about a dozen recently built near the airport. If offers airport shuttle.The place is larger than other La Quinta I have seen.The check staff were great!Place is modern and clean.Outdoor pool open 24 hours.Not anything to do in the area. Only one C Store  was a bit of a walk.There was a bad sewer smell in hallway  at 10PM  which made me consider leaving, but with an early morning flight we stayed.Our requested wake up call for 330AM did not happen and this could have been a disaster for our flight but we heard others in hallway departing early too and woke up without the important callPrice seemed a bit high with so many hotels in the same place.Internet was free and fast.The room had fridge and microwave, but oddly it had a large space next to the bed which made sense for chair or couch to be located.Loved the walkin shower!",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convientent to Airport,"This hotel is near the airport along with a number of other hotels. The free shuttle leaves a little bit to be desired. Hard to locate the shuttle at the airport and a bit confusing which shuttle goes to which La Quinta Hotel and a long wait for pickup. The hotel itself is obviously an older building but the staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. Short walking distance to a restaurant is a definite plus. I would stay here again if I had a flight delay or a long lay over.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Needs extensive upkeep!,La Quinta DIA looks OK from the outside but the inside is very dated. The hotel could use new paint and carpet in the hallways and updated decor in the rooms. The breakfast is your typical fare but the food is arranged in such a small area that you have to wait on line to access it. $125/nt is way too much money to pay for a night at LaQuinta.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,TRAVELING FOR 25 YEARS / WORST HOTEL I HAVE STAYED IN PERIOD,The hotel has outsourced the shuttle service from Denver Airport to their hotel.  Several guests waited one hour and saw competing hotel shuttles come thru 2/3 times with courteous drivers.  The shuttle bus was mid 70's shitbox with no shocks or tie rods and the driver was going 65mph - death capsule. By the way their are about 6 stops as it is not dedicated to LaQuinta. Not sure where to start with the hotel - think Beirut post civil conflict and citizens trashed the hotel common areas and rooms - the rooms smell horrendous.  I read several recent favorable reviews on this hotel and cannot believe them - instead of staying at Laquinta for $100 bucks rent a car from Alamo and sleep in it at short term parking - way cleaner and more convenient to catch your flight safely.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,two nights - good place to stay,"We picked this place, because we have family that lives nearby, but was very clean, large breakfast area.    They love your pets - we love pet friendly motels.    Least expensive, nicest of all the motels we have stayed at over the years in this area.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,poor attitude,"the attitude of the 2 ladies , jamie and claudia ( i think that is her name ) did not even speak to greet me in the mornings . Claudia the other lady that came in sometimes in the morning to relieve jamie , just had a piss poor attitude . she does not need to be working anywhere at all.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Return Guest,"this is our favorite when near the Denver airport, beautiful grounds ,rooms and beds very comfortable, they do not have non-feather pillows, and a few minor maintenance issues need addressed, overall a good value and friendly staff, convenient location with great views",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not Customer Service Oriented,"We stayed here with a group of friends and relatives and booked several rooms.  I booked a ""suite"" which is a very loose definition of the word.  They were supposed to give us a group rate, which they would not do when I checked in.  Just a few minutes after checking in I called down to the front desk and gave them our AARP information, which they said they would put in.  When we checked out, they had given me the AARP rate for the second night but not for the first night, saying that since I had not given it to them at check-in, they couldn't change the first night's rate, which was a very high rate compared to the rate our relatives got for the same type of ""suite"".  The ""suite"" itself was really one room with a divider with slats that were broken so there was no privacy in the ""bedroom"".  The baseboards throughout the ""suite"" were filthy.  They gave us 2 hand towels even though we had 3 people staying in our room, and one tiny sample of shampoo, enough for 1 person.  The general condition of the hotel is very mediocre, with obvious deferred maintenance needed throughout.  The community area in the lobby and outdoors is nice for gathering, about the only good thing I have to say about this hotel.  We won't be back.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,They get it,"So many chain hotels try to be something they are not. this is a great hotel in the proper place with a great attitude. It has all that you need large comfortable rooms, an elevator that actually works, a typical hotel breakfast, room downstairs to stretch out in the lobby a nice outdoors courtyard great shuttle service and pleasant staff. If you are looking for a place near the airport look no further.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Last minute business stay,"Flight schedule changed, I called the same day, and was thrilled to know that accommodations available, and the staff was extremely helpful and gracious, both in making the reservations, and at check in.  I love the beds, and always rest well.  The accommodations were as nice as many of the nearby hotels at a much higher rate.  I will stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,What's that smell?,"My mom and I stayed here a night since it was so close to the airport and it provides a shuttle. When we arrived everything seemed nice until we reached the sketchy elevator.  We were on the 5th floor. Once we walked a few feet from the elevator we were hit with a very unpleasant smell that grew stronger the further we went down the hall. The room smelt fine, but the hallway.  The staff were absolutely wonderful.  I realized that part of my suitcase was cracked and needed to be taped. The staff quickly located tape and scissors for me to repair my luggage. Altogether the smell could be overlooked due the kind friendly staff and clean rooms.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Forget the Shuttle -- Take a Cab,"Our only complaint is that we waited an hour for the shuttle to pick us up from the airport. There are other airport hotels located in the same area and we saw their shuttles arriving every 15 minutes. We thought we would need to take a cab to the hotel. The shuttle was also 15 minutes late taking us back to the airport. When we return to Denver, which we will since we have friends who live there, we will definitely book another hotel to avoid this aggravation.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,What a mess!,"We stayed at this hotel one night because we had an early flight out the next morning. We got the most expensive 'Executive Suite.' It was a MESS. The night light on one side of the bed didn't work. The HVAC unit in the bedroom was broken and poured out cold air until we finally had to unplug it. The microwave was missing its dial, so was unusable. The couch was dirty and stained. The carpet was torn. The amenities in the bathroom were shameful! The tissue was honestly like sandpaper, there was one TINY bottle of shampoo, no hand lotion; it just seemed totally CHEAP. We had just come from a similarly priced room at another hotel that was the opposite: lots of beautiful amenities in a clean and lovely room. I went to print our boarding passes and one computer was connected to a broken printer. The second computer finally printed the boarding passes, but when we got to the airport, the print quality was so poor that the scanner couldn't read the boarding pass!  La Quinta should be ashamed to have this hotel as part of its group.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,excellent reception,stayed there on 6/8 after a marathon in casper wyoming and everything was great.  talked with the Lady at checkin and she was great (i think her name was krista).  we talked about her husband who was wounded in the war and some of his treatment.  to go through what she is going through and be very nice and ask everyone how their day is going and still be nice was amazing.  she handle a very difficult guy while i was there and i wouldn't have been so nice to his rude self. but she didn't flinch.  room was excellent and breakfast was ready at 5 am,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Worst Ever,"Staff was horrible, eating while I checked in AND checked out, same person.  Lobby dirty, Great Starts breakfast was empty and not refilled.  Coffee machines were horrible.  Room had pet stains on carpet, smelled of urine.  Elevator dirty, smelled.  Staff was more interested in their cell phones than guests or jobs.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great restaurants nearby -walk 3 mins,"Good standard hotel, clean comfortable- great breakfast.  best is one can walk to good restaurants nearby.  Italian one -excellent-DiCicco's Italian Restaurant.  Had our 2 yr old grandbaby with us and she enjoyed watching the unusual big screen with pics of Sinatra and older singers as they warbled their tunes!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Property starting to age,"After staying at this LaQuinta since it opened years ago, it has started to run down a bit despite upgrades.  However our bed was comfortable and seemed newer.  The front desk was outstanding.  Breakfast was standard, nothing overly special.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Experience,"All of the accommodations were great.  The only thing that was less than impressive was there was no meat offering on the breakfast bar.  Other than that, great value, good price and excellent location makes this a great place to stay for the night.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good overnight airport hotel,Nice place to stay overnight. Quite calm place with friendly stuff. Has a transfer service typical for the airport hotel. But we had to wait for the shuttle bus from the airport apprix.20min. The bus was okeish... :) fine for this price.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Customer service not their strong suit,"We stayed one night at La Quinta Inn & Suites Denver Airport DIA. The hotel is in a convenient location near the airport and close to restaurants. The grounds are nice with outdoor seating areas and gazebos. Check in was easy and the lobby attendant was efficient. We reserved two rooms. One was a double and the other was a king executive. Both rooms were a good size, nicely appointed and had very comfortable beds with excellent pillows. Unfortunately both rooms were lacking items for the coffee maker. One room had no cups and the other had no coffee and only one cup, and there were parts missing from the coffee maker. I called the front desk multiple times and it just rang and rang. This was late afternoon and no one was answering the phone? The third time I called a gentleman answered. I told him our coffee maker was missing parts and there was no coffee and only one cup. He said he would send someone up. No one ever came. Along with the missing coffee there were no toiletries in the bathroom. The microwave and the refrigerator were very old. Looked like they jumped right out of the 80's. We loved the rooms and the outdoor areas of the hotel but were very disappointed in the customer service and for that reason we will stay elsewhere on our next trip to Denver.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean & comfortable airport hotel,The room was clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable. Bedding was quality high thread-count cotton. Bathroom also clean and spacious.  Heated indoor swimming pool and hot-tub made the stay enjoyable.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient to airport and rental cars.,"Stayed one night. Easy checkin, very helpful. Nice room with confortable bed. Microwave, coffeemaker and refrigerator in cornercabinet. I did not try the breakfast but they start serving at 4:30 am. There is a shuttle which stops at other hotels so it might take 30 minutes to get to the airport depending on how many stops it makes. I had to take a rental car back and it took less than 10 minutes to get to rental car place and onto their shuttle back to DIA. There are other hotels along this road but La Quinta is next door to Ruby Tuesdays so you can walk to it.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Perfect stay,"This hotel is conveniently located near the airport.  The property is clean and comfortable.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  What else can you ask for?  It provides all the things you have come to expect from a LaQuinta property.  The breakfast buffet is adequate, but is the only area that could be improved upon.  I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice hotel. For pets lovers,"Very nice at check in. Attractive, clean property. Pets welcome. Super area to walk or play with your 4 legged companions. Room was very clean and comfortable. Close to airport and out of town. Quiet and in crowded. Highly recommend.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great rooms,"We love the LaQuinta chain and this particular location was wonderful.The rooms were exceptionally large and very quiet .The hotel includes free breakfast which was varied and tasty.  Breakfast on site saves a lot of hassle in trying to locate something to eat offsite.The staff were helpful and pleasant.  The beds were large and very comfortable.  We would recommend this location to anyone passing through Denver Intl  Airport.Be sure to use your AAA, AARP, or other loyalty programs as the hotel offers a significant discount to members.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,JC,All met my needs and expectations.  Wonderful friendly staff.  Great location and transportation to Denver International Airport.  Nice spacious and very clean rooms.    Comfortable firm beds.  Convenient shuttle service.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Comfortable Rooms and Caring Staff,"First of all, the doors open automatically for the front entrance - how nice is this when your arms are full with luggage and maybe children.  Free Wi-Fi. The lobby area doubles with the breakfast area, but is pleasant and cozy.  The rooms are pleasantly decorated and the beds are comfortable.  There are serviced with plenty of towels.  The rooms have an unusual shape, but this adds to the different appeal.  The carpet seems cleaner than most, so this is a plus.  There is a fairly large pool and hot tub, both with a Hoyas-lift. Area of Concern: Although a non-smoking hotel, my room clearly had been smoked in.  I did not complain, but felt like it should have been taken care of a bit better.TIPS: *It is very close to the airport and provides a free shuttle. *Weekday breakfast ends at 9:00 a.m. - I would have preferred a little bit longer for those whose flights arrived late, therefore had late check-in.  I noticed that a customer asked about the breakfast and although it was put away, the front desk clerk told him to go and ask and they offered some food for him.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not what I expected,"I have never stayed at this La Quinta before and I was very disappointed.  The exterior looks really nice as well as the lobby.  I was impressed because I was able to check in quite early however they gave me the room key went to the room only to find out that the room hadn't even been cleaned.  I walked back down to tell them about it they did apologize and they gave me another room.  This was now on the third floor which was fine but the hallways were full of clutter on the floor.  I thought well maybe they just haven't been here to clean it yet.  Wrong, it was the same the next morning.  At first I thought my room was clean but after looking around more thoroughly there were large crumbs of food next to the nightstand by the bed and more by the floor by the computer desk.  Obviously they didn't vacuum.  The fitted sheets were not even put on properly and about to come off so I had to re-do it!!!  The room was extremely noisy.  You would hear people talking, flushing the toilets and what was even worse to me was the traffic noise from the street.  It was unbelievable.   Obviously the building and windows are not even close to being sound proofed.  Needless to say it was very hard to relax and go to sleep.I do not know how the breakfast was since I had to leave on an early flight.  However it was interesting to hear other people who stayed there as they had the same complaints as I did, especially about the noise.  I can't say I will ever go back to this hotel especially since they weren't that much cheaper then some of the better hotel chains. In my opinion La Quinta has really gone down hill in the past years.  They use to be a better quality hotel and I have stayed in several La Quinta's but wanted to give this one a try since it was by the airport and thought it was be of a higher standards since they have so many people that fly in and out of DIA.  I was wrong.  I would not recommend this hotel at all.  Oh ya, almost forgot.  I had asked for a wake up call and a shuttle when I checked in, they did do that.  Something told me to go back and re-verify only to find out that when they changed rooms she did not change my information, so had I not re-checked I would never have gotten my wake up call but someone else would have.  HA!  Then when I had her change my information the front desk said we don't have wake up calls at 2:45 am they said it starts at three.  What the heck????  All they do is put the time in their machine and it's a recording not a live person so it should matter what time your wake up call is.Needless to say I would not recommend this hotel.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good value for early bird airport travel,"We enjoy this hotel when flying out of D.I.A. in the early morning.  Get to skip rush hour, so we sleep better.  Beds are good, and the breakfast too.  It starts at 5 a.m. which is an hour earlier than many hotels nearby.  The grounds are nice, so if weather allows, you can get out of your room to relax.  Pool is available 24 hours a day.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good hotel but false advertising on free shuttle!,"My family and I stayed here, and when we booked the room, we were very satisfied with the price considering that they offered a free shuttle to the airport.  However, they do NOT offer a free shuttle.  They do offer a shuttle, but they charge you an extra $25 per car to park there for up to seven days.  It is then extra if you park there for longer.  My friend drove separately, thinking that she could park there, as well.  When we got there, they checked us in (Leigh was extremely nice and helpful), and we thought we were all set.  However, when my friend checked in, they forced her to put the room on her card to hold it, and then they told us each of our cars would be charged $25 extra, totaling an extra $50 dollars on top of the room charges.  We were under the impression that the shuttle was free because that was listed under the amenities on hotels.com.  The front desk person was unhelpful, rude, and offered no explanation on this confusion.  I will not be staying here again.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice place to stay,The room was good and clean and they offer a great breakfast buffet (no Bacon) but still very good. It was nice and quiet and the fellow passing guest seemed pretty friendly.I would stay again.They also offer free airport shuttle pick up and drop off.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Adequate overnight near Denver airport,"Pluses: clean, convenient to airport. Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Bed was comfortable with lots of pillow choices. 24 hour airport shuttle - great! and breakfast begins at 5am.. good for those with early departures. Free wifi worked just fine. Coffee was decent and it's also available 24/7. My room had a microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker as well as a comfortable couch. You couldn't hear any noise from airport arrivals and departures. This LaQuinta is significantly less expensive than competing nearby hotels. There are several ""generic"" restaurant options within walking distance (Village Inn, Ruby Tuesday, etc).Minuses: very little interior sound insulation; you can hear everything in the hall. I was blessed with a quiet night. If there had been rowdy folks next door, it would have been hard to sleep. (Easily remedied if you bring your own ""white noise"" app or machine.) The heating and A/C system was touchy. I needed to ask for help from front desk to switch mine from blowing cold air to heat. (It required unplugging the unit and waiting 15 minutes.) It would have been nice to have an extra blanket in the room. The free breakfast was uninspired. Styrofoam plates / bowls and instant oatmeal; hard boiled eggs, Yoplait yogurt, muffins, toast, apples, bananas, juice and milk. Overall this place was a good value for a single night stay before my flight out of Denver International Airport.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay close to DIA,Great value for the price. The room was clean. The mattress was fairly firm and offered great support. The bathroom was spacious and had shampoo and soap. The staff was friendly. The shuttle to the airport was very convenient. We'll definitely stay here again.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport Hotel,"Since our last stay the hotel has taken a step back. One of the two elevators was out of service  making for long wait times, and the handicap ladies bathroom in the breakfast area was also inop. The hotel could use an update.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay,"Enjoyed our two nights stay; warm, friendly staff.  Nice (warm) pool.  Conveniently located to the airport with good transportation.  Located near two great restaurants.    Would highly recommend to friends.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very good experience,"This hotel is very convenient to the Denver International Airport (the only thing ""more"" convenient would be the brand new hotel being built directly next to the airport, but it's not open, yet!).  Free airport shuttle service, very comfortable bedding, clean, bright, fresh.  Breakfast was good.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,lack of service,"When we arrived we did not find bath towels in our room.Although we left a request for a wake-up call,All the traveler's that morning did not get their wake up callIt did not have a bar, although one was at the next door motel",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Value with a Smile,"I stay at the LaQuinta in Denver located on Tower Road mainly because of the friendliness of the staff, clean and comfortable rooms, ease of checking in and out and the bottom line, the price is right. Only complaint is noise factor. You can hear people whisper is the halls",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,HAD TO CLEAN OWN ROOM,We have been staying at hotel since Tuesday night.  Desk people don't tell truth  (gave our room to someone with our same name but no one knew about it the next day) and cleaning staff have cleaned room only once.,1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Awesome price. Great location. Couldn't beat it!,Awesome price. Great location. Couldn't beat it. It was nice and close to the airport so that was nice for our early morning flight. We didn't take advantage of the shuttle but there was one. There was also a breakfast offered but I can't comment as we left to early.     I will say the bathrooms and appliances in the rooms were out dated. They did the job but looked a little worn out.      The bed was comfy and the room was clean. Our son loved the pool and the hot tub was nice. Again this area was dated but nothing wrong with it.      We fly out of Denver a lot and have stayed at mean airport hotels. Definitely think this was the best value for our money.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great service..wonderful stay,"Comfortable bed, clean rooms and adequate breakfast. Check-in and check-out was smooth and staff well very courteous. I did not use their shuttle, but they have free shuttle service from the hotel to the airport. Overall, excellent service an a wonderful experience.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta Inn & Suites DIA is Tricky,"We stayed at the La Quinta Inn near DIA with the thought of parking there while traveling.  We were told that we didn't make the ""right"" kind of reservation to allow storage parking.  They weren't interested in helping us; the clerk said since we made the reservation through tripadvisor there was nothing to be done.  So we had to get up extra early in subzero weather and find parking at DIA and ended up paying lots more than if we had just taken a shuttle to the airport.  Never again!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Location and shuttle great,This was just a stop over while waiting for next leg of my vacation.  The shuttle and service was excellent. I use LaQuinta a lot and this was as expected.  There also was several restaurant within walking distance of the hotel which is important when you do not have a vehicle.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,LaQuinta Stay,I stayed here because I was picking up a family member at the airpoprt late at night and live an 1 1/2hrs away. We have stayed at LaQuinta several times in the Denver area and  also North Carolina and they are one of our favorite chains.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Way less than expected,"I understand this is a lower priced chain, and I was only there one night before a morning flight from Denver, but I was still shocked to see black mold growing around the corner of the tub/shower.  Mold!  Haven't the housekeepers heard of chlorine bleach?  Strike one.  With my phone alarm set for 6 am, it was quite a surprise to hear the phone at 4:30 am with ""my"" wake-up call.  I didn't request it, I didn't program it, I definitely didn't want it, and I didn't reach the phone in time to respond.  So ten minutes later it rang again.  So much for a relaxing night's sleep before a full day of travel.  Strike two.  Since I was up early and didn't want to spend long in the shower, I was out the door early and avoided the weak breakfast offering by eating at the airport.  This property may suit somebody but definitely not me ever again.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Budget hotel with a budget feel,"I think I have stayed in just about every airport hotel off of Tower Road. I needed someplace near the airport with a shuttle the operated after midnight. La Quinta offered that. The shuttle van was not a hotel van but contracted through Western something or other. The hotel offers an inexpensive military rate of $85/night/double/with breakfast. The desk staff was helpful enough but the facilities are a bit worn and our room was not very clean (hairs in the bathtub, floors not clean, etc). The beds were ok and it was quiet enough. Would I stay again? If I had to but I think there are better options for marginally more money.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent Service,Very friendly staff at check-in and check-out.  Very clean room.  Very nice facility.  I would recommend this facility due to the courteous staff and cleanliness of the room and overall facility.  It is close to the airport and a shuttle runs every 30 minutes.  It was very convenient for access to and from the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very good and comfortable hotel,Stayed at this La Quinta 5 miles from Denver airport for 2 nights.Pleased all around. Comfortable room and adequate wi fi. The pressure in the shower was weak but other than that everything was good. I would definitely stay here again.Parking was a bit of a problem at the backside of the hotel. Lot was often completely full....but that is probably being picky.Over all happy and would stay here again if need to be close to the Denver airport.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A scenic hotel with scenic views,"Excellent Breakfast Buffet, could stock up for eating later.  Breakfast room had panoramic views to the snow-covered mountains outside Denver.  There were places to sit outside which were well-thought-out and attractive.  The breakfast room had an adjoining ""sitting room"".  For a hotel, it was almost ""comfy"".  Single room was excellently appointed.  I could open the bedroom window-hurrah!- as I don't like ""conditioned"" air.  Food could be stored in the fridge.  Brought more tea bags as hotels have too few.  Shake, rattle and roll.  The shuttle bus was filty on the morning of 14th March at 9 am.  Disgusting remnants of the driver's possessions and food were strewn all over the floor near the driver's seat.  He had enough time to clean the ENTIRE bus had he chosen to do so.  Instead he pie-jawed with people in the hotel and served himself breakfast at the buffet.  The only true negative during the stay.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Check this one off my list,"I booked this hotel becuase of the closeness to the airport and the amenities included extended parking and airport shuttle. When I checked in on March 1st I was greeted by a very rude ""Sabrina"" who had no manners or customer service. She then told me that because I booked on hotels.com I was not eligible for the parking or the airport shuttle. What?! So, I asked to chat with the manager on duty. Sabrina told me that there was no manager on duty. So, I'm in a bind, which of course I figured out. The room was ok. Not the cleanest, hair in the tub. Very noisy, lots of door slamming. Nope, wouldn't stay here again.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Run down, loud, and not clean",Stayed here prior to catching a very early flight. The front desk perso laughed about the lack of parking and our room was dirty. Our neighbors were having a great time partying all night. I called the desk and requested that they speak to them but nothing was done. There are many hotels close to DIA. This airport should be your last choice.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Snow delay,"Got into Denver at 3AM instead of 3PM, airline made a reservation for me at La Quinta. The shuttle pick up neglected to tell me where, at that time, I was to be picked up. Not sure whose fault but the Hotel had them make a special run. The night desk staff was very helpful. The room was a welcome sight and although by the time I got in people were leaving it was quiet and I was able to catch up on some sleep. I would stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Disappointed, loud, but clean","Parked all the way in the back of the building and it was 9 degrees out. Cards would not work on the door. Thankfully, someone was walking out. Got to the room, again, cards didn't work. The door to the room was beat up and the front desk said ""No worries, the fire dept had to break in a few years ago and it doesn't pose a safety risk."" The beds were changed and had clean sheets. The room was clean. Kudos to housekeeping! However, the bed and pillows were super uncomfortable and I had the worst sleep. Lastly, lots of door slamming all night long. I think the doors could use some sound proofing since they all slam when shut. We paid an extra $30 for shuttle and parking. Not back yet but I expect our car to be untouched when we return. We'll see. Previous comments in February are concerning.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Probably shouldn't tell you about this one,"Going to DIA when you live out of town sometimes can be difficult if it is snowing.  We love staying at LaQuinta.  They have military rates, and it is always nice.  Probably should keep this place a secret. But I am sure folks know about it.  We have not left our car there - though you can. We don't do that because friends at other hotels on Tower Road have had their cars broken into. So if you do leave your car - don't leave anything valuable in it.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Everything as expected,"The hotel was clean and the breakfast was as expected so it was fine.  I did find though that the things that made it standout were the clerks at the desk, the housekeeper with her very excellent advice about the woeful bus transit weekend service, and the very busy lady making sure all of the breakfast items stayed stocked.I see that some reviews are critical of the rooms but on the second floor, we were fine. Try to get a discount rate as we did when we booked online and it will feel like you did the best for the price. I will also state that there are about 6 other establishments on the same block.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,la Quinta Hotel,This is a good place for staying one night and leaving your car for a trip. The shuttle was easy to access with drop off right at our airline entrance. Breakfast was good.Room was clean .Had read prior reviews but did not have those issues.  Just remember to bring lotion if needed as none supplied.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"night shuttle is the worst & ""sleeper sofa"" fits one child","I got into DIA at 11:30 pm with luggage and kids.  I called the hotel for shuttle pickup.  They told us where to wait, and that it would be half an hour.  1/2 hour later, the bus pulls up 50' from where we were it was supposed to.   The rest of the hotel guests rush to the bus and manage to get in.  When we got there, the bus was full.  We asked the driver to send another bus for us.  Nothing doing.  He said he was the only one, and that with all his passengers, he'd be at least another 45 minutes.   We called the hotel and got the same response.   I wasn't going to wait for another 45minutes and still not be guaranteed seating for my family.  Unfortunately, I had paid in advance for the hotel, so ended up taking a cab.  If you stay here, I'd recommend getting a cab - as opposed to waiting for a shuttle that may or may not have room for you.  Since the cab fare was $30, I’d recommend not even staying here and upgrading to a hotel with proper service.Booked a room for 4.  Got a king bed with sleeper sofa.  Sleeper sofa was a single.  Barely fit my 7yo.  The rest of the hotel experience was as expected. However, the shuttle ordeal makes this one hotel I'd neither recommend nor return to.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,No Concern for Shuttle Impact,Stay and Park shuttle service is why I stayed here.  Hotel facilities were nice & shuttle was quick on the way out.  On return...1 of 2 shuttles broke down hours earlier and hotel had no concern for replacing it.  20 people waited 60+ minutes in 8 degree weather outside while hotel told me nothing in 6 calls,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Just ok,"I stay at a lot of La Quintas.  There wasn't anything particularly wrong with this hotel, just not particularly good either.  I found the staff to be unfriendly and not very courteous.  Cleaning of my bathroom just didn't happen a couple of days and rather than give me wash clothes gave me hand towels as a substitute.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very unhygenic.,"The bathtubs are dirty and stained. The carpet is stained and smelly and so is the linen.Stay away from this propety if you care about hygiene.The customer service is poor. The room did not have laundry sack and when I reported it to the reception they sent me a black trash bag to use os laundry bag.The microwave and refridgerator in room are old and dull too, looks cheap.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel,"Great price, room was spacious and was not pleased with the shuttle. We ended up taking a taxi after calling three times and waiting over one hour. I am sure that was just a mishap as everything else was excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Nice, clean hotel!","This is a good la Quinta. I stay at this chain quite often, and find them to have good cheap rooms. The beds were very comfortable, and I slept very well. Nice and quiet. Staff are very friendly. Breakfast area is nicer than usual, with a mediocre Continental breakfast. The only problem was that the AC/heater seemed to have a mind of its own, but that wasn't much of an issue. I would stay here again the next time I visit Denver!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointing end to our trip,"Stayed here because of early flight out of DIA.  First room was dirty and loud being next to vending machines.  Front desk said they would call right back after checking on the room  and did not, had to call her back.  New room was better but had dirty sheets, had to wait 50+ minutes for the person to arrive after being told on the phone that it would only be a few minutes.  I didn't mind waiting just didn't like the dismissive way they gave us unrealistic times.  Breakfast was sparse, only had waffles for hot breakfast items.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Did what we needed,"Decent price on line.  Shuttles from airport run every 30 minutes but it is also for 4 other hotels so some folks got turned away.  Like all hotels off airport its about a 10 minute trip.Front desk was fast and good service.Very clean lobby, fast elevator.Room was on 5th floor.  Good sized, nice beds and super clean room.  As other said only noise was from other doors on the floor.  Bathroom good sized a clean.Not a bad choice if price is right.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Airport shuttle not on schedule,The airport shuttle was hired out to the Western company and is not dependable. The staff have no idea (at least at night) when it is going to get to the airport because it has to stop at other hotels on the way. We had to take a taxi after midnight to hotel.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver 2015,"One scheduled night stay and one additional night stay due to weather related flight cancellation. Very convenient location, friendly helpful staff, clean room, comfortable bed. If we are going to be marooned in Denver, this is close to the airport and not a bad drive to downtown Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Terrible!,"I needed to stay overnight at Denver International Airport for a morning flight, the hotel is only a few miles away and I booked this hotel based on past TripAdvisor reviews.  Things started out poorly and went worse.  It took 45+ minutes for the shuttle to come and pick us up from the airport that evening and it was packed solid with people.  It turns out that the shuttle serves a number of different hotels, so it took another 30 minutes to get to the hotel.  While the lobby was nice, the room was spartan and more in the mode of a trucker hotel.  The next morning we were scheduled for a 6:00am shuttle back to the airport.  We got down stairs a few minutes before 6:00am and the shuttle was there, so we go on.  It turns out that this was the 5:30am shuttle, filled to the brim with people (standing room only), which was running late.  Several people likely missed their flights, fortunately, we did not.  I had told the receptionist upon checkout about our shuttle experience the previous night, she apologized and said she would take $10.00 off the bill, not that that would matter about my ever returning here.  Suffice to say, when I checked my credit card recently, there was not such deduction.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Horrible service,"This is by far the most horrible place I ever stayed. My flight was diverted to Denver airport, which makes me to book this hotel. The front desk staffs had a horrible attitude towards customers. They made a mistake on booking and I had to go back and forth because they never picked up the phone. Finally when I went back to my room, my card to the room didn't even work. When I  had to go AGAIN  to change the card, they didn't even say sorry for the trouble. After spending a long agonizing time between canceled flights at the airport, that was the last service you look for. I will NEVER go to this place again.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Enough,"We like La Quintas when we travel cross country.Pros of this one:Clean, comfortable, great beds/pillows, $79 for King room with sofa, nice doggy area outside.Cons: No body lotion provided, hallway activity all night  due to airport location, breakfast just OK.We walked across the road to have dinner at Ruby Tuesday. Very convenient and good food!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great customer service/ Great hotel,Best value close to the airport by far! Outstanding customer service.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful stay!,"My husband and I have to drive 5 hours to get to the closest airport (Denver). We always stay here and love it! The location is great, very helpful staff and the rooms are lovely. I love the free breakfast; it's always fresh! The rooms are very clean. The hotel is located near plenty of restaurants for a night stay.We took the shuttle ride to the airport and left our car parked at the hotel. This last time we were gone for nearly 2 weeks, came back and the car was totally fine. Gives us peace of mind knowing our car is well watched while we're gone. I see the security car driving around the parking lot very frequently! Thank you for always taking good care of us!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"La Quinta, DIA","This is a comfortable, attractive, quiet airport hotel with some nice amenities like a refrigerator and microwave. Breakfast is plentiful but not unusual. Some rooms have beds which don't face the TV, making watching TV awkward, so ask for a room with the right bed configuration. Most rooms are under $100/night, which is nice for a quick overnight layover near the airport.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Hotel has gone slightly downhill,"I have stayed at this motel a few times prior and had been reasonably impressed.  I recently stayed for a night and noticed the little things had gone downhill.  Check in and customer service was fine.  When I went to open the door to my room, there was a large dent in the door which was just cosmetic.  Inside the room there was a large dirt stain on the comforter.  The TV channel guide was also off an hour.  When I went to use the hot tub the jets would not turn on.  Otherwise the room was decent with a refrigerator and a microwave.  The motel met my needs for this stay.  However, I may look elsewhere the next time I need a motel in this area.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Mila was great,"So my boss and I had a long day of travel that got even longer when our connecting flight at DIA had left without us.It seemed to be the day that all flights were being missed and/or cancelled because there were a TON of people needing rooms.Luckily, I had heard about the Hotels Tonight app & we quickly reserved 2 rooms.It was a CRAZY night and there was only one girl at the counter that night. Mila.She was getting phone call after phone of irate & grumpy travelers trying to book rooms, on top of trying to check people in.There was a pretty long line when we pulled up to the hotel.  So while waiting all I could obvserve is how she handled the guests/phone calls.One instance that sticks out in my mind is the time a guest got so mad because his reservation was made incorrectly, months prior, that his voice became uncomfortably loud. Mila didn't react, instead she apologized profusely & tried to just get the upset guest done with his check-in as soon as possible to avoid any further conflict, but the gentleman wasn't done.He then started using obscenities to show his distaste with her & La Quinta's policies as she tried to tell him why she wasn't able to refund his missed reservation.Basically, Mila stayed calm and collected through the commotion & confrontation and I wanted to give her credit for it.I have worked in the customer service industry most of my life and I know first-hand what it is like to deal with an angry guest but have no real power to do anything but apologize and be understanding.  Mila is a great employee and gave me a great impression of my first-time stay at a La Quinta Inn.Thank you!",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Got the job done,"The shuttle from the airport was not on time (stated ""every hour and hal-hour""), so we took a cab which ended up being $30 for a short ride.  The front desk staff was ok, the room was clean.  Nothing special or worth remembering, but we did get a good night's sleep in a quiet room.  Shuttle back the the airport was on time.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pleasant Stay,"I had to drive my son to Denver to catch a flight. My friend wanted to go with me with her 2 kids. I picked this hotel for the location, shuttle service, pool, free, breakfast. We stayed for one night and were happy with the room. It was clean and large enough for an overnight stay. The gardens and courtyard were beautiful. Breakfast was excellent, and they kept items stocked. We all ate well and enjoyed it. The shuttle was on time, and he drove safely. The driver was pleasant, and helped with my sons luggage. The pool was large, and the Jacuzzi was Handicapped accessible. This was a nice stay for us.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A good location for DIA,this location offers  comfortable accommodations.  There is a shuttle to DIA available at no additional charge.  The light breakfast is simple but offers healthy options.  We would sty here again if traveling from DIA.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient and Clean,"We like La Quinta Inns because they are a non-smoking hotel.  The free breakfasts are a good way to start the day if you are headed for DIA and a day of travel.  The rooms are clean and the staff polite and helpful.  We arrived in the middle of a snowstorm and the hotel was booked full but the service was great, our room clean and a good deal for the price.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice room,"This place was busy when we arrived, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Check in was fast. We had reservations. Got a room on the first floor which was helpful with our luggage. Breakfast was fair. Very little in the gluten free options. Glad I had some of my own food. Room clean. Bed clean. Bathroom clean. Slept well. Didn't use shuttle. Had rental car to return. Walked 1/2 block to Ruby Tuesday's for supper.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Repeatedly Substandard,"I have stayed at this hotel ten to twelve times over the last three years and on at least half of those occasions there were significant deficiencies with the rooms I stayed in related to housekeeping: dirty sheets multiple times, towels and paper not restocked, dirty clothes found in bed, no soap in the bathroom, etc.  On my last stay I had an experience where the front desk staff were unbelievably rude and disrespectful. I will never stay at this hotel again. Recommend the nearby Marriott Courtyard, Fairfield or Holiday Inn instead.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Horribly rude reception,"I've stated at this La Quinta numerous times in the past on our way through denver and sways thought it to be a. Ice, reasonably priced choice. But we were stunned by our recent stay. Our international flight from Paris, France , had been delayed for over two hour which meant that we missed a connection and a arrived in Denver at 11 pm instead of the planned 6 pm with two exhausted children in tow (they err literally) falling down. I had called the hotel from Dallas to explain that we would be arriving late and to please not give away our room. Upon arrival, however, my husband, who had gone ahead with the children while I got the rental car, asked If they could give him the room -- I would be there in 10 minutes and the reservation was confirmed with my credit card. The woman at the front desk refused, stating over and over that it was hotel policy nit to give rooms without an id (which we weren't asking then to do , we were asking then to open the door do the kids, who were now crumpled on the ground) could lie down. After several minutes of parrot like response, my husband gave up. I waked in about 10 minutes and saw mt exhausted children looking physically I'll and exploded -- particular I had called the hotel earlier in the day to explain the day situation. The one receptionist kept up her parrot like response, when I asked her why she couldn't have has had some simple common decency, her cohort at the desk accused me of being rude. A nasty verbal exchange ensued, largely with the mheavyset, vicious 2nd receptionist. When we finally got up to our room (this hotel has gone seriously downhill, btw) with beat up looking common areas, we undid the pull out bed for the kids (we had a king suite, on top if it) it hadn't even bed made (I had specified on the reservation that we were traveling with two children. I had to go back downstairs and after another surly exchange with the nasty dark haired receptionist (honestly I've never had worse service at a hotel) reluctantly changed our room. This hotel isn't the cheapest R the airport and it now has lots of competition with better-reviewed rivals.  I would suggest staying somewhere if you don't want to be treated like crap by the front desk. And reding the other reviews, apparently weren't the only ones to have has such a negative experience lately.  La qunita's management needs to shake up this hotel immediately.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Perfect DIA hotel,"This is as good as budget-priced hotels get. We overnighted here, coming from a town to the north, in order to make a 7am flight. Everything went exactly the way we hoped, including a prompt airport shuttle. The room was attractive and well-laid out, except for the consistent and perplexing chair situation. Two people could easily use the clever desk/table, except one would have to like to eat or work standing up. Very disappointing - is another desk chair really so expensive? Of course, if one of you prefers a barca-lounger, you'll be just fine.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta is consistent ,"One thing about a chain hotel is you pretty much know what to expect. This particular property is no different.  If you like La Quinta, you will like this place. Great location near the Denver Airport, restaurants and other hotels are close by. Staff was efficient and friendly and the ever present free breakfast was more than adequate. The price is right and I definitely recommend.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Gone way downhill!,"I always read reviews before I book a room but we have stayed in this hotel several times since it was built and have always had a great stay. Until now it had been one of my favorites to stay in. Never again! The 1st sign was how filthy the entrance was. My thought then was that it is winter so maybe that had something to do with it. If only that had been the case. Our room had urine on the floor around the toilet and dirt and hairs in the corners of the bathroom. The desk had something sticky on it, the sink by the microwave had coffee grounds in it and grounds and coffee spills all over the counter and running down the front of the fridge. The lip at the bottom of the fridge door was full of crap. The shutters that divide the sleeping area from the living room were broken and filthy. The bedroom curtains were missing hooks and hanging down and the rod to open them was standing in a corner. To make matters worse the sheets were not changed. One pillow stunk.  i did complain to the front desk and they said they would see we had a complete clean and inform the head housekeeper. 4 1/2 hours later housekeeping arrived and all we got were clean sheets and towels. I'm glad I travel with clorox wipes and believe me I used them here! Making the stay even worse was on the last morning having to stand out in the cold not once but twice due to the fire alarm. Apparently there was a pipe break and the same pipe had issues the week before. Just tells me this hotel is not being maintained properly. Certainly not being cleaned properly either.if you flying in or out of DIA I suggest you stay at one of the other hotels next to this one.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Nice Place, Nice staff","Nice little place only 10 minutes or so from the airport with friendly staff. It has a pretty basic swimming pool that was an OK size for kids and it was nice and clean, just like the rest of the hotel. The one downside we found was that there is no business centre other than a little computer off to the side of the hallway, not really necessary in todays day and age but it would've worked well for us when we were there. Overall it""s a good option if you need an overnight place near the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Clean, silent, comfortable. ","My room was clean, silent, and comfortable. Nice staff. I will stay here the next time I fly into Denver. This pet friendly hotel shows no evidence of any animals ever being in my room. The whole place smells clean and fresh. This was a great price for the accommodation and close proximity to the airport.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Rude front desk,"Nice hotel, staff is rude.  I honestly felt as if I was interrupting their life to ask for a replacement key that was misprogramed. Not to mention the 4 am wake up call I would never ask for, but got and was then told they misread the room number. I am a laquinta customer so I will stay at the chain again, but never at this one.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Snow Storm,"I do my best to plan trips where I can stay in a LaQuinta hotel. My wife and I we're stuck in a Snow Storm, with my Large Breed dog.  We called the nearest Laquinta, they welcomed us with open arm's, and the accomodations were wonderful. Thank You",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Near-ish the Airport and Ruby Tuesdays,"We needed a place to stay on the first leg of our journey to Puerto Vallarta. We started in Las Vegas and found we could fly cheaper if we flew to Denver first, even paying for a hotel. We chose La Quita DIA because it was close enough to the airport for timing and the price was right. It is on Tower Rd which apparently is full of hotels but we didn't see them because it was dark and rainy (and only 40 degrees!). The hotel has nice rooms, but it seems a bit dated. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was nice. The only issue we had was the shuttle from the airport never arrived to pick us up so we were offered a ride from another hotel that was next door and we walked from that drop off to our hotel. I think the girl at the front desk that night was sick, because she didn't much care we were left at the airport by their shuttle. In the morning the people at the front desk were very friendly and the shuttle was prompt. So I would rate our stay about 3.5.  And go to Ruby Tuesdays - they have late night happy hour and a great bartender.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Horrible. Will not be back!,"Upon check-in was greeted by a surly young man, correction, NOT greeted. I had problems locating my credit card in my purse and there was an awkward silence as I frantically fumbled to finally find (unintentional alliteration) it. I was not told directions to my room or anything, just handed my door card with a blank stare. If you are not a ""people person"" get another job. I'm exhausted and jet-lagged and I don't want to deal with attitude. Arriving in my room I was greeted by a foul odor. I would guess cigarette smoke disguised by air freshener. The window was open so I am sure there was someone smoking in the room before me. There was a WET bathmat on the tub, folded, as if someone had used it and it was just placed back there. Then I noticed a USED piece of soap on the sink. Really?I had to walk down a mile-long hallway to request a change in room. The manager was very nice about accommodating my request. He was the only one I encountered there who had a professional demeanor. The desk clerks need to be replaced. Micah, one of the female clerks, made several of those obnoxious sucking a lemon faces as she had the weighty decision of assigning me a new room. There was a husky, dark-haired girl rolling her eyes in the background. WOW! Upon arrival to my new room I noticed she had placed me directly across from the housekeeping room where there was noise galore! Thanks Micah! This room was a wee bit better but still had a foul smell. The carpets are so dirty you do not want to be walking on them with bare feet. Just when I thought my troubles were over I decided to go get a soda and relax. NOT. The machine would not accept cash though there was the option to do so. So I had to trek back to my room for my credit card. So I put in my credit card, the machine said VENDING and made a great deal of noise to indicate a soda was coming out and >>>> NADA. So, once again, I had to hike up to the lobby. When I told husky dark-haired girl my dilemma she looked at me like I was insane and said she ""Had never heard of that problem happening"", with several skeptical glances between her and Micah. I said, ""Um, believe me, I'm not trying to score a free soda."" She reluctantly produced a form for me to sign and handed me two dollars (wow thanks). I said, ""Well, I just tried to use cash and it didn't work."" Her suggestion was to walk over in the dark to Ruby Tuesdays next door! Wow. I also overhear the clerks making some snide remarks about another guest who had the extreme impudence to ask directions to the elevator! Oh my. So demanding!The good points are - the room was spacious, bed was comfortable, nice big desk with charging station. There was a recliner of questionable cleanliness so I took a pass on using that. There is a microwave and fridge, closet, nice big bathroom. TV was nice but limited channels. There is also an airport shuttle, but the driver from Estes Park Shuttle was nice enough to drop me off at the door. Now HE was a sweetheart!!My husband joined me later and it was all I could do to restrain him from going up to the desk and telling them where to go, but I just wanted us to get in and out of this place as soon as possible with no further incident as he has problems with people who treat me with disrespect. I was so appalled by me experience here that I was moved to write this review before checking out in the morning. Thank goodness we are only here for one night. But one night too many in our opinion!To sum it up: with all the choices of hotels on Tower Road this is not a place we will EVER grace with our presence again! You get what you pay for. Spend a bit more and go elsewhere! And please put the snotty little girl desk clerks where they belong, somewhere where they don't have to deal with people. Housekeeping, perhaps?",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta Inn - by Denver Airport,Staff need to be more kind. Upon arrival seemed we were begging for a room. During my stay I saked for information and the people were displeased to answer. Upon my departure lady spent much time chating with other partners (seemed to be old customers of the hotel) and I had to wait until she gto free. At my check out everything was very fast,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Just ok. Pets stay free. Staff is the highlight of this hotel.,"Our family had two different rooms in this hotel. The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating. The common area where breakfast is located is very attractive, but the breakfast is mediocre for this class of hotel. The rooms were very outdated. I thought that our room was maybe not as nice as other rooms since we were in a pet room, but my daughter's room was the same as ours. The carpet just looked heavily worn and there was some light staining on the bedspreads. The furniture appears old and has a lot of scratches. The only time we noticed traffic noise was early in the morning and even then it was very muffled (our room faced a major road). I also liked that the room had a thermostat which allowed for a fan to run all night (I always need white noise to sleep). This hotel is also an extremely short drive to DIA.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,comfortable bed,"We stayed at La Quinta after a 14 hour day of flying from Europe. The airport shuttle was very timely (allow for 20-30 minutes from airport to hotel). Reception was friendly with a quick check in. The bed was very comfortable, pillow top king, the shower was average, hotel not classy but functional. Skip the breakfast especially if you are coming from Europe or anywhere else in the world where they value good healthy food. Everything was served on polystyrene and plastic which should be a crime with all the waste created. The average american hotel breakfast of sugar bagels, sugar cereal, high fructose spreads, and watered down coffee is a disgrace to the American people. Head 2 doors down to the Marriott for a better coffee and an average breakfast that won't make you sick.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Stay for Business Travel,"Great place to stay and convenient for getting to the airport!

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"UNhelpful, UNfriendly staff","For the THIRD stay now, they vow (after I call oersonally) to give me a downstairs room on the hall closest to Ruby Tuesday (I am disabled so if I want to have dinner r lunch I need that side of hotel or I can not walk the distance t the restaurant) and for the THIRD time after even telling me the exact room they were saving ---gave the room to others and out me so far away I could NOT go eat unless I called a taxi to take me across the street. The check in girls were SO RUDE. Need major attitude adjustments and if this is the same manager that has been there the ast 2 years then HE needs to go back to training. He is a di nothing manager. DONT vow to save a certain room number for a disabled guest, charge for that room, then give that room to some other guest. The MALE front desk clerk that has worked there for a very long time was and is the ONLY good thing about this hotel. Better off going to Staybridge or Holiday Inn which are both close to La Quinta. THIS La Quinta staff (except that male ckerk) are HORRIBLE",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel to be close to the airport.  It is very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff were all helpful and friendly.  The courtyard was very nice and relaxing; there were white tailed bunnies enjoying the plants and watching me. I took plenty of pictures of them. We enjoyed a continental breakfast in the large breakfast area before heading to the airport. We had to return our rental car but there was a shuttle to take us to the airport if needed.  The room was large, clean and very comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great night's sleep but disappointed by dirtiness,"We stayed in room 422 on this trip.  There was some good and some not-so-good this time around.  The room was a nice size, tastefully accessorized, and the bed with comfy with plenty of pillows.  It was nice to have a hair dryer in the bathroom with three speeds instead of the usual lo and high.  Breakfast offerings were typical.  On the negative side, the room door was dirty and covered in fingerprints.  The drawer fronts on the furniture were VERY dirty around the molding.  The fridge was not very cold and we couldn't adjust that, and there was no freezer.  The ice bucket lacked a liner.  One of my pet peeves - the alarm on the clock was set and armed; I learned long ago to check and I was glad I did.  Housekeeping should always ensure the alarm is off so guests don't get an unwelcome surprise, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Also, there should be a ""no cell phone"" policy for front desk staff.  The woman working the desk the morning of checkout was distracted from helping guests as she was focused on her cell phone.  LQ, you can do better.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay before a flight,The hotel staff are friendly and very accommodating to getting us a room for early check-in.

It's affordable, dog friendly, clean and offers all the best amenities like workout facilities and even a 24 hour pool and hot tub! Perhaps best of all is the customer service. Specifically Maggie who was WONDERFUL, very professional and helpful. She went out of her way to make sure our stay was excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Conveninet to Airport,We stayed here to catch an early morning flight out of Denver.  It was very convenient to the airport.  We were returning a rental car so did not use the shuttle from the hotel.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom door was a strange configuration that was very noisy every time you  opened or closed it.  The people around us were very noisy at first but they finally got quiet and we didn't have any trouble sleeping.  Only a few restaurants right around the hotel and they were very crowded.  If you keep going down Tower Rd. into Aurora  (about 10 minutes away)  there were a lot more choices for restaurants and stores.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Convenient, clean and comfortable",Was a great place to take advantage of a park and fly option.  Staff was pleasant and accomodating.  The only problem was with shuttle service from & to the airport.  It was not very prompt in either the pick up or drop off process.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,If you want to Be unhappy stay here,Airport shuttle service the worst! Staff was indifferent to problems. Paint peeling in the bathrooms. Shuttle Had no air conditioning and no windows open and the temperature out side was 89 it was like being in a hot box for or 15 min.,2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Happy stay,I was hesitant to stay with LaQuinta because of a past experience but I am happy to say it has been good experience this time.   The building is fairly new.  The rooms are clean.   Staff is friendly.   Breakfast is average.  Bed comfy.   A little noise and more light than I would like.   But I will no longer rule out staying with LaQuinta.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Quiet DIA stay,"We decided due to our early morning flight to Dallas, we would stay close to the airport. This was our first trip out of DIA even though I had arrived at DIA earlier in the week. I decided that as complicated as the shuttle service was from the rental car place, we took our rental car back the evening before to prevent a delay in the morning and possibly missing our flight. The shuttle service for the hotel is a contract shuttle service, which we found was not very reliable and schedule wise was not always on time based on information from fellow travelers and the staff. The decision was to take an earlier shuttle than we felt we needed, which meant that we would not utilize their breakfast. It was a good decision, because even the earlier shuttle bus was running late by 45 minutes, so with us taking the earlier one we still made it to the airport in time to clear security and make our flight to Dallas. Our room was clean, the bathroom was nice and large as well as the bed was very comfortable with their pillow top mattress. The hotel was convenient to the airport and also was easy to get to the Ruby Tuesday restaurant across the parking lot. Best thing this hotel could do to enhance their image is to start running their own shuttle to the airport and get rid of that contract carrier.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful staff!,"This hotel is your average airport hotel that has a few extra touches that makes it amazing. The shuttle is little to be desired so be on the lookout for that, but that's another company named Western Parking so I won't hold it against La Quinta, when you call the hotel a friendly staff member will inform you that they pick up on the west side of baggage claim outside door 506, island 3, the only reason I remember that is the girl who checked us in repeated it a lot while we were checking in, and even though she kept answering the phone that just kept ringing, we never felt ignored. That's the part that really makes this place outstanding, the staff. First we checked in with Maggie, and she was amazing. She was super busy when we checked in, but she moved that line very fast and didn't rush any of the check ins, she informed each guest of the shuttle schedule and breakfast times even though we heard when the people in front of us were checking in, it made us feel like she cared. Our room was wonderful, the bathroom doors were a little odd,but the room was lovely. We luckily had our swimsuits because their indoor pool and hot tub were amazing, perfect for a late night swim, it's 24 hours so that's awesome. Breakfast was a typical hotel breakfast, nothing fancy, but they have make your own waffles and really yummy muffins. The breakfast clerk was this wonderful lady named Rosa, she did such a great job keeping the breakfast stocked and clean. Checkout was simple and we were checked out by Ray who seems to know his job very well, he was professional and once again we felt like we mattered. I would very much recommended this hotel to anyone traveling in or out of Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay okay but not great...,This LaQuinta is convenient for anyone flying in or out of the airport.  The breakfast was just okay....boring but adequate.  The checkin was slow and the checkout not friendly.  Stain in the room carpet.  The best thing about the hotel is the proximity to the airport and that it is next door to a Ruby Tuesday restaurant.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Average,"Stayed at this hotel 2 nights on arrival from UK before moving on South.The hotel is average at best, swimming pool probably best thing about it.Basic room fairly clean but nothing special considering I paid less at the Hilton on my return. Which incidentally is in a different class altogether.To sum up a basic hotel at a high cost .",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nightmare Shuttle Experience - Management Unaccountable,"This is a very mediocre hotel.  Only reason to stay is for airport.  To that end proper functioning of the shuttle is very important.  During my stay the shuttle was running with 45 minute to 1 hour delay.  Hotel took no responsibility or had any intention to facilitate alternative transportation.Decided to take shuttle well in advance.  When shuttle finally arrived to airport, the magnetic pass to open the gate for commercial vehicles was not functioning.  Driver knew this in advance since he pulled straight to the intercom soliciting airport  personnel to come open the gate.  No one came despite repeated calls.  We were stuck in the bus for 30 minutes --only 150 yards from the airport terminal.  Driver would not let us leave and walk to terminal.  Other commercial vehicles went through gate with no problem.  Finally I had to make a scene threatening to call 911 if we were not let off or someone would come and open the gate.  Only when I did that a solution was found.  Almost lost our flights.I called La Quinta to complain both at the hotel and with customer service.  It was a Sunday and no-one took responsibility.  They indicated they would contact me on Monday.  No-one ever did.The hotel markets itself for having a shuttle but they take no responsibility for it. I understand it is a contracted outsourced service.  Yet they still are responsible for the business they contract to serve their customers.Avoid this hotel and its management at all costs!!!!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,The best La Quinta we have stayed in yet,Since we have dogs we love the La Quinta name but this is the most modern one we have stayed in yet.  The room is great and overlooks the beautiful fenced in courtyard  The most inviting entrance and breakfast area. Would recommend to anyone needing to stay near the Denver Airport.We are actually here to pick up a new dog at the airport and this will be a great place to bond with our new friend.  Thanks again La Quinta,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Dirty bathroom,"We were disappointed in the cleanliness of the bathroom. The floor was dirty when we got to the room. There was a smudged footprint right in the middle of the floor not to mention hair on the floor. The hotel also is in need of new mattresses. It was very soft. On the positive, the front desk personnel was wonderful. Location was wonderful. Our room was a complementary room as we had stayed at a different La Quinta and had an even worse experience so I think we are just going to avoid the chain. We aren't fussy and can overlook a lot but dirty bathrooms are unacceptable.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Standard airport hotel - good for a night,"Stayed here with my family on the night before heading home from vacation.  The girl at the front desk was alone, but was moving fast in helping guests.Room was clean, bed was comfortable and the shower had good pressure with lots of hot water.Across the parking lot is a Ruby Tuesday so there is a decent restuarant just a few minutes walk.  The morning breakfast was a little simple, but I am always happy when there is yogurt and a waffle maker...there was!The shuttle was running on time although our senior driver did not appear to be happy that he was working but he nonetheless provided good info about the airport construction.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very disappointed,"We needed a place close to the airport. After reading reviews and checking prices, I chose this hotel. We checked in fairly late in the evening (9:30-10 PM). There was only 1 person working the desk so we had to wait a few minutes while she helped another customer. The lobby appeared okay, reasonably clean. Our room was another story. The carpet was old, torn and stained. There was urine spattered on the toilet. I called the front desk about that, and she offered to either clean the toilet for us or change our room. I opted to have the toilet cleaned. She came up immediately and cleaned it. What I didn't realize was that it was the front desk employee, so while she cleaned our toilet, there was no one at the front desk. Our room was close to the stairs, and we heard the door opening and closing all night. There was about a 1 inch space between the bottom of our door and the floor, so no noise reduction there. We were also close to the breakfast area. Our room smelled like bacon when we arrived, and we could smell burned toast the next morning. The TV dish signal was controlled by the same switch that turned on one of the lights in the room, and there was no way to turn off that light without losing the TV signal. I could go on, but I think you get the point. I was extremely disappointed. I wish I had spent a little more money and stayed somewhere else. The other tripadvisor reviews didn't prepare me for this!",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Transit Stay,"Stayed here during my visit to US, had to catch a flight to Omaha got a transit stay here in the hotel.Its decent hotel near to the airport with good staff and good for accommodation. You have only one restaurant near the hotel. It maintains the La quinta tradition, good for short stay. Good Breakfast available.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,So stressful,"When we checked in, everyone was awesome and it was quick and our room was ready to go. The rooms are actually pretty nice and the hotel itself is nice. If you take a short walk from the hotel, you can see mountains which was really cool. However, this was probably the most stressful weekend I've ever had. In our bathroom, someone forgot to flush, and it wasn't pee. Also, we started seeing a few bugs in our room. And the biggest issue I had was when house keeping came to clean the room. A maid accidentally (I honestly think it was an accident, not on purpose) took my swimsuit bottoms that were hanging up behind a towel. I told the front desk about it, they told me they'd look for it and call my room. No one ever called so I had to go back to the front desk and they said they couldn't find it but they'd ship it to me. And then she went on to say that she didn't have a key to unlock some office even though my swimsuit was most likely in the laundry and you walk by the open laundry room every time you walk to the pool. On the last day of our stay I checked one last time to see if it had turned up and the person at the desk told me he would check. I never heard anything. As we were leaving, I asked AGAIN and the guy at the front desk told me the girl that cleaned my room wasn't working so there was no way to know what happened to it. Apparently no one is capable of checking the laundry, WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. I would have gladly gone and checked myself. He still offered to ship my bottoms to me, which no one can find. I asked him what happens if they can't find them and there's nothing to ship and he said he has no idea what to do. It sounds stupid to make such a big deal about a swimsuit but it's just the lack of effort the whole staff put into at least TRYING to help me. I will not stay here again. I'm back home now and I'm still trying to get this stupid hotel to help me.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Nice,clean and neat rooms.","I've stayed in this hotel several times. The rooms are always in great condition and clean. The room has a minifridge, coffee machine and a small tv but it's everything I need for 1 night before heading to the airport. The swimming pool and hot tub it's a plus. I usually leave before breakfast time so I can't say anything about it.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great location near airport,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights twice at the beginning and end of our two week vacation.  Even though this property is considered to be an airport location, it is still about nine miles from the airport so there is no jet noise.  The shuttle is very convenient and is available every half hour beginning at 3:30 am!  There are multiple, secure entrances to the parking lot.  Ruby Tuesdays is located next to the property which was very convenient when we turned our car in before our last night.  Other restaurants are available further down Tower Road as this area continues to develop as a bedroom and business community.  The breakfast included make your own waffles.  My only complaint about the rooms were the French Doors for the bathroom and the loud, power flush toilets.  Not only could I hear when our neighbors flushed, I could hear the toilets being flushed above and below us.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Family Reunion,"Perfect location and services for our family to gather because it was close to the airport and a lovely place to stay, including breakfast in the morning.  We had our farm meeting in the gazebo by the swimming pool.  Ideal!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great stay in convenient location,"This hotel was extremely well priced, convenient to the airport (they have a shuttle), clean, wonderful staff, easy check in/check out, and the room was great. I would recommend LaQuinta to anyone. They are pet friendly and the continental breakfast is varied, fresh, and satisfying.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,GREAT STAFF,"There is no question that the staff at la Quinta in Denver, made our stay extremely enjoyable. The room was large and clean, the bed very comfortable.  I am not a breakfast person so I would not be a good judge.   When the shuttle failed to pick us up at the airport, we took a taxi and were reimbursed immediately by the front desk manager.  Overall, our experience at La Quinta was excellent.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good stay.,"Folks are friendly and helpful. Priced just right and near airport. Across street is a good American cuisine restaurant.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Another great stay and park,"Had another great stay at this hotel on Tower Road. The hotel is clean and offers a 24 hour shuttle to the airport. There is breakfast in the morning, but we left too early for the airport to enjoy it. We would highly recommend this hotel if flying out of DIA and want to leave your car during your trip.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not impressed,"One pillow clearly had not been changed, stunk of perfume. Very late check in, 11:00 pm then 4:00 am out, so threw it on the floor checked the rest and went to sleep.  Flew back into Denver after a week on vacation, have been waiting for the shuttle now for well over an  hour. Were told almost an hour ago it would be about 10 minutes! ! Ridiculous!  Won't use again .",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,overnight stay,"Chose LaQuinta because saw commercials on tv and liked the look of the place.  Shuttle bus from Airport was like riding in a bucket of nuts and bolts.  Checked in and went right to sleep after long night and early flight in the morning.  Yikes, the sheets were dirty from whomever stayed before us.  Ewwwww, gross!!! Reported the situation to the clerk at the front desk.  She said she would let housekeeping know and they will do a better job in the future. Took the morning shuttle to airport and it stopped at 3 other hotels before heading to airport.  Will never stay at a LaQuinta again.  Their advertisements are deceiving.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Easy access to Airport and rental car return,"We stayed here the night before our flight out of Denver. It was on Hotel row close to the airport and car rental return. It was clean and comfortable. Back elevator was not working so a bit of a hassle to park walk upfront and then take elevator up to our floor. Other than that no complaints. Beds were comfortable, staff was friendly, location was good.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Incredible,"We're still here. Tonight I put ""no disturb"" out of door to hope other not disturb us. This morning at 10 am we go out and told reception room ready to housekeeping. At 4 pm we return in room and no house keeping was made. Many time I asked to have house keeping and still no precision of time. Worst service: never in my life (and I travel many times yearly) happen this. I'll never lodge in La Quinta Inn in the future!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Warning -- Non-Smoking Doesn't Mean Non-Smoking,"Got stuck in Denver with my family (wife plus kids 7,4,2) on Saturday night due to a cancelled flight.   Was able to grab a room via Hotels.com before everything started booking up.   Got into our room (#339) and was overwhelmed by the obvious fact that this was a smoking room, even though hotel is listed as non-smoking.   Called front desk and was told ""This was a former smoking room, but it's non-smoking now.   Sorry, no other rooms available.""  Terrible.   Clearly they haven't done anything substantial to try to remove that horrible odor/stench.    Sleeping on the floor at the airport may have been better.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pay the Extra $10 for Holiday Inn,"I had a very unfortunate experience at La Quinta Inn. We went to La Quinta Inn for the day before our evening flight, assuming we would be able to take the shuttle service to the airport. The shuttle (advertised as running every 20 minutes) came 35 minutes late. All the while, the surrounding hotels had shuttles coming regularly. The concierge desk had no information regarding the shuttle and kept telling us it was ""five minutes away."" Once the shuttle arrived, it had a malfunctioning scan card, so we sat outside the airport commercial vehicle entrance for TWENTY MINUTES waiting for airport security to scan us in. The driver said that the scan card had been broken for a few days. I can only imagine how many people missed their flights. When all was said and done, it took over…",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,awfull,"We called this hotel from the airport to check availability and the rude women who picked up the phone, wasn’t able to understand me, (I’m not American, but it’s the first time in my life I have problem with language), so she said there were enough room and that a booking was no needed.  Once we got off from the minivan transfer I had the idea to run to be the first in line: That was a great idea, since the rude black concierge woman screamed at me that I was very lucky since that was the last room! (at the same time, the other woman picked up several times the phone saying there were rooms available….). When I asked the price, she replied “240 $”! I said that I had just called form the airport and the price was 140. She screamed even louder saying: “Ehy man, take or leave it!” …",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good Stay,"For the price and location, this is a good choice.  Really enjoyed a totally non-smoking property. Breakfast ends a little early at 9am. Apparently lots of others agree as there were people from all over the US and some from foreign countries.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good start to a great trip,"We flew into DEN, and stayed at this hotel. I had a hassle making 3 nights stay into 2 (?), so we were upgraded to a suite. Good customer service, great free breakfast, nice grounds near the airport. King bed and sleeper were good. Wife found a live round bullet near the sleeper sofa ( so much for housekeeping ). Otherwise, would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Disappointed,"We encountered abrupt clerks, broken baggage cart, dirty bathroom, small filthy elevator, misleading information on booking website. Location to airport great but the rest if the experience way below par. ",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Stay,"We usually stay here as we travel in from overseas when coming on Summer vacation. We recently had an upgraded room and while the room was clean and bigger in size the location was terrible, directly over the reception and breakfast/lounge area. There are many early morning travelers so it gets very noisy and we could hear families and babies crying. Otherwise the hotel is a good place to stay, beds are good (exception the couch beds, my daughter complained about the springs) Do take care when taking the airport shuttle as they have changed their route and now go pickup folks at several other hotels. Newly outsourced shuttle provider and it takes a good 30 minutes to the airport.  The reception folks are helpful and friendly every time we have stayed there. My only complaint was…",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A great overnight stay near airport,"My daughter and I were flying in to Denver to meet up with my son and husband who were finishing up a week long camp nearby.  My husband told me the front desk staff was very helpful when he and my son arrived before us and helped them locate a Laundromat nearby so they could wash all their camp clothes.  The shuttle to the hotel was convenient and we were the first stop on the route.  I had called the hotel front desk when we were at baggage pickup and they directed me where to meet the shuttle and how soon it would be there.  The hotel room was clean, comfortable, quiet, and spacious.   We met friends for brunch so didn't eat the breakfast at the hotel.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Just what we needed.,We had a flight out the next day. Shuttle runs 24 hours. Front desk was so friendly! I didn't have time to use all the amenities but it seemed like a great place to spend some time. Stayed in a suite.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful stay,"When traveling to Denver I usually stay at the Doubletree hotel near downtown so I actually was not looking forward to staying at a La Quinta to be honest.....yes I know such a snob but also my inner fatty loves the unlimited availability to walking down and getting those warm, gooey and addictive chocolate chip cookies! Ok, ok getting off track here. After reading some of the reviews online about pot smokers and fire alarms I was mortified to be staying here and almost called my boss to have her change my hotel location; I refrained you snob hunters out there and I am so glad I did!   When checking in, the lobby was very clean, extremely quiet, as was the hotel 95% of my stay, nicely open and it was easy for anyone to see where they could get their continental breakfast, which…",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice airport overnight,The girl at the front desk was very bubbly and happy when we checked in .

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A Great One Night Stay,"I checked in here after missing my flight out of DIA because of the traffic coming out of the mountains.  I was here on business and after a very long day of work, and a three hour drive I just wanted to get a comfortable room until my flight in the morning.  I arrived at this hotel and while overall it was extrememly nice and pretty, the front desk staff that evening was not great with the customer service.  I needed some help with the shuttle info for returning my rental car and getting to the airport and while I got the info, it seemed to be too much work for the front desk gal who was working that night. My room was very large, clean and comfortable.  Just what I needed at the end of the long day although I was missing my Elite member gift even though I was assured it was left in my room. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it.",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Rocky Mountain High, Rating Low!","The pot smokers stunk up the hotel hallways. We saw then smoking openly in the parking lot.   Stayed the night before flight and we exited our rooms twice for fire alarms attributed to pipes breaking.  I bet it was all the pot hitting the smoke detectors.  When we evacuated, not one employee came out to tell us what was going on or when it was safe to return.  We assumed it was okay when the fire trucks left.  We voiced concerns and all they said was thank you.  When we came back on the return flight, pot smokers again. It sounded like people were running up and down the halls all night. A bed was pulled into the hallway further down from us and standing on its side.  I think that would be a safety issue.   I am pretty sure that the pot laws in Colorado do not violate my rights to clean air. This was my first and last experiences at La Quinta.  I might just write off the entire state of Colorado.  Use your amazing revenues from the pot to patrol hotels so decent people can take trips.  Long black hair in bath tub.  Smelly towels.  Cracked sink.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Worst LQ ever!,"Three rooms booked 8 weeks ahead - asked for rooms to be close to each other.  They were on three different floors at opposite ends of the building.  ..and the desk staff said they were 'just around the corner.'  Ice machines out, elevator down for some of the town.  Most LQ's have some eggs and/or biscuits and gravy-- all they had were boiled eggs.  And when I returned home, instead of charges for two nights total - I had charges for four nights.  Spent one trip at beginning of trip and one at end of trip - once again requested close rooms for second night.  These people have zero customer service or understanding.",1

Great customer service as 50 percent off the room.  Bed and pillows could use updating, but the room was large with king bed and a pull out.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Wonderful stop as alway,We have stayed here several times and this hotel has consistently been well staffed and well maintained.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  Breakfast is always consistent and items are continuously restocked. The only negative about this hotel (and some other La Quintas) is the poor quality of their gym equipment. It is some off hotel brand that is shaky and not worth the effort. A disappointment for someone who works out every day.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,My stay at La quinta,"Ive always loved staying at this hotel but this past weekend there was dogs in room next to me barking throughout the night and then housekeeping was opening my door at 8am yelling ""Housekeeping!"" and woke us up. Front desk staff very friendly when checking in and checking out.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Again a nice stay,"Stayed here for one night before a driving tour, nice clean hotel, we had a room with a king sized bed very comfortable.  The free shuttle bus was very convenient and arrived on time both times we used it. This is the second time we have stayed here and would stay again if ever in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A relaxing end to a long trip.,We stopped here purely for the convenience of DIA and dropping a hire car off. This worked like a dream and the hotel was beyond what we expected. Large and relaxing rooms and a good shuttle service to the airport. The bonus of being able to walk out to the restaurant next door made the stay even more pleasurable.c,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good hotel but need better maintenance,"We came to this location whenever we come to Denver.  It is at a very good location, nice rooms, nice service, nice swimming pool...  However, this time we found the exercise room with water damage on the carpet, one wall panel was removed with obvious water and mold damages.  We were there for 3 days and nothing was done at all even though the front desk staff assured us that it is being taken care off pronto...  It should have been taken out of use for sure.  The door to the swimming pool would not open with the room access card.  We had to try several times.We are unsure if we would come back the next time if the property is not maintained properly",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,We would stay here again.,The hotel was clean and the bed was quite comfortable. The fitness room was very small but it served its purpose. We used the swimming pool and hot tub and I was impressed on how clean they both were and the area around it was also very clean. The breakfast was very simple but it is what we expected. The lady tending to the breakfast area was very nice and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed for breakfast. (I can not remember her name.) The only negative I have for this hotel was the shuttle service to the hotel. It was late getting to the airport to pick us up and there were so many people on it we really should have had two. The shuttle got into an accident on the way to the hotel but I am really not sure who's fault it was. The driver was on his phone a lot which made a lot of us quite nervous that he was not paying full attention to the road. Other then that the actual hotel was nice and very clean. My husband and I would stay here again.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,excellent value,I made last minute reservations at this hotel due to an unexpected cancellation of a flight out of the airport. I chose this location because of the convenience of easy shuttle service from and to the airport. This turned out to be exactly what I had hoped for. The room was clean and comfortable. The positive hotel experience helped to make up for a disappointing airline experience. Thank you to La Quintana.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Average is okay,"It's La Quinta -- you're not at the Ritz. That said, the rooms are roomy and clean. The woman at the front desk when we checked in was quite efficient, friendly and helpful for all our requests. Any of the Tower Road hotels are convenient to DIA and provide regular shuttle service -- I haven't stayed at the others for comparison, but La Quinta is excellent for the pre- or post-overnight with quick access to the airport. Not a destination hotel, but should serve business travelers well. Probably would serve well for travelling families, too, and there did seem to be a number of families in the hotel.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great experience thanks to Maggie,"Maggie helped my wife and I out when we were in a terrible situation.  She was kind, caring, and extremely helpful.  I cannot thank her enough for her assistance after we arrived at 1am without a reservation.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Comfortable Hotel Close to Denver Airport,"This hotel was comfortable and convenient. It also met some of my more obscure standards. For instance, the room had a recliner which is much more comfortable than watching TV in a hard chair or propping yourself up with all the pillows in the bed. The work desk was not against a wall, so it was easy to work at the desk and watch TV (which swiveled enough to make that convenient). There is a nice courtyard with benches and a gazebo to sit outside. Dining options are as close as across the street as well as within a few miles, as is shopping. You are only about 5 minutes from the Denver airport rental car return facilities. Breakfast was OK. I would definitely stay here again.",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Acceptable eventually,"We arrived at this La Q at the end of April after travelling for 24 hours. It was very cold in Denver, about 30F outside in the wind, so we were glad to get inside with our luggage. The young lady on the desk was not really customer focussed, and booked us into a room on floor 2.  When we entered the room, it was cold, and the air con was sucking in a freezing atmosphere. We asked the desk how to set it to heat and was told that it would take 15 mins or so.No heat appeared, so they sent up the handyman.  He re-set it and said to leave it for some more time. Still no heat, so the handyman returned, and realised that it was not working.  The desk was not very helpful so the handyman went downstairs, changed the room and returned with the  new key. He then helped us to move our luggage some way down the corridor and checked that heating was effective.By that time, we were an hour later getting to bed and totally exhausted but we did get some sleep.  In the morning, we went down to breakfast, coffee was weak and tasteless, and the rest was basic.There was a different young lady on the desk, very apologetic, helpful, and reduced our bill by $20 or so. She was  so  much better focussed than the previous night's clerk, when we think, we only got a usable room, thanks to the handyman.  He was there at the desk in the morning and enquired how we had slept and wished us a good trip. A man with good customer relations!!So I hope that if you go there in a cold period, you get a room that has some heating!Overall, this hotel is ok, but soon will need some refreshing as it is well used.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Another Good stay at a La Quinta,"Another nice stay at a La Quinta.  This hotel was well cared for and we enjoyed our stay.  The Breakfast is only average or a little below what you would like to have, but typical for a La Quinta.  The hotel did have a nice pool.  The hotel had two elevators, and one was broken.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Horrendous!!!,"We stayed at the La Quinta Inn @ Denver International Airport (Tower Rd) for one night. I was hesitant to even book the room after reading all the negative feedback from fellow travelers on TripAdvisor. I should have taken their advise. The only person that deserves kudos at this hotel was a young lady by the name of Leigh. She was very courteous and helpful. After checking-in with her, the customer service from that point went absolutely downhill. There were 2 ladies in the evening working behind the counter that cared more about what they were having for dinner then helping us out as we were right in front of their face. When checking out early this morning, a young man saw us coming up and he headed straight to the back of the front desk and softly said ""I will be right back"". After 5-7 minutes he came back and said ""how can I help you""? I promptly said we need to check out b/c we have a flight to catch. He took our room cards and not once did he apologize for the wait or how our stay was. I asked about the hotel shuttle and he said ""just go outside"". Our flight was scheduled to leave at 530am and we were outside of the hotel at 3:40am thinking this was enough time considering the hotel was only 7 minutes away from the airport. The shuttle bus driver was chatting outside with the security guard and saw us waiting. After a few minutes he came up to us and said ""I can only leave at 4am"". Never did he mention that he had to pick up customers at 3 other hotels!!! If I knew this was the case I would have called a cab. Needless to say we didn't get to the airport until 4:45am. We barely made it on our flight by running after clearing the security line. I understand the airport shuttle is a complimentary service but it would have been nice if someone along the way mentioned something about the other stops or ""planned times"" the shuttle leaves. This was one of the main reasons I booked a room here. I also forgot to mention how the walls in the rooms are ridiculously thin (you can hear everything your neighbor and people in the hallway have to say). Anytime someone flushes the toilet or turns on the sink you can hear that as well. I will for the life of me never ever stay at a La Quinta Inn after this last encounter. This piss poor service literally put my wife into tears after we almost missed our flight!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Place:),"La Quinta and this hotel in particular has allowed our family to travel with our small dog. They have been clean, priced right, and the staff has always been pleasant and helpful. There breakfast with the waffle maker and and other staples are well stocked and organized. This is a nice place, although it is getting a little worn, but still very comfortable.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Adequate for easy hop to airport,"This hotel have a very efficient shuttle service to DIA, and is one of the most reasonable in the area. However, do not expect anything special. The place is clean, the staff is very helpful, and there is a great view of the Colorado Rockies, but the furnishings are a bit worn & dated.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Brilliant for business,"I have used this hotel to hold my twice yearly sales meetings for the last few years & have no intention of going elsewhere. The rooms are nice, the staff (especially John the business manager) are incredibly helpful & the value for money is great. We'll be back in November!!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great For Going to the Airport,"I had been in the car driving from Kentucky to Denver where my mom was going to get on a plane and go home, while i kept on my cross country trip. All the employees were nice and helpful.It is very clean and the area it is looks like new developments. My mom had no problem printing off her boarding pass, getting the shuttle very early in the morning, and making it to the airport with ease. Which was our goal. I will say, it is far away from downtown.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pleasant surprise,My husband is a Veteran so I have a Military ID. Called LQ and got the Military discount. When I got to LQ they had upgraded my room to a suite because it was Memorial Day. The room was great!WOW what a surprise Thank you  LQ,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not my favorite!,I was disappointed in the LaQuinta Inn near Denver airport. I could hear people flushing their toilets in the next room and even heard their TV at night. Didn't think it was all that clean either. The breakfast was so-so.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Value,"Stayed a week for business, bed was comfortable, staff was great. The only complaint I have is the breakfast was more ""continental"" than ""full"" but the quality there was good as well. Easy access to the airport and less than 30 minutes to downtown Denver (if the traffic cooperates)",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Very disappointed!,"My husband and I reserved a room for 4 nights on Memorial weekend at this hotel. At first I was pleased with the room because it was clean and appeared to be very comfortable. Our first night went without incident but breakfast on Friday morning sucked. We were served boiled eggs, stale bagels, stale muffins, stale raisin bran cereal and the coffee tasted like dirty water. We avoided breakfast at the hotel for the rest of the weekend. This is supposed to be a completely smoke free hotel but we smelled marijuana smoke in the hall ways and coming through our air conditioning unit and not just once or twice but consistently throughout the day and evening every day we were there and were told by the cleaning ladies that there was nothing they could do about it. The lock at the back door entrance and elevator that were closest to our room were not functioning. The iron was coated with sticky black stuff and I even called ahead to make sure we had one that worked in our room. We managed to get some extra clean washrags and towels which were later removed by the cleaning staff and when we called the front desk for more the gentleman working the desk named Michael was very rude. We rotated around the room trying all of the electrical outlets and they did not accommodate our phone charger for some reason so we were never able to get a full charge on our phones. We will never stay here again know that there are other La Quinta options in the area. The staff at this particular La Quinta were very rude and disorderly.  The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is that the room and bathroom were clean and I have definitely stayed in worse. And I almost forgot the bed and pillows were terrible, my whole body was stiff every morning.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Stay,"This hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was also fresh and there was a nice selection and a quick shuttle in the morning to get to the hotel.  Improvements, shuttle speed at night from the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place to stay!,I stay at this location of La Quinta whenever I have to fly. Their park and fly rate is very reasonable. I am usually traveling alone and always feel very safe there and my car has always been very safe there. The rooms are clean and well appointed and very comfortable.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,nice airport hotel,"Stayed here the night we flew into Denver and the night before we flew home.  Made our life relaxing and comfortable.  Nice breakfast, pool, hot tub and small gym. Would stay here every time we go to Denver...Great vacation destination",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good mid range chain motel with good free breakfast,"This motel, just by Denver Airport, is pretty much all you could wish for if you just wanted a place to lay your head for a night or two. The rooms are a good size, the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are clean and the free breakfast is a good continental breakfast with cereals, breads, boiled eggs, waffles, muffins, fruit, fruit juices and hot drinks. Just be a little careful if you want to use the free airport shuttle - this should run every half hour but doesn't always and we met people who had waited over an hour at the airport for the bus to arrive. Also be aware that the shuttle bus is not exclusive to La Quinta and serves several local motels etc so you may get a motel tour en route. The shuttle that we had was a very large bus which was difficult to get in and out of with large cases too. It should be remembered, however, that the shuttle is free and is a useful service offered by La Quinta. All in all, a perfectly acceptable experience although I did complain to reception about our bottom sheet being stained - fully laundered but stained.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Meets all your basic needs at a reasonable price,"We spent 2 nights here in mid-May, although we originally were only booked for 2 nights because of an unexpected snowstorm which precluded us from going to the Rockies. Upon check in we were greeted courteously by a helpful clerk.  We had a clean large king executive room on the 2nd floor which had a mini fridge, coffeemaker (with coffee), microwave, desk with several outlets, and pretty good internet. There is also a computer you can use near the lobby if you don't have internet access with you. I suspect you can print boarding passes there, too.  The hotel offers a free shuttle to and from the airport 7-8 miles away, but we had a rental car so cannot say how reliable it is. The parking for our car at the hotel was free. The hotel has a nice courtyard on one side of the building (I asked for a quiet location and got it) and is located in an area where there are several other hotels. As with all La Quintas, dogs are permitted for no extra charge and if you have one (ours wasn't with us this trip), there appears to be plenty of grassy areas for taking them out. There is a pool/hot tub area that looks ok, although I did not try it.  There is a small fitness room which I did use with limited equipment,  but at least it's something.  The breakfast was just fine with several fast options, and I saw they had 24 hour coffee, tea, and hot chocolate (which was great for our snowy day).      We arrived late the first night and were able to walk right next door to Ruby Tuesdays for a good dinner (I even brought Ruby Tuesday discount coupons with me since I saw beforehand they were close by).  The second night we walked (in the snow) about .4 mile down the road to a bar called Vinny's which had some reasonably priced and tasty pub food to eat with a delicious beer. I would stay here again if I needed a hotel near the Denver airport as it has everything one should need for a short stay. I did feel safe outside walking to/from the restaurants, too.  There's not really much else in the area, though. The best rate I found for this hotel, after checking all of them was the AARP rate, even better than AAA, so be sure and check around for the cheapest option.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Bait and Switch,"I had a confirmed late arrival reservation at the La Quinta Inn & Suites at DIA.  When I arrived, the front desk was unable to locate this reservation.  I showed the front desk my email reservation confirmation - he refused to honor it.  Finally after almost 2 hours, Expedia was able to fax him my confirmed reservation which he finally honored.  Unfortunately that was not the end of the problems with this hotel.  I booked and paid in advance for a two double bed room.  In a classic bait and switch,  La Quinta Inn & Suites at DIA would only provide me with a King bed and a lumpy sofa pullout bed.  The front desk advised that I could take this or leave it - unfortunately by now it was 1 AM and I had already paid for the room thru Expedia.  The room was not clean, had a musty odor and was next to the very noisy elevator.  I will never stay with La Quinta again.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pleasant experience,"Clean, spacious room, exceptionally friendly staff, great bed, nice breakfast served beginning at 5:00 a.m.  No meat was offered which would have made a great breakfast.  We have stayed at this hotel three times in the last 12 months and look forward to another stay soon.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Hotel Good when traveling with pets,We stayed 3 nights in one of the larger suites. There is plenty of room to spread out. Bed was clean and comfortable. Had nice sink and bar area in the living area so is nice. Bathroom is very large and has additional sink area outside the main bath so 2 people can be getting ready without interferring with each other.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good enough,"This is a nice LaQ, perfectly situated for airline travel to/from DIA. Lobby & breakfast room are nice & there's a lovely, small courtyard that makes a lot of difference. Room was clean & spacious; everything worked well & the bed was comfortable. The breakfast was awful & horribly not healthy, which is pretty standard. (If hotels like this would offer healthier, more real food, I & millions like me would patronize them even more.) I will stay there again, tho, next time I have to fly. And, as always, we commend LaQuinta for the fairest, most intelligent pet policy in the business.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,great place,"pretty nice place to stay.  Rooms are pretty open and clean.  Shuttle to airport was great.  will definately stay here again. They said that the breakfast started at 6 am, but on both mornings that we left one time at 4am and the other @ 5am they had food and supplies out already.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place,Staff always great.  Any special room request is always honored.  We stay here frequently because we have to drive to DIA from Wyoming - and will stay before or after our trip depending on flight times.  Very convenient - has airport shuttle - you can park there also.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Decent choice near DIA,We chose this hotel because it was the cheapest option near DIA. We were satisfied. Room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was acceptable. Really my only criticism was that the walls are thin and you heard a lot of noise from the hall and the adjoining rooms.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,slow pickup from airport; breakfast boring,"The pickup from Denver airport took forever. We waited about 1/2 hour on the east side, then the shuttle took forever to also visit the west side (probably due to construction).  The room was stuffy but I couldn't get the fan to stay on for more than a few minutes at a time. It is always nice when one can set for a fan without heat or air conditioning.  There was a fair amount of noise that came in through the door and we could hear every little noise from the bathroom next-door. Breakfast was boring; some fruit and more cereal selections would have been nice.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Don't rely on the shuttle,"We were just passing through Denver to get home.  We called the hotel & asked for the shuttle & we're advised it would be there in 10 minutes.  We waited & called 2 more times before the shuttle driver showed up 30 minutes later.  The rooms were nice.  Very well kept & nice location close to the airport.  Breakfast was fine for us with cereal, waffles, fruit, yogurt, etc.  We had a 9:50 am flight the next morning.  I called the front desk & asked what time the shuttle would come & was advised 8:30 am.  The shuttle did not arrive until 9 am plus we still needed to get to the airport & thru security.  Luckily we RAN & made our flight just as they were getting ready to shut the door.  So, I would not rely on the shuttle service or go 2-3 hours early to the airport.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Super Value,"This is the perfect hotel for laying over before a flight out of Denver airport.  Great price, very clean, a morning breakfast and a shuttle to the airport. Just be aware there is no restaurant or bar in the hotel but there is one next door.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Overnight Stay - Great stop,"My wife and I were passing through Denver on our travels and wanted a quick, cheap, and quality spot to stay.  We have been consistently pleased with La Quinta lately and this one was no different.   We were greeted and taken care of quickly at the front desk (also friendly).  This was great because we were REALLY tired.  The room was very clean and tidy.  The bed was incredibly comfortable...much more so than what I was expecting.  Great night's sleep with a decent breakfast (waffles, fruit, yogurt, muffins, etc.) The next morning on our way out.  Would highly recommend...and we will definitely be staying here our next time through.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A Great Stay,"We stayed here one night, as we had early flights the next morning.  This hotel is new, fresh and well appointed.  The staff is very nice and friendly.  The location is great, with free shuttle service to the airport.  The rooms are quiet with a nice design.  Only complaint is that, while visually attractive, the french-type doors on the bathroom do not provide enough privacy.  Nice standard continental breakfast, which is available from 5 AM, nice for early morning flights.  Everything about this hotel was fresh, clean and new.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Location,"The location is great for spending the night & getting to the airport.  Restaurant next door that has good food.  It's clean, comfortable, good van service to the airport, & breakfast.  Has wifi also.  Have used this location for many years and always great.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta by Airport,"We  have stayed here 3 time now and have not been disappointed.  I did forget to ask this last time if our room had a microwave & refrigerator, I just assumed there all did and there do not. It was ok we were only staying for the night, but if I was going to be there longer I would have liked one, the last time we had them.  The breakfast has always been good, we did not get to eat this time around.  Service has always been good, and we love that we can rent a car next door and cheaper than at the airport and this place will bring us to and from the airport, so much easier than renting a car at the airport rent a car places. Enterprise is at the hotel across the street.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta Hotel Review,My husband and I stayed at the La Quinta on Tower Road near the Denver Airport.     Was surprised at how nice the whole area was being so close to the airport.    Airport shuttle ran every 30 minutes and got to the airport within 15 minutes with no hassles.      Hotel close to nice restaurants and chain stores.  Comfortable and safe for women traveling alone.     Staff was the friendliest and most helpful of any of the La Quinta we have ever stayed.   We travel a lot with our dogs and love their dog friendly policy (no charge).     This time we didn't have our dogs and could have stayed at other hotels in the area for less but knew we would get a  good room and nice accommodations so we decided to once again stay with them.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great place,"We had a wonderful stay. When we got there they forgot about our dog so they didn't have our room available. They upgraded us to a suite at no charge. Very nice room. They had no problem with our pitbull mix. Clean, plenty of towels, comfortable bed. Hot tub and pool large and opened 24 hrs. Pool was warm and empty so we were lucky enough to get it to our self, both times we went swimming. Will definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,comfortable stay,"This hotel provided a clean, comfortable stay.  A mini frig or microwave would have made this more comfortable.  The desk attendant was very friendly and attentive.    The amenities (pool, exercise room was clean).   The breakfast was OK.  They can improve the menu",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great comfort at a budget price,"Needed a hotel for one night before flying home the next day, and as it turned out spent all afternoon in the room as well as the night. Room is clean, comfortable, and roomy. Great desk for working, spacious bathroom, and includes a modest breakfast.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Huge Room was Clean and Fresh,"Spacious room was clean, cheerful & fresh-smelling.  Bed very comfy.  Lots of good TV channels.  Fridge & microwave in room.  Extra towels in BR which was BRIGHT and big enough for 2 people to get ready in the morning!  Beautiful grounds for a walk.  Pool & jacuzzi awesome.  Need improvement: A/C fan a bit noisy; room temp challenging to get 'just right'; and more plugs needed by nightstands for overnight charging of cell phones without unplugging the lamp, etc.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Stay N Go,"We used this hotel for the Stay N Go airport parking feature, and used their shuttle for transportation to and from the airport.  All worked very smoothly.  We appreciated that the first night, when we stayed at La Quinta, the parking was included, so the Stay N Go days started the day we actually left.  The shuttle drivers were very helpful and the return driver took us to our vehicle and helped with the luggage.  Our shuttle left before the official breakfast time, but they already had some beverages and fruit available.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Nice airport hotel, nearby restaurant","Nice hotel. Good free airport shuttle operates every half-hour, in conjunction with other area hotels. Good local Italian restaurant within walking distance (DiCicco). Front staff very friendly and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent for Nebraskans,Living in western Nebraska or anywhere 3+ hours for Denver International Airppro and need an overnight hotel that makes an early morning departure sensible and also bundles on site parking while you're out-of-town that this is the ONE. Excellent! Thank you.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Average Airport Hotel,"Nothing bad about this hotel, but there was nothing special about it either. We only stayed one  night in a trip along the Front Range of Colorado, and we would probably not want to spend any more than that. It was a pretty clean place, but beds were worn-out and the walls were pretty thin. There also is no refrigerator in room, so be aware of that. Breakfast choices were also pretty limited compared to other comparably priced hotels with no hot items! Wi-Fi was also pretty slow, but you can always count on an HD TV with many channels at La Quinta. Overall, an average hotel with no huge drawbacks, but in need of small changes to make the stay more comfortable.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,hit and miss,"We arrived before check in and they gave us a room-hitThe room was funky.  Updated in some regards, and not in others-hit and missReally, the bathroom was just odd.  A weird double door that was more like a closet door and you could see through the crack where the door met.  Awkward being that our young adult sons shared our room.  The yellow, plastic shower curtain and tile were odd as well.-missThe beds were pretty awful.  Not the worst we have slept in, but far from the best.-missVery clean-hitVery quiet-hitElevator at our end of the hall wasn't working at check-out-missJenna was excellent at check in and check out-hitBreakfast was free-hitCoffee was hot-hitHeated indoor pool and hot pool-hitLocation was a miss for us-very far from any thing BUT the airport.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Review,"I love that we were able to bring our dog. However the  walls were really thin so we could here alot of noise. The pool and hot tub was great, service was good, food was good. There are no Microwaves or fride in rooms.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good Value at Denver Airport,"This La Quinta is only about 10 mins from the Denver airport and free shuttle service is provided (make sure you tip them - $5 seems to be the usual) every 20 minutes.  Rooms are spacious, quiet and very clean.  The staff was very helpful.  I didn't get to try the breakfast since I had a 6AM flight but I heard from other guests that it was very good.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,At least the bed was amazing!,"I’m so frustrated with my stay that I’m reviewing it on my last night here.I’ll start with the good points: the bed was amazing, one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept on, the room and the hotel were clean and tidy, the staff was relatively friendly, and the room was cheap ($65/night).Now to the issues which taken by themselves would not be a big deal. First, the night I checked in (about 7:00 p.m.) there was one person at the front desk when I arrived and asked me to wait just a moment while she answered the phone. After a minute or so of waiting, a woman (who I presumed was the manager) came out of the back and as I approached her told me that the other woman would be with me in a minute and then retreated into the back office. I waited for about another 5 minutes (seemed like 20) while she took a reservation from someone else. Finally she checked me in and I asked her where they had the snacks, sundries, etc. and she pointed me to the vending machines by the elevator.Second, the room. Issues: only one trash can in the room located in the bathroom, bathroom has double doors which provide little privacy (luckily I was alone), no outlets above the night stand (have to dig behind them to plug in a phone charger), noise from hallway and adjacent rooms seemed to be unusually loud, noise from the elevator (while in my room and three rooms away) is reminiscent of the old vacuum tubes at the drive-up tellers at the bank and about that loud. Third, the morning after my first night I went to the front desk to ask if they had any lotion they could provide or sell me and she attempted to be nice while telling me “no”, but it came off kind of snotty. This was typical with most staff I came across at the hotel – with the exception of the maintenance staff which were remarkably nice.Fourth, my room was at the far end of the hotel and I used the door at that end to enter/leave the hotel. Twice my room key (which was required to enter that entrance) would not work and I had to trudge with arms full of stuff to the front desk via the outside of the hotel to have my card reset (one in the wind and snow). Both times I was given no apology, only excuses of why it might have happened – mostly that I had it in my wallet and I shouldn’t. So even though I have always put my room key in my wallet and NEVER EVER had an issue until I stayed at La Quinta DIA, suddenly my wallet is an evil room key killer.Fifth, the Wifi is PAINFULLY slow!!! So much so that I connected via my phone, which provided shared internet over AT&T that was lightning fast in comparison.Lastly, for the past four hours upon returning to the hotel there has been no signal on the TV. I called down to the front desk and was told that they “think” it’s because of the weather and “bear with them” because even the TV’s in the lobby aren’t working. Like I am supposed to care in the least if the TV’s in the lobby aren’t working and by all means that should be the priority of the hotel. Also, guess what happens to the children noise level in the hotel when the TV isn’t working!?!Again, the room was $65/night and perhaps I am being too picky, but I will not stay here again and since this is my first exposure to La Quinta hotels I will probably not stay at any of them again. But the commercials are great.",2
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Consistently clean, conviently located, competitively priced","We have stayed at this La Quinta for several years as a starting point for our ski vacations.  Rather than driving to (or from) the resorts directly after or before our flights, we enjoy a night here before further travel.  It it conviently located near the airport, there are a number of restaurants located within an easy walk and the 24 hour hot tub and pool is refreshing.The buffet breakfast is simple but satisfying.  This La Quinta has been consistently clean, friendly and well managed.  We look forward to future stays.",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Good job, La Quinta",I am impressed by this chain and this hotel was clean and the staff was friendly & helpful. The breakfast was average. Its a lower price alternative than some other airport hotels nearby or farther away.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta Inn&Suites,"The hotel is great, I was flying from Spain to Aspen but I had to sleep in Denver for one night because by the time I got to Denver there weren't shuttles.  There is a free-bus that takes you from the airport to the Hotel and the other way around.  I called the Hotel from the airport because I didn't know about the bus and they told me where to find it.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Ok, but noisy heating system equals little sleep... :(","Room was clean and spacious BUT the heat in one half of our suite didn't work and the blower (more like a blow dryer on a thermostat) in the bedroom would wake us up every time it turned on. If only, they had better heating systems... Also, it appears they set their thermostats to turn off a few degrees below the temperature you would select, with a max at 78 degrees, which would be fine if the heaters worked properly.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,ALways stay when flying out,"Never can predict the weather in CO., so always spend the night b/4 a flight at La Quinta because I can depend on top notch service from the staff, a very clean and suitable suite, good breakfast and timely shuttle to DIA.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice place to stay near DIA,"La Quinta DIA was clean, comfortable, well priced, and the staff was friendly. We appreciated the park and ride option - you can pay extra to keep your car for up to 5 days and use the shuttle service.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good But,"we have stayed at this hotel before and it always was excellent, BUT this time it was definitely starting to go downhill, the room is just adequate, nothing fancy, but you can tell corners have been cut, from sparse toiletries in the bathroom, one small shampoo to the bazaar outlet situation. No outlets anywhere except under the desk, then an old 6 plug in devise. The clock radio was possessed, went off in the middle of the night. Thin walls, and incredibly small double beds, i had to sleep with my daughter because my husband and I could not fit in the bed. The TV was also possessed, must of been demons or something?? the scariest thing was the elevator, it was so sloooooooooooow and it kept slipping and moving. Very scary There are numerous airport hotels along this stretch, I think we will choose a different  hotel next time.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Hotel,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, breakfast and free wifi.  Can recommend.  Near airport and free shuttle.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Perfect for the airport,"The room was quiet, and the breakfast offered was a nice variety and very good. They had a shuttle that took us right to the terminal and picked us up after our return flight right back to the hotel. We left our car at the hotel with no worries, that was great.  Staff was very friendly and helpful with everything.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Our Stay,"Good place to stay, close to the Denver airport when you are arriving late and don't want to travel up to the mountains late at night!!

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Denver Airport Hotel,"I had to stay at this hotel when my flight was cancelled to Houston, Texas due to weather.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good for the area,"In a real need of an upgrade in the rooms, especially for the large airport area, but it is still a good hotel.  The service was very friendly, loved the big open rooms and the cleanliness of the bathroom.  Breakfast is simple, no hot items (eggs and sausage or bacon) except waffles but was kept stocked.  I would stay here again if the price is right.  Another couple had a much lower rate than myself, I might ask about it next time.  Close to Ruby Tuesday (which also had amazing friendly service at the bar) and DiCicco's.  Parking can be an issue, but not terrible.  Appreciated the mini-fridge and microwave, 24 hr coffee and hot water downstairs in the lobby.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great value,"This hotel is one of the cheapest ones by the Denver Airport and they accept pets. The staff is incredibly friendly, rooms are clean, free shuttle to and from DIA, and free breakfast.   Only cons: the free internet is slow and the fitness center is lacking. There is also no food/bar (besides breakfast) at the hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,good,LaQuinta Inn at the Denver airport was above average and price is very good for park and stay. Stopper in bathroom sink did not work correctly. Only negative was shuttle driver who is not a part of hotel. He dropped off at only west terminal and made anyone who was going to east terminal walk the distance. It was snowy and cold and he was running late. did not like this treatment,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient to airport,Very convenient to Denver Airport with great shuttle service to/from.  Simple room with all of the necessities.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient & Clean,"This hotel is clean and convenient for staying before or after a trip via Denver airport.

Continental breakfast included. Even called us after we checked out to let us know we forgot something.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Look elsewhere,"Over the hotel was ok but it was running down with certain items in disrepair. Elevator buttons did not work so we had to push up to go down. hot tub was more like a luke-warm tub.  Common on fix the hot tub. Rooms a little noisy with doors slamming, road noise, etc.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Convenient to the airport,"We arrived into Denver very late in the evening and decided to spend the night here before venturing onto our final destination for a ski vacation in the Colorado Rockies. We had a suite, nice for the kids as there was plenty of space. There is literally NO traffic from the airport to the hotel, you don't have to drive on the interstate. The rooms are nice and clean. We didn't check out the pool but we all enjoyed the complimentary breakfast especially the waffles!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A nice surprise,"I had never stayed at a La Quinta, so I thought we would give it a try before flying out of DIA early one morning.  It was quite nice!  The room was nicely furnished and well laid out.  It was also quite large.   The only drawback was no shampoo or body lotion.  Breakfast was not as good as at other similar hotels (no hot entree).  A really good value and so convenient to DIA.  We will stay at La Quinta again!",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Long term parking,"We chose this for it's reasonable parking deal. We left the car for four nights, plenty of space, no problems. Shuttle to the airport Runs every 20 minutes starting at 4:00 a.m. We just missed the breakfast in order to catch the shuttle. It was a Sunday morning and they serve breakfast an hour later on Sundays. Too bad this is their policy, because the lobby was full of people who would have probably appreciated having something to eat. Even coffee would have been nice. Otherwise, a good place to stay and leave the car.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,convenient and comfortable hotel near airport,"Wonderful pool and outdoor courtyard area - rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Vacation Trip to Colorado,"This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in and was very friendly atmosphere. It coulcn't have been better. The rooms were clean, and the food was excellent for the continental breakfast.The maids and all employees of the hotel were courteous.

Overall the hotel was very nice and I would recommend staying there especially if you like Ruby Tuesdays which is next door.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta at Denver Airport,"Great place to stay if you are coming or going from the airport. It's close and the price is good, especially since it includes breakfast. Very nice rooms. They also offer a parking deal for long term parking.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice place close to the airport.,"I stayed here the night before I flew to the east coast for a week, and stayed here again when I got back. Both rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. Breakfast was adequate. I did the ""stay and park"" deal, and it was convenient. They have a shuttle to the airport. If I need to stay close to the airport in connection with a flight in the future, I would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Dependable Quality,We stay here frequently.  We travel a fair amount and have to travel to Denver to fly out of DIA.  We usually go down the night before and stay at this hotel to avoid traffic problems trying to get to DIA in the mornings.   Shuttle service to and from DIA is great.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Smells like cigarette smoke- wouldn't recommend,"When you enter the hotel there is a faint smell of cigarettes in the air. We got off the elevator and it had a very strong smell of cigarettes in the air. It was disgusting that a ""non-smoking hotel"" smelt like straight cigarettes. Definitely would not recommend this hotel unless you like the smell of cigarette smoke in your room.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,just fine,"Really appreciated the efficient airport shuttle and the free internet service. The room was fine and we slept well.  We were, however, awakened by someone´s dogs barking early in the morning, which didn´t make us very happy.,",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice hotel close to the DIA,"The hotel is less than 10 minutes from the Denver International Airport. The room was very clean and my primary concern was that I could have my pets at the hotel, the hotel had many pets, the hotel was very pet friendly and very clean. Will stay there again when in the area.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great hotel,Great place to stay. I would go back again ! Very clean and I loved the room. Breakfast was very good with a lot of options. Pool and hot tub was a open and very clean. I had a great sleep and the bed was very confortable.,5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta-Denver Airport,"We spent the night here before flying out of DIA on an early morning flight.  The room was very comfortable, clean & tidy.  Our flight was very early in the morning, so didn't expect that the breakfast buffet would be ready before we had to leave.  Well...surprise....it was!!  So much appreciated!!  Will definitely stay again when we have an early flight.  The hotel also has shuttle service to the airport and parking for your car during your trip.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good hotel for stop over,This was a perfect hotel for a stop over in DIA --- close to the airport; shuttle service (bring phone number to call them when you retrieve your luggage); large clean rooms; reasonably priced.Other amenities included:  continental breakfast; gym; and nearby restaurants (Ruby Tuesdays was only 100 meters away).The staff was very very nice and helpful --- another plus.,3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good hotel- good location,Typically stay at this LQ location when traveling in the Denver area. Hotel is close to airport with a couple good restaurants nearby. Rooms clean and staff friendly & helpful. Wireless internet is sketchy but improving. Overall a good location at a good rate.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good Value and close to airport,"We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Denver Airport, about 10 minutes away. We checked in about 8:30 p.m. and left about 5:45 a.m. the next morning for an early flight home. The room rate was good, about $62 with the AAA discount.Check in was quick and we were in a ground-floor room (135). The rooms are small but laid out well with a built-inn desk, queen sized bed, closet, and a decent-sized bathroom. The room was clean and the bed comfortable.There are some noise issues. Our next-door neighbor turned on his TV at 5:00 a.m. and we knew about it right away. I wish that people checking in late or leaving hotels early would have the decency to keep their voices low and not slam doors. I always travel with ear plugs, but they don't block out the sounds of doors being slammed. Breakfast had been put out early but we didn't have time to eat. It looked good and the waffle maker was ready to go. No one seemed to be at the desk when we were ready to check out, so I just dropped the keys cards there and left.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,A PLEASURE!,"SUPER staff! Pleasant, clean accomodations. PET-FRIENDLY--WHICH IS HUGE!! RECOMMEND highly! VERY near Denver International--which is NOT near anything else in Denver, but convenient for early-next-day flights.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Excellent Hotel Near the Airport,"I was impressed with the value of this hotel. The room I had was large, and the bed was very comfortable for under $100! Most hotels in the area were charging at least $40 more. There were a good amount of choices for breakfast. My only complaint that when I got in it was -20 degrees F, and the lobby was cold, but that is to be expected.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Downhill,"We have stayed at this hotel many times when traveling through Denver and I have to tell you that this location has gone downhill.  Upon entering the elevator it looked as if someone smeared snot all over the walls, the welcome we had to the floor we were on was of the aroma of just extinguished cigarettes, which welcomed us every single time we went to the hallway.  We had two rooms, both toilets were broken, there was dinged paint everywhere, cracked tiles, dirty refrigerator and the room was only marginally cleaner then gross. The shoddiness left me wondering what was there that I could not see with the naked eye.   I would have left this hotel had  we not been so exhausted and it not been so late at night. The best I can say is that the staff was nice. This location has turned into a dump and I would not stay here again. There are way too many other choices now in the DIA area to settle for such filth.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Just an average LaQuinta, noisy","It is only ok,what you would expect from a LaQuinta.  My main complaint is the design of the property makes for a noisy hallway.  When you are sleeping, you can hear every door in the hall slam closed when they are used.  So, be prepared to be woken up by any late night arrivals and any early morning departures.  Breakfast is only OK as well.  Would only recommend staying here if you had an early flight the next day, otherwise why would you stay all the way out on Tower road, where there is really nothing but a few other hotels and a very few restaurants?",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,DIA La Quinta,"Stayed in a ground floor unit that was near the entrance so we could leave early the next morning.  The employees were very nice and helpful.  Room was clean and quiet even though they allowed dogs, only heard 1 bark.  Quick drive to DIA with no problems.  Very clean and nice all around.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Terrible,"This hotel started off with a 10 minute wait for someone to show up at the front desk for a check in. The agent was out right rude, did not even apologize for the wait (after asking about it). The rooms were built cheap you could hear everyone around you even through the room doors. I understand you get what you pay for, but in this case pay a few dollars more at a neighboring hotel and get a lot better quality stay.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Decent, clean, close to Denver's main airport","Located about a 10 minute shuttle trip away from the airport, this comfortable hotel provides an excellent staging area for morning departures.  Clean rooms, typical LQ breakfast.    Lobby is uncomfortable at breakfast because of the automatic double doors staying open too long.  Bring a sweater with you during cold weather.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Good choice for airport,"I Stayed here for 1 night to fly out the next day.  this hotel provided a clean, quiet, place before my travels.  Had a couple of good restaurants next to it and a few more a short walk away. Shuttle to the airport was good.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Pleasantly surprised,We stayed here for one night while passing through Denver and were pleasantly surprised at the quality and value of this pic. The room was spacious and very clean. The breakfast in the morning was outstanding! The bed was also particularly comfy. We are staying here again on our Denver stop this year.,4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Pleasantly suprised.  Big rooms, near airport.","Stayed here one night before flying out early in the morning.  This appears to be a new hotel, and was pleased with our stay.  Hotel nice and clean.  Rooms were rather large, great for kid to run around in the room and burn off steam.  Didn't love the breakfast options, but hey its free.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Clean and Friendly,"Clean hotel, Friendly staff and the bed was super comfy, we slept like babies.  Nice continental breakfast and the hard boiled eggs were delicious.  We did the Park, Sleep and Fly option where you spend the night, park your car for up to 7 days and take their shuttle to the airport, it was great and worry free.  We have done this before at this LQ, and would not do it any other way.",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Nice Hotel at a Nice Price,"I stayed at this hotel on 11-14-13 prior to flying out on 11-15-13. I got this room with a king size bed for a great price, far better than other hotels in the same area.   The hotel is close to the airport and the drive there was a breeze. The hotel is located near several other hotels and restaurants that are within walking distance.Check in was very quick and the staff was pleasant.  The front desk staff pointed out a business center in case I needed to print out a boarding pass or check in for my flight, (which I needed to do)  The free breakfast was not to bad, they had waffles hard boiled eggs and fruit as well as a selection of cold and hot cereals.The public areas are all clean and well maintained and my room was very nice and was clean.  There is plenty of parking at this location, the parking lot is well lit at night.I would defiantly recommend this hotel for a stay prior to flying out of DIA.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Not enough room at the Inn,"I reserved and paid for one night with a roll away, had no problem paying the $10 for it. Upon our arrival, desk clerk said our room w/double beds can not accept roll away, so they gave out all roll aways,  then they moved us to a room smaller than what was originally booked. My children had to sleep on floor!",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Smells like raw sewage,"I stayed on the 1st floor and noticed a rancid smell. I notified the front desk and the told me it was a plumbing issue nearby. That is it. No apology, or offer to change rooms. Gross. I was also told when I made the reservation that I could have 9 dollar a day parking passes and she would make a note for when I checked in to give me them. I got in late and never got offered them. I called the day after when I realized and the girl told me she would have to charge me $80 more. Only gone 3 days. She was rude on phone and I will never stay at a La Quinta again.",1
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Experience,"This hotel is located near the airport in a newly developed area where there is a lot of vacant land.  We found it well-maintained and very clean with up-to-date furnishings. There is a guest laundry facility with one washer and dryer which we used. There was free detergent available as well as some for purchase. Our bed was comfortable and we slept well. There were waffles and boiled eggs on the breakfast buffet along with the usual cereal and bagel offerings. There is a McDonald's nearby if you want something else.  The staff was very helpful.  On looking outside the next morning, we found that the hotel faces a field of sunflowers with a red barn in the distance.  Nice!",5
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,"Good location, average stay.","First impressions are everything right ? Well when you arrive after dark and every hotel around has a front sign illuminated makes it easy to find, not so with this hotel. Front sign was dark, hard to find. Ok now the good, once inside check in went nice and easy ,friendly clerk. The lobby was very nice. Once in the room, looked and was very clean, however the refrigerator and microwave were unplugged and put in front an adjoining door, just seemed strange. Turned on the TV it was downloading data ? went on for over an hour then worked. After dinner came back was exhausted, bed was very comfortable pillows nice. Time to sleep, nope loud neighbors making that hard. Problem it seems is very thin walls. Even in the morning could hear doors slamming, not good. The bathroom was large and nice, except no exhaust fan, which of course means fogged up mirrors. Breakfast in the morning starts at 5am which is great for early travelers as we were. Standard hotel brekfast fare.   All in all ,not bad, with several other hotels nearby I would probably look elsewhere next time for more quiet.",3
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,La Quinta - I'll be back!,"I absolutely loved this hotel.  It was clean and quiet, the staff was helpful, the room was beautiful and the internet worked great! I'll definitely stay there again!! :) And the bed was really comfy!

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Bravo for the hotels GM,"Have stayed here 3 times this fall, first two stays very good, nice staff, we really like the room layouts, and kids love the pool which is one of the nicer ones we have seen in this size hotel. Our third stay was not not good, we got in late and had the 2 room suite booked which is what we were checked into. However the 2 person sleeper had been switched to a single, since it was so late no other rooms were available, and all rollaways were out. When we made res we were told had double sleeper, hotel web site not updated. Anyway one person slept on floor since there were four people. Called the GM when returned from our trip and he was aware of problem and refunded our nights stay no questions asked. In my book that has earned this hotel another chance for us.",4
"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,EXCELLENT STAY on overnight business,"Upon arriving to DIA I called the hotel because I was not familiar where the shuttle center was.  Megan answered the phone and gave me step by step directions which helped me get there without any problems.  I took the shuttle which arrived within 5 minutes from my arrival to DIA.  The hotel is about a short 10 minute drive from the airport.  Upon walking into the hotel I was greeted by Megan.  She remembered my name and had everything ready to go for me.  The hotels lobby is a very nice size and extremely inviting.  My room was on the 5th floor which the elevator was just a quick walk from the front desk.  The entire hotel was very clean and well maintained.  My room was just what I needed.  There was a comfortable king size bed, a great television lineup, big bathroom, and the lighting was great allowing me to productively get work done.  I had an early flight in the morning and went down for breakfast.  I was welcomed by a very friendly Jamie who checked me out and assisted me in getting to the airport.  Breakfast was very nice and convenient.  There were several types of juice, coffee, cereals, yogurts, and pastries. Everything you need to get your morning going.    I had a great stay there and would recommend this hotel to everyone.",5

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Great Accomodations,"We've stayed at many La Quinta hotels over the past 25 years, this was definitely the best of all.

"Denver, CO",La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Denver Airport Dia,Absolutely Perfect,"We had an emergency in Denver and had to fly out with none of our personal affects.  We brought home our daughter all her belongings and her dog. This hotel staff was so accommodating and helpful with our situation! They also supplied us with toothbrushes toothpaste combs and deodorant! The next morning we had to leave before the breakfast was set out, and the staff at it up early just so we could eat before we had to catch our plane home! We will always stay with La Quinta now!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,WHAT A STAY!,"The Crawford Hotel was seriously the most unique and beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in. My husband and I decided to stay here for our honeymoon and it certainly did not disappoint. From guest services answering our every need and the Tesla valet courtesy car service especially with Jamel and Riley as our drivers was amazing!!!! I can’t really say anything bad about this hotel whatsoever. Super quiet, super cozy, and outstandingly beautiful and romantic!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anniversary Staycation,"Husband and I booked the B&B package for our 31st anniversary.  The hotel staff were warm, friendly, and professional.  Also I was able to update my reservation after a date mixup.  As mentioned by others in several reviews the hotel amenities are great and the rooms are beautifully decorated.  The experience overall was great with the exception of a few things:  1.  Being awaken early AM to loud noises which sounded like large doors being closed and metal clanging2.  Couldn’t figure out how to order breakfast from Snooze as it was not featured as a category on the iPad.  Called the front desk and they placed the order for us (thanks)!  However by the time the food arrived it was very cold.3. Upon checkout I sat in the great hall in the area reserved for hotel guests while I waited for my husband to return from the restroom.  We saw several people sitting in this area the night of our stay as well.  After about a minute of being seated, a security officer approached me and informed me that this area was for guests only and asked if I was a hotel guest of which I responded I was and then was asked to provide some sort of proof...hotel room number or key.  Since I had previously observed many others who had been seated there unapproached, I informed him that I wouldn’t provide him with such proof but that he could check with the front desk for verification.  After checking with the front desk he came back and apologized.  I understand the need to enforce the seating requirement however from my experience I felt highly offended.  Perhaps Crawford hotel could figure out a different way of enforcement.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Birthday Getaway,"We traveled from Emeryville, CA to Denver on the Amtrak Zephyr. It was such a pleasure to get to a real hotel and bed! Anna and Jen at the front desk were marvelous. They put us in a corner spacious room on the balcony level. I love this hotel. Second time staying here and will be back again. Awesome bathroom, shower,  and whirlpool tub. Minutes from multiple restaurants so easy walking even in cold weather.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A perfect staycation during the pandemic (and perfect for out-of-towners too),"We stayed at The Crawford the weekend before Thanksgiving to celebrate a 40th birthday and knew that with the pandemic most everything would be closed. So, we decided on a staycation to treat ourselves to some fancy and fun time away from home. The staff are so professional and accommodating, and special thanks go to Jordan (concierge) as she answered all our pre-trip questions, offered to schedule car services for us, and greeted us warmly in-person when we arrived. The amenities included in our stay made it fun because we got to take advantage of enjoying Union Station's full atmosphere (including the restaurants there that offer takeaway food and we even treated ourselves to the complimentary drink, coffee, and ice cream). The rooms are lovely, have very thoughtful touches (like disposable cameras), and gorgeous architecture and design so make it feel like a real getaway to a special hotel versus one of the many chains that don't offer much of an ""experience."" As far as cleanliness and COVID-friendly, The Crawford was completely on top of it so it felt very safe, clean, and accommodating to anyone with underlying health conditions or otherwise simply trying to travel responsibly. The Crawford is a hotel I would highly recommend to anyone local and to anyone coming to Denver who wants an original experience, in a fun part of town, and values real customer service that makes you feel pampered and taken care of. Did I mention the free Tesla car service (within a 2-mile radius)?",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible service - above and beyond!,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The Crawford! We were staying there to celebrate my cousin’s 40th birthday and the staff was so incredibly kind and generous! Jordan at the front desk was so very helpful in making sure we had a great stay. She went above and beyond to accommodate additional requests. Top notch service. There were some great perks including the free Tesla rides within 2 miles (and the excellent driver Riley!) and free coffee and ice cream at Union Station. Enjoyed the fun Polaroid camera in each room too. Finally, very Covid safe and clean! Will definitely look to stay again when I’m in town.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Every time we love it,"We love the location and the hotel every time.  Staying in Union Station with awesome amenities and great people watching if always a treat.  To have such a beautiful room to enjoy on top of that is always appreciated.  We have stayed there after taking the train in from Chicago, after a flight in and this past year after some great days hiking in the mountains for fall colors.  NEVER disappoints.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Quick Get Away,"We took the A Line train directly from the airport to the door of Union Station for $21.00.  It was super convenient and runs every 15 minutes or so.  Upon arrival we received a room upgrade to a suite room which was very nice with 1 1/2 baths.  Location was convenient for tours in the surrounding area.  Only let down was that the Tesla service was not offered during our stay and we had to request our coffee supplies from the desk; which wasn’t delivered timely.  Lack of room cleaning/stocking was due to Covid which is understandable during these times.  Complimentary daily coffee shop drink, bar drink and ice cream per person was provided due to the amenity fee which was nice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Could not have been a better stay! ,"During my time here the staff was incredible and so helpful, the rooms are clean and absolutely gorgeous. Even our TESLA driver, Riley was absolutely  amazing. I would recommend  for anyone to stay in this hotel at least once!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved it,Loved the stay at this hotel on my wedding weekend. It was a treat to have a Tesla drive us complimentary! Riley was amazing! The rooms are so spacious and the amenities are just so amazing. The concierge desk is so helpful and warm.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved the Location and Staff!,The location of the Crawford made it so easy for a 4 day exploration of Denver. The hotel staff were so quick to respond to questions and any extras for the room. Having access to the Crawford Hotel e-bikes to explore the many scenic trails and river/creek was a highlight. Hotel staff Jen and Jordan were so helpful and part of why this was a 5 star experience!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel & Wonderful Staff,"My husband and I stayed at The Crawford for 2 nights and had the best time. Our room was absolutely fabulous (we booked the Deluxe Loft). But the staff really made our trip memorable. Jordan and Jen were so friendly and helpful. They had great restaurant recommendations and made our stay that much more amazing! We will definitely be back soon! Highly recommend this amazing, historic hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved the location,We really enjoyed our stay here.  We were loved the central location.  Everything we wanted within walking distance.  We traveled to catch a game at Mile High on the lite rail just a short walk from the hotel  Simply the location is brilliant.  The building and surroundings have a great feel about them and the hotel itself is closed off to the public so you don't have any disturbance.  The rooms were well set out and comfortable and we loved the exposed beams and rustic feel to our room that gave the room plenty of character.  The staff were extremely helpful and took care of any request we had. We would easily stay here again when back in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An almost perfect stay,"This hotel is fun and unique.When you arrive, you'll need to park at The Oxford hotel down the street.  They will move your luggage to The Crawford and valet your car. When walking in, a lot is going on. Trains are moving, people at the bar, others seated at comfortable seating with drinks or meals.We booked the LoDo Suite and could not be happier with the choice. The room was immaculate and stylish. The seating and the bed are in separate areas and has two full baths. The staff was terrific and accommodating. We had dinner at Stoic and Genuine inside the station. The food was incredible, and the service as well.  We ordered oysters on the half shell, clam chowder, and Maine lobster rolls. The bed was comfortable, and we did not hear any noise from other guests.Everything was fantastic until the next morning.It states you receive priority Seating at Snooze, an A.M. Eatery. When we attempted to eat that morning, we were informed we needed to make a reservation to get seating. Ummm, I am sorry, but that is not a priority seating option. That is a reservation. So that was a no go on the breakfast. We decided to get a cup of coffee and head to the airport early, and eat there.  This is where the morning gets worse. We get our coffee, head to the room, grab our luggage, and call Valet for the car. We sat outside for 1.5 hours, waiting for our car from Valet. My husband asked multiple times where our car was, and each time he was told it was on its way, from where I am unsure.Finally, he had to walk to The Oxford and tell them we would miss our flight. Twenty minutes later, the car was there, and now we don't have time to eat nor the time to fill the tank on the rental. So, we had to return the car without filling the tank, that was a substantial additional charge, and we ended up having to grab McDonald's at the airport. So much for a relaxing last day of vacation.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,DO IT! You'll be happy you did!,"Talk about making the right choice!  My fiance and I got engaged 10/3 of 2019 and wanted to celebrate our first year being engaged so we planned a little getaway from SF to Denver.  To be honest, we debated staying at a different ""luxury"" hotel, and I'm SO glad we didn't.  Not only is the location of The Crawford absolutely perfect (literally can't mess up the airport-to-town train ride even if we wanted to), not to mention how EVERYTHING is walkable from it, but the service was the absolute BEST.  I called a couple days before our trip to inquire if the hotel could recommend a photographer to do a last minute engagement shoot out at the Red Rocks; enter: Jennifer Brown and her incredible customer service.  She not only helped me track down one of the most EPIC photographers that Denver has to offer, but she also coordinated a sweet little whiskey tasting to surprise my hunny with!  She and her team made us feel like we were family and as if we had known them for years!  I felt like everyone working during the time we were there knew how excited we were to have a reason to celebrate, which was a welcomed feeling especially after having to postpone our wedding (F#*% you Covid)!!!  Our room was a sexy styled loft and we were beyond comfortable.  The icing on the cake was the free nightly happy hour and the daily comped cup of coffee and ice cream.  I literally felt like I could just hang out at the hotel and Union station and be as happy as a clam!  (Definitely glad we got out to explore though, and was happy to take Jen's recommendations as well).   All in all we would recommend this place 10 times over and we truly cannot wait to come back and visit our new friends at The Crawford!  (Thank you so much Jen!  You were a life saver and now we can finally get our ""save the date"" out for our new wedding date)!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Short escape from ""Paradise""","In mid October 2020 I ""escaped"" Aspen, Colorado for a short, but much needed reality check in Denver. I've always wanted to stay at The Crawford Hotel and booked two nights and opted for a third last minute. Growing up in the Colorado mountains the city has always been a draw and this trip was no different. The hotel is attractive and comfortable. Close to everything from good restaurants, quick eats, workout and bike routes. The downtown area is undergoing constant rejuvenation and can be noisy, but fun day and night.In person shopping at unique stores and attractions; Don't be afraid to explore.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Must Stay for amtrak travelers ,Took train from emeryville to denver..stay over two nights and then back west again.  For first night we stayed in west denver....nothing special....so we remembered we passed hotel crawford in train terminal...went online and booked a loft.  Sooooo. Glad we did!!!!!  Awesome room with lots of places to eat and drink.  Felt like an awesome downtown vibe with lots of people out and about.  Room was above our expectations.......only minor changes I would have made were some type of step stool for better view out window and the large sitting chair was extremely stiff and not comfy at all.....  I would here again without hesitation.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Luxury service,"This was my third visit to The Crawford. We were celebrating my son’s 10th birthday on this trip. The staff went out of their way to make our weekend memorable. Union Station is a great location with so much to see and do. Restaurants, shopping, museums, 16th St. Mall are all within walking distance. The rooms are absolutely lovely and exactly what you would expect from a luxury hotel. It is worth the upgrade to have the clawfoot tub. I appreciate the traditional decor and details. The location is so fun and unique and definitely adds to the specialness. Our driver, Riley, was very personable, and the Tesla ride is all my son has been talking about! I really cannot say enough good things about The Crawford. This is definitely my favorite Denver hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Overpriced, you're paying for the location","Hubby and I have stayed at the Crawford twice.  We stayed two years ago in a Lodo Suite room and loved it, didn't mind the $20 amenity fee and took advantage of some of the free deals.  Decided to stay again for a staycation recently.  I think this might be our last stay for a while.  We booked a bed and breakfast rate for a deluxe loft room, which faces toward the train tracks.  No matter what people tell you, these rooms are not soundproof - you will hear the bells from incoming trains all night - and I mean ALL night.    The mattress was saggy. I think it's an innerspring, but I don't think it's been turned since the hotel opened.  NOBODY is enforcing the mask mandate at Union Station. There were people running around in the station without masks, and don't bother sitting in…",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great visit, would definitely stay again!","Went to the Crawford for a night with two girlfriends, had a lovely time. Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Our check-in was a breeze. The room was very clean and well-appointed. Loved the little extras like the camera in the room. Everyone was wearing a mask and were very conscientious about staying at least 6 feet away. Had a great time, can't wait to go back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic,"I cannot say enough good about The Crawford!  We had an unfortunate incident when our keys were stolen to our rental from the valet box BUT the staff went above and beyond to compensate for it. Outstanding service, excellent facility, friendly & accommodating staff and all around one of my favorite hotels.  Our Tesla driver Riley was fantastic as well!  Don’t miss out on this place next time you’re in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,During Covid-19 Normalcy in an Abnormal World,"I've stayed at the Crawford in the past while visiting Denver.  It was absolutely wonderful to stay there during the Covid-19 pandemic..to have some normalcy in an abnormal world.  I felt safe - the hotel was so clean & the staff was, as usual, over the top.  Sandra in housekeeping so friendly & helpful.  Laura & Jennifer & Riley at the front desk very pleasant, friendly and also helpful.  We opted not to have housekeeping in every day but the response for anything we needed was very impressive.  Great to be able to visit the Crawford again during this time.  Thank you!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Getaway!,"Visited Denver again for a family getaway. Staying at The Crawford always feels like we’re at our home away from home. During these uncertain times, The Crawford staff made everything feel wonderful and safe. They checked with us numerous times during our stay to be sure things were going well and they were!  After a day in the city the rooms are so spacious and comfortable to come back to!! Laura, Riley, Jennifer and Sandra went above and beyond to make our stay great!  Can’t wait for our next visit!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great service!,"Stayed one night at the B&B rate -- included valet parking ($47 value) plus $50 allowance for in-room breakfast from Snooze.  Breakfast choices were great, but in the Covid era, cardboard and plastic are the best we can do.  Included typical barista choices -- we had chai latte and a cappuccino.  The room has an I-Pad to use for getting information, ordering breakfast, and retrieving the car from the valet, among other things.  Bathroom is very nice with a walk-in glass shower with two heads -- the rain shower was great.  The room also has a Nespresso machine with espresso pods.We took advantage of the free Tesla transport (2-mile limit) to go to our restaurant. Riley, our driver, was on-time, very polite, and professional.Have stayed in downtown Denver on numerous occasions (Hyatt, Brown Palace, Marriott, to name a few) -- first time at the Crawford.  We've definitely found a new #1.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exquisitely comfortable with outstanding service,"My husband and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary here in the midst of the pandemic and felt for once like everything was normal for a moment. The suite was fabulous, with high end everything! Luxurious and beautiful. The hotel staff were super friendly and went above and beyond, especially at the check in desk. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Sorry we came back.,"Couple of year’s ago we spent a few days here and it was great so we came back. Our second visit was during corona virus, so I realize things have changed,  but the service was horrible. They no longer clean your room. No clean towels and the garbage piles up in your room. No parking at the hotel. You have to take your car to another hotel for parking and walk back to the Crawford. Thongs were not in working order in our room. The hotel employees are incompetent. I had to ask 3 times for toilet paper and clean towels. Never did get them. When I asked questions at the front desk, the girls kept chatting to each other and were very unhelpful. We will find another place to stay next time.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for EVERYTHING!,"This beautiful, historic hotel in Union Station was ideal for ALL our needs and then some.  It is just steps from the light rail which transports to Denver airport(only $10.50 per person).  The ticket is also good for the city bus and doesn't expire until 2:59 am the next day!  Both of our tours conveniently picked us up in front of the hotel, and we were in the heart of LoDo (lower downtown-very nice part of town). The daily amenities are plentiful-free coffee(or tea), ice cream, happy hour alcohol, and more discounts!  Our room was comfortable, clean, quiet, and spacious. The shower was AMAZING-also spacious, with strong water pressure and soft water texture(no residue).  Robes, slippers, more coffee and alcohol available!We were delighted with the hospitality while in Denver.  Kudos to the state of Colorado for managing to simultaneously welcome tourists and take all precautions during this unusual time. Went home with great memories!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crushing on The Crawford ,"We’re in the middle of our stay at The Crawford but did not want to lose another minute before raving about this amazing establishment. From the moment we stepped foot onto the plaza in front of the hotel, to our seamless check-in experience, to the actual room itself, our experience has been top notch! We’d like to give a special shout out to Lara who has been delighting us with extra special surprises.Upon arrival, we were thrilled to learn we’d been upgraded to a Crawford Suite. The room layout is perfect for any traveler, but particularly if you are a couple traveling with a toddler. There’s plenty of space for everyone! The suite has everything, including its own fully stocked bar (with dishwasher!), assorted bitters + top shelf spirits, in addition to boardgames and beautiful coffee table books. Other thoughtful touches include an aromatherapy diffuser, spa-worthy waffle weave robes + slippers, and makeup remover wipes. We couldn’t be more pleased with our hotel experience at The Crawford. In fact, my husband remarked that we could literally limit our entire visit to the confines of this hotel and its exquisite bars and restaurants...there is just so much to do right here. Walking through the lobby continues to take our breath away each time; it is jaw-droppingly gorgeous! Is it possible to look forward already to a future visit when you’re in the midst of enjoying your present stay?",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Really Outstanding Experience,"I had hear about the Crawford Hotel  but the experience of it was so much better.  The check in was fast and friendly.  I felt incredibly safe, because to get to my room there was a card key elevator, a card key door to the hallway and then a card key lock on my room.  The Loft room was really beautiful, and very quiet.  There was water waiting for me and craft beverage for purchase.  The bathroom was so nice with the antique tub and the shower with multiple shower heads.  There was an iPad in the room that had information about the hotel, Union Station, transportation and local sites to visit.  I was also able to order room service through iPad and really enjoyed the selections available.  On the desk was a copy of the book Atlas Obscura, and once I picked it up I knew I would have to order a copy.  It has fascinating information about artifacts, buildings, shrines, etc, from around the world.  The staff that I interacted with was polite and friendly and the general manager emailed to follow up to make sure I enjoyed my stay.  You don't want to miss out on this experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel!,"We stayed at The Crawford in Denver because we had a very early flight home and needed to take the commuter train to the the airport. It did not disappoint! The building is in the refurbished historic Union Station. It is home to The Crawford, restaurants, the Denver commuter light rail, some small shops, and the Amtrak station. There are also many restaurants within walking distance of Union Station. We used the Tesla courtesy car service to pick us up from the rental car return. Our room had 16 foot tall windows and was decorated in the historic style of Union Station. It was very comfortable and luxurious. We would recommend The Crawford to anyone looking for a luxury hotel in downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very neat unique hotel,"Being at a train station and a lot of traffic coming through, the room was surprisingly quiet. We chose a non smoking room but for some reason when we arrived it smelt like a smokers room. The value of the room was a little overpriced but it was a cute room. Snooze delivers room service but it was too overpriced for 2 people, a few eggs and pancakes close to 100!. It’s in a great location but the lobby where people come and go can be a little cleaner.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Outstanding hotel,Situated in the heart of downtown this train station which was converted into a hotel is an absolute must stay. The Amtrak trains still run from here which is cool. The rooms are outstanding and opulent  along with the deep luxurious bath tubs and huge showers. It shows that however planned this hotel put a lot of time and effort into it and it paid off. They have a coffee shop pizza place Sushi restaurant and a bar overlooking the grand concourse which is unique. Definitely very happy l booked this hotel 👍,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anniversary ,"I really liked the loft we stayed in. It was nice and cool , and clean. It was awesome to be so close to dining and outside activities. They only reason I didn’t give more stars is our bed squeaked all night every time we would roll over or move I was awake. Also bed was lumpy with dip in the middle. Otherwise great place to stay. Room 418 needs a new bed.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,so perfect is this location,"loved staying here in the beginning of the come back from the apocalypse.  My sister and I stayed 5 nights to celebrate our retirements.  Loved the entire stay... the light rail from the airport to the hotel is perfect.  then you stay in the middle of all the fun.  the bikes they loaned were perfect and fun.  the rooms were spacious and comfy with the Nespresso coffee every day... comfy beds great soaking tub.  the extra charges were well worth with free coffee, ice cream and my first ride in a Tesla.  Will come again with more crowds net time.....",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Spectacular Customer Service,"Well, we had a disaster happen and if not for the spectacular customer service of Jordan at the front desk and Sarah who backed her up, our visit to Denver would have been a disaster. We arrived in Denver on a Friday afternoon and parked our rental car in the public lot across the street from the hotel. On Saturday morning we went to retrieve our car and without warning, the parking lot had closed for COVID cleaning until Monday morning! Zero warning and we were due to fly home on Sunday evening. We went back to the front desk and Jordan went to work for us. She walked back over to the lot with my husband to see the situation for herself. Then she arranged a rental car for us so we could get on with our weekend and we exchanged cellphone numbers. Jordan made countless calls and waited on hold for hours, enlisted coworkers to cover the phone if she had to step away. She called the lot owners, the management company and anyone else she could think of until she found a person who would come out and unlock the parking lot prison our car was trapped in and she found a guy who could come unlock the lot! Jordan then called us to let us know that we had a plan, could park both the rental car in valet at the hotel’s expense and then sent a bottle of Chardonnay and three glasses to our room for what we had been through. When Jordan’s shift ended, she enlisted Sarah to cover any problems with our situation if they should come up. No one could have done more to help us with a situation that came right out of the blue. We will never forget the excellent customer service we received at The Crawford. The suite our family shared was beautiful, comfortable and spotless and we are loyal guests for life!Thank you again, Jordan and Sarah. I hope your management gives you a big bonus for your effort!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Short but sweet trip!,"My husband I booked a last-minute trip to Denver after having to cancel our honeymoon to Italy. Kathleen was professional, courteous, and incredibly accommodating, and very graciously sent us a bottle of prosecco on the house! Although we were only there for one night, we will definitely be back at the Crawford when we return to Colorado. What a lovely and welcoming hotel -- we had a wonderful time!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Short but sweet visit,"I stayed here for a work trip, it was booked for me.  Everything went smoothly, the room was basically a mini-suite with 2 TVs and a kitchenette which was perfect for remote work.  The Union Station location felt secure, despite an errant vagrant who accosted me in the AM while I waited for coffee (not the hotel's fault, and Union Station security was quite present.  The hotel has partnerships with a bunch of the dozen+ restaurants at Union Station, so discounts abounded.  I finished my meetings early and had a looooong wait until my flight, the front desk staff sent me to their spa (Oxford Spa) less than a block away to wait, which was quiet and comfortable, equipped with snacks and drinks. 12/10 would stay there again even if it wasn't work (and thus I had to pay for it myself :)).  Megan at the front desk was especially wonderful!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel but a few flaws,"This is a really nice hotel and we had a great time, but there are a few flaws.  Each room comes with a preloaded IPAD, which is a great idea.  You can read newspapers and magazines, contact customer service, set am alarm, etc.  Unfortunately, ours had been so messed up by a previous user it was almost impossible to use.  I contacted customer service but the problem was not resolved during our two day stay.  We also had trouble with the Nespresso coffee-maker in the room which did not operate as it was supposed to.  They replaced it.  The Crawford is a nice place and the staff is earnest, but these two problems should have not been allowed to happen.    Especially for the price!  It has been a week since we stayed and I bet that IPAD is still screwed up.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Lovely hotel, great hotel, excellent staff!! ","We loved our quick overnight at the Crawford. Train from the airport, Late dinner at the Terminal, cozy bed breakfast at Snooze. Fabulous staff that helped my husband with business/ printing help. wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else in downtown Denver - five stars!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver Date night layover,"WOW what a find!Flew into Denver for a visit CSU Fort Collins and watch CSU RAMS 🏀game. Drove upto Ft Collins to stay at the Elizabeth (see review) and needed to stay an extra night prior to flying out to next destination. So decided to get a room in Denver and explore the LODO area. Discovered that there was a hotel within Union Station called the Crawford that offers standard rooms as well as “loft” rooms so selected the Loft options (that over looks rails and station stop). It’s an excellent view of LODO. The Crawford is literally smack dab in the middle of Union Station, along with craft kitchens, cafes and bars - of which you get discounted (and free) treats, drinks and eats for staying at The Crawford. Now be aware it’s a fully active station with commuters, travelers and locals buzzing about. There ARE kids, but I wouldn’t say it’s kid friendly. I would stay there with kids BUT keep them busy sightseeing and in the rooms.The Terminal Bar is cool, the ice cream shop was delicious, the Cooper Lounge was convenient for a night cap (but that’s about it $$$)There is a car service that will shuttle you around LoDo for free and the driver offered great recommendations. Lastly Th e main reason we would most likely visit is the location and A line service to and from the airport.. CANT BEAT IT... there are rental cars service right across from The Crawford. So you can ride A Line check in and walk to get rental car if you need to ALL IN ALL it’s highly recommended for visiting Denver for Nuggets 🏀game, Rockies ⚾️game.. or avalanche 🏒game",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Vintage Classy,"On arrival we were greeted by the valet quite well, they grabbed a cart for our bags and such in a very timely manner. I always like to bring some fun and fashionable clothing for these occasions and they cared for our things properly. As we arrived at the front desk concierge it was just good vibes all the way, the staff here felt like friends instantly.  The Cooper Lounge on the 2nd or 3rd floor, (can’t quite remember) this was great for getting the night started, having a wonderfully made cocktail and enjoying the loft view of the Crawford and enjoying good conversation with our other friends who joined us as well.  The Terminal Bar on the first floor was exceptional service and wonderful drinks and it gets better the later you stay, we stayed until it closed and then walked the union station after. The security guys were also very nice to us, even after closing the Terminal Bar thee e u said we could carry on our conversation in the station as long as we wanted, this works when you are guests of The Crawford. The greatest thing about this place is the customer service though, the staff is on point. I honestly wish I had more cash on me at the time of my stay so I could tipped more. I will make up for that next time.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel with fantastic customer service,"My son lives in Denver and we came for a visit to go snow tubing and see the ice castles. We arrived at the hotel on Thursday night and left on Sunday. We took the train from the airport to Union Station and then we are at the hotel.  We were greeted by the Staff and they upgraded our room. The rooms are small but beautiful and clean. The bathroom great with a nice rain shower. We had breakfast at Snooze in the morning and it was delicious and it’s located right there in the train station in the hotel area. We were also given a voucher each day for each of us for a complementary ice cream at this creamery right in union station. The ice cream was delicious. I even had vegan almond joy and it was so good I couldn’t wait to get it the next two nights while we stayed there. Big shout out to the following staff that went above and beyond for the best customer service we have seen in our almost 40 years of traveling around the world since we got married. We must mention Jordan, Kim,Megan and JD. I can’t speak highly enough of these staff members that work there! I point out that it was Kim’s first day at work at the hotel but she addressed situations like she’s been there forever! We will definitely stay there again next time we come to Denver from Florida to visit our son!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible property,"My husband and son had a concert to attend in downtown Denver. We decided to go as a family so while they were at the concert my daughter and I walked around downtown and rode the tram to shop. The hotel is top notch and the staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable. We enjoyed the free beer in the historic bar, walked around the old train station, shopped while eating our free ice cream and did a lot of people watching. Our room was fantastic. It had a lot of the old wood beams, young living essential oils with the diffuser, beautiful tub and showers and chic, throw back  decor. They also had a Tesla available for local rides which we did not take advantage of this trip. I highly recommend this hotel!  It is FULL of personality and great architecture.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Casual entertainment on a new level!,"The rooms were luxurious, the cocktails were divine, (did you know there is a cocktail bar above on the second floor!? I highly recommend the ""Witch's Ladder"") the decorations and nuance was a perfect balance of old and new, the woodworking and stylized rooms were meticulous and craftily put together with flair and care! On a whim, I booked the Union Station Art and History Package and was taken on a tour of the spectacular history of Denver's ""Living room"". WOW! The information and things seen were so interesting and fun! Those conference room walls are like something out of Star Trek technology! A big kudos to Conner, our guide. He delivered so much information about the different style rooms, history, and highs and lows of the building with such suave composure, it was a true pleasure that we will talk about for a long time. I can't say enough about this hotel, located at Union Station in Denver... Staying for our Anniversary was the best decision for down town casual entertainment and stay. We will be back again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location...but that’s about it!,"We had high hopes for The Crawford Hotel; however from the poor front desk service; to the poor attitude from the bartender at the bar upstairs; to a bed that wasn’t comfortable (it declined at the head of the bed), the room wasn’t clean (it had personal soap bottles from the last guest, trash in the trash can) it fell short. If you happen to get a room (like we did) that face inside the union station, it is quite loud as well (but gets quiet at night). Overall, not worth the price you pay to stay there.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great Staff, Comfortable Room, Incredibly Convenient","I'm a native of Denver, and Union Station went from very grand in the days of train travel to a dump from, say, 1965 to about 2008. Thanks to some visionary people, the Crawford Hotel's namesake for one, Union Station is now back to very grand. If you take RTD's A Line from Denver International Airport to Union Station, walk about 50 steps to the Crawford Hotel front desk on the north side of the grand hall in Union Station. You'll meet some delightful staff members who will have you on your way to your room in minutes. My room, number 318, was comfortable, clean, quiet, and stylish. 18 foot ceilings helped the ambiance. Take a tour of Union Station with Connor, who has encyclopedic knowledge of Union Station's -- and LoDo;s -- history; book the tour through the front desk. Have a drink at the Terminal Bar or the Cooper Lounge. Enjoy Pigtrain Coffee. Mercantile Dining was also nice, with outdoor seating to enjoy Denver's sun. A note of caution: your room rate won't include Denver's high state, lodging, and tourism taxes. And there's a Historic Preservation fee on top of the taxes! You know what? The Crawford was worth it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Locations and Amazing Room Amenities,Is located in Union Station which was very easy to get there from the Airport.  My room was warm and comfortable with up upgraded TV and IPAD to get any information you needed on the City or Hotel.  Deluxe bathroom with a Rain shower head.Lots of restaurants and bars in Union Station and more walking distance.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,hip new living history,"Beautiful, grand, historic, meticulously restored, and (best of all) an efficient, functioning train station. all the charm of thoughtful restoration with the vitality and purpose of a functioning transportation hub. hotel is an easy train ride from the airport. arriving on the train somehow feels right. and no need for a car in downtown Denver; public transport is awesome! Hotel staff are exceptional! check in was effortless and friendly. had a problem with the business center computer and Anna not only offered to help, but really did the job for me (and I picked it up after the nightly ice cream parlor snack that comes with the room.) She and the other staff made us feel like long-time repeat customers. seemed like staff were having fun (even as they fielded one weary traveler after another). wonderful service had the air of what 1st class train travel may have been like when the station was in its (first) heyday.Train station complex has at least 6 restaurants, maybe more, nice pubs, a coffee shop, the aforementioned ice cream parlor and sweet shop, all top notch. tons of gluten free options btw! nightly beer at the train station pub is part of the amenities package (for which there is a charge at check-in).beautiful building, exceptional service, top tier amenities. if downtown Denver hadn't so much to offer, there'd be no reason to leave the train station!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Great Hotel,We stopped for the night on our train trip to enjoy Denver and this hotel was a real treat.  The staff was extremely warm and welcoming and eager to assist with advice on places to dine and things to see.  Exceptional service.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to stay,"Flew into Denver, took train to Union station, stayed at Crawford Hotel-a splurge for us-but what a marvelous place.  Great staff, beautifully rebuilt space in Union Station. If splurging,give it a try!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Superb...,"experience at the Crawford, in large measure due to my room and the environment but in largest measure due to the service. I’ll mention two by name: Ander and Sara.  The story began when I tried to check into the sister hotel, The Oxford. It’s perfectly ok but sometimes things just aren’t a fit and the Oxford wasn’t for me. In an effort to resolve my issues, I asked about moving over to the Crawford. It was arranged and, when I got there, the Crawford staff installed me in a superb room, one of the most beautiful and comfortable and spacious and functional rooms I have been in, in a very long time. And I have travelled over two million miles, so I know hotel rooms. The staff was courteous and helpful and just really proactive in ensuring that I had a great experience. Highly recommend and kudos. Great place, great service, fun amenities, restaurants, coffee shops, live music, all built around a working train station. One word to the ethnocentric: if you aren’t comfortable around diversity, this place isn’t for you. It is part of a working train station and there are all kinds of people there. Didn’t bother me a bit because I enjoy all walks of life. Total thumbs up. I’ll definitely be back. Loved it. My kind of place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love The Crawford,"We have stayed at The Crawford numerous times and always have a great experience. The staff is always friendly, and the location can't be beat.  We love walking downtown to great restaurants, and have utilized the complimentary Telsa for events.  Union Station has so much going on, and is usually very busy.  But once you close the door to your room, the noise is gone.  The soundproofing is top notch! Beds are super comfy and amenities well appointed.  You will not want to stay anywhere else downtown!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Charged my parents, it was supposed to be a gift","We booked a room back in October for New Year’s Eve for my parents as a Christmas gift. The room and the package was great, no complaints at all about the quality of the property or room. However, we filled out a credit card authorization form about a week in advance to make sure all their charges would be on our card (not much of a gift if you have to pay for it right?) I confirmed this with the front desk to make sure it was taken care of. I realized that my card hadn’t been charged, and on the day of check out I had to find out from my dad that they had charged him the full amount on his credit card which was the opposite of what we were going for. I had to call in three times to get to a billing person to figure it out. Finally got the charged reversed and fixed, but…",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Historical Hotel,"Can’t recommend the Crawford Hotel enough! Everything about this hotel starting first with excellent customer service, to location, dinning, bar & shopping options steps outside of a well appointed room, is simply one of the best experiences Denver has to offer! Will definitely be returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fabulous hotel in Union Station!,"This hotel is awesome!  It was my second stay there and I loved it just as much as the first stay.  They sent some champagne to our room for my husband's birthday (we were there to celebrate the occasion), and we used the free shuttle to get to our dinner destination.  Valet was a little slow fetching our car the next morning, but no huge deal.  Will stay again for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel for travelers and downtown lovers,"We were delighted with the accomodations at the Crawford.  There was a large Christmas party crowd in the Great Hall of the Union Station, but when you went to the rooms it was completely inaudible.  The soundproofing inside and out is spectacular.  The room was well appointed and the 13 foot tall windows (ours looked out on the tracks) were like a step back in time.  There are multiple restaurants in the station and many more just outside. Plus, the Tattered Cover bookstore has a small place in the station and the big store is across the street.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome Hotel!!,"My wife, son and I decided to make a quick trip to Denver and flew in.   We rode the train from the airport to the Crawford(it is so cool to take the train directly to the hotel)!! The hotel is beautiful inside and out!  The ice cream shop, coffee shop, pizza and other restaurants in the hotel are excellent and it is fun to people watch in the lobby area as so many travelers make their way thru the station!  I highly recommend the “Snooze” restaurant for breakfast!  Make sure and put your name in thru the hotel desk and reserve a table at this outstanding venue!  The breakfast is delicious!!, creative, affordable and custom made!!!  We also really enjoyed the awesome shuffleboard tables in the lobby, just take your drivers license to the bar and they give you the pucs!  The hotel Tesla X will take you within a few miles of the hotel and it is really fun to ride in!  Last but not least, perhaps the most important thing, the rooms are exceedingly quiet!  I slept better than I have ever slept at a hotel, comfortable and quiet!  I highly recommend a stay at the historic Crawford!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved the Crawford,Everything from the friendly and helpful front desk staff to the room were wonderful for our adult getaway. Marie at the front desk had great recommendations that were exactly on point for us! The extra amenities in Union Station like coffee and ice cream were icing on the cake. We will absolutely stay again when visiting Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Anniversary Getaway,Loved the Crawford...very quiet rooms even tho we were just above Union Station lobby.Nice amenities...were even able to make a reservation at Snooze (usually 1-2 hour wait).We’ll return!!Valet parking alittle slow tho.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience. Love this hotel.,"I came in for business/vacation for a few days. I'm in Denver a few times a year and this was my first time at the Crawford.  I cannot say enough about the hotel and the staff, I will definitely be back.  The room was beautiful and had an extremely comfortable bed. The convenience of being right at Union station is a huge plus.  I was very impressed with the presence of staff with their attention to detail and their genuine friendliness. Crawford will certainly be my go-to place on my future visits to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible and lovely experience at The Crawford! ,"My mom came into town and we decided to book a hotel room as a treat for her visit, and so we could be amid the energy of Union Station and all the surrounding restaurants and shops. I cannot say enough to express our satisfaction with our stay - check-in was easy and quick, our room was beautiful and unique (loved the amenity of the Polaroid camera! My mom and I had a blast taking photos - very cool), and the option of having a driver take us anywhere in the nearby area was so convenient (in a Tesla!). Every staff member of The Crawford we came across checked in with us about our stay and made sure we had everything we needed. One staff member even remembered both of our names, which helped to make the experience feel even more personal. On our departure day, we both had a bit of work to do, so we posted up in the great hall with coffees from Pig Train and enjoyed lounging on the couches and enjoying the hustle and bustle of downtown Denver. Looking forward to another stay, hopefully sooner than later! Thank you, The Crawford Hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,What a gem.,"Fantastic hotel. Great service from Jamel & Jordan. I will definitely stay here again.....next time it will be for fun, not work!!! Strategically located to fun shopping, restaurants, major sporting arenas. Easy access to public transportation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Don't pick ""Superior Classic"" or room 319","I like this hotel - I travel to work in Downtown Denver and stay here once or twice or month.  It is an interesting hotel right in the train station.  Perfect location if you fly into the airport and take the train to downtown (faster than a car in traffic, reliable, and only $10.50).  The staff is really helpful and the rooms are comfortable.But, room 319, which they call a Superior Classic is bad - it is so tiny as to be claustrophobic.  There is a desk across from the bed but the TV is on that desk so you only have about 12 inches to work.They brought me a ""welcome gift"", which is nice - and based on a preference sheet I filled out some time ago.  But, they brought me iced Green Tea (which I really don't like) because they were out of the tea I requested.  Don't get me wrong - I still think this hotel gets a Five.  I just hate this room.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Weekend Getaway,"We spent our anniversary weekend at the Crawford. Yes, it is more expensive than other area hotels, but the amenities make it worthwhile. We received free beers every happy hour at the bar located on the property. Also free ice cream (really really good ice cream) from the on-site ice cream bar, discounted food at the attached restaurant, and were driven around by Brian in the hotel's Tesla to church and to the football stadium. There is no more convenient spot to stay - you won't need a rental car as you can take the train straight there from the airport. The staff was incredible. They really make you feel special. And - the hotel itself was modern, clean and beautiful, with unique touches in the rooms that made it special - and artwork and photographs worth stopping to look at in the hallways. We highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A great unique hotel,"We stayed at the Crawford hotel after arriving in Denver via the Amtrak California Zephyr.  Since the hotel is Denver's Union Station, it was very convenient.  The hotel is basically Union Station with rooms on two sides of the great hall.  Our room door opened on corridor that was open to the main lobby, and although there was buzz of activity from the lobby, the room was very quiet!  The room had very high ceiling, maybe 12 feet.  it felt like a grand hotel room from a bygone era.  There were even little glass containers with pre-mixed cocktails and glassware in the room.There were several places to eat in Union Station.  We could look down on the hotel bar from the corridor, but we didn't get a chance to try it.  It looks really cool.If I have reason to visit Denver again, I would definitely try to stay here again.  It was a great experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Pampered bachelorette,"My bridesmaid booked this place to stay in for my bachelorette night out! It was so incredibly comfortable. They gave us a corner room and had champagne and chocolates waiting for us. The shower (I think it’s called a rain head?) was so relaxing and warm after our night of partying. I also LOVE the coopers lounge for delicious drinks and incredible (I mean INCREDIBLE) service. I was also surprised with how quiet the room was, despite being on the busy union station corridor. Slept like a baby! Will be back there soon for another staycation!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A great location for seeing Denver and the surrounding area...,"We loved the hotel and all it had to offer.  From the older vibe of the building to the bustling main lobby, we enjoyed our entire time there.We also had a great assortment of places to eat without ever going outside and I’d recommend them all.We also were able to walk to lots of places quite easily as well as places outside the city like Boulder with a rental car.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Excellent service, clean rooms and great amenities","The service I received from the staff was outstanding. Megan was as helpful, kind and personable as anyone I’ve met in the hospitality industry. The amenities the hotel has in union station are also wonderful. Overall it’s a 10/10. The staff being the best. I highly recommend this hotel for a stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Never left the building,"This was my second stay at the Crawford.  I love love love the wonderful 2014 renovation of Denver's circa 1881 Union Station, which included adding the Crawford Hotel to its upper floors.  Denver was having a heat wave when I visited, so I ended up rarely leaving the station, and then it was only to take photos of its exterior.  I slept, rested, toured and, most importantly, ate my way through the station for 2 days.  It was so convenient because I flew into Denver, then took the light rail directly from the airport to Union Station.  Departing Denver, I caught Amtrak's California Zephyr, also at Union Station.  The Crawford has no dedicated lobby.  Rather, the Great Hall of the station is its lobby/living room, and is so for all station visitors.  There is a front desk/bell area for the hotel. There are rooms in both wings of the building as well as overlooking the  Great Hall.  The rooms are on the second (a rear facing mezzanine level added just for the hotel), third (former office space with 16-foot ceilings) and fourth (former attic) floors.  The 2nd floor houses the Pullman rooms, the 3rd the Classic rooms, and the 4th the Loft rooms.Having stayed in a Pullman room my last visit, I tried a Classic room this time.  These rooms vary in size;  mine was definitely one of the smaller ones.  Also, my room's entrance overlooked the Great Hall and was directly on the path folks walk to get to the Cooper Lounge,  Luckily, the door was very heavy and muted out all but the loudest Cooper Lounge guests.  Note the hotel's 2 elevators (one per wing) and the doors to the wings all require keycard access.  Only the Great Hall rooms on the 3rd (where my room was) and 4th floors on the Cooper Lounge side do not have these secure measures, since there is a stairway to these areas accessible to all.The room was compact but comfortable.  Definitely more wear and tear was noticeable on the furnishings since my last stay.  The room received no housekeeping until I asked a housekeeper I saw in the corridor.  She was not assigned to my room but cleaned it anyway.  There is no turndown service.  All rooms are charged a $20 ""Destination Amenity Fee"" which includes a gluttony of complimentary or discounted offerings within the station or nearby.  I took advantage of the daily free scoop of ice cream at Milkbox Ice Creamery, the daily free craft beer at The Terminal Bar, and the preferred seating at Snooze, a wildly popular breakfast/brunch spot in the station.I also took the history tour of Union Station offered by the hotel and led by one of the concierges, Connor.  Very informative.  Here are the places I ate;  ACME Deli, Mercantile Dining and Provision, Milkbox Ice Creamery, Snooze an AM Eatery, Stoic and Genuine, and Ultreia.  I would eat at all of them again.  The biggest, perhaps only, niggle with Union Station is its restrooms.  There's only one set for the entire building, and that includes all the restaurants.  They are super busy and get skanky very quickly.  There used to be public restrooms in the basement as well, but these are now locked and only for use by the Crawford's basement meeting rooms.  I was so glad I could use my own bathroom in my own guestroom!Overall a great stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stay for the Experience,We stayed one night on the 3rd floor. The room was beautiful. The was a few spots in the bathroom where i noticed have been missed while cleaning. The bed was unbelievably comfy! Guest services were nice but not what i was expecting for such a fancy hotel. We ended up getting a deal but i would never pay the $450 a night. It was a great experience staying in Union Station at this historic hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,It was just fine. ,"Decent enough, but there seems to be many nicer hotels in the Lodo area, for a similar price. We stayed in a loft room, and while spacious, the one window was very small so it was extremely dark in the room, even in the mornings/daytime. The bathroom could have been cleaner - grout stains, dirty floorboards and a glass bathroom door covered in layers of sticky hairspray (I assume). Housekeeping didn’t come to clean our room until 4:30pm, which was just strange.Great overall location, but the uniqueness of staying above the old train station terminal wears off quickly as there’s no real hotel lobby - rather an open space area shared with folks waiting for the train (or just escaping the cold). The “perks” that come with staying at the hotel are great and worth the $20 per day they charge if you take advantage - free ice cream and coffee daily, and lots of discounts at local restaurants  Oh and the valet lost our rental car keys. They were nice enough to uber us to the airport, but we are waiting for them to confirm they found/returned the car, as they promised.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Daddy and Caleb see all 50 , 15th Birthday ","We travel all across the US staying only in historic hotels and this is one of our favs .  The rooms are clean , the shops and restaurants are endless and the staff is fantastic. Came for a Broncos game and didn’t get to do all we wanted.  We will be back . If your looking for a place to stay for any occasion this is the place ! Everything you are looking for and much more !",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Hotel with Great Customer Service,"A beautifully, well-executed hotel with unmatched customer service. Lots of small, thoughtful touches to make sure customers are happy. They also provide fun perks with your room, like free coffee at the coffee shop downstairs and a free scoop of ice cream each day at the ice cream shop in the atrium. The location and amenities are ideal. I couldn't hear anything in my room, amazingly, despite the nearby access to bars and restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A perfect anniversary stay!,"We live right outside of the Denver Metro region. It was our 1st wedding anniversary and we wanted to celebrate. We had been to Union Station a couple times before but had not stayed at the hotel. It was easy to check in and get to our rooms. The room was  ""old timey"" but contemporary. It was clean, nice and comfortable. We spent the entire evening just within the hotel. We had dinner at Stoic & Genuine, had cocktails at The Cooper Lounge (A MUST DO!!) and then had a night cap at the Terminal Bar. In the morning, we ate breakfast at Snooze and then headed out around downtown on scooters. It was a great day/evening at the Crawford Hotel and I can wholeheartedly recommend it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,My Favorite Hotel In Denver,"The Crawford is hands down my favorite hotel in Denver. It is conveniently located right in Union Station with access to all my favorite bars and restaurants. The room was absolutely beautiful! I love taking baths and the large freestanding tub was heaven. JD at the front desk provided professional and courteous service and made sure we were comfortable and felt at home. The room was just beautiful, reminiscent of its historical past but updated with modern amenities and style. I'm already planning our next stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver's shining star,"The Crawford Hotel is 1st class....friendly, efficient, accommodating staff.  Beautiful hotel located within Union Station.   So much to do right here or walking distance to so much.  The rooms are unique, clean, comfortable, beautiful.  The staff couldn't be better.  Complimentary transportation within 2 miles.  Best place in Denver for top-notch enjoyment.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Union Station,I had a great experience here!  Rooms are very unique and quite spacious.  The lobby still acts as a functioning depot and there are great shops/restaurants/bars.  The staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly.  Overall this was a fantastic trip!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Historic Landmark in a Great Location,"Hospitality from the front desk was lacking for the cost to stay at this establishment.  This place stays busy all hours of the day so if you are looking for somewhere low-key, this is not the place for you.  So the Crawford Hotel use to be the old train station...and still is a train station with the hotel.  The amtrak is at the back of the hotel and there is an amtrak office in the hotel.  The open sitting area of the old train station remains a sitting area for people for the train, for the restaurants on the ground floor, or just for people coming to marvel at the historic building.  The shops on the ground floor consist of an ice cream shop, coffee/pastry shop, brewery, clothes shops, etc.  When staying at this hotel, there are daily resort fees that are charged.  Some items that the resort fees cover is:  2 bottle waters a day, scoop of ice cream per person in room per day, cup of coffee per person in room per day, 2 glasses of craft beer per day and other items.  The hotel is located in a central area where you can walk to many hot spots or take the ""mall"" trolley.  The mall trolley is free and is located right at the corner of this property.  While we were there, they had a farmers market set up on the saturday in the courtyard.  Valet parking was easy and available.  The only downfall with valet parking was that if you were not at your car when they sent a text that it was ready then they would take your car back and park it.  My mother was with us on this trip and in a wheelchair and we had to send someone out to the car a couple of times to make sure they did not return the car.  The reason we did not give the hotel 5 stars is because of the hospitality.  They saw my mother in a wheelchair and saw that she was sick and left her out in the chaos of the lobby instead of trying to get her in a quiet area or trying to do anything to help her.  Would I ever stay here again?  Maybe....but not at the price point that they are current charging which is about $250-$300 per night.  If I received a trip from work or the rooms were less than $200 per night then I may stay there again.  This location is for people wanting to be in the middle of the action in Denver and don't mind the constant overflow of people or noise.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A night like no other!,"My spouse and I had the best time at The Crawford. We've stayed at may 5-star hotels around the world, and this was a really special and unique experience... especially because we are from Denver, and this was just a stay-cation! We were able to bring to our dog, were given complimentary or discounted items at all of the neighboring food and coffee venues at Union Station, and had a really great night in the middle of the city. From a luxurious red leather loveseat that we sipped champagne on, to the amazing bubble bath with aromatherapy in their gorgeous bathroom, every detail was paid attention to and made for a spectacular stay.I would recommend the Crawford to anyone looking for professional, courteous staff and beautiful, memorable rooms and amenities. And don't forget to get a cocktail at the Cooper Lounge, with it's ridiculously beautiful chandeliers, windows, and woodwork!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Really interesting experience,"Hotel is inside the Union Train Station which was a really interesting experience, you can see the train tracks from your room. Isolation is great though so you will not be bothered by noise.Location is amazing, downtown a few blocks from the Coors Baseball Stadium. I would say best location in Denver.Room includes a free beer at a restaurant downstairs as well as free scoop of Ice Cream. You can also avail of a Tesla shuttle service for free within 2 miles of the hotel. Convenient as well if you going to the airport as you can take the train straight from the hotel.One of the front desk ladies could have been friendlier upon check-in, most of the others were very friendly.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Decent hotel inside the train station,"I didn’t realize that the hotel reception is actually located inside the main train station lobby. I didn’t see any signage outside the station indicating that hotel check in was outside, so I was confused at first. Once I figured it out, I went to check in. My room wasn’t ready yet and they said they would call when it was. They finally called about 15 minutes after the official check in time. My room was expensive for what it was. The room was nice, no complaints, but some of the furnishings were pretty scratched, I couldn’t get the internet to work (had to have the front desk person come up to my room to get it to work), and the bathroom was small. Again, it was nice, but seemed like a lot to spend for what it was. Also, you get charged a mandatory service fee that gives you discounts and coupons to local service providers, but if you’re in and out like I was, then you’re paying for things you’re not going to have the time to go take advantage of. Not a bad place to stay - the location is great. But it’s also not the best. I wouldn’t stay there on my own dime, but for a business trip, it was just fine.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Nothing short of amazing,"Hotel staff, especially JD, was pleasurable and made the experience memorable for our trip. The additional amenities were amazing as well! Tesla, ice cream, coffee, and much more. Highly recommend this place if you’re staying in downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stay Cation,"We had a wonderful one night stay at the Crawford. We live in Denver but, wanted to have a stay-cation for our Anniversary. The room was comfortable, and clean. To our surprise we even received a complimentary bottle of Champagne to celebrate our special day! Would highly recommend staying here for any occasion! :0)",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,What I had hoped it would be,"Spent three nights at the Crawford.  My intention was too stay at the hotel and make full use of all of the amenities offered, which I managed to do quite well.  The Crawford hotel is housed inside of Union Station in the ""LoDo"" section of downtown Denver.  I arrived from DEN via the train which is ridiculously convenient as you can take directly from the airport to the front doors of the hotel in 37 minutes.  Union Station was lovingly and meticulously restored The station house re-opened in the summer of 2014 as a combination of the 112-room Crawford Hotel, several restaurants and retailers, and a train hall. Inspired by three different periods of Union Station’s history, the Crawford accommodations offer guests various different room types from snug to roomy suites.  The small reception area was staffed by friendly and professional staff, room service and housekeeping were friendly and timely and the daily destination amenity fee that is added to your bill includes ""free"" perks like coffee, adult drink and ice cream.  Once could, as I did, not leave the Union Station and have all your needs met.  I plan to return and check out the other room options.  During this stay I booked a suite located on the third floor, which appears to be considerably quieter than the rooms facing the waiting area of Union Station.  Overall, I was delighted w my stay at the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beware but lovely ,I stayed for business as the venue was here in union station. The Crawford is an old restored historic hotel with its lobby being a train station. I arrived after midnight and the lobby was filled with what looked like homeless and others traveling late.The area is patrolled by security but it wasn’t too welcoming.The say the hotel is secure as the elevatorwill not let you upstairs with a key but a large staircase is wide open .It’s very noisy from the bars in the lobby.Room is nice but noise still came in.Thank goodness I have a sound app so it drowned the noise out In am the lobby is fun and the hotel has free stuff at restaurants like ice cream and a coffee .In the afternoon one of the staff (Brandon?) used the hotels Tesla to drop me off in the rino area where there is art in buildings and alleyways  Wry funHe would have picked me up but easy walk backSo service and s very good !,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Revisiting Denver,"We were back at The Crawford for our annual visit to Denver and just when you thought the service couldn’t get any better, it did!  The entire staff was so wonderful! They made sure we had everything we needed and more!  They were so helpful with information about where their amazing Tesla could take us around the city. We enjoyed having coffee in the early morning and ice cream in the evening relaxing in the Great Hall. We loved being able to stroll down the street to see the Rockies play at Coors Field. It was a great time staying with the Crawford “family” again!  Can’t wait for next year!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Incredible Hotel, Incredible Location","The Crawford is a truly unique hotel experience in the newly renovated Downtown Denver Union Station.  Its centrally located, packed with amenities and has an incredible style and quality of service.  It is the best hotel I've ever stayed at, and thankfully the staff is not arrogant about it. They work hard to provide you with 5 star service.  You do get what you pay for.  Make sure to ask what perks are included, because there are a LOT of them.  Especially the complimentary Tesla Model X car service, and ability to get next day reservations at Snooze (among many others).  Also the bed is amazingly comfortable and the privacy and security is outstanding considering its location.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Denver,"This hotel is amazing! We were greeted warmly and the staff attended promptly to any request we had, while informing us of the many extras that come with your stay. They arranged a stylish ride for us, breakfast at Snooze in the morning with no wait (with their priority seating, we avoided waiting over an hour), along with a nice bottle of wine in our room when we arrived. The room itself was beautiful and comfortable, while holding some original charm. We slept so well in this bed! The location is also incredible. The restaurants and bars, and seating and shuffle board, the coffee and ice cream all inside make it so you never want to leave. I only wish I could have stayed longer!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Extraordinary Service, beautiful hotel, comfortable beds","I arranged for our entire family to stay here during our Mothers memorial- a tough time. John in reservations was so patient as I made many room changes as family members changed their plans. Margot at the front desk was so kind as I checked in and was a mess- walked me to my room. The next day, there was a gorgeous bouquet that we took to the church with us. Connor at the front desk made sure everything was as easy as it could be given the circumstances. The room was very comfortable- and was again as I stayed here again 2 weeks later. Can't say enough about this place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Good Vibe Good Location,"We have stayed at the Crawford Hotel/Union Station 3 times while visiting Denver for business and extended family visits. I love this hotel. The location is great. Surrounded by great walkable restaurants. Close to shopping on Larimer St. Close to Coors Stadium. Inside the hotel are several restaurants, coffee shop, ice cream shop and several other browsable areas. The interior is truly a train station. It’s very lively yet the rooms are quiet. In addition, they offer a free Tesla ride within any two mile area which was very nice. Now for the negative.  The rooms a quite dark and the lighting isn’t great. If you are a hair person like myself please bring your hair dryer as they offer a very cheap conair which hardly blows any air.  Our room this time was very warm and we couldn’t seem to regulate the air conditioning. The shower has an overhead rain head which was dripping freezing cold water on my head during my shower.  Lastly, ok this is silly but we had some cute and delicious chocolates the first night after our turn down. The other nights we just had a bucket of ice. Not sure what that was for but we missed the chocolates.We will stay here again as my husband has business in Denver. Give it a try.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique Hotel,"The lobby is wonderful, with a warm vibe, many shops, and a comfortable amount of hustle and bustle. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. However, the mattress moves when the other person turns over. Aside from this inconvenience, I highly recommend this hotel.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Checked The Crawford off our Bucket List,"I grew up in Denver so I can remember going to Union Station to pickup and drop off relatives riding the train in the 1950's and 60's, before air travel was available. Now that it's been remodeled and it's the transportation hub for the area my wife and I had to stay in The Crawford Hotel. We rode the train downtown and spent a night in The Crawford. We enjoyed lot's of good entertainment and restaurants in and around Union Station.  The next morning we enjoyed breakfast on the patio at Snooze, then rode the train home. The room was nice. We appreciated the character and ambiance. Service was good. It was fun to stay in the building that provided me so many good memories over the years. We're so glad that Union Station was preserved and is such a cool place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Downtown Denver,"I was in Denver for a wedding and stayed downtown at Union Stations Crawford hotel. Getting there was a snap there is a rail line that takes you from the airport to Union Station. The Crawford Hotel is in Union Station.It is right where you want to be. The 16th street mall is right there.  Bars and clubs abound on Blake street. Killer restaurants are nearby (see review of ""the kitchen""). And if you don't want to leave Union Station there are restaurants and shops and bars right in there.As far as rooms, the room I had was good but not great but the price was very reasonable. It was clean, and service was good. The staff was very helpful in every interaction I had with them.Also, if you like to people watch, it's awesome cause people are coming and going all the time.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel and location ,"Just spent one night, but enjoyed all aspects of our stay.  Union Station is a fun location with lots to offer - we had fabulous sandwiches and sweet potato fries from the Terminal Bar, and great local beers on draft. Enjoyed the amenities offered as guests at the Crawford - from free ice cream to a late night cocktail at Cooper Lounge. Took the Union Station history tour which was excellent and well worth the associated fee.  We’ll be back!  Thank you to Monica, who helped guide me through our reservation process and made excellent suggestions for our visit.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Be in the middle of it all!,"We've always wanted to stay here and with grandma in town watching the kids we had the perfect reason to get away for a couple nights! The location can't be beat and it's really fun to be right in the middle of everything in Denver...or have a quick ride/transportation to everything else. The rooms were great and the amenities were a nice touch, coffee downstairs and drinks at the bar. We were able to check out a little late and got to enjoy an extra hour before heading back home. We'll be back and we can't wait to book again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect ,"Perfect location, really nice rooms. So many restaurants and pubs nearby (and within the station). Jumped on some Lyft scooters right outside and toured the area. Excellent airport and Fiddler’s Green access with the train right there. Loved the complimentary extras like the ice cream, coffee and pints from Terminal. The vibe was terrific! We’ll be back for sure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver’s Best,"I have been traveling to Denver for work approximately 15-20 times a year for the past five years. I have tried several hotels but my first choice is The Crawford. And it’s by a winner by a wide margin. Their five star starts with Marie and her entire staff ALWAYS providing five star service at every  point, reservations,  check in, breakfast, room selection, car service,etc. The rooms are unique and more than comfortable, well appointed, and spacious. Many thank yous to Marie and The Crawford staff for making me feel right at home so many times.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Absolutely brilliant in every way,"This has to rate as one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.  From checking , in to reluctantly checking out,  we enjoyed every minute of our stay. The staff are delightful , friendly, helpful , go the extra mile. The rooms fabulous - we had a loft  - the space was fabulous we just enjoyed being in it. The concourse the hotel,overlooks amazing - comfy sofas, games, tables and chairs , live band - people coming and going, catching trains, lots of life. Surrounding the concourse were bars (a beer at 5 pm with your room card) coffee shops (a cup each a day) an ice cream shop - (delicious a scoop a day) , a flower shop, a cocktail bar and top notch restaurants (The Mercantile being but one) hope you’re getting the picture. As I said in the title brilliant in every way - wish I had an excuse to fly back to Denver on a regular basis to just stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top Notch destination,"Denver has become a frequent destination and I have recently discovered The Crawford Hotel in Union Station.  From the great vibe of Union Station, welcome smiles from the front desk staff (uncanny ability to remember names), to the uniquely designed rooms, The Crawford is a gem.  Kudos to the entire team for making my stay so enjoyable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome place to stay,"This hotel is THE place to stay in Denver.  It is so convenient to everything!  Amazingly quiet in my room even with all of the activity surrounding the hotel.  The staff is very attentive, room was very clean and spacious, and the service all around was excellent.  I highly recommend the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,"I have been coming to Denver almost every other week on business for almost five years and The Crawford is my favorite hotel.   For starters, there is NO more convenient hotel for a business traveler flying into DIA.  Get off your plane, get on the train and 32 minutes (and $10.50 in RTD fare) you are at Union Station AND at The Crawford (by the way, that beats the pants off of an $80 Uber Black ride).   Then there's The Crawford; almost every room is different; this is no cookie-cutter hotel.  Rooms have 18 foot ceilings, cast iron bath tubs AND large showers.   Refrigerator and coffee maker in every room.  Also, FOUR great restaurants to choose from in the lobby (plus an ice cream shop and a sandwitch shop) and two fantastic bars.  The vibe in the lobby is hard to describe but urban chick is as close as I can get.  And then there is the service.  Whether you are looking for an early checked in, a late check out, a restaurant reservation or a ride to a business meeting (in one of their Tesla's!) the front desk and other staff are the friendliest, most helpful folks you will meet in Denver (much of it no doubt due to Marie, the Director of Operations) who is the type of employee every employer dreams about!   Do yourself a solid and make your next stay in Denver one that includes the Crawford; you'll be glad you did!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Historic and unique; luxury with a twist,"Stayed here before a conference, just to experience the hotel and union station.  Both have been renovated extensively, with great attention to detail and historical accuracy.  The hotel is a new concept, yet it is built in to pre-existing rooms from the original union station, creatively using existing space to provide three different kinds of rooms: loft rooms, classic rooms with tall windows and great natural light (I stayed in one of these), and Pullman rooms (smaller, but very cool rooms that mimic a sleeper car of the past and have windows looking out on the trains).  The hotel takes itself and its guests seriously, and aims to please.  They have a number of arrangements with restaurants and businesses in Union Station, such that the entire station becomes a large hotel lobby for hotel guests.  The room I stayed in was well appointed and comfortable, with an excellent shower and tub, and large windows with a great view out to the train tracks.  My bathroom actually featured an old safe built in to the wall - from when the space was an office years ago.  The bed was comfortable, and technology worked in the room.  If you enjoy renovated historical buildings, and a high class hotel, this is a place to put on your list.  Consider taking out one of the electric bikes in the morning to see the city; and take the 1 hour historic tour of Union Station led by the concierge!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful surprise,What a nice surprise! Super central and great history. Located in busy and hip Union Station but ultraquiet in the Loft. We took advantage of a few of the wonderful amenities. Jordan took great care of us and everyone we interacted with seemed happy and was knowledgeable. The staff did everything they could to make our stay even better.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel,"Loved the location, history, amenities and staff. Easy walk to great restaurants and Coors Field. Will be back for sure. Loved the downstairs bar and the room on 3rd floor was amazing - wood beams and all",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel!,"I loved this hotel. Elegant, quiet rooms with train station or city views. The Lobby is Union Station with lots of eating and people watching opportunities. Great coffee, good ice cream, lovely “pub’, The choices are varied, but all excellent...even a flower shop!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Larry's places to stay at,"Well to start it was my wife's & mine 45 wedding anniversary on July 13. I love going to see any where they have a baseball game so I look up the Colorado Rockies baseball schedule, I told my wife if I could see the Rockies on July 12 I would take her shopping on our anninversay so it work out great so i found the hotel it was real nice & clean u name it it was great.  So we got to the Hotel they had Valet parking I had a problem with that. So the hotel took us Downtown Denver and they pick us up. It's was cool but we want to pay cash for our room but it didn't happen. We was upset about that. Our bill was pretty high. So the next time we will stay somewhere it's not too high.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top Notch Service,"The Crawford knows how to provide exceptional service. Beginning before we even booked our stay and continued even after checking out. The extra care the staff shows only enhanced our wonderful stay. The location can not be beat. Walking distance to wonderful restaurants, bars and entertainment. The A train outback made traveling from the airport to the hotel a breeze! Our room was cozy, clean and had great details with exposed brick and beams. I’ve seen other reviews speaking of the hotel being noisy but we didn’t experience that at all. Once the door shut it was like the outside world disappeared. This hotel and staff has quickly risen to one of our favorites. We will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Historic Hotel,"Loved our stay at the crawford, beautiful room, great amenities, in the heart of downtown and can hop right on the A Line from the back of the hotel and catch a ride to the airport. Grab a drink at Terminal Bar, some great people watching and a huge selection of craft Colorado beers.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Modern amenities with vintage features,Myself and my parents had stayed here in 2015 and came back this year to experience it again. The rooms are well-kept and seem just as new as they were back then. The iPads are a great touch for techies that make it feel even nicer!! There's soo much to do close by the hotel as the area has an awesome bar and restaurant scene. Definitely a hotel you can stay in without a car and still experience a lot just by walking! Love the Union Station building it's located in as well.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome!,"What a great place. The Crawford was recommended by a good friend. I am so glad I called him. What a fantastic place. The rooms was small but gorgeous. Sound proof & can’t hear anything from the trains outside the window. Service was off the charts great. The hotel is in Union Station. What a great place union station is. Fun, vibrant and definitely the hot central spot in Denver. Five minute walk to the Rockies game, food scene everywhere within a few blocks. We will stay here again and again. We are use to NYC small hotels and this meets or beats any NYC experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent place to stay!,"This hotel went above and beyond to make our stay sensational.Check in was quick and easy, room was clean & modern. The free ice cream/beer while people watching was brilliant. Be sure to use the courtesy Tesla, the driver Riley was a Star!⭐️ We’ll most definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Waay overpriced and overrated ,"Bailed on New Orleans because of hurricane. Last minute— Denver seemed right. Crawford $500/ nite!!Asked to have house car take us to dinner. Front desk said sure. Show up at valet. They knew we were scheduled. Stand around for 15 minutes. The guy pulls up. Says he is busy. We should have taken an Uber. He parks and walks off. Valet just shrugged and walked off. Thanks. Cooper lounge. What a rip off!! Then the waitress tried to short change me. Today I get back to the room at 2:45. Not made up. Call front desk. “Oh, they make up the empty rooms first. “ I guess the people who aren’t here pay more. Not staying here again!!",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, haughty front desk","Great location. Union Station is breathtaking and its amenities are fabulous.  My Pullman room was adequate, but overpriced. My chief complaint concerns attitudes of  people at the front desk.  My face-to-face interactions with them felt as if I was interrupting them from conversations they'd rather be having with each other.  When I checked out, the person at the desk was superficially polite, but didn't ask if I had enjoyed my stay at The Crawford nor encourage me to stay with them again.   There are many hotels along the 16th St. Mall, easily accessible by free shuttle buses.  I will choose one of those hotels the next time I'm in Denver and include Union Station on my itinerary because of its stunning beauty, shops, and excellent restaurants.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,great spot,"terrific stay.  only steps away from the train.....and surrounded by good food/bars etc.  a few freebies too with your hotel stay.  While the weather was fine when I was there, had it been raining, I think I could have gone (by train) from baggage claim to hotel check in without getting wet.  Probably a nice bonus during the winter.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location but.....,"Beautiful property and great location.But:1.  They obviously change the sheets but not the bedding.   There was a coffee cup lid between the quilt and the base of the bed.2.  Check out was a real hassle.   My wife and I stayed there for one night on the ""bed and breakfast"" special but it took 3 people to get us checked out as they bill separately for valet parking and breakfast and they then deduct it from your folio only if you notice their error.    The special provides a Snooze breakfast delivered to your room.   In reality it is a $40 credit which barely covers the fees and service charges.   While you can eat a wonderful breakfast for 2 at Snooze for $40, the hotel does not disclose the fees and service charges that they tack on.    I signed a $39 charge at room service delivery and was surprised by the extra fees and service charges at checkout.    Really?",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location & historic vibe,"Stayed here one night this week, had a great stay. Although the train station & plaza are very lively throughout the full day, guest rooms are very quiet. Great food shops in the station, including select free items with your room key. Location is easily walkable to Milk Market, Coors Field, Larimar Square. We were in a Pullman Room; loved the art deco/Regency details on the furniture & decor. Only downside: the beds are advertised as queen size, but it was the smallest Queen I've ever slept in. Not sure if Murphy-style beds run smaller? Felt like we were sleeping in a Full size bed. There is a cute Farmers Market on the plaza Saturday mornings, and several great breakfast options. Make sure you tell the hotel that you want priority seating at Snooze the following morning--the food looks delicious and the wait is over an hour on weekend mornings without it. Loved the charm of the train station, all of the great food & walking options nearby, and REALLY loved how easy it was to stroll outside and hop on the train to DIA. Staff was all very friendly, very helpful especially Margot. We checked in early and they had our room ready several hours before the guaranteed time.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Retro hipster vibe but lapses in service,"Interesting location and there are a lot of things to do at Union Station. Light rail can take you to many spots in Denver. The rooms (I saw several) vary in size and amenities. In some the furniture is wearing pretty badly. Some staff were accommodating, others had a lot of attitude. I was double billed and had to call a manager to get the extra charge removed.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,All Aboard - Sleep at the Train Station!!,"Friends told us to stay at the Crawford - suggesting a truly unique experience.  WOW - they were right!  The hotel is embedded in Union Station in the heart of LoDo - easy walk to Coors Field, the Pepsi Center or the 16th Street Pedestrian Mall.  Union Station was totally renovated in 2014 and is a very active Amtrak and commuter station.  The front desk is tucked in with the many shops, restaurants and bars surrounding the spacious 4 story atrium.  Our 4th floor Loft Suite was a split level design with closets, minibar/fridge on one level and then a few steps up to the sitting area, bedroom and bathroom.  The exposed structural wooden beams and slanted ceilings gave the room a great feel.  We were concerned that the noise from the atrium might carry into the room - but the rooms are located behind a keyed doorway that completely blocked this hustle and bustle from below and an added level of security.Be sure to take advantage of the Tesla car service - a treat if the weather doesn't cooperate or you need to get a bit further away - they'll drive you in style within a couple of miles of the hotel.I have to mention the front desk staff.  In 40+ years of travel I can't recall a front desk person introducing themselves to me - of course you always get the 'welcome to the x hotel, and thanks for being a member of our frequent stayer program etc.' - but Dusk and JD went that one step further and gave us their names along with the standard warm welcome.  A very nice touch.  Be sure to say hi to them for me :)",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect 3 Days in Denver,"Visiting Denver for a wedding and a friend recommended the Crawford.  We loved the ease of taking the light rail from the airport directly to the hotel.  The hotel is located in the amazingly refurbished Union Station.  There is a small check in desk within the lobby.  Margo was wonderfully accommodating and all staff members were helpful and full of tips for getting around.  Room accommodations include  many extra amenities found throughout the station including a morning cup of coffee and a daily scoop of fantastic ice cream.  Complimentary rides within a 2-3 mile radius in a Tesla is an additional perk.  Our driver, Riley, was prompt and hospitable.  Rooms are on the smaller side, but not uncomfortably so.  There is a beautiful grand Whole Foods less than a block away. Running path on the river two blocks away.  A ton of hip eating options and the free trolley down 16th Street.  Looking forward to future visits to Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Stay,Our stay at the Crawford was great! The room we stayed in (The LoDo Suite) was beautiful and really highlighted the beautiful aspects of this amazing historic building. The walkability was perfect- there were so many places to explore. We were driven to a bar in ballpark area and the ride there was d.O.p.E. In was in the courtesy Tesla with the raptor doors!!The on-site amenities are incredible - great ice cream bar and a liquor bar! We got preferred seating at Snooze AM eatery the next morning - a great way to top it all off!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Stay - Beautiful Rooms and Helpful Staff,"My partner and I stayed at the Crawford on our honeymoon this past May. We had an unexpected cancellation of our reservation, but it was reinstated and the front desk staff was very helpful in getting that fixed. JD and Margot were especially great and helped us with finding vegetarian restaurant options. The room was beautiful and we enjoyed the convenient location to many Denver attractions. FYI leave your Chromecast at home. You can stream through the TVs. Also there is no parking garage or lot. Instead there is valet which is on the north side of Wynkoop street. Make sure you also take advantage of the free perks like the drip coffee, happy hour beer, and ice cream.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Why would you stay anywhere else?,"I'm never one to post reviews or anything but I felt compelled to talk about how great my experience was! This hotel sits right inside of the train station where the airport train lets you off at and the convenience level was absolutely amazing. The rooms were spotless and the breakfast joint in there was superb. THEY EVEN HAVE A TESLA! We had Dan, the hotel Tesla guy take us out to eat and to a jazz bar called Nocturne. He was extremely knowledgeable and one of the most polite people we've ever met. Cool accent too. Upon check-out, we had a tall gentleman named J.D. assist us and he even offered water to us upon exit. I will never stay anywhere else when I visit Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Elegant accommodations!,"We chose the Crawford for its convenient location in Union Station since we were flying into DIA and leaving the next morning on Amtrak. We were upgraded to a delightful queen room. With the historic setting and the quiet elegance, we found just what were looking for in a lovely hotel. Next time we’ll stay longer to take advantage of all the amenities and the many places to visit in downtown Denver. Gracious staff, comfortable bed, and near the eclectic train station waiting area made the Crawford a perfect place to start our railroad themed vacation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Spend the Money. It is totally worth every cent.,"I was in Denver for the weekend. I didn't have a hotel. I took the train into the city from DIA and was at Union Station. I just saw The Crawford. It was about 7:30 AM on Saturday morning. I figured if they didn't no big deal, just keep walking. If they had a room I figured I could just store my bag and come back later. Not only did they have a room but she gave me an upgrade. She also gave me the room right away. I found an amazing room (308) on the third floor. The room was spotlessly clean, cool and very quiet - despite the very busy street below. There was an IPad for me to use. The hotel has amazing little amenities such as a free beer in the bar or a free ice cream. Need a ride? They have a Tesla and will take you there for free - provided it is within 2 miles of the hotel. For breakfast, Snooze, located in Union Station, was awesome! Can you get a cheaper hotel? Sure, you could. Don't. It is worth every cent you pay to stay here. The staff is fantastic and the location is the BEST!. I can't wait to stay there again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Outstanding,"Everything about our stay was outstanding.  Location, accommodations, Union Station is great fun, and, more than anything, the staff at the Crawford was went way above and beyond at every opportunity.  We picked the hotel for convenience from the RTD train.  We will go back for everything they has to offer.  I can't recommend the hotel highly enough.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,10 Star Review,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Crawford Hotel.  The front desk staff was always helpful and welcoming.  We really appreciated the amenities from the Tesla transportation and the valet services to the drink specials and the ice cream treat.  The atmosphere is energetic and always exciting plus the rooms are gorgeous and amazingly quiet.  We highly recommend this hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel Ever,"Wow oh wow!  Where do I start!  I have seen the grandeur of the Crawford so many times in passing while going between places near Union Station (for work trips) in the past.  Finally, I had the opportunity to stay that the exquisite Crawford Hotel, and it was even better than I imagined.  The Crawford has a unique vibe about it which I have not experienced anywhere else.  It is at a real, working train station, so that is marvelous in itself that the planners managed to figure out how to meld the flow of the workers in transit together with the folks there with less hurried schedules, and create a lovely mix of energy and ambiance in its symbiosis.  I also got to learn its history a bit - that the station dates back to turn of the century train transit; and the hotel itself is actually very new - starting only in the last 5 years renovation work.  The rich history together with the beautiful neoclassical architecture and decor make the experience one definitely for bucket lists.  I have often thought to myself - this reminds me of Disneyland - so beautiful and cute, but it is REAL!  One other person we ran into in the course of my stay (while getting our free ice cream :-P) remarked the same thing about it feeling all very surreal and fantastical.  The customer service of the hotel was very awesome.  At check-in, the hostess walked us, guiding us to our room, while describing all the free things included with the stay.  She made us feel very welcome there, which was nice since we had been traveling for such a long time.  The views are breathtaking anywhere at the Crawford - whether through the window, or just looking down to the terminal of Union Station.  I had a wonderful time just walking around Union Station at night admiring the beauty of everything, while proud of America's rail transit heritage.  When at Crawford/Union Station I can really see how other cities/metros would be wise to imitate what Denver Union and the Crawford have done with their transit/infrastructure planning!  Oh, and the Tesla ride/driver which we used for getting to/from dinner one of the nights was very enjoyable as well!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Stay!,"The Crawford Hotel located in the Denver Union Station is a unique hotel in a great historic location.  We stayed in a Pullman Room, which was clean, comfortable, roomy, and nicely decorated. Bathroom was spacious with nice amenities and a large shower.  Hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  The train station provided the perfect setting for one-stop dining and lounging.  A little pricey, but worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful renovation of historic train station,"My husband and I were embarking on a week long trip to ride excursions trains in Colorado and New Mexico, so we stayed at the Crawford for our first night in Denver.  The hotel is located in the renovated train station, which seemed like the perfect place to begin our journey.  My husband is the train fan, and he really enjoyed staying at the station and learning about all the intermodal transportation options that come together there.  Our room was on an upper floor in the building, and must have been an office before it was converted to a hotel.  The room was not large, but was very well appointed, with a lovely bathroom and very comfortable bed.  It was quiet and well-designed.  When you arrive at the Crawford, it takes someone to show you where the hotel front-desk is located, as it is off to the side of the train waiting area.  Service was prompt and cheerful from the staff.  The main level of the station has a number of bars and restaurants, so it is very convenient that way.  The only negative is the price--it is over $400 a night (including parking) for a fairly small but nice room.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun in Denver,"Great time at the Crawford.  Really fun to stay in a high end hotel with a train station for a lobby.  Best part was complimentary TESLA to get us around town.  Riley, aka Tyler the TESLA driver is da BEST.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Outstanding,"Let’s start with the Crawford Hotel’s price which is on the higher end. With that said every single facet of the hotel met or exceeded our expectations for the price. The rooms were very comfortable, well appointed, and quiet (a big concern based on the location). The staff were all top notch and there are to many amenities to take advantage of in under a week’s stay. I would strongly recommend the historical tour of Union Station (1 hour) to give you an appreciation for the site. Also take advantage of the Hotel’s Tesla X to get you to and from dinner. We have stayed at a number of Denver Hotels and the Crawford is our new favorite. Certainly worth singling out are Dusk (excellent service at the front desk), Conlin (sp) (an outstanding tour guide and  concierge), and Riley (our Tesla driver). Well done.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel for staying in downtown Denver and walking distance to everything,"Great hotel and very posh.  Would give it a five star, but had a little bit of an issue with valet (tough place to park on a weekend due to crowds for ball games and getting to valet) but that's mainly not the hotel's fault.  Staff was extremely attentive to details and helped us by personally escorting us to our room (front desk staff, not bell hop).  The bar on 2nd floor overlooking the terminal was great.  If you are going to a Rockies game, great place to reside for a weekend series.  Also, they give you lots of perks that can be used at the terminal shops/restaurants.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Cool location, okay rooms, bad room service","I stayed at the Crawford because I like Union Station and the location is very central, but the room was dark and very basic for the price.  I was also very unhappy about the ""room service."" One, it's delivery, not room service.  Then, I ordered breakfast from Snooze and the order took over an hour.  Then, it was the wrong order and we had no plastic silverware.  I complained and got a partial refund, but it was disappointing.  The one good thing was that we were able to get a reservation at Snooze, which is only possible for hotel guests.  That was a good experience.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for a romantic getaway in Denver,I could not have asked for better service from the reception desk. They were so polite and recognized my husband and I's needs and desires. We wanted a special night downtown to ourselves and they made sure to make us feel comfortable. The room was so perfect and we felt like we had a very personal touch. We were a little concerned that the rooms were going to be loud being so close to the station but it was completely quiet.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel and great location in LoDo!,"We loved our stay at the Crawford Hotel at Union Station. We stayed for three nights during Memorial Holiday.   Our room was a King Superior Loft on the Fourth floor.   The room isn't huge but we had plenty of space.   The room was very quiet and the bed quite comfortable.   Because I am a light sleeper - I actually prefer having minimal windows in the loft room.  If you need plenty of sunshine - you might opt for one of the Classic rooms instead.     Only negative was housekeeping seemed to half way do our room one day.   Bathroom was cleaned and towels replaced but missed making the bed all together and didn't leave any extra toilet tissue.   This doesn't take away from my star rating though but could be improved.  You do pay a daily resort fee but you receive a free daily beer at the Terminal Bar, free morning coffee at PigTrain,  and free daily ice cream at MilkBox (all within Union Station) as well as discounts offered at other local restaurants.   The Cooper Lounge was closed during our stay so I can't comment on that.   We loved Snooze for breakfast every day.    We took the train (RTD)  from Denver Airport.  Cost $21 for two people each way but so easy and brings you directly to Union Station.  Takes about 40 minutes. Check-in to the Crawford is immediately on your left as you enter Union Station from the Train.  LoDo is a perfect area to stay in Denver.  We walked every where with ease.   We enjoyed Illegal Hamburgers for lunch and Seven Grand Whisky Bar and The Cruise Room at the Oxford Hotel for cocktails.   16th Street Mall is walking distance but find that area more touristy and not really something we were interested in.  If you have some downtime and want to unwind - grab a drink from the terminal bar at Union Station, grab a pizza from Acme Pizza also at Union Station and sit on the benches playing cards, people watching or listening to free live music.   Coors Stadium is walking distance to Union Station.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Location and Room Size AMAZING!!,"We spent three glorious nights in Denver. I loved this hotel. We went straight from airport to the hotel for $10.50 a ticket and because the station is right at the hotel it was so convienent. Check in was a breeze, lots of free promotions when we checked in. The  lobby was full of travelers, tourists, homeless people, working people. I really enjoyed that all sorts of people can use this area. Lots of seating, free wifi, games. We ate breakfast at the coffee shop which was quick and great service! We also ate at two different restaurants in the hotel which had great food and fun to sit outside and watch people go by. Free yoga class on Saturdays. Rooms were huge, bathrooms nice. Just a great hotel.  I would highly recomend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Cannot fault this hotel,"My husband and I came to Denver for a short visit and we’re really happy we chose to stay at The Crawford. Really like the location and our room was great too. The hotel staff on the front desk were always polite and friendly and very knowledgable. The $20 daily amenity charge gets you a lot of things so we were happy to pay this. We booked a table at the Snooze am eatery and really enjoyed the food there. The Terminal Bar was great too, and the ice cream place! Thank you for an enjoyable stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for travelers,"Easy to get to from the airport via light rail.  Super convenient to anything you could want.  Wonder proximity to 16th st Mall.  Beautiful, comfortable and clean.  Property is priced right.  We loved it.  You also get a 1 free beer per guest at terminal bar, a free scoop of ice cream from the creamery and other discounts available from local places that we did not use.  Fun experience. Extremely walkable area",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible Experience!,"I stayed two nights at the Crawford with friends for a bachelor party. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel and its location. As far as comfort and amenities go, it does not get much better. The location was perfect because its seconds away from a huge variety of restaurants and bars. Although herding a bunch of guys around for the bachelor party was a pain, the staff was so accommodating and friendly it really wasn't bad. I have to give a shout out to my guy John Higgins with the hospitality team. Although we're not related I felt like family with the outstanding service I got from him. All in all it was an outstanding stay and I will not hesitate to book here anytime I am in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Another great stay...,"We stayed here the night before flying out of town  Outstanding access to travel to the airport and the room was absolutely amazing!  We always look forward to staying at the Crawford, they never disappoint.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,3 Day Stay - excellent!,"I’m currently staying at the Crawford and have been quite impressed by what this hotel has to offer. Our check in process was efficient, professional and helpful. We were provided with excellent information on the hotel and area amenities. Our room is as expected and is well maintained and clean. Some reviews have spoken about noise or the activity in Union Station. I find this hotel to be extremely quiet and yes, there is activity in the station area but I found it to be inviting and a positive part of the experience. We have visited many of the eating establishments in the hotel/station and have found the staff to be equally pleasant and the quality of the food excellent. While I haven’t stayed in other hotels in the area, I can say this hotel is a great choice and we will be returning customers!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel for downtown Denver,"If you’re searching for a beautiful, quiet hotel room in the middle of downtown Denver with all that has to offer, the Crawford is it! Service was excellent, especially with Jordan in charge at the front desk! Great experience and I will return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,THE best hotel to truly experience Denver,"Whether it's for a staycation, family or friends in town, or I have an early morning flight out of DIA, I always find myself back at the Crawford Hotel inside Denver Union Station.  Everything from it's location, the history of the space, the city-wide amenities and the above and beyond service, make it one of the best and most unique ways to experience the city.The Tesla courtesy vehicle is such a cool (and free) way to explore the downtown area. There's also so much to experience inside Denver Union Station that I've been content just dining and drinking my way through the restaurants and bars inside the train station! The Cooper Lounge has a cocktail menu that's exclusive to hotel guests. And you can't beat that free daily scoop of Milkbox Ice Cream!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Experience at an Incredibly Unique Hotel in the Heart of Downtown!,"As a traveler, I'm all about unique experiences that can't be found anywhere else. Staying in a hotel that's part rail station in downtown Denver is one of the coolest experiences I've had. The Crawford Hotel not only provides a unique location within Union Station with award-winning food (Snooze - YUM!!) and cocktails, but the rooms are incredibly decorated to match the hotel's history and the staff is beyond kind! Service is the most important thing when staying at a property and everyone at The Crawford goes above and beyond. It's definitely one of my favorite spots!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Experience at The Crawford,"My wife and I spent one night at The Crawford. Union Station is a really cool space with a lot going on. Parking and getting a valet was a breeze, as was check in. The room was very well appointed with a great walk-in shower. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel had a Tesla available to take guests anywhere near downtown Denver (within 2 miles) and we definitely enjoyed there service. The driver was very friendly and knowledgeable about Denver and was quite helpful with some of his suggestions. The next time we visit Denver we will definitely stay at The Crawford. We really enjoyed our short visit there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Cool place, poorly executed","Unfortunately the image this hotel very skillfully portrays was not met by the levels of service / actual experience we had here. I booked the Crawford because we would be coming in from a long-haul flight and its location next to the light-rail was convenient. Plus, it looks so fricken' cool! When we checked in, it didn't seem busy (there was one other couple) but we still had to wait awhile to be seen to and the person who took our names was visibly harried. I don't know why she was so stressed out? She didn't tell us anything about the gym / spa across the street, and didn't offer to show us to our room or take our luggage.I tried to get a 1pm checkout but was refused, 12:30 was the latest they could do (seems a bit silly to me -- this prevented us from going on a walking tour we had wanted to do).In the room, we quickly realised in the evening that it was far too loud. The bar area turns into something of a club atmosphere late at night. We needed earplugs to sleep but still kept waking up. Despite our massive exhaustion from a 10+ hour flight!!Finally, this is minor but strangely it has really stuck with me: I had also booked the hotel because I love Bigelow amenities and was actually quite disappointed to see that they don't supply you little soaps/shampoos in the room.We complained on check out about the noise, but were told we could ask for a different room the next time we stayed there. Why would we go back? I don't think the price was worth it (£200 for one night -- doesn't even include breakfast). Also, we did end up using the coffee / free ice cream benefit but they charge you $20 for it -this is silly, it should be baked into the expensive fee of the room. Personally, I think check-out could have done more to make it up to us, whether it was a room discount or complimentary meal at Snooze. I noticed that rooms were £370+ if I had booked them last minute. £200-£370 for that kind of experience isn't worth it in my opinion.The sad part is that the image of the hotel is SO COOL -- it reminds me of a more modern, hip St Pancras - but they don't follow through with this in terms of service. I wouldn't be back here and would choose another hotel in Denver next time.",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel,"This is a great hotel and a really unique experience.  The train station is a historic building in Denver that has been restored and the hotel incorporated into it.  The rooms are beautiful, clean and comfortable.  Staff was friendly and very helpful.  Perfect location for exploring downtown Denver.  You must stay at The Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Westward Trip,"We flew to DIA, took A-train to Union Station, stayed at Crawford a few nights, visited CU-Boulder (bus directly from Union Station), caught Rockies game, and took Amtrak California Zephyr to SLC.  The hotel staff was fantastic, from front desk, to Tesla driver.  We arrived a bit early for check-in, they conveniently took our bags, texted/called when room was ready, put bags in room.  Room was fantastic, quiet, clean, well-appointed, and definitely lodo style, and our kids got a real kick out of the jackolopes on the wall, bathroom was awesome from big tub, to big shower.  Can’t say enough about the facilities, our sons played shuffle board, got ice cream, while we drank a few pints.  Restaurants are great, breakfast at Snooze on patio, great service excellent food.  Will definitely stay again when Westward-bound.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect hotel and perfect location,"I loved being able to take the train from the airport directly to the hotel.  It was so easy and quick.  The room was really clean and very comfortable.  I also felt like I got a lot for my money, I took advantage of getting my coffee each morning and my scoop of ice cream from Milkbox each evening.  Really cute hotel and so easy to walk everywhere.  This will definitely be my home each time I visit Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome location!,"My husband and I traveled to Denver and stayed at the Crawford for 4 nights for our 10th wedding anniversary and couldn't have been more pleased.  The location couldn't be more central to everything.  We took the train right from the airport to the hotel-super easy. We had a rental car to pick up about a mile away and the front desk clerk drove us the in a Tesla which was super convenient.  Our room was super clean and cozy. Union station has everything you need- a few restaurants,  a bar, a sandwich shop, coffee shop, gift shops, and an ice cream shop. Snooze is a must for breakfast and you get priority seating if you let the hotel staff know the day before.  We spent a lot of time walking around the downtown area.  The Crawford is close to tons of restaurants,  Coors field, parks, shops, breweries, etc.  We had so much fun and highly recommend the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,There's no place like home... except The Crawford,"If you're in Denver on vacation, work or a stay-cation, stay at The Crawford! The location is incredible, you can be anywhere in the city in a matter of minutes - walk, drive, bike or train. The restored train station makes for a lovely boutique hotel.The rooms are gorgeous and I slept like a dream (the beds are oh so comfy!). I brought my dog with me and the staff was so welcoming; providing me with dog bowls, treats, a toy, bed AND a Furbo, so I could check in on my pup while I was away. To make it feel even more like home, the bath tub is heavenly, I could almost float in it! With all the luxuries of The Crawford, the staff is equally wonderful, great housekeeping staff, friendly front desk and concierge full of local tips. I would stay here again and highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful,The Crawford was an amazing place to stay in Denver! They had wonderful amenities and the location was perfect! The room was comfortable and clean. We stayed in a loft room which had beautiful wood beams and brick. I recommend it highly!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Very hip, but not super-functional","The hotel is actually inside the Amtrak station, so you walk through the train station waiting room to get to the check in desk, and then to get to your rooms.  It's a very cool vibe, but the rooms are nothing to write home about.  Rather small, and not worth the rather high prices the place commands.  I've stayed there twice now, and will be going with one of the other hotels right nearby in the future.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic Stay!,"You can't ask for better customer service! The front desk staff were professional, kind, and attentive. Our room was very clean. This hotel is close to everything and has countless amenities. We highly recommend!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love the Crawford Hotel,"Everything about the hotel is so very good.  The best amenity is getting a free Tesla ride driven by Riley! Other things that are great is free scoop of ice cream, free coffee, 25% off meals at the terminal bar.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Experience,First review I have ever written. But had to spread the word about this place. Rooms are beautiful and are meticulously clean and decorated nicely. The front desk staff was super friendly and helpful with any questions we had. I could not speak more highly of this place. In the heart of Denver and so much fun all around.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great stay. ,Such a gorgeous property. Everyone there is so nice and the hotel is so spotless. I would defiantly come back again. Jordan was very helpful in giving me excellent directions. The amenities in the room far exceeded expectations. They even deliver chocolate truffles to my room which are my favorite,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Stay!,I had an outstanding stay int he city at the Crawford Hotel!  The staff was exceptionally accommodating with my particular needs.  The front desk staff made me feel welcome despite my constant requests.  Lara and Margot helped me track down some amazing flowers and chocolates for my girlfriend.  They truly made this stay-cation special.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing stay at The Crawford Hotel!,We had an amazing experience at the Crawford Hotel!  It all started at the front desk where our check in was smooth and they helped us get dinner reservations along with organizing the Tesla to drive us there.  Housekeeping helped us with all of our requests.  I believe Lara and Steven assisted us one day.  I fully recommend taking advantage of all the amenities they have to offer in downtown Denver.  A big thank you to their team!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Everything you could ask for in a CBD located,This hotel is THE place to stay in Denver. Centrally located within the fantastic redeveloped Union Station. The rooms are spacious and well appointed and the staff are always available to assist  where needed. But it is the Union station itself which makes a stay at the Crawford so memorable. The selection of high quality food/beverage and specialty stores within the building is very impressive - several with special deals for those staying at the Crawford.But why oh why has the  Crawford decided to levy the dreaded US$20/night 'Resort Fee' (payable at the hotel in addition to the accommodation charge) on those choosing to stay here? It is a real blight on what was otherwise a memorable part of my US vacation.  The imposition of the Back Door Resort Fee added to the published rates detracts from what would otherwise be a 5 star review.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Amazing Stay, Amazing Hotel!","My boyfriend and I decided to stay at The Crawford Hotel after our friends had such a great time.  The staff was beyond amazing- they were welcoming, friendly and attentive to everyone's needs. We were upgraded to a loft style room which was amazing with exposed brick walls and wooden beams.  The Tesla was an amazing touch and was able to take us to dinner nearby.  We loved all the little items you get being a guest- especially the craft beer and  ice cream.  We will most definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel Experience,"My husband and I stayed the Crawford as a stay-cation, while we sleep trained our twins. Our whole experience was delightful from check-in to check out. We stayed in the Pullman suite and were greeted with a sun-filled room that had its own lounge area and scrabble board on the wall. My favorite part was the super deep tub and the bedside essential oil diffuser. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Denver. It is at the hub of everything. We were able to walk to Jax fish house for happy hour and then walk around downtown afterward. I love that the room provided little goodies at the businesses downstairs; a happy hour beer at Terminal bar to priority seating at Snooze! I will definitely be returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,I was very disappointed!,"While the location - literally within bustling Union Station - is perfect, that's where my compliments stop. My ""gallery"" room faced the train station's main hall and the noise level was very loud until after midnight as travelers enjoy the vars and restaurants in the station. This was particularly annoying since I was assured at check-in that noise was not an issue in the ""well soundproofed"" rooms -- WRONG!! The furnishings in the tiny room belong in a Motel 6: deep scratches in the. cheap desk and large stains (from spills) on the table and nightstand. More stains in bathroom. Apparently no one is monitoring such things.  🤨  This hotel is expensive, so spend your money elsewhere!!",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Spot,"We live in Loveland and went to a concert in Denver so we spent the night at The Crawford Hotel.  It’s a perfect spot with the train.  The hotel is beautiful, extremely clean, and very comfortable with lots of amenities right there.  The staff is very friendly and we were especially impressed by Brian, the courtesy Tesla driver, who gave us a ride to the Pepsi Center.  We will definitely stay at the Crawford again when we have an event to attend in Denver and don’t want to drive home.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Valentine's Day Weekend!,"I travel a lot and missed Valentine's Day and took my girlfriend for a downtown Denver Valentine's Weekend the day after.  I have always wanted to stay at The Crawford Hotel and I was not disappointed.  The room was a deluxe loft on the 4th floor...loved the architecture of the brick and wood beams built into the room...the bed was amazingly comfortable and it was all so quiet from the hustle and bustle of Union Station.  Most notably, Jordan was like our personal concierge and took care of anything we needed...she made us feel so special and went above and beyond!  We also loved the Cooper lounge and found both Parker and Frank to be exceptional bartenders in both drink-making and conversation...we closed it down on Saturday night and it was such a short walk to our room after:).I highly recommend The Crawford Hotel for a special weekend downtown for you and yours!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Second time around,"My first visit did not go well. Heating issue. Parking issues. They called and asked to make it right and gave me a good reason to do it. We did. Room was great. The service top notch. The parking better ( still need more valet people). It’s a unique place and environment ( Union Starion Denver). Give it a try!  Best, Dave.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver stay-cation! ,"We are locals and Union station is one of our favorite places to explore - great selection of restaurants, Cooper lounge and the shops!   With that in mind we opted for a stay-cation date night and booked the Crawford Hotel.  Hotel room is lovely - we had deluxe loft on top floor.  Very unique space with the wood beams and character of the ceilings.  Well equipped room with nespresso machine, mini-fridge, bathrobes and lots of space.  We both spend a lot of time in hotels for our jobs, and what was so nice is that this didn’t feel like a normal hotel!  There were a couple service misses though!  My husband booked the date night package with the cooper lounge cocktail and appetizer.   A few days before we realized we didn’t have reservation for the Cooper Lounge. He called the hotel and at first was told that hotel couldn’t assist because it’s a separate entity - didn’t quite make sense since the hotel was promoting this as a package. The call ended with him being advised someone would call back.  No call back.  A second phone call and the  hotel associate said they’d have the concierge call him back. Two days later still hadn’t heard.  A third call and finally the associate actioned the request and had a reservation at Cooper made for our date night package .  We arrived at the hotel early recognizing our room may not be ready; we stored our bags with front desk and went exploring. Front desk assured us they would text or call the moment the room was ready.  At 4:30 having not heard from hotel we went back to front desk... our room was ready, bags delivered... but no one had called us.  Not a huge deal on its own but coupled with other promised calls it speaks to communication.  We went to Cooper Lounge for our cocktails and mentioned we had this date package from the hotel to our server.  She asked for the ‘card’ from the hotel... hmm, what card?  So back to the front desk went my husband.  Sure enough we were supposed to get a card/voucher to present at the lounge.   If you are going to promote packages then ensure the staff are equipped to help execute and communicate information accordingly. So while the staff were all very kind and friendly, it seems there is opportunity to tighten up some communication and service touches. After reading a few other reviews we also realized we were never made aware of some of the perks included for hotel guests... a complementary hotel car to provide local shuttle?  (We totally would have used that instead of walking 5 blocks to dinner!). Priority seating at Snooze?  None of these were explained when we checked in, Are these really items offered to hotel guests?  All of the above noted, we would recommend the hotel!  Rooms are lovely and location at the station is amazing and provides a wonderful base from which to explore this fun city of ours!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent hotel,"We had been to Snowmass for a skiing holiday & were unable to get back to Denver airport via the shuttle that we'd booked due to the I70 being blocked by a rockslide.  We ended up getting a train from Glenwood Springs to Denver Union station.  The train was running late & we didn't get in to Denver until about 23:00.  As we went into the station to get our luggage we noticed the Crawford hotel - as we hadn't planned on being in Denver we didn't have a hotel booked.While my husband waited for the luggage I went to see if there were any rooms free - they had only one room available & it was a double to I took it.  The person who checked me in was very friendly & helpful.  After a long & stressful day we just wanted to get some sleep & the check in process was completed quickly.The room was excellent - it was clean & comfortable.  There was a fridge & coffee maker.  The bathroom was well supplied with toiletries & a hairdryer.Given that we hadn't planned to stay here & new nothing about the hotel before we arrived, we were very pleased with how it turned out.The next morning there was a wide choice of places to get food & drink.  The hotel itself doesn't seem to have any dining facilities but there are plenty of places to go within the same building.  The hotel amenity charge ($20) provided a 25% discount at some of the smaller eateries & a coffee shop.We needed to get the train to the airport the next day & the fact that we were staying right beside the platform made things so much easier as in addition to suitcases we also had skis to transport.If you want a hotel with easy access to Denver airport then this one is ideal.  I am not familiar with Denver so I can't comment on how well located the hotel is if you are planning to stay in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,I Wanted To Like It,"We recently traveled from our home on the Western Slope of Colorado to Denver for a concert. Having lived in or near Denver for almost 25 years, we're big fans of the city and all it has to offer. We decided to stay at The Crawford Hotel because we're also big fans of rail travel and historic train stations, and The Crawford is located in the new newly-renovated Union Station.What a disappointment! On arrival at Union Station we had to make our way through the waiting area -- which is basically a day-shelter for street people, or so it would appear. In addition to the traditional wooden benches found in old train stations, Union Station offers a large selection of upholstered couches and chairs. Unfortunately, most of them looked stained and dirty, and most were occupied by transient types who also looked stained and dirty. This is, effectively, also the only lobby or lounge area for The Crawford Hotel. Check-in takes place just off this waiting room, and then you cross the entire waiting room to the elevator access for the hotel rooms. In addition to the couch occupants, there were people sitting on the floor, a couple of people nodding off while slumped against the wall. These people weren't waiting for a train. They were just street people doing their thing. The Crawford reception staff were fine, the room was clean and attractive, but not worth the room rate -- especially when you factor in the state of the ""lobby"". I understand that The Crawford Hotel likely has no control over what happens in the train station -- which is managed by the City of Denver. It's a real shame, because what could be a great experience -- staying in and old-style, train station hotel -- is ruined by the fact that the city has allowed the station to be occupied by transients. It's also a shame that this is the first impression for anyone arriving in Denver by rail.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique,"Just steps from the new transit line to/from DEN and Amtrak, this is a fun way to see a repurposed Union Station upper level turned into a luxurious and pristine hotel. Elements of the old building are all around in the unique rooms. Ours was very spacious with a well appointed bathroom that included a huge tub - for a perfect soak. There is so much to explore nearby in this new area of construction - the area has been transformed into a work, live, play neighborhood and is a perfect example of “what was old, can be amazing again.”  Hotel service was excellent. Food options abound. Don’t miss this!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Just wonderful,"An absolutely amazing visit. Elegant decor, wonderful service. Complimentary Tesla drove us to a nearby restaurant recommended by the Crawford and we had the best evening!I will stay at the Crawford for all my future Denver visits.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel with Great Staff,"We stayed in the Crawford Hotel last week. What a tremendous place. We took a taxi from the airport  as we had 2 large bags and skis and were tired from  our UK flight. However it is possible to go by train. The front desk staff were superb, welcoming and efficient. We ate at Stoic and Genuine which is within the station itself. Again also good. The hotel has a courtesy car (a Tesla) and the following day they took us to the coliseum to attend the National Stock Show. They even picked us up in the evening to take us back to the hotel! The drivers were super, very friendly and courteous. That night we had a late snack at the Terminal Bar, again it was very good. The rooms at the hotel were super.  We stayed in a Pullman room which is reminiscent of a railway carriage. Large walk-in shower with gorgeous toiletries. Lots of space for cases and clothes and free bottles of water for each day of your stay. All in all it was an amazing start to our skiing holiday in Colorado!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great fun, huge rooms, very cool!","I travel to Denver weekly. First time here. Very cool, the room is huge and has 2 bathrooms. Very well appointed, great amenities and a great massive lobby with all kinds of action and places to eat. Perfect location too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Hotel and Great Location,"This Hotel is beyond beautiful! The location off of the train from the airport made it so easy to get to and was convenient when dragging luggage around. Inside Union Station there are multiple restaurant, bars and a coffee shop, ice cream shop and a deli. 16th street mall is close as well as some breweries and restaurants.  The staff was amazing and helpful.  The rooms were modern and beautiful, my only complaint was the bathroom door was a slider (which was beautiful) but there was always a gap, so you were always somewhat exposed when in the restroom. Having the rooms part of the lobby of the station was magnificent and beautiful!!! But when you closed your room door, you couldn't hear a peep from the lobby!  My only suggestion is I wish it had more munchies available (a vending machine or something at the front desk)  If you want a drink or something to snack on after everything closes, there is nothing available unless you leave the area to the closest convenient store which is quite a walk, especially at night.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beyond Expectations!!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Crawford Hotel! Beautiful Room, fabulous staff, great location. We come to Denver frequently to visit family and have stood in my of the top hotels and air bnb’s and this is by far my favorite! We can’t wait to come back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exceptional and Unique ,"Worth every penny for the convenience and beauty and staff. I asked for an early check-in and was our room was ready at 9:30 am! I believe the polite manner in which I asked without being at all demanding helped though! Beautiful room! Loved the amenities. I did struggle with working the fancy Nespresso though! I’ll be back! Downtown right outside Union Station and the free mall bus ride, shops and restaurants inside the station plus Amtrak!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved the Family Jones Distillery Tour and Union Station Tour,"My wife and I enjoyed a staycation at the Crawford.  In addion to the lovely accomodations at the Cewford and amenities at the Union Station, we enjoyed the Family Jones Disllery Tour.  After checking in to our breathtaking room with views of downtown Denver, we returned to the front curb where a Tesla Model X was waiting to silently whisk us to our distillery tour just across the river.  We tasted and learned about 7 different spirits and they also served us snacks and offered designer cocktails after the tour.  After the tour, we enjoyed the leisurely walk back to the hotel. The following day we toured Union Station with guide Ian who did a masterful job with a one hour education on the history of the building (including fascinating photos on his I Pad which included earlier versions of the buikding) and it’s place in Denver history.  There are wonderful preserved artifacts throughout the building which one may not see or notice without taking the tour.  Well done on all fronts.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,LOVED THIS HOTEL AND THE FOOD AND BAR OPTIONS,"Loved my one night in the Crawford.  But first, to set the mood, the Crawford is a hotel with rooms above the HUGE renovated Union  Station (which still has trains). You walk in and go through the station to the Crawford Hotel check in desk, which is a large kiosk on one side of the station, and then cross the huge atrium/seating area (filled with bars and restaurants) and go up to your room. In the meantime, every corner of the staton is filled with interesting bars and restaurants, including the amazing Mercantile (a James Beard awarded restaurant).  I travel extensively and have never seen a hotel set up like this.  Fortunately I pulled in on a Saturday night and the place was packed, and fun--which was great for me.  This is not a chill mellow hotel lobby---at least during the evenings.  The idea that someone had to take the Union Station and convert some of it into a hotel and most of it into bars and restaurants, and blend it in with an existing Amtrak Station----and put a great hotel above it----well---just brilliant.  Even though just outside my room was the huge atrium with bars and restaurants, and (simultaneous) Amtrak waiting aerea, my wonderful and comfortable room was absolutely quiet and the constant hum of the atrium was silenced.  So for the right kind of travel, this is an amazing hotel.  Now, don't know if it's for everyone as the valet parking is expensive and not directly in a typical hotel lobby but across a somewhat large outside expanse, and it's not under any kind of hotel arrival area.  I was coming back in a few weeks with a group of people to produce a commercial and while the hotel was great for our scout, it wasn't a hotel in the normal sense where you can find your team at the typical hotel bar or in the restaurant----as there were so many of them at the Crawford (and EXCELLENT ones) that you could lose your team.    So I would absolutely stay again in a second, but not necessarily with my group as it's not set up as a normal hotel is...but for some groups it may be absolutely perfect.  I see why it's usually rated #1 hotel in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Our first visit, hopefully not our last!","My wife and two kids stayed a couple nights and we loved it...great service, room with 20’ ceilings was beautiful and fun.  Convenient location to see downtown Denver attractions.  Loved the shower, in room controls on iPad, and bedding was very comfortable.  Also enjoyed shuffle board in the lobby, beer and great restaurant choices, and the complimentary ice cream.  Highly recommend!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Romantic staycation in downtown Denver,"My significant other and I live in Denver and spent the weekend at the Crawford in celebration of her birthday.  I also used the occasion to ask her to marry me, so I really wanted the hotel experience to be special.  For those who don't know the Crawford is located inside Union Station in downtown Denver. We love to take the train to downtown Denver and have always been interested in staying there.  The hotel does a fantastic job of providing intimate spaces for guests within the hustle and bustle of a metro commuter train station.  Check in was fast and efficient, the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful in pointing out amenities available during our stay.  Our room was on the third floor above the main station lobby area.  You would think there would be the potential for noise in our room from the busy crowded area below us, but we didn't hear a peep.  The rooms are converted office space from the station's past life, with soaring ceilings and gigantic windows.  The furnishings were elegant.   It was a perfect combination of historical charm with modern updates.  The bathroom was modern and featured an enormous shower, easily big enough for two, with a rainfall shower head.  I had ordered rose petals for the room floor and bed, as I intended to propose as soon as we were in the room. These were delivered without a hitch. The service was great, everyone we met had a smile, asked us how we were enjoying our stay and was there anything they could do for us.  Amenities include complimentary items from vendors located in the train station, including coffee, hand crafted ice cream and discounts at the deli.  You also receive priority seating at Snooze, a popular breakfast eatery located in the station.  Room service from Snooze is also available.  Union Station features one of Denver's most ""in"" cocktail lounges, the Cooper Lounge.  Hotel guests receive priority seating and discounted menu items.  The drinks there are amazing.  The hotel also provides complimentary Tesla car service within 2 miles of the hotel, which gives you access to anything and everything you could possibly want to do.  I'm sure all these things are noted on the hotel website as well, but I want to point out we took advantage of all the amenities and enjoyed everything.  All in all the hotel enhanced a very important weekend for us.  We will definitely plan future stays there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver's livingroom,"Adorable and impeccably restored hotel in Union Station. ""Denver’s livingroom,"" a saying we found very true. a most convenient and appealing offering with several unique in-house restaurants, a couple cute shops and unbelievably quiet rooms despite them being in working train station! Amenities include free drink at the in-house Terminal Tavern and free ice cream at the in-house Creamery, each day! 50 feet away from free mall shuttle which goes on the main tourism drag from the Contemporary Art Museum to the Fine Art Museum/Civic Center. The hallways feature vintage ads and original art. The rooms are well appointed with original and custom architectural features, and very high ceilings, huge windows and a high shower head and great water pressure. Definitely the place to stay in Lodo Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love this place!,"My husband and I stayed at The Crawford in late Oct and made a reservation for a last minute trip this month (one night). Unfortunately, when we booked, the loft rooms that we had enjoyed during our previous visit were sold out. When the concierge sent a “welcome” email several days before arrival, I asked if they would check for a loft room for us again. And YES! they were able to get us one! 😍Believe it or not, this hotel is SUPER quiet despite being in Union Station and near all the hot spots in Denver! Staff is very accommodating and lots of “treats” for guests at the local retailers in Union Station. A very “urban experience” for us Okies!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique hotel, fantastic staff","Enjoyed a company event at this hotel, and elected to stay a third night.  Great service, front of house very friendly.  Housekeeping is excellent.  Perfect place to stay in the event of inclement weather with choices of restaurants, bars and a few shops inside the hotel. Centrally located to LoHi, and of course downtown Denver.  We will definitely be staying again.  Thank you, Crawford Hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Motel 6 for 6 times the price ,"Since it has been two weeks since I wrote the following to GM Tiffany Owen with zero response, thought I would try a more transparent medium...My wife and I have stayed at the Crawford multiple times, including couple NYE’s in the past. This time we arrived around 4:30 pm (check in starts at 4) and they stated the “loft room” I had reserved was not ready...but they had a “classic room” ready. We were tired and ready to rest so I took the classic, room 429. It was a little noisy being on the outside hallway to the atrium, but bearable. Not sure why a reserved room was not ready when the reservation came up.At bed time, I shut the tall curtains to find out they would not shut all the way, leaving about 6 inches open. With the lights from outside, and the sun in the morning, those 6 inches kept the room bright at night and it was tough to sleep.The next day, as we were coming back from lunch around 330, we stopped at the front desk to tell them about the curtains and if they just had clips we could use to close them, the front desk lady said she would send up “engineering” to look at the problem.We held off on showers waiting for engineering, but they never showed. We finally called before we left for dinner around 630, and the front desk said they never got the order for engineering. Hmmmm.We returned back around 930pm to find that the slide door lock was left in between the door, keeping the door open and the room unsecured. We went inside our room to find no one was there. We quickly made sure nothing was stolen and called the front desk to see if engineering was done, since they left our door open, and also to inform them that this is unacceptable. While on the phone I could hear the clerk ask engineering if they we done and they stated they were, and that “there is nothing wrong with the curtains” and we were “ just being very picky”.The manager on duty came to talk to us to let us know leaving the door is unacceptable for their employees, and offered us an upgraded room. My wife was not feeling well and we didn’t want to pack all our stuff up so we didn’t take him up on his offer, but I wish we did as I tell you about the rest of the night.Around 10pm the “silent” disco NYE party started, woke up my wife and kept us awake. It was so loud you could hear every word the “silent” DJ was saying and the room vibrated from the bass. I went online to see what time the party would be over, and the hotel’s website said 1am. I know it was NYE , but it was ridiculous. At 110am the music and DJ we’re still going, so I called the front desk and they said it would be over at 2.We finally fell asleep when the music stopped at 140ish, only to be awoken to hammering and construction sounds of them disassembling the stage around 330am.Other things we noticed for a supposed classy nice hotel...you could not change what head the water came out of if the shower (there are two heads, one on ceiling and one on wall) as the switch was broken. There was pink mold in the corners of the shower and the faucet handles didn’t seem to be put in right as the whole thing moved around as you turned them. Video and pictures were taken of the condition.I’ve stayed in Holiday Inn’s and Marriott’s cleaner and with better service than this. Not worth what was paid.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Start of our Honeymoon was PERFECT.,"We came to the Crawford for the first 2 nights of our Honeymoon. The Crawford had to be one of the coolest hotels I've ever been too. First, we were complimentary upgraded because it was our honeymoon to the Crawford Suite: SO EPIC! :) They left us champagne and chocolates which I thought was so great. If we are ever back in Denver, we will absolutely stay here again!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great service & ammenities in a truly unique setting,"Wow - my partner and I stayed at the Crawford for nearly a week over the holidays. We wish we could have settled in for even longer. The rooms are comfortable and spacious enough, but the amenities, services, and location made the stay superior. Each day, you you can take advantage of the Oxford Spa Gym - a great downtown workout spa/gym, have coffee, ice cream, beer, and local, knowledgable staff. Jordan at reception and Dominic at management provided friendly, professional service and are both exceptional. They work hard and love what they do. Our room, like we asked, faced the interior of the train station, so during the holidays, the festive crowd lulled us to sleep like a city street. If you are sensitive to noise, ask for a room away from the interior. I travel extensively for work, but this hotel is worth the stay away from the typical high-end chain establishments. Soak up Denver, and enjoy yourself in this unique establishment. Thanks for the great visit!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Stay,"The Crawford Hotel is the absolute best place we have stayed when visiting Denver. The location was perfect and the room was beautiful, elegant, and very clean! The staff at the hotel will make sure you take advantage of all of the amenities that come with your stay (free ice cream, coffee, a beer and pizza slice from the different shops that are located in union station) and will go out of their way to make your stay 100% (shout out to Connor for going above and beyond). You won’t regret your stay at this historical hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Old School Hospitality,"We were given a gift certificate to The Crawford Hotel and finally had the time to use it in early December.  We had tickets to a Christmas show at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and decided to make a night of it.  We were greeted by the efficient and gracious Jordan upon our arrival.  She upgraded our room and explained the various amenities that comes with the room including a free scoop of ice cream from Milkbox Ice Creamery, free beer from the Terminal Bar, and courtesy transportation in a Tesla.  Our room (#304) was huge (love the high ceilings) and beautiful, and overlooked the train station.  I was struck by the wide hallways in the hotel, and how QUIET our room was.  I don't know if it was because of the time of year (the Holidays), or if Union Station and the surrounding area is always so busy and crowded with people, but it felt as if we were miles away in our room.  I barely heard the train bells.It was a treat to spend the weekend at the Crawford.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Magical Holiday Experience!,"In the throes of Black Friday madness, we stepped into that great hall; it was beautifully decorated, and we were welcomed with a warm reception and a flurry of holiday entertainment that can only be showcased in such a grand venue of the restored train station.  The music was great and the energy was festive and positive.  The room was beautiful, and we were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary bottle of Champaign in our lovely loft suite.  The amenities were great with provisions for a great bubble bath and bath robes.  Everything about our experience was fantastic from the friendly hotel staff to the awesome Christmas production performers.  Events included the lighting of the tree, musical bell ringers, and even St. Nicholas.  I can't say enough about the great holiday experience at the Crawford Hotel--great amenities, great vibe, great food, and great martinis. :-) Thanks to everyone on staff that weekend!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Very nice, historic hotel ","This is a luxury hotel with a historic flair. I really loved the room itself and the bed was very comfortable. WiFi was decent and the shower stall was big enough for 4! However, the housekeeping service was pretty awful. They only made my bed both days. I didn’t get new coffee pods or clean cups or more towels. The first day I called down and asked for these items. The second day I didn’t bother because the person who brought the stuff up was rude as if I was the problem. For what they charge you’d think the service would be better.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel .. great location..,"Is like traveling to the past with all the modern day amenities, the location is perfect, right downtown, great bars and restaurants in the first floor/lobby which is a working train station... Great place to visit even if not staying there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,First class service in a unique setting,"Housed in a train station, the hotel offers a unique environment with first class service.  The check in is in the station surrounded by stores, restaurants and shops, none of which are part of the hotel.  The station is filled with chairs, benches and couches buzzing with people from all walks of life.  Ian and Riley provided outstanding personal service during my stay.  Each time I came to the desk they somehow remembered my name despite talking to countless people each day.The room was a unique loft that was comfortable and welcoming, something important if you travel a lot.  It wasn't a typical hotel room.I was staying for the weekend, but could stay at The Crawford because it was booked.  They willingly took me to my next hotel in their Tesla.  The driver, whose name escapes me was friendly and professional.  He even carried my bags into the hotel I was checking in to.There is no doubt that I will be staying at The Crawford for future trips, both personal and business.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Downtown convenience,"This was our second stay at The Crawford Hotel at Union Station.  We love the hustle and bustle of the train station, shops and restaurants juxtaposed with getting on the elevator and going to a peaceful, quiet retreat being our room.  Staff is wonderful.  Rooms are comfortable and clean. Some funky elements such as faucets working backwards or hot water taking a tad of time to get warm, but nothing offensive. Rooms are well appointed. It was extra specific for the holiday season, beautifully decorated and so alive!  We love the convenience of being at the train station and heading right to the airport.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience,"The hotel is in the train station so if you are looking for a traditional full service hotel, this isn't that. However, in the atrium of the train station, of which the hotel rooms overlook, there are restaurants, cafes and a common seating area which is a great place to meet people or do some work. There are many restaurants within short walking distance from the hotel which makes it great for walking around if you have the time. The rooms are spacious. Highly recommended.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Comfortable, convenient, a bit noisy","Stayed here for business for a couple of days around the holidays, nice central location, good restaurants to choose from on the main level. Changed rooms after the first night due to street noise, no problems.  Rooms a bit smallish but well appointed.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,First-Rate. I hope to return very soon.,"A wonderful experience from beginning to end. I can't say enough positive things about our stay at the Crawford.Being the start of the Christmas season, Union Station was remarkably busy. The energy and bustle in the great hall of the station was exciting. But only steps away, our lovely room was quiet, peaceful, and comfortable. The room was so quiet, it took effort to hear the arriving and departing trains outside, even though visible from the window and merely steps away.Our ""Pullman"" guest room had a modern and attractive art deco vibe. The beautiful and roomy bathroom featured C.O. Bigelow luxury toiletries. The bedside iPad not only provided music choices, but fast communication with the concierge. We appreciated being able to select a time for housekeeping service, and the hotel help arrange reservations at restaurants within walking distance. Though we didn't watch much, there were better TV channel choices than in many other hotels.The amenities at the Crawford are quite special, too. Union Station has many dining choices under the roof, plus many more only minutes away. The complimentary Milkbox Creamery ice cream was a special treat.We loved the Crawford and look forward to our next stay there when in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect!,"We stayed at The Crawford for our honeymoon, it was amazing. The building itself is absolutely stunning! It has multiple restaurants, bars and boutiques and is also near 16th st. Mall. We never rented a car since everything was near and the hotel can shuttle you around in their Tesla. We most definitely enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotels, spectacular and unique rooms","Stayed here on a business trip.  My room was great and reasonably priced.  Plenty of dining options within a very short walking distance too.  Would definitely stay here again and I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a unique, historic hotel.  P.s.  the bathroom was incredible!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Engagement luxury,"This is a beautiful old hotel above union station downtown Denver.  We spent one night here, and my now fiancé proposed to me in our room.  He had so much help from Kyle, who truly made our night memorable.  We had a corner room over looking downtown, and had breakfast in the bed in the morning from Snooze.  Kyle even brought us a bottle of champagne to congratulate us!  This hotel is the true idea of luxury, and I have no complaints.  We will be coming back yearly for our anniversary!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Restoration,"The hotel is in a great location in an amazing building. Loved having all the shops, restaurants and bars on the first floor. It was also decorated for Christmas which made it even that more festive.  The only reason gave it a 4 vs. a 5 was because of our room.   Don't get room 432, it was right by the door entrance which we heard open and close all day/night and we barely had a window; it was a little sliver not even at eye height.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location!,"We drove up from Greenwood Village for  an amazing staycation at the Crawford Hotel. The hotel is perfectly located right in Union Station.  We went to the Terminal Bar, Stoic and Genuine, Ultria, and Cooper, all amazing restaurants right in the terminal so no need to go anywhere if you want to stay put. There was a holiday market outside on Wynkoop to enjoy and a short walk over to the 16th street free mall shuttle which makes enjoying downtown Denver so easy.  The hotel staff was so accomodating with our request for an early check-in and pointing out the hotel amenities. My only suggestion with the room is to install a night light or dimmer in the bathroom so you can safely walk down the step from the bedroom to the bathroom without leaving the bright bathroom light on. Comfortable bed, quiet sleeping, lots of fun people watching. We will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Must experience ,"Flawless hospitality and comfort at great value. Experience modern life stepping back in time.Not a detail missed that I could notice.Could not be easier, off the plane, on train, in room.                                                           Need to get nearby? Someone will drive you. Lots to do all around.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Why stay anywhere else?,"What a charmed visit! Taking the light rail from Denver International to Union Station finishes at the front doors to this fabulous and historic property. Yes, it was Thanksgiving week, making it feel a bit magical, but anytime would work. The hustle and bustle of a high-end station-hotel lobby makes the luxurious quiet of the rooms even more rewarding. Get a room with a bath (although their showers are pretty exceptional). The service is impeccable and friendly, the bed is a lesson in comfort. After describing it to one friend, he said that we should spend the week at the hotel and skip visiting family. If only...",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lovely!,"Had a great time at The Crawford!The staff was lovely, the atmosphere was SO lively and the room was perfect. The little touches like robes and slippers, delicious chocolate at turndown and the Nespresso machine really made a great impression. Plus, you are in such close proximity to all of the downtown Denver fun. Will definitely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Worth the splurge!,"It was the start of my birthday weekend, and we splurged for one night before we headed to the mountains. It was definitely worth the splurge! The front desk clerk was professional, friendly and efficient. The room was luxurious and uniquely styled. We used a key card to get into our hallway, and once inside the noise level from the lobby of the train station magically disappeared. So well insulated that we never heard a sound of any kind all night long. We were in a Deluxe Classic room. I think the Pullman rooms are the ones you see around the open area of the lobby, and I'm not sure I'd want to stay in one of those. But the quality of the hotel was so nice, that I would bet those rooms are virtually sound-proofed as well. I don't know if we'll ever have the chance to stay at The Crawford again, but I would definitely do it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Ideal location, elegant hospitality","If you need to be in Denver for early morning meetings, don't try to drive in, stay at the Crawford!  Elegant hospitality, excellent breakfast spot, remarkably quiet.  Coupons for ice cream and coffee at small shops in Union Station.  I had trouble figuring out the tablet controller for morning alarm, too high tech for me.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stayed at The Crawford Hotel to visit our son in Denver.,"Room was unique and excellent in décor and amenities!  Service throughout our stay was exceptional.  Great location and walking distance to so many venues, restaurants, etc.  We plan to stay there again soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Take Me Back!,"I live in Denver but recently stayed at the Crawford Hotel because we have a baby and my house was under construction. I was nervous to stay in a hotel with her for the first time but the hotel staff helped put us in an awesome room that had two sections so she could nap in one and I could hang out in the other. The room was absolutely beautiful and sparkling with everything we needed to feel at home. Being in Union Station was so much fun!! Every morning we’d walk down to Mercantile for pastries and coffee, it was like being in Europe. The room service in the evening was perfect too. I’m having withdrawals from life at the Crawford... highly recommend it!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to stay when in downtown Denver,"We have stayed at the Crawford several time and love it. It is close to the 3 major sports venues, opera house, light rail, downtown shopping and restaurants. All the shops and restaurants at Union Square are wonderful, plus you get a deep discount at most. The rooms are luxurious and impeccably clean. The staff is extremely helpful, kind and they all have a smile on their face.It is our place to go when in Denver and plan on staying many more times.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Over the top!,"I recently returned from a 30-day journey around the country, and the Crawford was one of the highlights of my trip. Just as other reviewers have stated, the hotel is convenient, charming, and reasonably priced. However, it is the excellent customer service that sets the hotel apart from other beautiful properties. Kyle and Sydney at the front desk were consistently friendly and helpful and in fact, are the reason I chose to return for another night a few days later. Myles could not have been more pleasant or helpful driving me to buy a new pair of prescription sunglasses. I will return to Denver and will definitely stay at the Crawfor again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect stay at the Crawford,"As you walk through the hustle and bustle of the gorgeous Union Station, you are greeted at the front desk by friendly hosts. Up an elevator to the guest rooms that are spacious, high ceilings, and where old meets modern. The room we stayed in was a split level room the the living area slightly raised. The bedroom was cozy and the bathroom was huge! The tub was perfect!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,2 days. Efficient ,"If you never spent much time in Denver this is a great place to start. Big rooms, high ceilings nestled in a Renovated train station.  The Crawford rides the rails between hip, nostalgic and functional. I would stay again but also excited to explore other hotels. Maid service comes late in afternoon and beds are little on the soft side but all was good!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top notch,"The hotel is attached to Union station and both are restored to the original beauty.  The hotel has many food choices from deli, to upscale and walking distance to many others. The hotel itself was fantastic, high ceilings, luxurious bedding and great bathroom and showers.  I'm hooked, I wouldn't stay anywhere else while in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Looks nice,The hotel is convinient and spectacular. It’s right at the union station so that people travelling by train won’t worry about missing one by staying somewhere else downtown or paying for parking in a parking garage. The mini fridge includes 2 16.9 oz bottled waters. Highly reccomend it.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Excellent location, price, staff, and room !","The Crawford Hotel has all the modern luxuries, yet the look and feel of a 1940s retro hotel.  The location is above Union Station in Denver, with easy access to everything downtown.  The price is much lower than the huge hotels a few blocks away.  The staff are extraordinarily friendly, plus they gave me great suggestions on where to eat and other needs.  And, finally, the room was nice and tidy, just what you would expect from a wonderful hotel.  I would stay there anytime.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Our New Favorite Hotel in Denver!!,"We stay in Denver often over the weekends for the great food and fun. We normally stay at the Four Seasons, Hotel Teatro, Ritz Carlton or Brown Palace. We just tried the Crawford and they have stole us away! This hotel is so much fun! The location is fantastic. The staff is superb and the rooms are so five star. Especially the Loft Suites. We loved the whole idea and concept of the Union Station Lobby along with all the eateries and bars. The energy was exciting and upbeat and makes for a great place to stay. At the same time the rooms are quiet and tranquil. My wife and I could not believe how much we enjoyed this hotel. We have stayed at fine hotels all over the world and we were so impressed at this one. They also do a wonderful job of adding some cool amenities that include the merchants in Union Station. The Cooper Lounge was another one of the many great things about this experience. My wife and I had two more trips to Denver planned and we were going to stay at one of our other hotels but will be cancelling those rooms and booking at Crawford. Don't make the mistake of not staying here! It is GREAT!! Can't wait to go back again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lots of promise but overall was disappointed,"I booked this hotel because it was quirky and boutique - a former railway station sounded really cool.  The exterior of the building is beautiful and the interior is too, to a degree.  I was immediately surprised to find that the hotel “lobby” wasn’t really a lobby but effectively a wide open public space with cafes, shops and bar with members of the public and tourists roaming around in it.  This meant it was congested and noisy all of the time.  When I checked in I was told my room wasn’t available but another similar sized room was - I accepted.  The room was very small - shockingly so compared to the photographs on booking.com .  I asked to revert back to the originally planned room which they kindly allowed me to do but was surprised to find that room not being much bigger.  Overall I concluded that the pictures were very misleading.  This, combined with the chaotic ground floor / lobby / railway waiting room / bar / cafe / Gelateria led to this not being the best hotel experience.  I think the lobby for the hotel should be separate from the chaos so that it improves the experience of guests.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, perfect downtown location","The Crawford Hotel has quickly become one of our favorite places to stay in Denver!  First off, the hotel is embedded in the former plaza of the Denver Union Station train station, which now doubles as a half-public-space half-retail destination.  Surrounded by several great restaurants and bars, shops and interactive spaces, the hotel is ground zero for all the hustling and bustling excitement of Denver.  Furthermore, the hotel is connected to the train and bus station - literally, right out the back door of the hotel and you can hop a 30 min train to the airport, hit the central bus terminal, or take lightrail to most any other suburb of Denver. The redevelopment does an excellent job of paying homage to the buildings historic past as the logistical hub for people moving in an earlier time. On the other side, one step out the front door of the hotel has you smack dab in downtown Denver's historic LoDo district (lower downtown), with more breweries, bars and restaurants in walking distance than you could ever visit.  Just a couple blocks north is Coors Field, where during our stay the Colorado Rockies hit a walk-off home run to help them make the 2018 playoffs.  You could hear the crowd's roars spilling over the walls of the ballpark and down into the streets and alleys - a pretty cool experience. The hotel rooms and amenities are beautiful, and from what I understand, each room is uniquely shaped and designed as it was retrofitted into the original train station building.  The 2nd floor off our room featured a speakeasy of sorts, called Cooper Lounge, which seemed to only have access to hotel guests, Although a cunning adventure seeker could figure out how to make their way up to the bar, it's definitely not obvious from the plaza below. Service from staff and the surrounding retailers was excellent.  The environment of downtown Denver paired with this historic redevelopment masterpiece should be on everyone's bucket list. Overall, a fantastic hotel and a fantastic stay.  Although a little pricey compared to other downtown options, the Crawford is well worth it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,LOVE this hotel!!,"The Crawford Hotel is a truly unique and fun experience. I have traveled all over the world and was blown away by how special the Crawford is! We stayed in the loft which was lovely, comfortable and has very cool architecture! When you enter Union Station you may be a little confused about where to check in to the hotel, just look at the signs (which are clever) above the shops. People watching is the best, much more fun than a traditional hotel lobby!  Make sure to take full advantage of the $20 amenity fee. This gets you ice cream, beer, coffee and lots of other discounts to use in Union Station. No catches, just show your room card. The hotel is in the heart of Lodo, close to almost everything you need or want! We can't wait to go back~",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Five stars…BUT ..!!!!,"Lets deal with the BUT first. We were in room 325 , the door from the bedroom to the bathroom was frosted glass. Why? When one used the toilet at night, and switched on the light, the light little impeded by the glass washed over the room  waking my wife.  There is a trend among hotel designers to use glass  with varying degrees of opacity in the bath room door. Why? I want to meet the guest who on booking said “give me the room  with the glass bath room door so I can wake my partner through the night with my nocturnal evacuations, and they can have the  unbridled joy of seeing my flabby distorted  form performing these acts of relief.” Who is this customer? The glass bathroom door is an act of design desperation craving difference in a crowded market. Doubtless there was a staff meeting where the Head of Marketing said “ we will dominate the  hotel market  not just by well appointed rooms at  competitive prices, supported by superb staff; we are going to dominate this sector through the raw innovation  of  glass in the bathroom door.”  Cue applause by the owner's  corporate  myrmidons incapable of grasping the practical reality. If you have read thus far thank you I  feel better now. The glass bathroom  is  a design flaw in an otherwise great hotel, built round an interesting space. The Crawford is in  the old, but still functioning Denver Union station. This is a superb location, centre of down town Denver,  you can catch trains across the west and more importantly to the airport. One of the joys of the Crawford  is you can stay in central Denver and not need a car. Our room was on the 3rd  floor, the door opening on to a balcony that over looked the central concourse. The concourse is a public space, with a variety of good eateries and bars, and is abuzz with life, so different from the solemnity of the traditional  hotel lobby.  However abuzz means noise and I was concerned this would be a noisy room . It was not. The  thick, insulated door, halted all emanations, this was a triumph of noise suppresion design. The room was quiet, well appointed , Nespresso machine, good wifi , comfortable bed.  All  supported by well trained staff, truly helpful, friendly, and competent.  I would happily go back if they solved the glass bath room door issue.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A True Five Star Experience,"I have never before stayed at a hotel where before I even left, I was saying to myself that I needed to come back. The Crawford is a truly unique and wonderful experience, from the wooden beams that break through the rooms to the absolutely top notch staff who will go above & beyond for you. Everything about the stay is absolute luxury.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Greta,"Many thanks to Riley - best courtesy car driver ever - for the r/t to the Fillmore last Sat. eve (Greta Van Fleet was truly awesome... much love to the Fil. as well). This was our forth stay at The Crawford, the room was most excellent (love the high ceilings), the entire staff was great as usual and the location simply cannot be beat. The selection of food, libations and shopping in Union Station is impressive (Pigtrain Coffee is superb... their cro-nuts are my new addiction). We're already looking forward to our next stay, see you then.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"Spent 2 nights at the Crawford. The staff were very friendly and professional. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated and clean. The rooms was very quiet, never heard anyone above. below or next to us. The building itself is majestic and historic. Many wonderful restaurants within walking distance of hotel. Would definitely stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,One of the best and most unique hotel stays I've had,"We were only able to stay one night at The Crawford after a last minute decision to visit Denver, but it was such a memorable stay.  Walking into the Union Station lobby made us stop and drop our jaws... it's beautiful and vibrant.The woman at the desk generously offered us a choice of rooms on the 3rd floor (high ceilings, views of the train tracks) or the 4th floor loft.  We switched to the 3rd floor and were very happy with the room, which was luxurious and romantic.We ate downstairs that night and at Snooze the next morning.  Both meals were fantastic.  I am vowing right now that I am coming back to Denver and I'm staying at The Crawford again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,OUTSTANDING!!!,"I’m somewhat late in writing this review, but my wife and I will never forget the most gracious, kindest  team at The Crawford Hotel.  From the moment of checking-in and throughout our most pleasant stay, The Crawford Hotel will always be our only choice of stay in Denver.  Great people do make a great difference.  The room was spotlessly clean, a must have for us, and location, location – couldn’t be better;specially if traveling by Amtrak. D & R Cogdill.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful hotel...Wonderful people,"This is one of the most beautiful hotels we have stayed in.  Breathtaking lobby, hallways and rooms.  Wonderful, helpful, friendly staff!  When we called for any kind of assistance, from needing pillows to valeting our car, everyone was polite, efficient and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Fabulous Location, great staff","Great hotel, fabulous location,immaculate service and the rooms are beautiful. Thanks to wild fires in Utah we wound up staying here twice! All the staff were super helpful but a particular shout out to Margot & Kyle",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford Hotel at Union Station,"We loved our room at this beautiful hotel.  From the cozy bath robes and slippers provided to the spacious bath and comfortable king bed in one of the classic rooms, everything was perfect.  The room was well appointed, spacious, and quiet.  Location cannot be beat in Union Station in the midst of a multitude of tasty restaurants.  The staff there is very friendly and helpful, too. The Crawford will be our to go hotel in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Absolutely amazing!,"We are from Seattle where we think we have pretty good restaurants, bars and hotels. This place blows our downtown away! The Crawford is a place every traveler should experience. It is just that, an experience. The service from even before we checked in when the concierge called me personally to confirm our stay and let me know they were upgrading our room (who does that?!) and he made our reservation for us at Cooper Lounge(a must do swanky bar with scratch cocktails), since it was a Friday night he didn’t want us to not get in. Upon arrival, our room was not only ready early but upgraded to a gorgeous corner room with 18 foot ceilings and beautiful decor. Located in the train station with coffee shops, bars, restaurants, shops all within steps from your room and to the fun downtown scene and Larrimer square. Margot and Kyle were incredibly gracious at check out too. So friendly! We will absolutely be back and HIGHLY recommend this awesome hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great historical place,The hotel itself has certain charm. It is placed in original building of central train station that is there since end of 19th century.The main hall or the train station is at the same time also a reception area for the hotel. The rooms are relatively small but the ceiling hight makes the room more spacious than they really are.The hotel does not offer food but there is variaty of restaurants around to dine.Hotel offers free water and free shuttle service with Tesla X around the town which actually you pay 20 USD per day.All in all nice experience however overpriced.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Plus customer service!!,"My wife and I were booked here by Pack Up and Go and couldn't be happier.  From the moment we walked in to the beautifully renovated train station / lobby were treated exceptionally well.  The front desk people are all great and go out of their way to be accommodating.  The ride in the Tesla is a must, we took that to Linger for Dinner and Austin was a great driver.  We love how active the lobby is and the Cooper Lounge has great drinks and appetizers.  The central location is perfect for visiting Denver. We will without a doubt be back to the Crawford Hotel!",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lovely Hotel in Downtown Denver,"We had a wonderful stay at the Crawford Hotel. The location is perfectly located in Union Station. It is in walking distance of the Pepsi Center, Rocky Stadium, Mall 16, and numerous nice restaurants. The only improvement would be to have more comfortable beds and pillows.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Gem!,"We loved everything about this hotel! The old school architecture has been beautifully maintained. The atmosphere of Union Station was a lovely surprise. The staff were extremely helpful and, most importantly, the rooms are excellent. This is a boutique hotel that runs like an efficient upscale chain. Make sure you go for a drink at the second floor bar, it offers a great view of the architecture and the train station action below!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing place!,"The perfect location in the center of everything! The checkin was flawless. The center of Union Statiin has so much going on. But once you get to your room you’d never know! The room was spacious, clean and modern. The Nespresso machine and Bigelow products were a nice touch. We were able to get a ride in the Tesla (complimentary) to the Pepsi center too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,THE BEST PLACE WE HAVE EVER STAYED AT !!!!!!!!,"Stayed at the Crawford twice. Three(3) days in August and three(3) days in early September for our 50th wedding/honeymoon anniversary trip throughout Colorado and Utah riding trains and visiting National Parks.  We got upgraded both stays. Our first stay was under the ""linger a while"" promotion, but our second stay was at full price. However, the upgrades made it more palatable. Very handy, coming and going by AMTRAK. The staff was super excellent. Cortney, Connor, Margo, Sidney, Miles, Riley, Orianna(sp) and others whose names escape me. But, most of all, IAN  was superb in getting us dinner reservations to the ""ODYSSEY"", a small intinment Italian restaurant and tickets to the Carol  King Musical ""BEAUTIFUL"". We used the complimentary car service, a TESLA X 90. Talk about royalty. The looks we got when the rear doors swung up and open. Which leads me to AUSTIN, our driver. A great guy. Perfect for the job. Can not say enough good things about him. Whoever does the hiring at the Crawford, does a great job in selecting personnel. Was it worth the expense ????  Fiftieth(50th) wedding anniversary, SURE.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Golden Age of Travel,"Glorious architecture, gracious staff and thoughtful details combine to make this hotel a new favorite for me. Its setting in historic Union Station, now restired to her former elegance, is only the beginning. Being delivered in style in the hotel’s Tesla to a nearby destination was the height of pampering; and that’s even before I met friends in the elegant Cooper Lounge and later, sauntered down to select my complimentary scoop of ice cream at the neighboring creamery.My small room couldn’t have been more charming. Now scheming about how I can plan a return trip ... pronto!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Our trip was so delightful because of our stay at the Crawford,"The location could not be more perfect, and the front desk was most helpful each day.  The rooms were very quiet even though we were in the train station.  We also enjoyed the transportation in the Tesla along with discounts in the restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,THE.BEST.PLACE to stay in Denver,"We stayed at the Crawford hotel in the historic Union Station for a short 2 night stay for a concert at Pepsi Center in early August.  We took the $9 A-line train right to Union Station from the airport which was REALLY nice because we didn’t have to rent a car or Uber from the airport.  The new train service from the airport to downtown Denver/Union Station makes such a difference.  Everything is so walkable.  Definitely take advantage of the Crawford’s courtesy Tesla!  They will take you and/or pick you up anywhere within 2 miles.  We took the Tesla to the Pepsi center and were blown away by the car - the driver was really nice too ;).  I would also recommend that you make reservations as I did to eat breakfast at Snooze on your last day.  There was over an hour wait on a Friday morning so I was happy to have made reservations when we arrived.  Also, having some time to kill before our flight out, we took the history tour of Union Station with Kyle, the concierge.  It is a must-do!  We learned so much about the history and architecture of Union Station.  It is unbelievable to me that a few short years ago, 2011, I think, that It was up for demolition and ultimately saved and lovingly remodeled by Mrs. Crawford and partners, thankfully!  If access is available, you get to see an example of each of the rooms - the Pullman suites are really cool reminiscent of Pullman train cars from the past.  We stayed in a loft room and loved all the beams, vaulted ceilings, and natural light.  No two loft rooms are the same, so it was nice to see another loft suite too.  The Crawford suite is amazing with its direct views of the train tracks in the back, but quiet, of course.  The hotel provides some very nice thoughtful amenities as well - a free craft beer at the Terminal bar, a kids size ice cream at the Milkbox, and a coffee at Pigtrain coffee, all daily per guest.Beautifully appointed rooms, delightful front desk staff, and everything you could possibly want, await you at the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed here for two nights after a trip to South Dakota before the train trip back to Chicago and beyond. We had a LoDo suite. It was pricey, but more than worth the price. Our eight-year-old granddaughter loved it. It had a large full bath and a half bath, a living room, and a bedroom that were on two different levels. it's unique in that the rooms are built around the existing timber in the original structure. There's a $20/day fee, but it offers benefits (ice cream, coffee, drinks, 20 percent discount in some of the restaurants, preferential reservations at restaurant for breakfast) that made up for it. Our train ran late and they let us use it even after checkout as we were going to be in the station all day. There are a lot of nice, trendy shops and restaurants in the station as well as in the general area around the station, including the walking mall. The lobby of the hotel is the station with a lot of comfortable seating and free wifi with lots of places to plug in devices. There is excellent security. The service in the hotel was outstanding and the front desk staff was particularly helpful. Sydney and Courtney were helpful, but so was everyone at the desk. We had an excellent stay and would not hesitate to stay here again the next time we are in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A timeless stay,I stayed at the Crawford for one night while in Denver and it was an incredible experience. The small details they provided in their services was so well thought out and relaxing that I didn't want to leave. The convenience of all the hip and tasty restaurants and shops around union station is also another feature that makes the hotel so nice.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Enjoyable Stay; Will Return,"We enjoyed a 4 nite stay & would definitely return; a different hotel experience but a good one.  We booked a Superior Classic but upon check in were offered an upgrade to the Deluxe Classic, which we agreed to.  Glad we did as the addl square footage was appreciated! Our room was comfortable; we could hear some occasional noise from the train - altho not a huge issue, next time we will try the street side! Otherwise for such a busy place the hotel is extremely quiet; once you get past the locked doors (great security here) into the actual hotel hallways etc it's amazing - you would never know you are at a busy train station. Appreciated the coffee maker in the room as well as the complimentary coffee at Pig Train (?) downstairs in Union Station.  We also took advantage of the other amenities such as the Snooze seating time and the complimentary drinks at the Terminal Bar. So many great restaurants and bars in the immediate area as well as the little shops in the Station.  Special treat - there was a wonderful Farmer's Market on the Saturday we were there. Customer service at The Crawford was good - a special shout out to Domenic & Margot who were very helpful!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome Front Desk Staff!,Just checked in and was wowed by the service provided by Sydney and Courtney at the front desk.  I arrived way before check in and they exceeded my expectations. Can’t wait to experience the rest of this beautiful hotel!  More review to come.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Short stay in Denver,"Absolutely perfect experience. The Crawford in a great area, and part of the beautifully renovated Union Station.  The station itself has so much to offer, from Pig Train coffee to the awesome Terminal Bar. The Crawford rooms are unique, incorporating may elements of the original Union Station. The rooms are also quite spacious. But the best part of the visit was the wonderful Crawford staff - super professional and pleasant and knowledgeable of the history of their wonderful establishment.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique (in a good way) , comfortable, and convenient hotel","This unique hotel is conveniently located INSIDE Denver's very comfortable Union train station and is reached by the light rail which runs directly from the airport. The rooms at the Crawford Hotel are located on the floors overlooking the interior of the station. Some are train themed, and some are decorated in the style of a bygone era. Our room was extremely comfortable ( really comfortable king sized bed too!) and had all of the usual conveniences. The rooms are reached by elevator or stairs. In order to make the elevator ascend, if you go upstairs by elevator, or open the door to the hall, if you walk up the stairs, you have to use your hotel key card, so security is good. Everyone can walk out of the hotel hall and look down at the activity in Union Station.  We had an outside room and we could look down at the light rail coming and going as well. The second floor hotel bar also allows you to look down at the station's activity.Our room was tastefully decorated and very comfortable, and the hotel staff could not have been more helpful. If you stay at the Crawford, you get certain privileges and freebies in the station's stores and restaurants: a free ice cream (BEST ICE CREAM EVER!!) at the ice creamery; a free cup of coffee; preferential reservations at the amazing Snooze breakfast restaurant; a free drink each night at the upper level bar. I should mention that Union Station is not your typical big city train station. It has comfortable places to sit, including padded chairs and couches and is ringed inside and out by many wonderful restaurants. You also get free wi fi. This is the only area in which I felt that the hotel was weak. The wi fi wasn't consistent.  I know that I keep saying ""wonderful,"" but the entire experience was wonderful!This hotel was somewhat more expensive than our usual Marriott or Hilton stay, but we think it was well worth it. The hotel was an experience in itself, and the location allowed us to avoid having to use a bus or a taxi to go places, as our tour company picked up directly at Union Station. and, as noted before, we had a direct line to the airport. .",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful hotel in the center of everything ,"I stayed here for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it! The lobby is a vibrant space that also doubles as a transit station - that means there’s always something interesting going on no matter the time of day. You can get beer, ice cream coffee and even pizza all in the lobby. It’s also extremely convenient to the airport light rail, we also took the RTD bus to Boulder for the day for only $4.50. The room was beautiful with high ceilings, plenty of space and a very comfortable bed. This was the first hotel I’ve stayed in that I couldn’t hear a peep from any other hotel guests, no doors slamming or noisy people in the hallway. A refreshing change!If you want to be in the heart of LoDo this is a classic and fun place to stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver -- One of the Most Unique Anywhere!,"The Crawford Hotel is one of those ""must stay"" places in the world that makes travel fun and memorable whether for business or leisure. As a long ago native of Denver, it is remarkable to see how this former downtrodden Union Station locale has been completely transformed into the epicenter of the supercool buzzy LoDo district. The number of excellent high end restaurants, bars and fun casual places to eat in and around Union Station is simply amazing, The Crawford rooms are clean and comfortable (I recommend the larger higher floor rooms with tall ceilings). The hotel service is both very friendly and highly professional. And the freebies and discounts included in the Crawford's amenity fee make it the one of the very few I've seen that are worth the money -- free Terminal Bar Colorado craft beer, Milkbox gourmet ice cream and Pigtrtrain coffee plus heavily discounted cocktail at the high end Cooper Lounge.The Crawford makes returning to my former home city of Denver extremely exciting and a genuine pleasure!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Our Visit..,We just spent 2 Days At The Crawford Hotel in Denver!!  We LOVED It!!!  Great Location!!!!!!!Great Ambience.. Loved the upstairs Bar!!!!A FABULOUS Spot!!Kiel At The Front Desk Made EVERYTHINGWONDERFUL!!!!!!We Shall Return!!!!!💛💙💜❤️,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Gorgeous hotel with so much history,"This hotel was amazing. The little things like coffee and robes were nice, but we stayed here for the history. We stayed in a third floor room which the concierge mentioned were office spaces in the station's past life. Amazing. High ceilings, creaky floors, beautifully redone and and amazingly helpful staff. You get a lot of perks for staying at the hotel like free ice cream downstairs and a discount on drinks; take advantage of them! It's makes the room's price tag a bit easier to swallow. :) The ice cream was SO GOOD.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An Amazing Stay in Denver!!!,"We were in Denver visiting family and thoroughly enjoyed everything about The Crawford Hotel and Union Station.  The staff is so welcoming and professional.  Each and every one of them made sure our stay was fabulous.  The rooms are amazing and so wonderful to relax in after a busy day about town.  The complimentary Tesla will take you around town within 2 miles of the hotel.  The hotel is located in the middle of the excitement of Denver and some of the excitement of Denver is located in the middle of the hotel!!  If you're staying in Denver for an extended stay or just a get away weekend, I would highly recommend The Crawford Hotel!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,OUTSTANDING HOTEL INSIDE UNION STATION!,"The Crawford Hotel is located inside the terminal of Denver’s bustling transportation and restaurant/bar scene. The hotel itself is first class. Kyle at the front desk set the tone of gracious hospitality as we checked in. The room was spacious, sparkling clean and amenities were perfect. It’s one of the just coolest hotel experiences, especially paired with all the food and beverage outlets within Union Station. I’m definitely going back for a longer stay. And hope Kyle is there to be of assistance.Daniel H. - Dallas",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best hotel in Denver,"The Crawford is such a wonderful hotel.  The staff is so efficient, helpful, friendly.  They seem to remember each and every guest and their individual likes/dislikes.  They couldn't have been more accommodating.  The rooms are beautiful...clean, filled with all the amenities.  The nicest in which I've ever stayed.  Unique.  It's so nice to spend time in Union Station.  You can visit for a cup of coffee, breakfast, snack, lunch, drink or dinner.  We felt so safe and relaxed there. The Crawford also provides easy access to transportation around Denver...so much to see and do.   I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed my stay at the Crawford...truly outstanding.  The entire experience was the best!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,What an incredible time!!,We absolutely loved the hotel - what a spectacular building and shops and staff! My family thought this was spectacular ... having dinner at the Mercantile was just amazing and we also loved the ice cream shop and all the shops and the book!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotel, fun location - highly recommend!",Stayed for a few nights with my husband - perfect location to explore Denver. Plenty of shopping/food/cocktails in walking distance. Room was great but being in Union set it apart as a unique and fun spot we will for sure visit again! Staff was wonderful - can’t say enough good about this trip & this hotel was central to it.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Service was awesome,"My husband and I just can here for his 40th Birthday trip. The team of people working here could not have been more awesome (Margo,Kyle).

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,New Favorite in Denver,"Great location, beautiful, bustling space, well designed rooms. Stayed here with husband and 2 year old daughter for a weekend. Was the perfect home base for wanderings around Lodo. Loved having breakfast in the central common area as well as ice cream after dinner. My daughter played for hours in the fountain outside on a particularly hot afternoon. We stayed in a lodo suite. Really liked the room only caveat was the lack of windows. Only one in the sitting area, none in the bedroom. Room was beautiful and well appointed otherwise. Will be our Denver go to.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Jewel in Union Station,"Newly renovated Union Station has a real vibe in the lobby, it is a real train station with bar, restaurant, shops, totally clean and vibrant, location is close to Coors Field, near a lot lot lot of restaurants and shopping. Room was a bit small but had really high ceiling so felt roomy, big big window too. Parking was by valet only. The only nit I had was the $20 amenities fee, but truth be told it gets you a free coffee, beer, ice cream etc. which being the cheap SOB that I am, since I already paid for it, I got all of it.  A real nice place, I was pleasantly surprised by all of it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful stay in heart of Denver!,"We stayed one night with our 7 yr old grand-daughter who loved the attic room where we stayed. For us adults, it was quiet and comfortable yet just steps away from dynamic downtown Denver. Room was upscale and spotless. Staff was friendly and helpful. We loved it and will be back asap!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotel and location, book ahead for Snooze!","First time in Denver and the Crawford was a great hotel for me and my friend to explore the city from. Great rooms and location, and an amazing facial at their sister hotel the Oxford just over the street. The only disappointment was even as hotel residents, they couldn’t get us a reservation at the supposedly famous Snooze for brunch... if you want it, I’d book well in advance. Maybe next time!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Accommodation & Amenities! ,"After a 2 week trip around the southwest of CO , we checked into the Crawford Hotel  for some R& R and site seeing. We did not have a autIt was the perfect place ! it was immaculateAnd we had everything we could have wanted ! We had no automobile with us and planned to take the train to the airport the next evening.. it was perfect!The hotel provided a Tesla & driver to  the botanical Gardens .

Very comfortable!I’ve already told several friends to add this to their travel plans!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,What an End to my Trip!,"Stayed here to catch the Train. And what a blast. I love how the hotel is now a part of the station. Front desk were so helpful, as the train was delayed and they allowed me back into my room at 0800hrs to wait until midday when the train was ready. Really helpful. Its so classy. I loved the Cocktail Bar and then we were able to use the Tesla to get a ride downtown. Wow. Made my sisters night. Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Red Rocks Central ,"My wife and I stayed at The Crawford in mid July for our first trip to Red Rocks. The hotel is beautiful, well located and the staff was outstanding. I asked for some help putting together a picnic dinner for our trip to Red Rocks and Paloma, Kyle and several others took care of everything. They were amazing. I won’t stay anywhere else in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very nice,"Enjoyed the hotel located at the Union Station just a block from Coors Field. Very convenient for eating and shopping. Rooms were very nice with several amenities included - free beers, preferential seating, ice cream, etc. this area of town is really being rebuilt and a fun place to stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stayed at the Crawford in late July 2018,"I have been to Denver quite a few times over the last twenty years, but have never stayed in the LoDo area.  The company I visited placed me at the Crawford during a busy week in July 2018 (I'm told the area hotels had a 85%+ occupancy rate at the time).  Normally, I rent a car to get around Denver, but the company suggested using the RTD trains, and staying in LoDo (Lower Downtown).  I have to say, this advice was excellent.  Basically, I just walked out the doors in Denver Airport, bought a train pass at the kiosk, hopped the RTD train to Union Station, and walked a few steps to the Crawford.  I'm a fan of historic properties in the first place, but this whole concept of taking a train to my hotel was an extremely pleasant trip back to the late 1800s!  Union Station is a beautiful period building.  I arrived very early, knowing that getting into my hotel room early would be a problem (they were 100% booked the previous night and needed time to service the rooms).  I spoke with the person working the desk, and asked if they would expedite the room so I could drop my backpack and clean up.  They told me they would call as soon as the room was ready, so I figured I would grab some lunch in the meantime.  I found a nice local taco restaurant, and had just started looking at the menu when I got the call that my room was ready!  What a nice surprise that was.  The room itself was oversize, with those high ceilings one only finds in historic buildings.  All the usual observations about the rooms in higher end hotels - well kept, excellent bed, massive glass enclosed shower, etc.  Those are all table stakes, however.  What sets the Crawford apart is the Union Station location - plenty of night life here, many excellent restaurants within walking distance, quick access to the train that can take one almost anywhere in Denver, all while being quiet enough to get a good nights sleep.   As I wrote the Crawford management in a private email, staying at their hotel will be top of mind any time I visit Denver in the future, either on business or with family.  If you like historic areas, definitely consider staying with the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wow staff!,"Just returned from a short business trip to Denver and loved this property. 9.5/10 lost .5 as I would prefer a hard surface wood or slate throughout room rather than carpet but that’s a personal preference. Kudos to the staff who went beyond on service. Anya at the desk amongst other things recommended we take the convenient train back to the airport. Great saving! The use of a driver and hotel Tesla for short trips was awesome. Drivers,  Myles and Austin, were so friendly and we thank them for their helpfulness. All in alll would highly recommend this property!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel. Great Service. Great Location,Wonderful Hotel. Union Station in Denver is a great place to visit.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Most Beautiful Hotel in Downtown Denver!,"My husband and I stayed at the Crawford Hotel for our anniversary and it was THE best experience I have ever had! Upon arrival, the front desk staff were exceptionally friendly. They explained everything that was included with our stay, including a free ice cream scope from Milkbox and a $5 menu at their Copper Lounge, which is a bar on the second floor of Union Station. I live in Denver so this was a quick get-away for my husband and I. However, the experience we had was so over the top that it truly felt like we were on VACATION! The staff also welcomed us with a bottle of Champagne and two glasses in our room since they knew it was our anniversary! I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Can't say enough AMAZING things about this hotel!!,"We're so happy we chose this hotel for our first visit to Denver!! Couldn't have asked for a better location and the deluxe loft room exceeded our expectations. Also, the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating... in particular Mara and Dominic. They made us feel welcome and went above and beyond to make our stay amazing.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Gorgeous hotel and amazing customer service,"This hotel is one of a kind! We stayed in the Loft Delux room and the room was so unique with high vaulted ceiling, original exposed brick, and beautiful wood beams! It’s by far one of my favorite hotels to date! Mara at the front desk checked us in and she was absolutely amazing! She went out of her way to make sure that our stay here was extra special! It was a great way to start off our first time to Denver!The hotel offers a complimentary Tesla service, free beer at the bar in union station, along with many more amenities! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and next I come back to Denver there is no doubt in my mind that I will be staying here!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exceptional hotel in downtown Denver,"Could not possibly say enough good things about The Crawford.  It's part of Union Station, which means you're in the middle of tons of options for dining and entertainment, and just a short walk from seeing the Rockies play.  It also means noise could be an issue, but it wasn't in the room we had.  I would suppose the closer your room is to the main area, the noisier it will be.The rooms are very well appointed, and the hotel has some great amenities.  Specifically, you have a number of freebies from the other places located within Union Station, such as free coffee, free beer, and free ice cream (one per guest per day). Their valet is quick, and you can request your car be brought up right from the iPad in the room. Valet was complementary if you drive a Tesla (and they can charge your car).  They also have a Tesla Model X that will take you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel.The day we arrived, there was a concert going on in front of Union Station, and the day we left there was a farmer's market set up outside.  Certainly always cool things going on.  Staff was super friendly and helpful.   I'd be glad to return here anytime.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful, quiet, excellent location, tall ceilings, wonderful surprise in Union Station!","We live in Boulder but had a one night getaway in Denver and stayed at The Crawford hotel in Union Station. We were upgraded to a Deluxe Classic room, and it was beautiful. The ceilings are high with modern, art deco furniture, beautiful bathroom, and a very comfortable bed. The room looked out at the train station, but we could not hear the trains! The rooms are tranquil! The location is superb! Everything you need is in walking distance such as restaurants, bars, cocktail lounges, flowers, coffee and even Whole Foods. The staff at the Crawford are very friendly and professional. Someone accidentally gave us incorrect directions for the elevator to our room and later brought up truffles!My only thought is that it would be nice if the rooms had glass water bottles instead of the two plastic ones provided in the refrigerator. This hotel seems to care about the environment, and this little touch would be nice. I am trying to never use plastic water bottles so I personally appreciate the ability to drink from a large, refillable, glass bottle. We truly enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel, and we will return!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful hotel in Denver's Union Station,"This is a great hotel to visit in Denver.  We fly into the airport and take the train here, then in the morning we rent a car for about half the price of the airport car rentals.  We arrived early and they had a room available for us.  It is a very clean and beautiful hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Most perfect place to stay in Denver,We are local to Denver and have stayed at The Crawford numerous times.  It’s location in U ion Station is ideal!  The rooms are historic and charming.  For out of town travelers this location is ideal as the light rain goes directly from DIA to Union Station.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford Made Us Feel Special,"My partner and I celebrate our anniversary on the 4th of July.  We live outside Denver, but love being in the downtown area, and so, every year we pick a ""fancy"" place to stay and treat ourselves.  This year, we chose the Crawford Hotel at Denver's Union Station.  We've often passed through the station as we utilize light rail for downtown access, but we had never stayed at the Crawford, and we were curious.  We chose a 'Pullman' room for our one night stay. From check in to check out, everything about the Crawford and their wonderful staff went far above and beyond our expectations. The amenities, were posh and quite fabulous.  You could easily stay completely within the confines of Union Station for your entire stay of you so desired. We had oysters at Stoic & Genuine. Ice cream at the Milk Box, cocktails at the exclusive Cooper Lounge, and a wonderful breakfast at Snooze. Margot and Kyle at the Crawford concierge desk made us feel privileged.  We didn't even get a chance to use hotel's free car service that features a Tesla...but we'll be back!  Highly recommending the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford rocks!,"Was only able to stay for the night but the team took great care of my wife and family.  We had cookies and milk for the kids when we checked in and the complementary ice cream and coffee for each member of our party was the perfect start to our exploration of the surrounding area.  The preferred seating at breakfast was a help and got us on our way to the next stop.  The restaurants were great.  Make sure to stop by the Mercantile.  Wonderful afternoon wine and cheese on the deck.  Really high end selection of meats and cheeses. The facility is amazing.  This is a great use of an old building.  Also take advantage of the free shuttle within two miles, my kids called it the space ship.Only complaint is we could not stay longer.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, beautiful hotel & very convenient","Amazing location. Only steps to the train that goes directly to the airport in 35 min for $9. The hotel has a tesla that can fit five passengers and they will take you anywhere within a two miles radius--and with the location of the hotel it was perfect. We got dropped off at highlands and Rino and then leisurely walked back to the hotel. A couple of good restaurants in the station. Highly recommend having hotel staff book a reservation for Snooze for breakfast. With your stay you get a free beer each day, a free scoop of ice cream, and cup of coffee from the stores in the station. Hotel staff was very friendly and had some great recommendations for food. Highly recommend this place. The price is definitely worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Eagles Concert,We loved everything about this hotel.The location was close to Coors Field and we walked to a concert. Could have walked to a play the next night but instead got to ride in the Tesla!The room was lovely and the staff were great.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience.,"We had passed through Denver Union Station a couple of years ago while it was still under renovation. Having read that upgrades were complete, we decided to come back and check it out. Arrived on the Amtrak Zephyr and checked in to the Crawford Hotel. We had an amazing time. Our room in the Crawford was perfect - king size bed, large bathroom, comfortable chairs and sofa. The room was immaculate. Nice view of the station tracks - but not noisy at all. The staff was very helpful. We never left the station complex in the two days we were there. Several excellent restaurants, Snooze and Terminal Bar are two in particular, but there are others as well. Terminal bar is a great place to unwind and people watch. Huge selection of craft beers as well as a nice wine list. Cooper's Lounge is another nice place to relax.Overall, a great travel experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Just checked in and so far worst experience I have ever had with a hotel,"Well, we just checked in. The room type I called to confirm TWICE, including earlier today, wasn’t available for us. We called and spoke to Kyle today who confirmed our room preference was in the computer where I had called weeks before. We stated AGAIN that we wouldn’t be here until around 10:30 pm and literally asked that they please not give our room away. We were assured they wouldn’t.Now I can’t unpack and settle in because I have to change rooms tomorrow. I had emailed with concierge to order a birthday surprise for my boyfriend, which was supposed to be a floral arrangement and some chocolate truffles. The amenity I ordered isn’t in the room either, so no nice birthday surprise on arrival.The lobby literally has tweakers in it. Two cops were trying to get a couple of them out when we walked in to check in and there were 2 more outside the main front doors.The compensation for not getting the correct room was a waiving of the $20 amenity fee for today which is laughable since we just got here at 11 pm and couldn’t use any of them anyway. Of course I didn’t know at that point that the birthday gifts I ordered weren’t delivered to the room either. This has started out wildly disappointing, and I am definitely not impressed.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect destination for a special occasion!,"I booked a room here to surprise my husband for his birthday. The room was absolutely gorgeous, a perfect combination of historical charm and modern amenities. The staff accommodated all my requests to have a special note and bottle of wine in the room upon our arrival, the complimentary car drove us to and from our dinner reservation and they even offered to book us a spot for breakfast in the morning. Plus the turn down service was the perfect little touch in making us feel already so pampered. Located right in the heart of the bustling Union Station neighborhood of Denver, it was the perfect home base for an amazing urban vacation in the city. Would definitely recommend for a first time visit to Denver or just for a fun staycation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Convenient and very nice rooms,"What an amazing place! Although we took a rental car from the airport, the local train would have taken us right to Union Station and the Crawford Hotel. The hotel, restaurants, and shops are all located in Union Station.  The roms were huge and service was wonderful. Hotel is just a block from the free city bus line or they will give you a free ride in a very nice Tesla to local spots. Will definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Convenience and Gracious Style,"I haven't been to downtown Denver in 25 years, but had the opportunity when a BOD meeting was scheduled at the Crawford Hotel. Landed at DEN and walked 5 minutes to the RTD train which whisked me to Union Station in 30 minutes for $4.50 ($9.00 if you're under 65). The Crawford Hotel is in Union Station which contains multiple restaurants, bars, shops as well as the Amtrak office and the hotel front desk on the main floor. The rooms are on the 2nd through 4th floors. We chose Stoic and Genuine for dinner and couldn't get enough of the oysters and wines. The rooms are very comfortable with modern-rustic feel, if that makes sense. We had a grab and go breakfast at Mercantile in the morning, completed our BOD meeting by noon, stepped out of the lobby and onto the train for a quick return trip to the airport. If you are having a meeting of 20 persons or less from around the country, you can't top the convenience of Denver and the Crawford Hotel. A great centerpiece for the downtown Denver renovations.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A must stay every time I'm in town!,"The Crawford may be a beautiful hotel in a really cool setting, but what separates it from anywhere else you may think about staying in Denver is the unbelievable service provided by their amazing staff.I come to Denver once a month for business, and can tell you I've never had better service staying at any hotel anywhere in the world.Tara, Ana, Sydney, Dominic, Riley, Kyle... you'll learn these names and be completely wowed by how well they will take care of you. Just a small example is when I switched rooms and left a couple of toiletry items in the old room and they were disposed of. Tara went out and purchased replacements for my missing items and brought them to me. (!)All of the people at the Crawford treat you in an amazingly high-class fashion and make you feel as if you're the only tenant staying there. I had a slightly delayed check in one time and they gave me a small bottle of champagne as a thank you for my patience.Don't forget Austin and Miles, who will drive you around locally in the beautiful Crawford Tesla, as well as help you find places to go and things to do while in the city.And if this all isn't enough, your small hotel fee gets you daily perks like free ice cream, coffee, those Tesla rides, a free beer daily, etc.Oh and if you're asking... yes the rooms are amazing too... very comfortable, great beds, all the best amenities, high-speed WiFi... a tablet in each room with info and reading materials... etc.Obviously I can't say enough about this wonderful place and their amazing staff. You couldn't pay me to stay anywhere else when I'm in town! I'm telling you as I tell anyone else who will listen!Trust me on this. Book it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"All good! Easy transportation, spacious guest room & good eats & entertainment options","Rode the train directly from the airport and rolled our bags to check-in The Crawford. Easy Peasy. Trendy fun cocktail bar, a variety of restaurant options and easy transportation made for a super relaxing, un-planned 5-night stay.  The hotel's Tesla was always available for us. We used the city-bikes, hopped on the trolley/bus, Uber-ed, and road the train roundtrip for airport transfers. ""Walking distance to Coor Field for baseball game.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great way to catch a train.,"We chose The Crawford as a comfortable overnight stay before catching Amtrak’s California Zephyr west across the Rockies. We flew early to Denver the previous day to catch a Rockies game and planned to store our luggage prior to check-in. Imagine our delight when our room was ready for us at 9 am! This gave us time for breakfast at the Mercantile in Union Station and a nap before game time a few blocks (easy walk) down the street at Coors Field.We had a deluxe queen, and it is everything the photos show. It has quaint charm with very modern amenities. Every staff member we came in contact with was super helpful.When you check in, you get a card that entitles you to discounts at several cool Union Station establishments. This was great for after the game and the next morning as we prepared to board the Zephyr.It may seem a bit expensive, but it’s a really great stay in a really great venue where you can literally step out of your room and onto the train. Treat yourself!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing venue,Just amazing setting for hotel and conference. Everything about the the hotel exceeds expectations. Great location from the airport. Stunning bars and restaurants in the foyer which brings back the history and heritage of the train station.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Few Days before Skiing,"We took the train from the Denver Airport to Union Station, it was so easy.  Our 3 day pre-ski stay at The Crawford was great.  The hotel is very nice and the energy of an active train station was fun.  We walked all around downtown, enjoying the sites and lots of great food.  A huge, huge thanks goes to Kyle, a hotel front desk employee.  He helped make our trip extra, extra special by securing us tickets to Hamilton. It was amazing.  Thank you, thank you Kyle.   We plan to make our pre-ski stay and annual event at The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"It's not cheap, but it is very nice and the service is excellent","Went with my boys in their 20s.  The check in was very nice and helpful.  We talked about inner, we reserved a ride in the Tesla, he explained the 20% off.  You come into a bustling place with restaurants, bars, & shops.  Then you go upstairs to your quiet room.  The train stops right in back and it looked like it was easy to get a ticket and go to the airport.  I had a car but never used it because where would I park?  We reserved a ride in the Tesla easily and the driver took our picture.The hotel gym is terrible, but they have an arrangement with a very nice gym across the street in a spa.  They have classes you could go to.One tip, you get priority at Snooze, but make your reservation the night before.  It was an hour wait for breakfast on a sunny Saturday & you can't walk in and get priority.It's a short walk to Rockies Stadium.  Lot's of good bars & restaurants.  Walk over & check out the food hall called Milk Bar.  So many places to eat, but not enough local shops to keep you out walking.  You can only eat and drink so much!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Historic Luxury,"Before our train trip we had an over night in The Crawford Hotel.  It was beautiful.  Mara at the front personally made sure our stay went smoothly.  The room decor was stunning and they really took the time to make all the little touches feel nice.I felt right at home with my morning chat with Chet while Lynn brewed up a perfect cup of coffee.The train was delayed but Tara and Dominic helped pass the time by telling us about some of the special parts of the historic building.  The property is spectacular and the staff is extrodiary.  Make this a stop on any visit to Denver, even to grab a scoop of ice cream or a beer in one of the restaurants in Union Station.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,UPS and downs ,"Downs:This place is a mess if you arrive by car and you need assistance with your luggage. The valet guys are overwhelmed by the amount of clients they have . At the desk a rude employee couldn’t even explain to us what to do with the car and the luggage, couldn’t respond to the simple question: there is anybody helping with the luggage?. She just kept saying she was busy. And than, after we asked somebody else what to do , she just asked: are you staying here? Which kind of question is that? Obviously if I’m asking you for help with the bags I’m not staying in the hotel across the street! UPS:On the other hand the gentleman that later checked us in was really nice and took good care of us.The room was a suite, so it was very big but unfortunately not view of any kind. To be precise in the bedroom part of the room no windows at all. But two bathrooms and a comfortable area where you can prepare your coffee( nespresso machine). Very quiet, couldn’t hear a thing, which is very good if you have troubles sleeping.I don’t think I would stay here again, better to try the Oxford Hotel, that, by the way, is a sister property.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anytime in Denver this is the place to stay,Welcoming staff. Lovely amenities. Rooms are beautifully designed and quiet. In addition you have the fun of the train station complete with delicious restaurants and shops. Great stay. Looking forward to our retun,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Had a very nice stay,This hotel was great and a ton of fun to stay at. I used to live in the area and miss my old apartment.. this was a nice throw back to the neighborhood. The room was excellent. Very high end and nice - even enjoyed the bath robe which I don't think I've ever done. They had a Tesla X private car and it was awesome to pull up to the restaurant and have the automatic gull wing doors open. After dinner I was able to call Riley the driver and he was there in less than 5 minutes. I think this was probably the coolest part of the stay. Couldn't be happier!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exploring Colorado,My girlfriend and I spent 3 days in Denver exploring breweries and cocktail bars. We had the pleasure of being helped by a valet driver named Riley. He recommended several places that we ate and drank at. He helped us enjoy Denver to its fullest. Our vacation was better because of his service and expertise. Thank you Riley!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Grand and refreshing,This is the second time I've stayed at the Crawford hotel and each time now I feel so happy and so relaxed thanks to the wonderful staff and the charming environment of a refurbished Grand train station. Sometimes it's just nice to experience the unconventional such as the main desk being just one Alcove of many in the Grand Central area of the station or the Tesla Model X as a courtesy car with a driver named Riley who is absolutely gracious and concerned about how well you're doing and even folks like Sydney at check-in who has a sixth sense to know when you might have had the worst experience with an airline and helps you with a wonderful room so that your troubles can begin to go away. Hang out at the outside fountains and get you feet wet.  So why not try the Crawford and become human once again and not a corporate automaton.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stay here if you are in downtown Denver,"This is my 2nd stay at the hotel and it was wonderful.  Location is excellent, and staff is awesome.  Kyle took great care of us at check in, and Riley gave us lifts around town w the car service.  Lively scene in lobby and lots to do around the hotel.  Free ice cream is a treat as well!The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of room service.  Pretty awful if you love hotel room service (like I do).  Paper containers delivered in a bag w plastic utensils.  However, they corrected our order immediately and did not charge us for the meal.We will always stay here when visiting Denver!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Night Out Retreat,"We had a great stay at The Crawford. While it’s not our first stay (Pullman Room), this one was better than the first. The King Loft room was very well designed and comfortable. We had a drink at The Cooper Lounge, which always amazes us. Dry ice served cocktail shrimp? Very well done. The desk staff was great, especially Sydney and Mara who graciously arranged for us to take a ride in their courtesy Tesla, when our dinner reservation was only 1 block away. Miles took us for a few extra blocks for fun and to enjoy the ride longer than we had planned.  We’ll definitely be back for the great experience and treatment.  Thanks!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The best,This is my favorite place to stay in Denver and there is nowhere I’ve stayed quite like it. They took great care of us on this trip and Mara was particularly helpful and spectacular. Will be back many times in the future!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford Hotel June 2018,"I stayed one night at The Crawford Hotel as part of business travel to Denver.  The hotel is located at Union Station with rail access to the airport.  The front desk was extremely polite and helpful.  The rooms were very nice with tall ceiling and windows.  The room was very comfortable for sleep, relax, and work.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best hotel for our train trip across America,"Hi - My partner and I took Amtrak across America. The Crawford Hotel at Union Station, Denver, was our best stay.  Convenient, large rooms, centrally located, delightful staff and excellent amenities. Go now!Kevin",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Historic Hotel, Best Location","Margot and Kyle at the front desk were just fantastic. They always greeted me with a smile, offered water and were more than willing to help with any questions. This hotel overall is just amazing, you can take the train from the airport and it will take you directly to Union Station, a lot traffic in Union Station, plenty of restaurants to eat at, great walking trails nearby as well.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Classy Hotel in Downtown Denver,"We arrived late in Denver after a long and weary journey and were greeted by super friendly staff at checkin of the Crawford Hotel.The hotel is centrally located in the historic Union Station building in Downtown Denver (around 40 minutes drive from the airport).  Having originally booked a “Pullman” room, the hotel graciously upgraded us to a “Classic Guest Room” on the 3rd floor.  Despite our rooms proximity to a bar, we heard absolutely nothing from it for the duration of our stay. The room itself was generously proportioned with a desk, seating area, a large bed and good sized shower room.  The room was clean and well maintained.  We did struggle to get the WIFI to work during the first day, but that issue seemed to resolve itself on the second day.The building in which the hotel resides is magnificent and has been tastefully restored in the spirit of its former life.  The atrium of the hotel features features a bar and cafe amongst other establishments and we found this kind of a neat area to hang out at the end of a long day.  Incidentally, the hotel does charge an amenity fee that includes (amongst other things) a free beer during happy hour at one of the bars in the atrium - kind of a good excuse for a drink.We were very happy with the Crawford Hotel and would stay here again without any hesitation.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Family weekend at a fantastic boutique hotel,"A friend recommended this hotel as we wanted to be in the city area for a quick weekend trip to Denver and it was the perfect recommendation! The hotel was very unique and the staff were amazing (Syndey and Courtney at the front desk were very helpful). We were there for 2 nights and had an awesome room close to the Cooper Lounge (where we enjoyed some delicious cocktails). I loved the atmosphere of this place, the room was great and it was walking distance to several great restaurants and activities in Denver. Would highly recommend this hotel.We stayed on the bed and breakfast package and the breakfast at Snooze was delicious!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A great stay experience,"the Crawford anchors the restored Union Station which is the hub now of downtown dining options and a fairly short walk to Coors Field if you're attending a Rockies game.  The Crawford has a very welcoming front desk who were very helpful during the stay.  The room was very well done with all of the options, cleanliness you might expect from a very good hotel.  The shops, eating options, entertainment, etc. in and around Union Station make it a real fun place to spend a few days--had to work on the calorie intake when I got back home.  Oh, the Crawford was extremely helpful when it comes to making short trips within a two mile radius--they have one of those gull winged Teslas to squire you around.  Not a bad stay by any standard.  I give it highest marks.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Staycation Weekend,Had a great time at the Crawford Hotel in Union Station for a weekend getaway! The staff were fantastic and Kyle made sure we were satisfied. Super Location so close to everything and we used their Tesla service to go to dinner too--definitely recommend!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Mother's Day weekend in beautiful Crawford Hotel,"Worked w/ Tara to book unique loft room for Mom's Day. Tara was so helpful & a pleasure to work with; she made sure we were comfortable & in the best room possible. We'll be back soon, thank you Tara!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford-What a Fantastic Hotel!,"I just returned from a visit to Denver. Staying at the Crawford was a highlight of the trip. The staff was so wonderful and accommodating. We were warmly greeted by Kyle and Dominic at the front desk who gave us promotions and recommendations for a few of the many restaurants and bars in the hotel lobby. They couldn't have been more friendly and accomodating throughout the weekend.. They even informed us about a great tour of the hotel/station which was very informative and interesting. The room and bathroom were large and the bed very comfortable. The hotel is in a wonderful central and exciting  location in the city. Anya, also at the front desk, was fantastic in giving us information we needed as this was our first visit to Denver. She made checkout a breeze, offering us bottles of water for our trip to the airport. By the time we reached the outside of the hotel, our car was there waiting for us.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford Hotel Denver COLORADO,This was a wonderful hotel! Excellent service and so clean and great appointments in the room. The staff was exceptional and the location was convenient to many tourist spots and public transportation! Highly recommend this hotel in this historic site.The Fritzes from MN.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Service Ever!,"We recently spent Memorial Day Weekend at The Crawford Hotel. It was one of the best hotel experiences we have had in recent memory. The staff was incredible...making fabulous shopping, activity, and even late, late night dining recommendations and securing difficult to get dining reservations and baseball tickets. They made our weekend and really came through when I left a few things behind. The room was lovely and super quiet despite the really fun and hopping lobby. Loved every minute of our stay, Red Rocks, and Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to stay if you are an Amtrak traveler,"My college age daughter and I traveled to Denver via Amtrak for a Spring Break Trip in March.  The Crawford is part of the train station which made it really convenient.  Our train arrived early morning before our room was available.  Courtney at the front desk was wonderful.  She checked our bags, had the bags delivered to our room when it was ready and let us know with a text message.  At check out, she also checked our bags since our train was leaving several hours later.  She couldn't have been more helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,smack dab in Denver's living room,"Full of vitality, this LoDo area is a fun area to visit and Mrs. Crawford deserves a vote of thanks for largely making it so.  It is conveniently accessible to visitors (via the light rail direct from the airport) and to Denver denizens on their way to or from Coors field.  Security is well thought out with a guest key required to operate the elevator between floors and to access the individual hallways.  The room appointments are beginning to show some wear with some of the furniture trending towards 'shabby' with chips of veneer having been knocked off and drawers that are hard to open.  housekeepers were in short supply, though were often seen in the hallways; the rooms were not thoroughly cleaned (dirty coffee cups left lying about, espresso maker not cleaned) nor were toiletries (make up remover sheets, soaps) replaced.  as is mentioned elsewhere, the concierge service is very average.  upon arriving for several dining reservations we were told they had not been placed.  Considering the time zone differences of visitors, the added wait can be awkward if not uncomfortable.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, luxurious rooms, top-notch service!",The Crawford Hotel was the perfect place to stay for our long weekend in Colorado. The rooms were so nice and the service was great. Lots of perks staying here and it’s centrally located. We will definitely be coming back to stay! Wish I could give it 100 stars!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved Union Station!,"Awesome place to stay! We loved the historical site w amazing amenities. Great for vacation or staycation. Take advantage of all the amenities: Farmer’s market Sat, walk to Rockies game, Tesla ride, nightly ice cream, morning brew, happy hour craft beers and Snooze bfast!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top-notch and so convenient,"We were scheduled to travel by Amtrak the following morning and the Crawford seemed like the most convenient of locations so that we didn't need a taxi from somewhere else to the train station at an early hour.  The price was a little daunting but ultimately convenience won out.  The hotel staff were so friendly, our ""resort amenity fee"" got us a few freebies to offset part of the cost, and the room was lovely and delightfully comfortable.  I think I made the right decision in selecting to stay at the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Hotel,"Pulling up to this hotel, you are amazed by the location, atmosphere, and the train station lobby. The valet staff and check-in staff were nice and friendly. The room was beautiful and comfortable. There are a ton of restaurant options within walking distance, including a whole foods. My room was facing the train tracks, and although you could hear the comings and goings of the trains and the bells, it did not keep me up at night.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Riley saves the day,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Crawford for an evening out in Denver. The hotel is beautiful and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  We loved that we could get a ride in the Tesla on our way to dinner and were lucky enough to get a ride back as well. Riley, our Tesla driver, was fun and professional. On our way back to the hotel, Riley noticed immediately that the car in front of us was driving erratically.  He mentioned that he was going to fall back and give that car space.  Within a couple of blocks the driver of the car in front was hanging out of the car with the driver’s side door open, almost hit another car, then quickly turned the car and ran over the sidewalk and into a building. The situation was terrifying and Riley was very calm throughout everything.  It could have been much worse and we were very thankful for Riley’s quick thinking!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,I must be missing something,"We’ve had excellent stays at 2 other hotels in Denver, that I would just rave about, but their prices had shot way up, so my husband booked this hotel.  We were celebrating an anniversary of sorts...  as I read the other reviews about the amazing management, etc., I wondered if they were talking about a different place.  We had only the most benign and unhelpful interactions with management.  Apart from being in a hotel room, this has never felt like a hotel at all.  Many of the “amenities” they provide are sort of useless for me (I drink tea, so the Nespresso coffee maker in the room was not useful, I have an iPad so I can read and play my own music, I am allergic to dairy products, I don’t drink alcohol, etc.).  If you want to hang out in a crowded, noisy hotel lobby that’s actually a train station, this is the place for you.  (But it’s not your typical Amtrak station, it’s more light rail oriented.). Others have asked if the rooms were noisy here, from the trains (not at all - the noise in our room came from the room next door, with the guy loudly and tunelessly singing and waking us up in the morning - the walls are “thin” - and from another guy sitting in the hall conducting a loud phone conversation).  Otherwise the rooms are quite quiet.  What is also noisy - the lobby and the restaurants, especially the breakfast one.  I really had problems with the lighting in the bathroom (those energy saving LED lights are known for casting strange shadows - hint, you can use your iPad’s camera mode instead of the mirror) and as another person mentioned the pillows are not nice... small and lumpy.  I wouldn’t rate this a zero, but I would never want to stay here again.  We would even have checked out a day early if we hadn’t prepaid.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel in Historic Building,A wonderful Hotel in Old Union Station ... in downtown Denver ... nice rooms ... great service ... friendly & helpful staff!!!  Although you have to pay an extra $20 per day per room as a facility fee you do get perks like a free shuttle ride in a tesla within 2 miles .. great for going to dinner ... free coffee / free ice cream & free beer during happy hour !,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,"I received a free upgrade upon arrival. The room was great and all the amenities were fantastic. I would definitely recommend taking advantage of the ice cream, coffee, and car service. The car service was especially helpful with great restaurants just outside walking distance (1-2 mi away). Our driver Riley was helpful suggesting new places and picking us up quickly. Overall an 5 star experience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Gotta be the best hotel in Denver,"the Crawford throws in a lot of nice extras for your stay, and Union station is a great place to spend some time. Lots of good restaurants and bars in the surrounding area. Rooms are charming and modern. Wonderful spot!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun Time,"We arrived in Denver by Plane and took the train to the Hotel Crawford at Union Station. We checked in and they were very pleasant. The room was lovely and bright. Once we unpacked we went downstairs to the train station. whick is now a lively place with lots to do. Several restraunts, deli, drinks and ice cream.  We had made reservations for dinner at The Fort which was about 1/2 hour away. Mara and Courtney at the main desk were extremely helpful in helping us to the restaurant and back. They really went out of the way and made us feel like they appreciated our business.  On monday we had a few errends to take care of and the girls arranged for the hotel's driver to help us. We got to ride in a Tesla which was fun. I would highly recommend this hotel It was very convenient taking the train directly from the airport to there lobby. Also the staff does a great job in making you feel like your wish is taken care of. No stress and very relaxing  Again thank you Mara and Courtney.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic in EVERY way!!!,"My husband and I stayed at The Crawford in April so that we could celebrate his birthday. I had taken him to Vegas the year before, and was worried that I wouldn't be able to do something as special this time around, but I had no idea what was awaiting us. It was honestly one of the most exquisite stays we have ever had at a hotel! We were treated so beautifully from the very start too. After I made the online reservation, I was contacted by Ian from concierge to see if there was anything we needed. Once I told him that it was my husband's birthday, he took it upon himself to have a complimentary bottle of prosecco waiting for us in the room along with a lovely card. But he then went an AMAZING step further...he upgraded us to the most fabulous room we've ever stayed in. We were awestruck when we walked in and I couldn't believe how generous he had been. His kindness allowed me to give my husband a birthday that he will always remember. (Did I mention that Ian came over to introduce himself to us when we first checked in? He also called a few minutes after we got into our room to make sure that we were happy and had everything we needed. I can't say this enough...IAN IS THE BEST!!!!!) As part of our date package, that evening we had drinks and appetizers at The Cooper Lounge. If you ever stay at the hotel, or are even in the area, GO HERE! They reserved a table for us with our last name handwritten on a beautiful place card (which I kept because it was so pretty!). They also have the most delicious cocktails and food that will absolutely blow you away! Their presentation is fantastic! Every single person on their staff was professional and obviously loved what they do. When we checked out the next day, all we could talk about is how we wished we could stay longer. It was an experience we will always treasure and my husband said it was one of the best birthdays he's ever had!!! We're already trying to make plans to go back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Engagement Weekend EVER!!!!!,"I had been planning a weekend proposal getaway with  my now fiance and The Crawford Hotel met every expectation I could have ever had for my proposal weekend. We when checked in, the staffed asked what our plans were for the weekend and what we had going on. I explained that we had gotten engaged earlier that morning and that we were there to celebrate. Everyone stopped what they were doing to congratulate us and tell us how happy they were for us. Our room was not ready due to us arriving a little earlier than expected, but the staff held our bags for us while we went and got spoiled with spa services and once our room was ready they called to let us know. When we got back to The Crawford the night shift staff had taken over and joyfully greeted us and helped us with our check in. Once we got upstairs to the room we were greeted with a chilled bottle of champagne and a beautifully written congratulations card along with the most amazing loft room I had ever seen. After a few hours of drinking and celebrating I went downstairs looking for a place to purchase water, I stopped at the front desk and the night shift staff sprang to action and gladly helped me out with my water needs all the while congratulating me and telling me how excited they were to have been chosen for the weekend getaway. I honestly could not have pictured a more perfect weekend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique hotel experience,"The Crawford hotel was accommodating from the valet to the checkout. Valet was quick and easy, check in super easy. Front desk offers bottled water while you’re waiting and upgraded our room right away. For $20/night convenience fee you get some great deals like free happy hour beer and a scoop of ice cream each night for free along with other great deals! The room was so clean and tidy with an ultra modern bath with great shower! The cooper lounge was cozy to enjoy a cocktail and the pub downstairs had great food. I couldn’t have been more happy with our stay and being our first time in Denver, I would recommend this hotel to anyone!! The concierge offers a free shuttle within 2 miles which is super convenient! Only complaint was there was only an espresso machine in the room and not a coffee maker and the pub offers a free beer but it would be nice to have a cocktail if you are not a beer drinker.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Amazing hotel, great for small business meetings","I stayed at the Crawford at Union Station for 3 nights for a work trip. The entire experience was great. Rooms are nice and quiet. Staff is friendly and helpful. Venue is beautiful, has tons of energy, but also maintains a professional enough atmosphere to have work meetings on the main floor. Conference rooms in basement are solid.Our team of 14 was mostly from out of town and the Crawford is well located to make the most out of after-work city spelunking.",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Road trip from Winter Park to Salt Lake City,"Drove into Denver and we did not know much of the city.  Just happened upon a Mid Century modern furniture store, stopped in and started up a conversation with the owner. I asked of a nice place to stay and he immediately said to stay at The Crawford Hotel. This was the beginning of a wonderful experience. From the valet, to the front desk, we encountered only top quality people! The room was spacious and clean.  The decor was beautiful. My wife and I were thrilled and so happy to be here!",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Amazing service, rooms and amenities!","We stayed here over the weekend to celebrate my birthday and it was an incredible weekend from start to finish! Upon check in we were told we were given a complimentary upgrade based on the occasion, and our room was ready! Riley checked us in and made the experience so much better by keeping us informed of all the amenities, restaurants and hot spots available to us. He then showed us to the elevator and we got into our amazing room, room 445 which was a beautiful loft. 10 minutes later we hear a knock on the door and we're greeted by Riley again with champagne and card for my birthday. It was an amazing experience and so nice of them to do! Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, and at checkout even kept our bags so we could enjoy the day. Having worked in the hospitality industry, I know it's the little things that make a great guest experience and you guys went above and beyond! Thank you again Ian, Kyle, Courtney and special thanks to Riley! Thanks for an amazing trip, can't wait to come back. - The Pascal Party",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing,"This hotel was the best stay of our trip.  We booked a room with the Union Station history tour included.  The room was beautiful but the bathroom was amazing.  It had a claw foot tub, double sink vanity, and large shower with rain head.  Our room was once the office of Adolph Coors.  We took the history tour of Union Station and were able to learn the history and see some of the other hotel rooms.  Since all the rooms are a little different it was nice to see especially the Pullman room and Attic rooms.  We also received our own copy of the Denver Union Station history book.  Even if you don't stay at the Crawford the history tour is worth the time or just going and seeing the station itself.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wedding Night,My husband and I spent our first (and second) night as husband and wife at The Crawford and it was absolutely perfect! They have a great staff with excellent service and you can’t beat the central location.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,AMAZING,The hotel was amazing. I visited Denver to attend a concert at Red Rock. The staff were awesome for the check in & out. I arrived early and they were so accommodating. I had dinner and drinks at the Terminal Bar which the staff were great. I couldnt ask for any better service. Also the location is great for taking the train to the airport. When I come back to Denver I will be staying at the Crawford Hotel again.,5

The bed and bathroom were fantastic.  The service staff were all very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely return in the future.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful renovation in an active train station.  ,"The Denver train station is a bustling , active transit station with Amtrak, busses, and rail trains serving the airport and Denver.  The renovated  train station and Crawford Hotel in the train station is perfect. Perfect location for the Crawford connecting to rest of the city.  Food, coffee, and retailers in train station are high quality.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Sensational service,"Just came back from a weekend in Denver. When we travel, our accommodations are usually made with a chain hotel, because we know what to expect. This time however, our travel agent branched out and surprised us with a weekend stay at The Crawford Hotel.  We were not disappointed, we were pleasantly surprise with everything this hotel had to offer. The Crawford Hotel, downtown Denver’s newest luxury hotel, is located in the iconic Denver Union Station. Located conveniently to the commuter rail connecting travelers directly from Denver International Airport to the hotel. The Crawford Hotel is centrally located to the 16th Street Mall, the mile-long, pedestrian-friendly Mall is filled with shopping, restaurants and attractions. Without a doubt, the location and service in this hotel was above and beyond anything we could possibly have asked for. Their staff was incredible, every service offered with a smile. Thank you Ian, Courtney, and Kyle for making it a five star stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome historic property with great service!,"The property itself is worth going to visit, but the friendly and professional staff, the modern accommodations and all the extras they throw in (like a car service within 2 miles of the hotel; free ice cream, beer and coffee daily, etc.) make your stay a great experience!  I will stay here again next time i'm in Denver!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Always The Best,"This may have been the 4th or 5th time staying her. I love it!!!!! Between The Oxford and The Crawford, I am so happy! The staff is amazing, the rooms fabulous, and the location over the top! I can't say enough for Union Station.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,"We stayed in the loft style room and we just loved it ! We took advantage of the complementary coffee and ice cream as well as the craft beer at The Terminal Bar. We had dinner at the Mercantile and it was just DELICIOUS! Union Station has been wonderfully renovated. Riley, one of the Tesla driver, was very pleasant and knowledgeable of the city. I highly recommend anyone visiting Denver to stay at The Crawford Hotel !",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Staying in Denver? There's no other hotel to stay with,"The Crawford exceeded every expectation my girlfriend and I came with.To put this simply, we picked the Crawford based on the pictures of our room. We received a beautiful, modern room. It goes without saying, the care we received matched the room, Kyle and Courtney at the front desk took care of every request and turned us on to some of the cooler hiking spots in the area.What put the trip over the moon was the perks and thought the hotel put into our stay. Between the Tesla to shuttle us around the city, free ice cream & beer, and the guest only waiting list at Snooze...we felt like VIP's at every moment.I can't say enough, I can't imagine staying anywhere else when I come back to the city.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Special Treatment on our Wedding Night,"The Crawford went above and beyond for our wedding night. My now husband called ahead and ordered champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, the works - and when we arrived it was nicely laid out along with rose petals on the bed. Not only this, they had slippers placed on the floor next to the bed for us, water bottles on each nightstand, and... MILK AND COOKIES. I was not expecting that at all but I will not lie I was having some heartburn and felt I needed something to soak up some of the alcohol and I was so thankful for that gesture. What a great midnight snack we had together as husband and wife. Thank you for that extra special touch, Crawford Hotel. :) Also if you're staying here MAKE SURE YOU USE YOUR AMENITIES - you can get preferred seating at Snooze but need to make the arrangements the day before, you can get a free scoop of ice cream, a drink at terminal bar, and others - just know what you get and make sure you use it to your full advantage! Ask a staff member because they are all super helpful. Beautiful property, great location, plenty to do in Denver, and a memorable way to spend a first couple of days as husband and wife.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Visit at the Crawford ,"My partner surprised me with a staycation for my birthday at the Crawford! I had been wanting to go there since it opened and loved every minute of it! First off... how can you not love a place inside an old train station with the hustle and bustle of travelers and great restaurants to top it off. The people were friendly and helpful! The showers were beyond amazing... I wish I could have one in my own place. We got room service from Snooze... that’s right Snooze is their room service! If you ever get the opportunity to stay at the Crawford, snatch it up!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Stay-cation!,"We just stayed here for a getaway for the weekend. Everything was great, they upgraded our room, and we booked the Bed and Breakfast package with Snooze breakfast credit via room service. It was so great! Ate at Stoic and Genuine for dinner and basically stayed at Union Station for the night! So good, highly recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Amazing stay, highly recommend!","We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival (room 446-very quiet and beautiful) and there was even a bottle of Prosecco (on ice) with glasses in our room since we were celebrating my husband's birthday! The Crawford Hotel is truly an experience. The location can't be beat and the hotel is gorgeous. Service is excellent and we really couldn't have asked for more. We were on a staycation and will absolutely be back again. We took advantage of all of the free perks including free beer, free coffee and free ice cream. We also ordered Snooze in-room take out. Got to eat it in bed in the comfy robes, can't beat that! I highly recommend this hotel and we can't wait to go back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Hotel and More!,"Thanks to The Crawford Hotel for an amazing birthday weekend!  The room was spacious, clean and very quiet.  We were so impressed with all the ""perks"" that came with the room.  We took advantage of the free coffee, beer and Tesla rides.  Riley was an amazing driver and was so great to chat with.  This place is first-class and we will return again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for a stay-cation!,"Absolutely everything about The Crawford is calling us back for another stay.  As a Denver native I have fond memories of seeing the growth and change sweep through the Union Station area.  The addition of The Crawford is a crown jewel to the whole area.  Every single staff person was so pleasant and helpful, Austin - one of the Tesla drivers - was an excellent host and guide to the city. The room (424) was magnificent with huge windows overlooking they fountains in front of The Kitchen. We were sure to enjoy the complimentary beers from The Terminal Bar, ice cream from The Milkbox, and priority seating for Sunday brunch at Snooze.  Seriously - who goes from bed to brunch at Snooze on a Sunday in 15 minutes???  We did.  It was awesome. I can die happy now.  But I hope I don't before we get another weekend-long-date & stay-cation at The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotel, even better service","We stayed at The Crawford Hotel for our anniversary. The hotel is ideally located in the LoDo area. It’s also situated atop what seems like a train station (the concept seems to be a smaller scale version of NYC’s Grand Central Station).  The lobby of the hotel has several bars, coffee shops, eateries — you basically take an elevator down into a mini bustling setting. There are also plenty of restaurants, bars, and sites nearby. Larimer Square and the 16th street mall are walkable but there’s also a free bus that takes you close enough. You’re within a 3-mike radius from most of the big pockets of city life. The service at the hotel is probably among the best we’ve had. Courtney and Kyle were super helpful (and even sent us a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine for our anniversary). The hotel offers a bunch of free stuff and discounts at local eateries. There’s also a complimentary Tesla Model X that will take you anywhere within a 2 mile radius. All in all, highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great all around experience.,"Kyle was awesome from start to finish. Was in town for a conference and lucky got upgraded to a suite which made the co-workers jealous! Room was spacious, modern and very clean. Bathroom was newly renovated and absolutely top notch. They kept my bags while my room was being made ready so I was able to go see the city for a couple hours without having to keep up with luggage. Wonderful guest experience all around. 5 stars!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, historic interest, train station","had a great stay at the Crawford, it started when i arrived, Marie at the front desk was very helpful, i had a great room, huge very comfortable. the location if the hotel was fantastic, a few block from the baseball field where i caught a few innings of a game at a very reasonable price",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Everything!,"Our second stay at the Crawford was better then the first!  Everything and everyone at the Crawford was perfect.  The property itself, in the heart of a Denver Union Station, couldn’t be better.  It is walking distance from the 16th Street Mall and Coors Field, and a short distance to everything in downtown.  The station has great amenities that you can research on the Crawford web site.  If you haven’t been to Denver, you will find that Union Station and the Crawford are at the end of the light-rail line from DIA.  You won’t need a car because everything is a $10 or so Uber ride.I would call the rooms at the Crawford throwback modern.  While they give the appearance of being from the stations early days, the room appointments are all modern, new and fresh.  The best part of the Crawford may be the staff.  They put accommodating into accommodations (sorry, couldn’t resist).  The staff will do everything they can to make your stay memorable.  Like us, you will likely find that your first visit to The Crawford will not be your last!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful hotel,"This is a wonderful luxury hotel with great amenities and helpful staff. We flew into Denver and were taking Amtrak out to Sacramento, California. It was very convenient to take RDT from the airport to Union Station and the Crawford Hotel is right there with the front desk on the ground floor of Union Station. For dinner the courtesy car took us to the Buckhorn Exchange and then picked us up after dinner. The next morning we caught Amtrak to Sacramento. Since we are returning the same way we will be staying at the Crawford Hotel on the return trip. We plan to have dinner at the Ultria on the return trip which is also located at Union Station. Many choices. We are already thinking of another trip to Denver with the Crawford Hotel and Union Station as the hub for that trip.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The only downside of staying at the Crawford...,"...is having to check out. Every detail, every contact, every experience during my stay felt designed for me. I guess the other downside is how it raises the bar of my expectations at other hotels. It’s elegantly beautiful, historic, comfortable, welcoming at every turn, at the center of everything, and my favorite hotel. Ever.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Not your ordinary hotel...finally.,"This place is both hip and historic. We came for a night on the town for my husband’s birthday. He is an engineer and historic rebuild manager so it was right up his alley. We so enjoyed just hanging out having cocktails and playing shuffleboard. We loved to tour and look at all of the art and history of the building. The upgraded room was a joy, clean cozy robes and slippers. And the snooze breakfast in bed cannot be beat.The station is the hub of downtown and you can do anything from there. It was so easy to get around to nightlife, but would have been just as fun to stay put. One of the highlights of our experience was the integrated nature of “Denvers living room”. The station is filled with people traveling to and from, students studying at the long tables. Young hipsters sipping cocktails and ordering tapas, Families, elegant couples, and yes there were also transient and homeless people.Crawford security did an amazing job honoring and respecting all of the humans, while keeping everyone safe. Which made it such a pleasurable place to be with community.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Baseball Birthday Getaway,"This was a great experience.  I stayed at this hotel for my 42nd birthday and the Cubs had been in town.  It was an amazingly beautiful hotel room and definitely lived up to the expectation of being a high class and full service hotel.  I enjoyed all of the room, a very comfy bed, amazing shower with a rain shower experience and the many perks of staying at the hotel.  I have always wanted to stay at this hotel.  I feel like this is a dream getaway in the city because it is in Union Station and it did not disappoint.  I really would love to come back and highly recommend this hotel for anyone.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Fantastic Way to Showcase Union Station with a 5-Star Hotel,"We took the train from DIA to Union Station and found ourselves at the Crawford.  A traveler couldn't find a better staff to compliment the facility itself.  Our room was incredible - tall ceiling and floor to ceiling windows.  Don't lay down on the bed - you won't want to leave.  The rooms are spacious.  The hotel's courtesy car is driven by Austin, and there aren't enough words to describe this transplant from N.Y.  The man is extremely friendly and outgoing.  He will meet you at the agreed upon time both to and from your destination.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Felt like stepping into the lobby of the Crawford led to the Orient Express train!,"This is truly a landmark hotel.  Renovations made to take it from near ruin to today make this place an architect's delight.  I took my daughter (adult) and 2 13 yr old grandchildren to Denver on a birthday trip for the 3 of them.  This hotel was what I had hoped for.  The staff was helpful, accommodating when we needed advice, friendly to 2 kids who have very little experience in a city other than their home.  The lobby is beautiful.  You can have a coffee, adult beverage, or ? and sit and watch the world go by.  Because it is still a working train station (Amtrak) it is busy and because there are restaurants than ring the lobby from the inside, you can order a drink and take it to a comfy chair or couch in  the lobby to sit, read, people watch, relax, chat - whatever.  Knowledgeable concierge (Tim) was helpful figuring out the best places for us.  The shuttle service provided to places nearby was a Tesla SUV - yup - a Tesla.  That in itself was a hoot for the kids and actually us too!  It is on the higher price range, bot deals can be had.  The rooms are in keeping with the style of the hotel - huge ceilings, doors.  The bathroom - marble, giant shower, lovely amenities.  We were on the 3rd floor - quiet and great sleeping.  Cannot say enough about the place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Buzzing with Life,"A station hotel with a difference - sheer class and sophistication, pleasant rooms superb staff and a buzz of excitement all around. The images online do not do justice to the reality as they are larger than they look. The classic rooms have vast ceilings and high windows, the Loft rooms are big and airy (beware of rabbits!)  and the Pullman are a great deal bigger than a sleeper compartment on a train. All are very quiet and double glazed to exclude noise from the station. Union Station itself is some station, 5 star deluxe with boutique bars and restaurants of a very high level indeed. Victoria Station this is not! immaculate and interior designed more like a top end hotel lobby with all the trimmings. Once outside you are in the trendiest neighbourhood in town - think Tribeca in NYC. Great shops and bars and restaurants and a stone through from the ball park Coors Field and Larimer square's boutiques. Most importantly close to Rockmount Ranchwear which has been kitting our the Wild West for 3 generations. The location of the Crawford is just impossible to beat!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The best place to stay in Denver,"The Crawford Hotel is the best place to stay in Denver when taking the Ski Train the next day to Winter Park. Reception staff were lovely especially Kyle who was warm, funny and shared some great restaurant suggestions for us to explore on Larimer Street. We stay in the Premium Loft Suite and the valet had whisked our luggage up to our room in the short time it took to check in. A lovely card and chilled bottle of sparkling wine welcomed us and the room was full of character and luxe styling. The large soaking tub in the en suite bathroom was divine. Amentities were on point including the lovely C.O. Bigelow toiletries. So convenient for the restaurants and bars in Downtown Denver especially the cosmopolitan chic eateries on Larimer St. Super comfortable rooms that were very quiet given you're in the heart of Denver Union Station. Super secure as well with private key card access for the lifts and guestroom floors. Highly recommend staying here next time you're in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Place!!,"We stayed here for our last night in Denver, the hotel was stunning, the room was simply to die for! We had one of the loft rooms, everything we could possibly need was in there! The staff at the desk were AWESOME, I think the gals name was Cindy? She was the bomb.com she checked us in on the 12th of April, last name was Perry, please look her up because she deserves a promotion! Her professionalism was on point! The valet was fast and the different amenities were exactly what we needed after a long week of hiking and driving all over Colorado! The one thing we didn't realize is that the Union Station is still a station so there was a ton of people in the main atrium using the facilities, shops, restaurants, and benches. There were several people pan handling which wasn't really concerning, rather a surprise, there was a law enforcement presence that kept the space safe and nice. The hotel did a great job with sound proofing airlock doors to keep rooms quiet, and private key card access to keep only hotel guests in their areas. The hotel Tesla took us to the Denver art museum the night we arrived, the driver was great and the car was such a unique way to travel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great staff!","Every time we have come to Union Station, we have wanted to stay at the Crawford, so we finally decided to have a weekend getaway there!  It has a great vibe and is beautifully appointed. From the 4th floor corridor, we could see down over Cooper Union (classy bar) and the main concourse and we were pleasantly surprised that our room was very quiet despite the station being a bustling place. We also brought our 2 dogs (labradors) and the staff made them feel as welcome as they did us. I would highly recommend the Crawford for both vacation and business travel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Weekend Vaca done right!,Everything was phenomenal! Snooze for breakfast was a major highlight. And the Courtesy car with Tesla was bomb! Shoutout to Riley for being an amazing driver! Great mini vaca and very much needed! :),5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Vacation,"Gotta say, no problem finding things to do! All restaurants were close and no problem getting to sports games. The Uber in the Tesla was an absolute highlight to the stay! Thanks Riley, you made the trip more welcoming and exuberant!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Birthday weekend!,"Here for my wife's birthday weekend and the service at this place is OVER the top!  Margot the night manager was fantastic.   The character of the rooms is fantastic.  The uniqueness of how they have renovated this hotel in Union Station is very cool.We have traveled to many areas and stayed many places.  While a smidge pricy it is easily a top hotel for character, amenities and service!Stay if you get the chance.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very cool hotel,"We spent the weekend in Denver and the Crawford Hotel is such a cool place to stay. It is beautiful, surrounded by cool places to go, shop, and eat. The room was very comfortable and we got little extra bonuses like free coffee and ice cream at the shops in the lobby (Pigtrain Coffee Co and MailboxIce Creamery). We did not end up using the Terminal Bar, but the menu looks great. My tip would be to ask for a room that does not face the mezzanine as that would be much noisier. We were initially given that room but the very helpful front staff charged us to a loft which was spacious and quiet. We will 100% stay here again the next time we go to Denver",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Always great,"We’ve stayed her a few times now, and can’t wait to go back! The staff is friendly, rooms are great and the atmosphere is quintessential Denver. When you go, be sure to take advantage of the freebies for staying at the hotel within union station.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Birthday Trip,"What a fabulous hotel! Love the decor, the rooms very spacious and comfy! The staff was exceptional. All of the dining choices was also very convenient and delicious. Location was perfect for all downtown activities.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Absolutely flawless,"You know that you are dealing with a class establishment when all of your needs are met without asking for anything! We checked in yesterday afternoon for my Birthday and our 13th Wedding Anniversary. We were upgraded to a beautiful, spacious, corner room. A bottle of bubbly was awaiting us with a note acknowledging our celebration. It was so incredibly special! So many amenities! You just don't feel like you are being nickeled and dimed. The staff is incredibly attentive, from the front desk to the courtesy driver (Riley). We had gone with the Stranahan's Whiskey Tour package, and our whole stay was absolutely flawless! Renovated Union Station is a breathtaking location, a city within a city. Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful stay at a historic and elegant Denver hotel,"We enjoyed a spectacular room overlooking Denver. It had a super comfortable king size bed and lovely sitting area with an additional tv and space to stretch out. Enormous floor to ceiling(20 feet high maybe?)windows with tons of light. Comfy bed linens and aesthetic lighting. Claw foot tub and dual head shower. Yummy Bigelow bath amenities. We enjoyed the 24/7 workout room and happy hour in the fabulous Cooper Lounge on the hotel 3rd floor. You’ll pay a $20 amenity fee but it includes turn down service with 2 bottles of water, chocolate truffles, coffee in the lobby, a complimentary beer during specific hours as well as transportation in a cool Tesla per availability within 2 mi of the hotel. The hotel is in Union Station, downtown Denver. A couple of blocks from Coors Field. This is perfect if you hop on the A Line train from DIA for $9. Super location, a return to yesteryear as a part of the historic Union Station. Service was impeccable. Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great drivers, worthless concierge","We decided to book the Crawford for a birthday staycation. We chose a package that included a tour of Stranahan's Whiskey. We were told we would need to schedule the tour time with the concierge, Ian. We called several times and he was never at work, left messages and did not hear back. After a few weeks I got frustrated and voiced my concern to a manager as our date was quickly approaching and we had still not been able to book our tour. She assured me he would call back the next day and he did. After a little back and forth he schedule our tour and I thought all was good. Checkin was smooth, the room was beautiful and Riley took us in the Tesla to a concert that evening. He was amazing, friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the area. We called him after the concert and he picked us up and delivered us a bottle of proseco after the show for my birthday! Amazing customer service! The next day Austin picked us up in the Tesla again for our Stranahan tour and again, super friendly and a great ride! When we got to Stranahan they had no reservation for us so the concierge, after all that trouble had dropped the ball again. I had to contact the hotel so they could accomodate us for the tour. This was extremely frustrating as I had already had issues with Ian and he certainly wasn't friendly when dealing with him yet again. Luckily the people at Stranahan's were amazing and super accommodating and saved the day getting us in on the tour and finding a bottle for us to take home. Austin brought us back, again - great ride! The front desk people apologized for the ""hiccup"" as they called it but honestly for that much money the entire thing should have been much more smooth. The hotel was great but if you have to deal with the concierge at all, good luck - he's either not there or doesn't follow through. Huge shout out to the drivers though, if you do stay ask for Ian or Riley to take you for a great ride!",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Wonderful stay, great location!",We stayed at the Crawford on our way through Denver and had a fabulous time! Everyone was very nice and accommodating and the room was excellent. There is even a Tesla that will take you anywhere within a 2-mile radius. There are a ton of amazing restaurants at Union Station and within a close distance to the hotel as well!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.,"We began our honeymoon in Denver and kicked it off at The Crawford. It is such a swanky and modern hotel-we loved it. Immediately upon checking in they informed us our room was upgraded to the Crawford Suite since we were Honeymooning. HOLY CRAP-it was the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in. It had 2 bathrooms, an amazing tub, the bed was so comfortable. They even left chocolates and champagne and a lovely note for us to congratulate us. The service was excellent, and the entire hotel just felt so fancy! The location was perfect as well-many things are walking distance, and they have a Tesla service that you can take if you go within 2 miles. The restaurants surrounding the hotel are awesome as well-We ate at The Terminal Bar & Snooze-both had excellent food. Whenever we return to Denver, we will definitely stay here again!!:)",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Stay-cation!,"We took the train in and stayed for a night for a quick, celebratory stay-cation and it was amazing!! The rooms are gorgeous, the food and drinks and service are absolutely wonderful. The only thing though is that the in-room tablet they provide to place the room service orders didn't work so our food never showed up. We called the desk and they got it to us right away and gave us a complimentary late check out, so everything was awesome! Ooh and we enjoyed our free Milkbox ice cream and  we took the complimentary Tesla downtown!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anniversary Getaway ,"We stayed at the Crawford for a night away to celebrate our 16th anniversary. The staff here are very friendly and so helpful. Sidney checked us in and was so helpful explaining all of the amenities the hotel had to offer (lots of free and discounted items at establishments in Union Station). Sidney upgraded our room and even brought us a bottle of champagne for our anniversary. We are planning on making this an annual trip! *There is a $20 daily resort fee and parking is $45 for the overnight rate. Look for deals online - we were able to get a package that waved both of these fees. Other recommendations:The Cooper Lounge has amazing drinks and appetizers with outstanding service. Ask the front desk at the Crawford to make a reservation for you. If you stay on the third floor of the Crawford Hotel, the lounge is right there - very cool view of Union Station. Stoic & Genuine has amazing seafood and drinks. We love to come here for their great selection of west and east coast oysters. Make your reservation far in advance. Pigtrain Coffee has delicious coffee creations and ice cream. You get a free cup when you stay at the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Quick vacation, 20 minutes from home.","We spent one night and a couple days on a little Denver discovery trip.  Had tickets for Hamilton, so we decided to stay at the Crawford for the night.  What a great decision!  Lovely hotel, very comfortable and welcoming. There are great restaurants in the station as well as excellent people watching.  The rooms are light and well equipped and so very quiet.  Highly recommend the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing hotel,We stayed at The Crawford for my sister's bachelorette party. We had such a great time! The rooms are beautiful and the service was great. Kyle and the rest of the staff were fantastic. They made my sister feel very special and even brought some champagne to our room to celebrate. We really enjoyed our dinner at the Mercantile and had a delicious breakfast at Snooze. The perks aregreat. I can't wait to stay here again!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best of Denver,"Amazing location, staff, and amenities.  The atmosphere is vibrant and relaxing at the same time.  The Cooper lounge is a must do.  Tip, make reservations for the lounge.  You do not have to leave the grounds with all the shops and restaurants.  However, if you do the downtown location provides the best Denver has to offer.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to make memories!,"My family visited in March for our second stay at The Crawford Hotel. We were as impressed on this visit as we were a year or two ago on our first visit. Both times we had wonderful service, excellent accommodations, and left with plans to return again. We had a great experience when we made reservations. The front desk greeted us on arrival and provided an early check-in. They responded to all questions and requests. We felt welcomed at The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Such a Disappointment ,"Union station is INCREDIBLE, and I was so excited to stay at The Crawford, but honestly almost every single aspect of my two night stay was terrible... 1st, the rooms on the 2nd floor are really small. 2nd, the Nespresso machine was not working. 3rd, I couldn’t get the iPad to play music in the room. 4th, in-room dining ends, as advertised, at 10pm... I called at 9:38pm and, after being on hold for 9 minutes, was told they were no longer serving food... seriously? 5th, room 236 has a loud rattle in either the walls or AC or something and when I ordered earplugs it took the front desk 50 minutes to deliver them — honestly this is what sent me over the edge :( 6th, the curtains in room 236 do not fully cover the windows. 7th, you’re supposed to get a free beer during happy hour at the terminal bar (I mentioned it right away) and the bartender rang me up for both (I had two). 8th, the shower around 6:30 pm on the first night was not even close to hot. 9th, the phone charger on the bed does not work. 10th, the pillows aren’t great (usually don’t care about this but for the price it’s a little ridiculous not to have nice down pillows). I didn’t expect to have a single complaint at at a place as highly regarded as the Crawford. I am supremely disappointed. There are other cool hotels in Denver that I could have stayed at instead and simply just walked over here to experience the first floor charm. Wish I had stayed at the Kimpton or Art instead.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Made our 30th an anniversary to remember,"Pack Up + Go sent us to Denver for our surprise anniversary trip and selected the Crawford Hotel for our 3-day stay.  They could not have chosen better!  It’s a gorgeous hotel, right in the middle of Union Station, so it’s the perfect place to come and go from no matter which type of transportation you’re using.  From the time we arrived we were delighted with the hotel staff who were welcoming and helpful throughout our stay.  If you need a ride and your destination is within a couple of miles of the hotel, they’ll provide you a ride at no cost.  Their thoughtful touches were evident all weekend from the welcoming note and a plate of wonderful macarons when we arrived to the bottle of champagne hand-delivered to our room.  We stayed in of the loft guest rooms, which was gorgeous and comfortable, all at the same time.  We wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and will stay there again if we’re in the Denver area.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Union Station everything you need,"We took a random trip to Denver to see the mountains and go to a NHL hockey game. Staying at the Crawford offered a one stop place for food, drinks and atmosphere. Take advantage of the free Tesla shuttle service while in downtown. Saved us about $50 in Uber/Lyft faires.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exceptional Hospitality!!,"Amazing!! We stayed here for my best friend's wedding, and the service was exceptional. BIG shout out to KYLE who went above and beyond to ensure our stay, and the bride and groom, was top-notch. The hotel is so charming with original art-deco architecture and decor, and I loved the little cafes, and bar in the lobby (station). Definitely recommend getting a room in the attic space which gives you beautiful vaulted ceilings for a unique, timeless feel.  It's also very convenient to walk to a variety of bars, restaurants, pool halls, and shopping. Will definitely come back the next time we're in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Very unique, historical ... had a great stay.","My wife and I stayed 2 nights for our anniversary and her birthday get away.  The hotel is in historic, renovated Union station in the center of lower downtown.  The lobby is a fun buzz of train riders, hotel guests, locals hanging out and many shops, and places to eat and get an adult beverage.  16th street mall ends right in front, so easy walk to all the activities there.  Our room was very clean, great gym, and the staff was very helpful and professional.  We did the bed and breakfast room package which included a $40 voucher for the Snooze breakfast diner in the hotel ... delivered to out room.  The hotel also had many discounts and free-bees for happy hour drinks, coffee and ice cream at establishments in Union Station.  Did not disappoint.  We highly recommend and will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience overall!,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for two days and had a good experience. The front desk staff was very kind and accommodating and the hotel amenities were great. Requests for housekeeping and valet were a bit slow at times but overall, we were very impressed with the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very unique!,"Stayed 1 night at the Crawford and highly recommend. Created in and of Union Station, it's a straight shot from the worst airport in the world, Denver Stapleton. Hop on the metro and you'll be dropped in front of the Crawford. The lobby is within the 'train station' and is architecturally beautiful. It will bring back the by-gone days of rail travel. Several great restaurants are within a quick walk in or around the hotel.Rooms are beautifully appointed and include all the luxury you would expect from a hotel of this caliber. Staff is friendly and convenient location make it a great base when exploring Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Retro Hotel,The hotel is in a convenient location from the train and the many restaurants in the Union Station area. The rooms are high end and functional. Great retro atmosphere. With your hotel key you get a free coffee from the coffee shop in the lobby and in the evening you can get a free beer from the micro-brew pub downstairs.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,What a time,"“Spoiled” doesn’t suffice as a description for how my wife & I felt after staying at The Crawford Hotel. The amenities? Check. The ambiance? Check. The bed? Absolutely, check. But beyond the room having the cozy feeling of your southern relative’s guest bedroom, or the complimentary food and beverage from the shops in Union Station, the people were simply divine. The hospitality of the entire staff, specifically Lindsey, was refreshing. She was incredibly accommodating, courteous, and helpful. It was an overall amazing stay!! *And eat at Snooze! So much fun!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great stay!,"Location is terrific and the entire hotel setting has a great buzz. We came here for a romantic weekend away and loved it. Bars, shops, restaurants + nightlife all within easy reach and a Tesla shuttle to take you around town within 1-2 miles. Will return for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Thank you! What incredible staff.,"Luckily at The Crawford after taking the train downtown from DIA upon arrival from ZUR. I was knackered, airline had lost luggage and I had a business meeting in the morning. Staff was solution-oriented and very warm. Tara was amazing and helped with business needs as Margaret & Ian made the arrival welcoming. All made me happy to be back in Colorado. The Crawford rocks as does its staff. Vibe is the very Colorado. Highly recommend it and I'm a hotel snob of sorts.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford = Classy!,"Such a great time staying with friends at The Crawford. The room was gorgeous with incredible 20 foot ceilings and huge windows. Way more light than you normally get in a hotel. What really made the trip was the staff. From valet to Myles the Tesla driver, to everyone at the desk. Tara, Sydney, Kyle and Courtney. Everybody was so sincere and helpful. The night was a memorable one thanks to all who were working. Will definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic time at Crawford,"Loved the look of Union Station. I’m local but hadn’t been down since the remodel. Hotel was incredible. Kyle, Ian and Margo were all very helpful and accommodating, as was the rest of the staff. Would definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotel, beautiful train station","A friend and I stayed here overnight to take the California Zephyr and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  This hotel is beautiful, as is the train station.  Good location close to the stadium and some good restaurants.  A little pricey but you get what you pay for.  We would stay here again if we visited Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel! Awesome use of public / private space,"We really enjoyed all of the perks (especially Riley driving us around in the Tesla) during our stay. The staff was warm, friendly and helpful and our room was huge. Highly recommend for both business and personal travel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Winter Park Ski Trip,"Outstanding accommodations! Excellent Service! Service from valet, to check in and throughout stay was consistently above average.  Mercantile’s service and food were  met and exceeded expectations! We will be back...................!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Ciy Getaway,"we live in Denver and took a night away at the Crawford. The hotel was amazing and the staff were so attentive. It was my wife's birthday and they went out of their way to make sure she felt special. The Crawford is located in the historic Union Station train depot and is surrounded by great restaurants, bars, and things to do/see. Highly recommend the Crawford for your next stay in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Our second stay at the Crawford was as great as our first!,"What's not to love about the Crawford Hotel?  Between the grand entry via the gorgeously-renovated train station to the comfortable and spacious rooms, the Crawford Hotel is a special place.  This time, I happily utilized the Fitness Center ... along with the  terminal bar, ice cream shop, bookstore, and (breakfast) restaurant.  Plus, I had lots of fun people-watching!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome!,"Great location, right at Union Station in the hub of downtown Denver. You would think it would be a noisy area but the rooms in this hotel are as quiet and peaceful as any I have ever stayed in. Top notch service and convenient to all attractions. The train from the airport stops right at the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Extra night in Denver,"We were in the mountains for a long weekend with friends and my wife and I wanted to spend an extra day in Denver before going home. We booked The Crawford based on reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed! We enjoyed a beer and a coffee and ice cream as well as dinner and brunch the next day, all without leaving the building. The room was fantastic with a comfortable bed. We were also surprised by the lack of noise from the rest of the hotel in the room.We'll be back for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,20th Anniversary - 2-18-18 We were loved as family.,"We enjoyed our stay at The Crawford.  I want to commend Tiffany Owen-Hotel Manager and team for a very positive stay.  My wife and I could not believe the perfect level of service and cleanliness.  We joked about being out of tip money because we tried to tip everyone from the beginning of our stay - as Pete with the Valet service welcomed us and Tara -front desk welcomed us and said, ""thanks for giving us an opportunity"".  The room was stunning...we even left Housekeeping a tip at the front desk as we departed!  Myles was a great driver as he dropped/picked us up while utilizing the courtesy vehicle.  The man was dressed from head to toe and represented his company well.  We loved the way Security was not rude and awkward, and the guys on the late shift advised us on how to get food on a late Sunday.  All the more, as it was near closing time - the bartender gentlemen of the Cooper Lounge invited us to stay if we liked.  As we departed, Kyle smiled and said please come back and the young lady that checked us out (didn't get her name), was very busy but very accommodating.  The amenities of the Hotel will speak for themselves so I will not mention these, but they were stunning, and that Downtown view impeccable.  The product is so good I imagined working there and extending the beauty and service my wife and I received!!!!!  Thanks Tiffany- your team reflects good character and intend to deliver.  Go and see and feel for yourself!  -the Walkers",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome Hotel/Train Station,"Our stay has been awesome. From the moment we checked in the front desk staff made sure all our needs were met. Lindsey became my newest BFF, she asked questions to determine our visit and needs and took charge of us. She made dinner reservations for all four evenings, arranged for the Hotel car, a Tesla, to get us to museum and to dinner. She made our visit memorable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,"The Crawford hotel is simply the best place to stay in Denver! It is the perfect blend of beautifully-archaic architecture and modern convenience: never has it been more tempting to order a glass of champaign at the push of a button while luxuriating in an oversized spa, mesmerized by the century-old exposed brickwork and crossbeams.My wife and I booked this place to enjoy the trendy amenities of downtown Denver and Union Station (you dont even have to leave the building for the latter); but we eventually stayed an extra night (without leaving the room) because the hotel itself was simply the best place we had enjoyed in our 10 years of living in Colorado!I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates antique construction, modern convenience, or simply reveling in the endless supply of walking-distance bars and restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel conveniently located,This hotel was very nice. It was centrally located and offered a variety of things to do within walking distance. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The beds were comfy and the coffee was great. It was a little pricy for what you get but overall very nice.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great place for a ""staycation""","Everything was excellent. Room for improvement: If you want to go to Snooze for breakfast, make sure you tell the hotel staff at least one day in advance. We were told that we could get on the priority seating list for the following morning--we called later that afternoon to set up arrangements and then were told that all priority seating was booked. Poor communication on the part of the hotel staff.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fabulous Location and amenities,"The Crawford Hotel inside historic Union Station is a wonderful place to stay with it's numerous amenities (free coffee, ice cream scoop and beer, percentages off several eateries and  drinking establishments, as well as shops inside the station. Access to the beautiful Copper Lounge and of course luxurious rooms.  The station located in the heart of downtown Denver was opened after extensive and expensive renovations in 2014 and has been a hot spot ever since.  The hotel is one of it's charms with a great staff and rooms you'll want to live in. Kyle, our hotel concierge, who checked us in was delightful and accommodating.  He made sure everything was right and upon arrival we were given early check-in privileges and a room upgrade. Kyle was very friendly and welcoming to our every request.  He certainly helped make a stay a memorable one.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver by train,Arrived on the California Zephyr early in the morning.  Crawford Hotel staff were able to get me into a room right away.  I really appreciated the friendly helpful service from the front desk staff.  The room was small but beautiful with big windows overlooking the train tracks.  When inside the room I didn't hear any noise from the trains.Denver Union station has been transformed into a busy transportation hub.  I would have like more restoration in the main hall but the remodeling is functional and gives hints of the grand days of railroad travel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A little turn of luck on our trip home from Aspen,"My husband and I recently vacationed in Aspen and had a snow delay on our flight home (resulting in an extra night in Aspen). That next day we found out our flight out of the Aspen airport was delayed again, causing us to miss our connection in Denver. During a very unproductive discussion with United Airlines, we were told there were no flights (to about 6 major cities) available out of Denver and that we would have to wait until the next day to leave Denver.  After finding out we would be delayed a 2nd day, we decided to stay at the Crawford Hotel and just enjoy a night in Denver.  I preface this review with our airline troubles to show how upon arriving at the Crawford Hotel we were extremely frustrated, stressed, tired, etc.  Upon arriving at the hotel, we went to the desk to check in and met Paloma.  She was absolutely wonderful.  She went above and beyond to provide us with a wonderful experience at the hotel.  My husband and I both agree that it was the best service we have ever had.  The hotel and its amenities are amazing on their own, but the service and experience we had was absolutely indescribable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Valentine's Day Success,My girlfriend and I stayed the night here for Valentine's day and it was above and beyond. Not only was the staff amazing and helpful but they also had a spectacular Valentine's day deal! Highly recommended,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible!!,This was my first time staying at The Crawford and I absolutely loved it. The room was beautiful and the atmosphere is awesome. Kyle at the front desk was super helpful and wonderful to talk to. I will be visiting again soon!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful hotel and incredibly attentive staff!,"I stayed in a wonderful room, the Superior Classic. I had a wonderful view of the plaza outside the hotel. Just outside my room I could see the entire Union Station. Easy access to everything in and around the hotel. I would like to point out a few things about the staff here vs other properties. Every time I passed a staff member, they said hello and asked how I was. This was not just Front Desk. House Keeping, etc. All of them were wonderful. Speaking of House Keeping, talk about amazing. I setup my room w/ all of my work stuff and personal stuff spread out since I was staying for a week. They are like ninjas. I never saw them near the rooms and when I would return in the afternoon/evening, the room was clean, bed made, towels replaced, items restocked, etc. Which is common, but ALL of this was done w/o disturbing my setup. 50 out of 10, would stay at this property again! Also there is a wonderful placed called Snooze that you can have delivered to your room. This is a MUST TRY while here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Union Station,"Just stayed there Feb 2018, great hotel right in Union Station.First time taking train from airport right to hotel, so easy!!!!!!!Rooms are great, good restaurants!!!!Right downtown!!!Everything you need is right there, don’t even need to go outside if you don’t want too",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Stay,Had such an awesome stay. Couldn’t be easier to get to from the airport. The light rail literally stops in front of it. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and there are so many really nice restaurants and shops in the same building. Convenience galore. Had a blast.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Feel and Location!,"Right IN the Denver train station...the station itself boasts a classic feel, with classy library-style lounge and desk furniture throughout. There are plenty of side shops in the station for food and drinks. The hotel room was a bit small...but to be expected considering the prime real estate. The rooms were clean, quaint and stylish. I especially like that we had access to the hotel gym and wellness center across the street...which helped because we had a nightly beer and daily scoop of ice cream from one of the station's bar and homemade cream spots as part of our package! I also like that the police patrolling the area were always on watch...and did a very good job to control the few homeless folks in a way that allowed them to keep their dignity. There were tons of dining/drinking spots outside the station as well...and the hotel offered their Tesla for locations within 2 miles! I did have to let them know I needed an ironing board...but that was quickly addressed. I already let my wife know we'd stay here if ever in Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,My very high expectations exceeded!!!!,"The Crawford hotel had been on my bucket list for a long time.  I luxuriated reading other people's reviews and quite frankly didn't think it could live up to all those positive comments.  It did...and then some.   I chose it for the location and the unique ambiance.Both of those rate high but what we remember the most was the incredible staff that went out of their way to make our stay extraordinary.  Much of what we experienced was not a request from us but rather a volunteered suggestion from the staff.  (Highest level of service provided is that which is not requested ).  We loved the amenities and took advantage of almost all of the ""goodies"" at the various bars, restaurants, and flower shop.  The room was to die for and we take great delight in telling others about our memorable experience.  We took the rail service from the airport which is easy and inexpensive and delighted to get off the train and walk right into Union Station and The Crawford Hotel (we are from Florida and it was 7 degrees outside!)  Can't wait to stay again at this truly unique property and be treated like royalty.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great find!,"I was traveling from NY to Salida to see family and stayed overnight in The Crawford before taking a 4 hour bus ride to my final destination. This is a wonderful hotel, filled with excellent restaurants, shops, kiosks, bars, etc. There is no need to leave the hotel once you check in. The staff, specifically Kyle at the front desk, could not have been more caring and accommodating. I have stayed in Fairmounts, Ritz Carltons, etc, and have not been treated as well. Kyle went out of his way every time I was in contact with him, to see that I was completely satisfied. The restaurants are high quality with equally high prices. It was worth it to me because of the location and the experience. Do not miss Snooze for breakfast. My one negative is not related the hotel but to the exorbitant taxes and fees attached to the hotel stay. My room was $249 but taxes brought it to $317. Do not miss a stay here and ask for Kyle at check in",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place,"We checked in later but were still able to take advantage of the beer, cocktails and ice-cream offered as amenities. The staff is amazing and always available to help or answer questions. We will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel and location.,This hotel was incredible and the location in Union Station was very unique.  The room was incredible and the staff could not be more accommodating and very pleasant.  They showed us a couple of rooms that we could choose from which I thought was very kind of them.  Would definitely come back and will recommend my friends and family to your hotel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A unique hotel in downtown Denver,"The Crawford Hotel is located in Union Station and I love how they renovated the old train station into a hotel, restaurants, bars, stores, and public space.  The main hall, where the lobby is located, was always very lively with lots of people enjoying themselves.  The hotel itself was great.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the rooms were modern and comfortable.  The only negative was the room was small (we stayed in a Classic Guest room) - fortunately it was for only one night.  I highly recommend if you want a lively hotel in a great downtown Denver location.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lobby lunch and views,"We met some friends for drinks and lunch.  It was the week before Christmas and the lobby was bustling with kids and parents in line to see santa.  Although the lobby was extremely busy, all the staff we interacted with seemed to enjoy what they were doing.  Food and drinks were good too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Outstanding hotel, amenities, and staff, but public transportation is a must","The hotel is extremely unique and lively, especially at night. There are no shortage of fantastic eateries just within the train station alone with even more in walking distance. Despite the noise of the station and city surrounding it, the rooms are nearly silent, letting you retreat into peace whenever you decide. The rooms were impeccably clean, incredibly charming, and, most importantly, always comfortable. The Tesla service would have been a really cool feature, but with only one driver, our schedule was too fluid to take advantage as the slots would fill up really quickly. Despite how wonderful this hotel was, I can't recommend taking public transportation enough. I live in Colorado, but not near downtown, so I chose to drive to the hotel and use the valet. When parking the car one night the valet was really busy. Not wanting to make the valet come over to grab the keys, we got out, went over and just said we'd like to valet the car and asked what he'd like us to do with the keys. His response was, Excuse me, we're really busy and plus, the garage is full (which shouldn't happen since we were staying at the hotel). Instead of fighting with him, we just went in and asked the Margot, one of the hotel staff, if she could help us. She was more than happy to walk outside in the 15 degree weather and make sure our car was valet parked and we were helped. Even though when I went to grab the car later I was accused of not being a guest of the hotel by the valet and had to produce my room card, I was thankful I didn't have to deal with fighting over whether I could valet park. Overall, it was a great hotel but the employees like Margot who would selflessly act in whatever capactiy they could to make the guest experience better was what made it a hotel worth coming back to. I would highly recommend and will certainly stay there again, just maybe without a car next time.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Location,"We had a business meeting for a party of 25.  Members flew in from Alaska to Tampa.  The Crawford was the perfect location.  We all took the train from the airport.  This eliminated the need for rental cars that would sit in the parking lot for 2+ days.  The rooms were well designed and comfortable.  The hotel staff was attentive and pleasant.  The location was great.  Dining and shopping were all within walking distance.  Union Station (The train station) has dining and bars that have a cool vibe.  Overall, a great hotel and location. We did a cost comparison with other hotels in Denver.  The rooms, ease of transportation, the rental of a conference room and meals all made the Crawford the logical value choice. We will go back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,3 nights and will be back,"The Crawford is within Denver’s Union Station, which is a beautiful building. I took a train from the airport right to union station, which is the last stop, 35 minutes and $9.The hotel charged a $20 resort fee or something but its well worth it since you get daily a free beer (choose 1 of 25 on tap, and a $5 Manhattan cocktail (normally ($12) at another bar, a free homemade ice cream, a great happy hour with $1.50 oysters....and you never have to leave Union Station with at least 6 great dining choices. If that’s not enough, you could walk out the door and your within 2 blocks of another 12 places to explore.The room was classic handsome 1920’s decor with a large room and comfortable bed. Ask for a room not over the center of union square. I had a room off of the center (220) and was quiet.I will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Shuffle down for some shuffle board,Well beyond the charm and restored grandeur to Downtown Denver.  We had a fun evening with friends playing shuffle board and people watching.   Service is wonderful - at the hotel Desk clerks really are sensational - rooms comfy and tastefully  decorated.  Great dining experiences in walking distance or at the hotel.  Whether you are travelling or watching those who travel a great spot and our favorite Denver hotel.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful room in a great location!,"We stayed at the Crawford Christmas Eve and although our room was small, it was well appointed and comfortable. Because of the location in Union Station you are a short walk to everything down town. We had drinks at Wyncoop and dinner at Tavernetta, all within a short walk! The front desk receptionist was friendly and quick and gave us all the information necessary. The only negative was there was no restaraunrt open for breakfast because of the Christmas holiday.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Pampered in the heart of Denver,"I booked because I wanted convenience and location but my takeaway will be how comfortable and spoiled I felt here at The Crawford.  Amenities meant to spoil...free scoop of delicious ice cream at the milk box creamery, coffee at the Pigtrain Coffee Co and a drink at the lobby bar are just the start..  while almost everything I could possibly want to do, drink or eat is within a block or two, the Crawford offers a Tesla car service for those slightly longer jaunts.  My drivers made the visit even better - Riley was a great Ambassador of Denver.  The room itself was cozy and quiet even though I was located right over the restaurant with a view of the trains.  I landed in Denver airport, grabbed my luggage and was on one of those trains within minutes and a cheap $9 ticket got me to the Crawford in about a half hour.  The train was clean and safe.   (Union Station) has great restaurants and activities so  staying at the Crawford allows immediate access in a safe, comfortable and fun way.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An amazing stay for our group,We recently had our company holiday party in downtown Denver and reserved a block of rooms at the Crawford Hotel. The sales process was seamless and their entire team was great to work with. Our employees absolutely loved the hotel and they took great care of everyone. The rooms are incredible and the location of the property cannot be beat. Many were grateful to be able to bring their dogs and we all were able to take advantage of the newly renovated Union Station and all it has to offer.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford Delivers,"Our second stay at the Crawford was as good as our first.  We stayed for three nights this time.  The room was well appointed and provided the glimpse of a time gone by. Staff was friendly and helpful.  The property itself could not be better located in Denver.  Smack dab in Union Station, it sits in a hub of buzzing activity with restaurants, pubs and transportation taking center stage.  It is also a five minute walk to several four star restaurants.  Light rail to the Denver airport is right out the door. This place is a must stay for people in their twenties or thirties or people enjoying the buzz of a young vibe.  Full marks to the Crawford.  We can't wait to get back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Nice Historic Location,"I love the historic location and use of space.  We had a room on the top floor, so it also had a fabulous vaulted ceiling.  The rooms were clean and impressive, overall a nice place to stay in a central location.  Good for couples or friends, but I would not recommend for families.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great destination spot!,"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway for his birthday. We live in Denver, so we weren't sure if staying in the city would feel like that much of a getaway. Luckily it did! There was so much to do inside the hotel. It was during the Christmas season, so it was especially festive. We loved our room and the courtesy we received from Marie who helped us book our stay. We can't wait to come back and definitely recommend to others from afar and those who live in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Uninformed,"This hotel is amazing. Beautifully decorated and over the top in regards to aesthetics. It was a comfortable place to spend NYE. I booked the day before. Considering it was NYE, I expected to pay more. Probably the most I’ve ever spent on a room and I’ve stayed in some amazing places. Anyway, what I’m a bit irked about is the lack of information. Upon reading reviews after our stay, I learned about the paid parking across the street (I’m sorry but $45 for valet is the most I’ve ever been charged for downtown hotel parking). I later read about the Snooze priority and Cooper Lounge. Upon check-in, hotel staff was friendly and did show me the amenity card. They did not, however, mention you must have the card when partaking in those amenities. I figured a room key and ID would be used. So, stood in a long line on NYE just to figure this out later. When redeeming our drink comps, the line was outrageously long and they only allowed one drink per guest at a time. The comps were only Denver beers too so meh on that amenity. A separate line or server for hotel guests would make this much better. Ice cream place had wonky hours so we were never able to get those free scoops. With all of the travelers around, it really wasn’t a cozy hotel feeling. Felt like I needed to watch my back and I would never let my kids meander alone. Many homeless people sitting/laying on the benches immediately outside of the elevators leading to the rooms. They just stared at us as we rolled our luggage by (obvious tourists) Now I know there are safety measures (keyed entries) to prevent non-guests from entering the room areas but it did feel like someone could be an easy target here. The room was beautiful. We didn’t use the Tesla. Should have. It’s a great location.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Yearly Visit,"I've stayed here 3 years in a row over the holidays, and I really love it. This year was particularly a standout because I had just come off of a horrific holiday of family medical emergencies, and the staff was exceptionally kind and accommodating. There were also some fun events on NYE night, easy access to great restaurants and bars, and fireworks visible from just outside. Love this place! Will return again and again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Mixed Bag,"It was a mixed bag at the Crawford for us. I was really looking forward to our stay based on what we'd read about, but our experience fell short of what we read about in some respects. We booked through Chase Rewards for a ""Premium Loft"" room. Upon arrival, we were given a ""Premium Classic"" room. When I asked to be put in the same class of room we had reserved, paid, and confirmed over the phone the day before I was told that all of those rooms had been taken, and that there had been ""a mixup"" with in house reservations. It was frustrating that we weren't given the same thing we had paid for, and more so that we had to ask about the change rather than the hotel being honest about the mistake from the beginning. At that point another person at the desk took over and tried her best to mitigate the situation - she comped the valet parking and the amenity fee, offered us our choice between the classic room or a smaller loft, got us the house car for dinner. That brought things back to level, given the room price differences. The space is beautifully renovated and bustling with activity. It was hard to use the beer token given how crowded terminal bar was, we more enjoyed the peace and quiet at Coopers Lounge. (We were able to get off the waitlist, I wish I knew about the reservations). Pigtrain was great. But water never showed up in the room, we had to ask for it at the front desk. When we checked out, as well, the amenity fee had been added back on (and the person we had spoken to the evening before wasn't there). It was removed after we spoke to them, but again an issue with service and communication that I didn't expect from a hotel of this caliber. The house car was great (especially in the snow), bed comfortable, bigelow bath products very nice. If we're back in Denver we'd consider staying again, but would certainly book directly given all the issues we had with the third party treatment.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Surpassed My Expectations !,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our fifth stay at the Crawford last week. We have always found the hotel personnel to be extremely courteous and professional. We have stayed in a number of the different room styles, and are always impressed by the way that they have managed to design them to feel warm and comfortable. The addition of the train line connecting directly with the airport has made the trip in and out so convenient. Really looking forward to our next visit!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,FINEST HOTEL IN DENVER!,"The Crawford Hotel is Fantastic!  The property, staff and amenities are the very best.We arrived on the train directly from the airport to the beautifully restored and decorated Union Station.  It is so easy for traveling. The front desk staff were so nice and welcoming! The rooms at The Crawford Hotel are all unique and lovely. My husband and I stayed in a beautiful Premium Classic style.  Our bed was extremely comfortable! The bathroom offered a beautiful bathtub and a great shower. The double vanity was large and had a lighted makeup mirror, which is just one of the many little things they thought of to make the stay comfortable. All the rooms and halls have very pretty artwork too. The Tesla courtesy car was available and ready to take us and pick us up from our destinations around Denver.  I believe The Crawford Hotel is the finest in Denver!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,One of the best properties  I have stayed at.,"I am a multimillion miles flier with platinum and diamond status at all major national brands.At our sons suggestion, we stayed here and what an exquisite experience. Luxury, comfort, courtesy- thou name is The Crawford, Lauren at the front desk walked in bitter cold across the street to Uber and with her petite frame not only carried our bags but put in room even before we got to room. Thanks, Lauren, you are awesome. What can I say for the drivers David, Miles and Riley- on time, courteous and very professional. Management should be very proud  if I had a hotel in Denver, I will still all of them. Thanks",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique Experience in a Primo Part of Town,"We enjoyed staying at the Crawford in a Deluxe Classic Room for two nights during the holiday season.  Our corner room had two huge, floor to ceiling windows that let in tons of light.  While the bathroom was on the smaller side (no tub), the room itself was spacious and nicely appointed.  Because the hotel is inside Union Station, the place is hopping, which is fun, but it would also be nice to have a private place to hang out (besides the room) and the Crawford doesn’t offer that. The Cooper Lounge, which is a beautiful space, is open after 4 PM, and empty during the day.  It would be an awesome amenity for guests if the Crawford would offer continental breakfast in that space for guests only.  We booked the “Hoilday Package” which included free valet parking (worth $45) and comped the  “Amenity Fee” (worth $20) but the reservation confirmation did not confirm this information so that was a bit confusing.  It would be nice if the hotel reservation system could figure out a way to include exactly what is included in the booked package IN the email confirmation.  Valet service was slow, so we realized after the first time, that we needed to give them 20 minutes to bring the car around.  Crawford guests get priority reservations at Snooze (if you know about Snooze, that is a big deal) and that worked out really well for us.  The Crawford is in a primo part of town, Union Station has been beautifully renovated, and staying at the hotel offers a unique experience.  If you don’t mind lots of action around you (but note, the room itself is very quiet), it would be worth checking out.  If you like a more elegant and quiet hotel experience, then I would recommend that you go elsewhere.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Reservations and details  a problem here,"Nice property, but not quite there with service.  Could be a solid four star, but service is off.  Multiple problems with hotel canceling our reservations.  Hotel offered a credit to order food.  Ordered room service next morning and no food ever arrived - even after calling to find out where it was.  I honestly have no idea how this hotel is considered a top business hotel?  You can be quirky and cool, but you still need the basics.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Xmas in denver ,Got the holiday package for 3 days 2 nights. Stayed in Pullman room. Lunch at merch. Bkfst at snooze. Tesla courtesy ride to and fr theatre priceless. Our driver david was the best. Room was perfect. Thxs,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Shout out to Myles! ,First trip to Denver and we couldn’t be more satisfied with our trip so far! Myles gave us A+ treatment and a great tour of the area in the complimentary Tesla.  Thank you to The Crawford Hotel for a wonderful visit.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique experience,This was a fun place to stay on a quick trip to Denver. The experience was fun. The room was nice and the amenities include free food from surrounding places in union station. It was a fun stay overall.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Another Fabulous Holiday Stay,"Just had another wonderful stay! My family and I come every year at Christmas, and this year they we were not disappointed. The hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas. We even got our favorite room. From the drinks at the Terminal bar to our super friendly Tesla Driver, Dave it was a great stay. (Dave was really awesome!) Looking forward to next year.  Only bummer was the two hour wait for Santa.  (Please bring him back on Saturdays and or a few days during the week.)",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Meetings,This was a really nice place to stay. The hotel is located inside Union Station so its really busy near the check in area. Several choices for food and entertainment near the hotel. The staff was really attentive and accommodating. We arrived early so they kept our luggage and then had it delivered to our room for us. The room was nice and clean. It was very well furnished and well maintained. The gym had nice machines but no weights. We had a great time and would stay here again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Mile High Gem,"Fantastic experience from check in to departure.  The hotel is situated downtown and convenient to all the unique local shopping and food. The bonus is the Tesla valet service provided with your stay - the drivers Myles and David were professional, friendly, informative and very helpful.  The entire staff was 5-Star, and I am a tough customer with high expectations.  We will be back.  Oh, and make sure you try the local ice cream from Magill’s, best I’ve ever had.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique experience in downtown Denver,"Recommended if you are not renting a car and either taking Uber or doing a car share (Maven). Good for those who like the nightlife, fancy drinks, and easy access to amenities. Bad if you are getting a car (parking is expensive) and prefer eating at chain restaurants. ARRIVAL/CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUTWe picked The Crawford Hotel because we were not planning to rent a car, and the light rail A line from DIA ends right at the hotel. The light rail was fast and easy (albeit a little steep at $9 a head). Once we exited the station, the hotel was right in front of us. We went into the station through one of the many pairs of double doors and found the front desk on the left side, amongst many shops and restaurants. The check in was easy; even though we arrived at 2, they were able to check us in. They gave us our card keys, told us about the amenities and said they provided some accommodations in the room for our dog as well. Check out was just as easy and we hopped back on the A line to the airport. THE ROOMWe reserved a Pullman Superior room, and it is supposed to look like a train sleeper, long and narrow. I mean, we ARE staying at the train station, right? It was decorated in Art Deco style, with carved wood doors and stylish mirrors. The bathroom is right off the entry, with a sliding door, revealing a subway tiled shower (no tub) and good sized vanity. Straight into the room is a mirrored vanity table with a bench hidden below. Next to that, there is a closet, revealing half a closet for clothes, and the other half holding the coffee pod maker, cups, ice bucket and a mini fridge. Next to that, and in front of the window was a swivel chair, and a side table. There was a dog bed and treats left for our doggo there as well. On the other side of the wall was the bed, with a partition between the bed and desk. The partition had a TV mounted to it, so you could swivel it towards the bed or the desk area. The room itself was not large, but the partition created a nice break up of the space, so you didn’t feel like it was this small, narrow, and long room.  But in fact it was a bit on the small side, and we wished there was more than only one chair to sit on, but the narrow room size wouldn’t have accommodated two chairs. If there ever was a reason to visit Denver again, I’d definitely upgrade to a larger room. THE AMENITIESThis was not a happy visit or a vacation, so we didn’t plan on doing much. That being said, we enjoyed the amenities that were offered through the hotel. Given the $20 daily amenities charge, we partook of the free ice cream and discounts on coffee and pastries in the morning. The whole station was packed and abuzz at night (probably because we were there Friday and Saturday nights) with people enjoying the various eateries, drinking, and hanging around. We had cocktails at the Terminal Bar, and we enjoyed them whilst sitting on a bench, along with some tasty fries. The morning revealed a drastic change; it was very quiet with only a few people waiting for their trains. The coffee place was open from 6 AM, so it was very convenient to go downstairs and grab some coffee and pastries for breakfast. There were a whole lot of other restaurants close by, and we noticed a Whole Foods a block or two away as well. The fact that The Crawford allows doggos was the main reason for staying here. Our usual dog sitter was not available given the last minute trip, so we had to travel with pup in tow. He’s a pretty chill traveler, and he settled right in. The only complaint I have is that there is not a great place for dogs to “relieve” themselves. Actually the whole downtown area was lacking any sort of dog friendly grass patches. The only place that was close for an early morning jaunt was a couple of planters on the northeast side of the station, in front of Snooze eatery. For a longer walk to find some grass, we went over the Millennium Bridge and to Commons Park. The light rail was the other reason for staying here. It was very convenient if you don’t plan on renting a car. However, the light rail must have a lot of issues with people not paying, as we were visited twice each way by the same rail security/operators asking for tickets. We commented to ourselves that we’d gone hundreds of miles in Europe without anyone harassing us twice. We saw them make people download and pay via app, if they had gotten the wrong, less expensive ticket. So be warned—make sure you get yourself the $9 airport ticket.All in all, although the occasion was not happy, we really enjoyed The Crawford Hotel. We’d recommend this hotel to anyone who hates chain hotels and wants a unique experience in downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel. Great Service. Great City.,"I stayed at the Crawford Hotel at the beginning of December 2017 and was left absolutely in awe.  From the moment we walked in, not only did the physical hotel space create a warm and inviting environment, but the staff did as well.  The hotel supervisor, Lindsey Silverman, helped us in every step of the way.  From graciously checking our bags when we arrived before check in time, to orienting us with all of the features of the hotel (the hotel’s free ice cream for guests is a great plus!), to ensuring our room was prepared and well tended to, Lindsey was a gem! Ive stayed in several luxury hotels, all featuring the highest quality room service, hotel amenities and features, but the customer service truly makes or breaks an experience.  We were able to ask questions to all of the Crawford staff when we needed it and they truly exemplified the friendly and welcoming city of Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,NOT hospitable,"My husband and son stayed here from Dec.9 - 11th 2017.  Said the hotel was lovely, that I'd love it.  My husband had to fly back Monday night so checked out and my son stayed elsewhere for the one night.  My husband arranged with the desk staff to have my son leave his bags at the hotel so he could tour around Denver before taking the train to the airport for his flight Tuesday evening.  When my son arrived there Tuesday morning with his bags - he was told by the manager named Lindsay that he could NOT leave his bags, he had not stayed there the night before.  My son said she was not accommodating in any way and was actually MEAN.  REALLY?  In this day and age?  UNFORGIVABLE!  We will be staying at the Brown Palace and the JW Marriott on our next visit (about 4 times/year) - how about you?",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Nice rooms; nice location,"Let me right off the bat say this is a solid 4-star hotel, but I cannot abide by hotels that tack on a ""destination amenity fee"" ($22.95 in this case) to the room price. A ""free"" ice cream scoop? A ""free"" cup of coffee? Let me buy those if I want. With that out of the way...as several reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is almost not a hotel. There is a small reception area and then you take an elevator up to rooms whose front doors often look down over the train station's waiting area. It's a lovely area, so no complaints here, just that it's not what you're used to. The train station feels brand new and has a nice lively buzz to it. Don't think there are many trains - other than the airport train. If you drove here, there's a public parking garage almost immediately across the street if you'd rather not valet park. Lots of restaurants either in the station, or within easy walking distance. There is a lovely bar one floor up (you could see the entire bar from outside our room looking down). It didnt seem too busy (got a place to sit no problem) nor too noisy, so a perfect place for a drink before heading out for dinner, we really liked it.We had a 3rd-floor corner room (premium classic), with one side facing the main street, and our door facing the station lobby. We are very sensitive to noise and had no issues whatsoever. The room was quite large; bed was comfortable; bathroom well lit. No movies on TV (yes, yes, stream your own and all that).We've stayed at the Four Seasons and JW Marriott (plus a bunch of Denver airport hotels), and this is definitely a top choice in Denver. Four Seasons is clearly more elegant, much of which comes down to it's expansive lobby (nice rooms too), and the JW although high-end just feels tired and the rooms feel almost like you could be in any old Marriott/Hilton etc. I reckon we might stay here again next time we come.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Tesla Courtesy Transportation,"The trip to and from the Capital Grille in the Tesla Courtesy car, driven by Riley, was outstanding. Riley was friendly, attentive and quite the host! Please let Riley know how grateful we are for his outstanding customer service! Well done!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Good Central Luxury Hotel in Denver,"I've stayed at the Crawford twice--once for a date night, and once on my wedding night.  The rooms are nice, the beds are very comfortable, and I do like the little additional conveniences provided, such as free or discounted items and services at the shops and restaurants in Union Station.  However, the staff leaves a lot to be desired in terms of a service-oriented attitude.  The check-in associate, Ameena, probably shouldn't be working in hospitality at all, as her favorite word seems to be ""no,"" and I didn't see her smile once at anyone.  Because I do not believe staff with such attitudes should be employed at luxury hotels, I detract one star.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A beautiful venue,"The Crawford is located inside Union Station in Denver.  The lobby is done in turn of the century motif and is spacious, beautiful and comfortable while at the same time useful for the local line as well as Amtrack.  My room was comfortable and quiet.  There was a fully stocked expresso machine in the room and guests had access to two free waters per day.  The fitness room was small but guests had access to a larger center across Wynkoope Street.  The front desk staff as well as all other staff members were courteous and helpful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing room! Amazing experience!,"I stayed one night, and it was incredible! There were two great women who helped us out, Courtney and Amina. They were friendly, and delightful. I was picked up in the Tesla from my restaurant by Myles, and he was conversational, friendly, safe, and engaging. It was so cool to stay in Union Station, and the perks at the restaurants and bars in Union Station are an excellent bonus! Highly recommend!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great Hotel, Good Value","We stayed downtown overnight after my company's Christmas party. We had a great room away from the atrium with a beautiful view of the city. Bed and shower were excellent and we did enjoy some of the ""freebies"" from the $20 destination charge, though I'm not sure that given the choice, I would have paid for that, especially since we're not beer or coffee drinkers. All things considered for the price, it was very good and we'd love to stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Babymoon ,When we got off the train I had no clue what to expect. The staff at check in did a fantastic job getting us into our room early. The setting is awesome especially during Chris. It is located in an old train station and the people are friendly at ever spot from pigtrain coffee to the terminal bar. My favorite is the hotel staff. They treat you like royalty here. Dave is our fav! He drove us around Denver in a Tesla. His conversation this trip has been great. The rooms are awesome. The shower was really cool. The feel is very nostalgic and 1920s sort of. This hotel is perfect for a weekend get away. Just what the wife and I needed. We will be back.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible,"From the moment I stepped inside until the moment I left, everything and everyone was amazing!!!  I received a phone call from the hotel manager herself minutes after walking inside my room after check-in.  I mentioned that there wasn't honey in the room for the espresso, and she had the kitchen make up something unique and delivered it to me herself!  The Tesla ride was also really cool.  The shops, bars, and everything was very unique - highly recommend this place, and I certainly want to return there soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Absolutely amazing!,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Crawford while visiting our son who goes to school in Denver and all I can say is WOW! The hotel is amazing and located in a truly unique space, Denver's Union Station. We loved that the lobby is the old train terminal and was decorated to the nines for Christmas. The room was spotless, comfortable and the bed amazing. The girls at the front desk were very sweet and accommodating and the gentleman driving the courtesy car were prompt and delightful. We also opted to take the history tour of the station which was the highlight of our stay, Ian the tour guide is eccentric and wonderful and brought the station to life for us - so much history hiding in plain sight! If you are looking for the best hotel in Denver, look no further than the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Stay - love the amenities and ambience! ,We loved our stay at The Crawford Hotel!   Great setting at Union Station in LODO.    Outstanding staff that took care of all our needs.  Great amenities included with our stay!  Especially appreciated Dave who ran us around town in the Tesla X that is part of the amenities plan!    It was actually Dave that showed us the car that made us interested in booking a stay while we were in town!   We will be back!     Thanks for a great visit!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Treated like a queen,"Just spent 6 days at the Crawford (again). And again, it was just about perfect. I love staying in Denver's ""living room""- Union Station. We had a gorgeous corner room on the 2nd floor with all the lux amenities. Snooze was right downstairs! The hotel staff could not have been friendlier. They took care of every request with a smile! We used the courtesy car (a Tesla!) and the drivers: Dave, Milo and Riley, were so outgoing and welcoming. You could not ask for a more convenient location when visiting Denver. Treat yourself to a stay here!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Such a treat!,"My girlfriends and I enjoyed a women's getaway here! LOVED all the perks...the happy hour at the speakeasy, free ice cream cone, best latte ever, Tesla car service, walking distance to everything wonderful in Denver. FIVE STAR in every way. Going back and taking my husband for a romantic getaway.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Date Night,"My husband and our two neighbors did a date night at The Crawford Hotel including the Stranahans whiskey tour. The driver of their courtesy car, Riley, was punctual, friendly and great at navigating Friday night traffic to get us there on time for our tour (not to mention the Tesla model X was quite fun). The hotel is beautiful and a great people-watching spot. We tried a room on the third floor this time and it was large, clean and incredibly unique. The two headed shower was wonderful! The Crawford never disappoints, we just need to stay longer next time.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect polished urban getaway!,"The hotel is beautifully situated within historic union station and is the perfect place for a polished and elevated urban getaway. The staff was attentive, polite and professional. The room was warm, lofty and clean. Loved the bathroom and the CO Bigelow bath products - peppermint and lavender. Good bath products are such an appreciated surprise instead of the expected watered down sample sizes given at most hotels! You can order breakfast ahead of time from Snooze on the iPad in the room which was a cool touch. Loved all of the extra amenities like the branded tesla courtesy car which we took to dinner! Also the free ice cream from their partner vendor in Union Station AND a free beer at happy hour in Terminal Bar. Love love love this hotel. It's perfect for a date night, solo staycation, business travel and especially for anyone coming in from out of town as Union Station is the coolest place in Denver right now.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Place,My husband and I just returned from 3 nights in Denver.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Crawford Hotel.  It's so conveniently located in downtown Denver at Union Station.  Our room was spacious and comfortable. We'll definitely be back.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford Hotel at Union Station,"A beautiful hotel in a great location in Denver! Courtney at the front desk was fantastic to talk with and she offered all sorts of accommodations that made staying a breeze. The Crawford has a complimentary Tesla that can be used to get around the city within a 2-mile radius. Our driver, Riley, was extremely friendly and flexible with time when he came by to pick us up at a speak easy that was nearby. The hotel is inside Union Station and they did an incredible job preserving it's historical features and converting old office spaces into rooms. I will be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great Room, Perfect Location","I absolutely loved my stay at the Crawford. It is a beautiful hotel, and the rooms perfectly reflect the character of the historic Union Station. As far as convenience for someone trying to experience Denver, you couldn't ask for a better location. In the heart of LoDo, you can easily walk to one of many great night spots, or catch a train/bus to anywhere else you'd like to see.On a personal note, as someone who grew up in Denver, and spent a lot of time at the Union station before renovation, I am amazed at how well this area has turned itself around, and the Crawford Hotel is one of many integral factors in an amazing transformation. Would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stay at the Crawford Hotel,The hotel finishes are beautiful. The Union Station Lobby is magical and the restaurants there and nearby are terrific. Myles and Dave took good care of us getting us where we needed to go and sharing the local knowledge of the area.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Train Station Turned Hotel --- WOW!,"The Crawford Hotel... wow, where do I start? Talk about a beautiful place to stay. When you enter the building you are greeted by an incredible view; an old train station beautifully restored with all of its vintage charm.The rooms are incredible! Beds are super comfortable, showers are spacious and luxurious, and the Voss water is a nice touch.If you are flying into Denver the train will dead end at Union Station (aka the Crawford Hotel). You can't beat the location. You're in the heart of downtown and can easily walk to everything. But if you don't feel like walking, you're in luck! The Crawford Hotel has a courtesy valet service that will drive you anywhere in the downtown area for free. Yeah, it's awesome!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing rooms and location!,"We staying in a suite with a living space, king bed, and large bathroom with soaking tub.  It was prefect and ever better than the pictures. All the amenities were great and perks. This is located inside the train station so it is very busy with lots of people but the room was very quiet. This is a great location for bars and restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel - Super cool,"Biggest disappointment....only got to stay here one night.  This is a great property, right in Union Station.  It is a very lively environment and location is fantastic.  If you are in town for a sporting event you can walk to it no matter what it is, and there are multiple restaurants and bars all walkable.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The rooms are great.  Love the amenities in in the bathrooms.  Even though you are at an active train station you would hardly ever know it.  They have done a great job with insulating the outside world from the room.Walking around the ""lobby"" takes you back to the early 1900's.  Historically and architecturally this place is stunning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Has it all!,"There is really nothing else that could make this hotel any better.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford Hotel,The remodel of what used to be offices in Denver's Union Station is nothing but an unqualified success.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel and Excellent Staff,"Stayed at The Crawford Hotel for a business meeting. The hotel is in a great location with a lot of amenities.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun place and great location,Very enjoyable place with well designed rooms. Great location for bars and restaurants with the in-house Cooper Bar heading the list. The complimentary Tesla car service is par excellance with David at the helm. Really made coming and going to the stadium a bonus.The front desk staff could be a bit more organized and trained.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Downtown Romance,"Amazing visit! Dave and the Tesla was a highlight! Easy check in, great bars, ride to our show and then they picked us up.

In 30 minutes you get off at the railroad station where the hotel is for less than $10. The rooms are QUIET and of ample size; the bathroom is clean and spacious and the bed/pillows are outstanding. The railroad station downstairs is filled with restaurants, bars and little shops. The hotel is one block from a free bus system that goes along the length of 16th street. I would stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel with staff that are friendly and professional,"I stayed at the Crawford Hotel twice now when I was in town for business.  It is located in the heart of downtown Denver and the train is very convenient to get you back and forth from the airport for only $9.00 each way (door to door).  The rooms are very clean and decorated nicely.  The lobby is a comfortable gathering place for both the locals and travelers; get a hot cup of coffee from Pigtrain Coffee Company and hang out with your friends, order a great-tasting breakfast at Snooze cafe or get the kids ice cream from the Milkbox Ice Creamery.  The staff is very professional and friendly. On your next visit to the Crawford, say hi to Matt at the front desk for me.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hospitality!,Riley was great! The hotel provided us with a drive in a 2 mile radius and with this location that covers enough! Great room with living room and great view! The lobby reminds you of hogwarts during Christmas time! Great vibe!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best of Denver in one building!,I stayed at The Crawford for a couple's retreat and was blown away.  The staff was incredible and took care of my every need.  I purchased an upgrade at check in and it was a great deal - totally worth it.  We ate and drank at many of the places in Union Station and they were all awesome.  Stay in bed and get room service from Snooze!  I will definitely be back!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful station refurbishment in great location,"Very quiet hotel in an active train station. There are a very wide variety of restaurants and bars in Union Station. There is a facilities fee but it comes with freebies: Coffee, beer, ice cream, discounts in the Cooper Bar. Union station has a Farmers market every Saturday (warm months) and an Uber stand.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Location, Location, Location","We visit family members who live in Denver and Evergreen. Staying at the Crawford we can walk to one son's home, and the hotel takes us in their Tesla to the other. We go downstairs to get great lattes and rolls for breakfast and then have dinner at Mercantile. Great service. See Margot for everything you need.  The Light Rail to get to the airport is right there at Union Station",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford,"This was a wonderful addition to the train ride from Glenwood to Denver and back.  After a little opps in our arriving in Denver, we were welcomed by a wonderful person who saw what had happened.  Dominic helped by engaging us and telling a little history on the hotel art, intrigued we asked about rates, then booked us a wonderful room with awesome amenities.   Problem forgotten and enjoyed a wonderful evening.  I will stsy at the Crawford again. Great location, quiet,  beatiful.  Great staff.  Me likie!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing!,"We stayed at the Crawford on our wedding night.  Tara Saldivar made our stay most memorable with the amazing room she picked out for us.  The room was beautiful with high ceilings, and a beautiful bathroom with a four foot bathtub!   Tara and the staff there are top notch!  Thanks for making a great ending to our wedding day!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Complete Hospitality,"This could be one of the most unique metropolitan transit stations in the world accented with top notch restaurants, cafes, bars, and bookstores, all centrally located in Downtown Denver. The Crawford Hotel encompasess the entire station which is easily accessible from the Denver Airport, and provides transportation to anywhere in the state. The Crawford Hotel specifically caters to the traveller, the local, and pets. I stayed there with my siberian husky and was provided with instruction cards for easy access to dog parks, a dog bed, food/water bowls, and all around genuine warmth and graciousness. I have stayed at the Crawford 4 times now, and make it a requirement for any stop in denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wow... Denver,My daughter booked this hotel for us and I can honestly say it was a fantastic find.. Great rooms with tall ceilings and beautiful bathrooms.  Quiet !  The train station down stairs is really cool.  We used the Tesla complimentry car driven by David.  Such a nice guy!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Instagram Friendly,"The Crawford hotel is beautiful. WOW.  The City of Denver should be very proud of the renovation of Union Station and the revitalization of the area. It's very impressive. I stayed at the hotel for one night just to check it out!  Gorgeous design.  I had room 238. It is very small. The wood detailing is beautiful. The room feels very inviting. There are two ""free"" Voss water bottles and a great expresso maker. The air conditioning is quiet and comfortable. The TV is way to large for the room. All the information for the room is on an I-Pad. After flying in, renting a car, trying to sync my phone to my rental, driving in downtown Denver to find how to valet the car ($45), I wasn't in the mood to figure out a channel guide on an iPad. I called the front deck to ask what channel the local news was on. They said to check the I pad. The ladies at the front desk were adorable and very helpful. The shower is beautiful. The water pressure was ok, not great, and was lukewarm, I couldn't figure out how to make it hot. The property is expensive and I really  enjoyed the experience but wouldn't stay there again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford Batmobile,"We stayed at the hotel whilst attending the Durango Songwriting Expo. We had a loft room, which was very spacious, comfortable with free water and chocolates each night. The only thing was it was a bit dark. The hotel was an ideal location for us as travellers from London to visit the city. The train from the airport had cross platform access with a 37 minute service to the Union Station. The hotel staff were efficient, courteous whilst providing a first class service. The other plus is the Mercantile Restaurant within the complex their breakfast menu was healthy and wholesome. Let’s not forget Coopers Bar on the third floor that serves a half bottle of Rosé champagne paradise. The city’s free hop on off bus service on 16th Street for shopping is an excellent service with the bus frequency of under 5 minutes duration. For high end shopping Cherry Creek Mall it’s about 10 minutes max in a Uber. The Crawford courtesy gull wing Telsa car aka the Batmobile was a surprise perk taking us to restaurants within a 2 mile radius. The Batmobile was an opportunity for us to imagine we were on a cape crusade mission to bring good to the city only ours was usually to dine and shop!!...",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for a weekend getaway (even if you live in Denver),"We love The Crawford. The location in Union Station is amazing and so close to great places in downtown Denver. The rooms are luxurious and comfortable, the amenities are wonderful (they carry my favorite lotion in the rooms), and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. You get some fun Union Station freebies when you stay at The Crawford and you can pre-book your Snooze reservation and skip the wait for brunch (it can be up to a 2 hour wait one the weekend). We’ll be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful hotel!,"Great location. Lots of amenities in the main area (union station), really bustling scene with great restaurant, coffee, ice cream and bar.  Very unique layout in general, rooms were clean and upscale. And....Coziest bed ever!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love this place,The staff was amazing. The room was above and beyond. The whole atmosphere of the place was fantastic. We probably should be stayed another night so we could explore more. Next time we will for sure! If you need to get to the airport early the train is very convenient for that.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,LETS GO GIANTS,Stayed at The Crawford while attending the Giants vs Broncos game. This is a great hotel. Very convenient to airport and stadium as well as bars and restaurants. Room was very nice with comfortable bed and was very clean. A bit pricey but I think the convenience was worth it.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome stay!,"Loved my stay here! The front desk people were so nice, friendly and always smiling! Lauren who checked us in was so nice and very informative,  Margot who checked us out was awesome, she is so friendly. David who drove the curiosity car made the ride  fun and relaxing, very easy to talk to!  I loved the shower in our room, the rain shower head and the space of shower was very luxurious. We did not hear any noise coming from the great hall, the rooms are very quiet  for all of the hustle and bustle that is around.  Everything we have experienced was unforgettable about the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun In Downtown!,"This place won't be everyone's cup of tea but I've been twice in the past month and a half and really really like it.  In a way it's a bit of a 'deconstructed hotel' smack in the middle of the train station right downtown within walking distance of about everything you'd want to do.  Walk to the ball park? Check.  Walk to LoHi over the highway and thru the park on 17th? Check.  Head up the 16th street mall? or to Larimer Street?  Check and Check.The restaurant scene and about everything else you could want in the hustle and bustle of the town is right at your fingertips.  It's not a Hyatt, Westin, Sheraton, or Marriott. It is so much more fun and a great vibe.  It takes some getting used to because it's in the middle of a station with shops all the way around.  One little entry stall is the check in, concierge, and bell desk all combined and you don't really realize all those services are there until you ask.  The rooms are across the station and up the elevator so that feels different.  You can also take the stairs.  It's relationship with shopkeepers is 'indirect' meaning you can get a drink at the wonderful bar on the second story or get breakfast at Snooze or get a complimentary ice cream or coffee at the local creamery and coffee shop but none of the experiences are actually part of the hotel.  Thats why I say it's like a deconstructed hotel. The lobby is the station area.  But it's LOVELY you just have to accept that you are not contained in a building that is all hotel and nothing but hotel.  But that's the fun of it.The rooms are well appointed. They have coffee, wonderful bath products, and we chose a deluxe room that had a separate seating area and claw tub and shower with double sink.  The beds are yummy - firm, great sheets, and very very comfortable and our room had super high ceilings and the temperature was consistent and lots of natural light. If you like to cocoon I'm told the rooms up in the 'attic' are really cozy and super.  Wasn't our cup of tea because I like windows and up in those rooms the windows are up near the ceiling.  Complimentary waters and also as I said coupons for a drink, coffee, ice-cream and nice treats throughout. They make their car available for a 2 mile radius but a) it wasn't available when we needed it and b) we'd rather walk. Anyway - love this place. The only thing that keeps it in my mind from being a 5 star from a four is there is no turn down service. You get two sets of towels for two people instead of four and on the bed,  I'd rather have a duvet than what felt like a sheet and a heavy duvet in a bedspread like covering.  Was a little heavy.  But who can quibble.It's a bit on the expensive side but worth the experience.  This is my new go-to when I go to Denver and I will definitely be back.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Expensive but quality,"We stayed at the Crawford Hotel before our trip on the Califonia Express because its only a 2 minute walk from the hotel which is based in the station terminal, to the trains. The hotel harks back to a nostalgic era but you do pay for it as its expensive. The rooms are luxurious with big beds and high ceilings. As others have said make sure you ask for a quiet room away from the hassle and bustle of the terminal which the some of the corridors and lifts overlook. We enjoyed the stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Special Experience in Downtown Denver,"Our ""staycation"" for our 3rd Wedding Anniversary included an overnight at the Crawford Hotel. We loved the character and luxury of the 4th level Loft-Style room.  The room is well-designed with spacious sitting area (red leather sofa was a nice touch) and comfy King bed with robes supplied. Gorgeous bathroom with jumbo soaking tub and oversized shower! Very quiet room and the staff was wonderful...made me feel special.  The location is perfectly situated in the renovated Union Station...rode the light trail and everything was smooth and convenient.  Would stay here again for a special occasion.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,As good as it gets!,"A forward thinking hotel experience for the savvy traveler. From the gorgeous rooms to the personalized service, this place has it all. Explore the building, restaurants, amenities and neighborhood. A must for all visiting Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,As overrated as its namesake,Named after Dana Crawford who basically did very little and got credit for a lot - this hotel is just poorly planned poorly laid out and poorly managed -- and it's noisy too.  It does have a great location but that's about it,2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Impersonal ,One you check in you have zero contact with hotel personnel.  The desk is in a small alcove off the huge Union Station and is neither inviting or particularly accessible.Getting to the room took a long walk through the station to the elevator and then a long walk down a sterile corridor to the room.Interaction with the staff has been replaced by an iPad which supposedly does everything.Next time we would look for something more personable.,3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible Hotel with Character,"This hotel offers nostalgia as well as luxury and comfort.  There is so much energy in Union Station along with great restaurants bars and shops, and then when you step in your hotel room it is luxury, peaceful and comfortable!  This is a great place to stay with amazing access to all of downtown Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Hospitality 2.0,My fiancee and I stayed at The Crawford Hotel in Sept. 2017- it was the perfect staycation location! Tara Saldivar was so thoughtful about our stay and set us up in an amazing loft room complete with mini bottles of champagne. We took advantage of the Tesla car service on our way home that night too. Thank you for the great hospitality and accomodations Tara + The Crawford!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Historic Hotel,"First of all, coming into the train station, the lobby area was beautiful, and busy.  Everything looked wonderful.   After check in, the elevator was over to the side, and I went to my room.  When I opened the door, I was ecstatic, the light fixtures were huge and looked great coming down from the high ceilings. Loved the artwork in the hallways and in the room.  The bathroom was large as was the shower, very nice.  The only thing I wish is that there was a 24 hour room service, but there was food available at the various restaurants throughout the station.  My stay was nice, I had a view of Wynkoop street, and several times walked over to the Tattered Cover to purchase a book.  All in all a good stay, and, the train to the airport is conveniently located there.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,One Night In Denver ,"Crawford is a beautiful hotel & interesting space. Staff is very friendly & helpful. This hotel is inside of a working train station. Make sure to ask for a room down one of the hallways if you are light sleeper. The rooms that over look the balcony to the down stairs are cool but can be a bit noisy. There are some fun tours & packages that can be added to your stay. Plus shops, coffee, ice cream & restaurants inside the station where you free things from because you are staying at the Crawford. It is an over all unique experince. I'd call the front desk let them know the experince you are looking for and they will take good care of you.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Night on the town ,"If you are wanting night life and a fun atmosphere, this is your place. We checked in a little early and was greeted by Margot, who upgraded us and was as nice as could be.  Our room was beautiful and unique. Had breakfast in the merchantile; the croque madame was very good.  The free Tesla ride to Ruth's Chris was a nice touch. LoVe The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very Funky Hotel with Excellent Service,Imagine walking down to the hotel lobby from your high end hotel room and finding a train station instead.  This is the Crawford.  It is as if you are transported somewhere else in the elevator ride.  The atmosphere is fantastic and very unique.  The staff are constantly checking up on you to ensure a pleasant stay.  I loved it and highly recommend this for a business or pleasure stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Locals can Experience Denver Anew,"I love an adventure!  We've lived in Colorado for over 18 years and Colorado has so many wonderful places to visit and eat and experience. We received a gift for a night away at The Crawford Hotel.  We had visited union station and several restaurants, but had not had an opportunity to stay.  Wow everyone needs to stay.  You arrive and they handle everything from the moment you arrive.  Valeting your car which you don't even need to use until you check out-perfect; water is offered at the front desk and then all the additional perks: beers at the Terminal Bar, Ice cream, coffee plus so much more including free vehicle service to a local restaurant in their Tesla.  The room was unbelievable.  I mentioned that I was thrilled with the claw tub in the room and was hoping to enjoy a bubble bath and Tara smiled and then appeared with a small bottle of bubble bath. We made reservations for the Cooper Lounge and a couple of our children joined us for drinks and a beautiful cheese/meat platter.  The whole evening was special and the history of the hotel was a joy to learn.  It seems like every turn there is a little more to learn.  Denver is very lucky to have a gem like the Crawford Hotel. I would like to thank Tara for everything she did to make our night away be so enjoyable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Downtown Denver,The room was a little small - no place to put our luggage - but there were lots of great extras. Most fun was the Tesla transport with our great driver Riley. When we were picked up after dinner a lot of people came out to look at our ride! Also ice cream and coffee at Union Station.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wow best hotel surprise I have had in a while. ,"Loving the vibe.  Room is clean and spacious.  Free samples from the shops in union station. Loving it.  Wish I was staying longer. High tech iPad for an alarm clock.  Not sure I would come here with kids, but business for sure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic Location,"You can not beat the location or the vibe of this hotel. The architecture is amazing and the restoration of the union station building into a modern space was done in a way that created a destination point from a destination point. The rooms were comfortable and the staff was friendly. We had brunch the next day at Urban Farmer, just a block away. It was delicious!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location and Friendly Staff",Stayed here for one night while passing through Denver.  The hotel is in the perfect location to walk around downtown Denver.  The room and lobby where beautiful and well maintained.  The team at the front desk was friendly and helpful.  The Terminal Bar offers several local beers and you get two free each night!  We did not utilize the Tesla transportation but it's cool that they offer it.  The hotel lobby serves as an actual train station as well which was entertaining.  I will stay here again!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing hotel,"Beautiful hotel, helpful and professional staff, great location -- this place has it all.  We took advantage of the wealth of great dining options in the hotel and within walking distance.  My go-to next time I'm in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Choo Choo Train,"Imagine staying at the train station! The lobby is like an old station with benches and a ticket window. You can take the train from the airport straight to the hotel! All sorts of fun shops are at the station too! The rooms are above the station yet you cannot hear Amtrak or the train to the hotel! What a comfy room! Wonderful lavender shower gel, shampoo and conditioner! You HAVE to experience this! You can walk to the 16th street mall and enjoy great food! We had amazing sushi at Blu!  Have fun! I think I can, I think I can, I know YOU can! 🚂",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Staff is always ready to serve you,I always enjoy my stay at the Crawford. It is a beautiful building and a very lively location. The staff is outstanding here. When in Denver I prefer to stay at the Crawford. Easy transportation to and from the airport.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"We were very surprised and thrilled to find such a wonderful hotel in a railway station!It was so much fun and you have everything at your fingertip….bars, restuarants, shops etc.The room was excellent, with a large modern bathroom and so very quietOne of the best things, the train arrives at the door of the Hotel direct from the airiportAnd takes you back to the airport, so easy and comfortable.We really enjoyed our stay and will for sure go backHighly recommended",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Mildew and tattered towels,"The Crawford Hotel is cool. It's in a great location in Denver and it's actually in Union Station. Our two rooms were fine, but our shower was full of mildew and the towels in our room were tiny and tattered. The hotel is certainly not luxurious or worth $500 a night.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Get A Way,"Great place to stay in the middle of a great city. The staff was outstanding and we loved their great customer service. We will be going back soon. This hotel is in the middle of the union station and is amazing how they set it up. Great amenities all around. You can get coffee, desert, any meal, a cocktail, a book and so on. It's fantastic!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location!,"The Crawford hotel was fantastic. It is located perfectly in union station and was an easy commute from the airport via the train.Staff was friendly, rooms were clean and nicely appointed.There is free coffee, ice cream, and a craft beer every day for guests of the hotel. We also took advantage of the complementary Tesla courtesy car to take us to and from local eateries.I would definitely stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,None better. And a free Tesla shuttle,"Travels to denver downtown region (or anywhere the lightrail goes) should include this property. Spoil yourself or those you love with subtle luxury and service.Located inside the main terminal train station, Crawford is plush and convenient. Quiet and located next to crazy, if you want it. So many amenities for your $20 resort fee that you feel a little ashamed. (free ice cream, espresso, Tesla shuttle service, preferred seating, discounted bar tab, flowers and more)Go to Denver. Stay at The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique Hotel in Denver,"The Crawford Hotel is a very interesting concept. It is a hotel set in the middle of an active train station (which also has shopping, restaurants, and a massive ""waiting room"" which is great for meeting people or just hanging out.)So, although there is much offered here, the whole experience can feel a bit like a circus. Be prepared to navigate a broad mix of people (guests of the hotel, but mostly tourists and train travelers) as you come in and out of the hotel. If you park a car using the hotel valet, allow ample time for your vehicle to be brought up for you.The hotel portion of the building is very nice. Very high ceilinged hallways -- much calmer than the lobby.  The room we had was quite lovely. Again, with high ceilings and sizable queen beds with nice bedding. Our room faced a water park (Room 303) which provided some lively sounds from outside until the fountains were turned off. But it was that or being too close to the elevator.The one hotel services issue we had was housekeeping. When we returned to the hotel at 4:30pm (Our stay in Denver was brief, so this was on our only full day in town and at the hotel), following a long day of exploring (after leaving our room at 10am), our room had not yet been cleaned. We went to the front desk to complain and they oddly asked if we had ""requested an early room cleaning"". Hotels in this price-point should provide their guests with refreshed and cleaned rooms by 2:00pm every day. Period. We found ourselves having to wait in the very busy and chaotic lobby as housekeeping swept our room. We were tired and had been looking forward to relaxing and getting cleaned up before dinner. Unfortunately, in their haste to clean our room, housekeeping failed to remove & replace used coffee cups; no new drinking glasses; and they didn't replace the extra towels we requested following our check-in.  Hopefully management will prioritize the cleaning of current guests rooms in a timely fashion so they can maximize use of their rooms during their stay. Despite that hiccup, the Crawford Hotel is an interesting choice while staying in Denver if you are looking for a fun and active experience.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome,Amazing service and staff. Very helpful and courteous. It was located in an area that was fun and rustic. Many great places to eat within walking distance. Nice amenities on site for exercise and enjoyment,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,So quiet! And you cannot beat that location.,"I would have never thought a hotel in a train station would be that quiet but it was! And the location was perfect, close to everything. We took the train from the airport and less than half hour later, we were in our room. The room itself was well appointed, with good toiletries and good size - although the window was a bit high up but what can you do. And having so many restaurants closed by was great. We walked everywhere.The best part of the room was The Cooper Lounge. Great atmosphere and amazing drinks! I discovered a new favorite - the Bernadette - and my husband (as usual) had a Manhattan, which were superb. We had a nightcap almost every evening we stayed at the hotel.If I ever go back to Denver, I'll be sure to stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A slice of everything at your fingertips. ,"My wife and I recently stayed here for or honeymoon. This is the most impressive hotel I've ever stayed at. The night atmosphere of Union Station was lively and the room overlooked it, but there was no noise penetration into the rooms. The best part though is all of the restaurants and activities nearby. The hotel gives you a welcome cars that gives you discounts and freebies to almost all of the surrounding shops.We will definitely come back later.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawford,"I felt the hotel was exceptional.  They did a fantastic job of converting the train station to a hotel.  The rooms were great with very nice décor.  The staff were all friendly and quick to help you.  The only thing I didn't like was the lack of self parking, but that is a problem with most hotels in Denver.  I would definitely stay at the Crawford again",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Little vacation,"Stayed at the Crawford a Wednesday thru Monday so got to experience it weekdays and weekend. Rooms are modern, clean and quiet. The staff is very professional and helpful. It's location is killer with tons of restaurants all within walking distance. They have a fleet of Teslas and offer free rides almost anywhere in the downtown area so no need to rent a car. On Sundays there is a wonderful farmers market right in front of the hotel. If you love people watching as I do this is a great place to people watch. The area around the hotel as well as the lobby has become a place to see and be seen by both visitors and residents of Denver.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An exceptional place stay,"Happily the Crawford delivered all the hoped for benefits of its location, but without the feared downsides of being located actually within Union Station in Denver.The valet parking staff were friendly and easy to locate on the kerbside outside the station. The only negative was a slow vehicle return when checking out, despite advance notice having been phoned through.The hotel reception desk is located within the station concourse itself, which is a slightly bizarre arrangement, but it was staffed by friendly individuals throughout our stay,Perhaps we were lucky, but our room on the 3rd floor towards the rear of the building suffered no noise at all from the trains or noisy station concourse. The beds were comfy and the provided iPad allowed easy access to hotel information and a selection of entertainment if required.A $20 daily amenities fee covered 2 bottles of water plus discounts at local stores, including a free scoop of ice cream for everyone. 'Priority access' to breakfast at Snooze was of varied help given their bizarre queuing system.I would definitely consider staying here again when visiting Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver Diamond,"Excellent location inside beautiful newly renovated Union Station. Loft room was immaculate with spacious bathroom and guest quarters. Delighted by complimentary ice cream, coffee and ride in Tesla Model X. The Cooper Lounge was a nice respite inside the hotel and the access to fine dining and nightlife was terrific. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Denver or anyone needing a little downtown getaway.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Not up to it's ratings,"Located at the Amtrak station in downtown it's become a place, the station that is, where folks go to to meet and greet, eat and drink. Lots of food and drink choices.The Crawford's checkin is in the station.Pull up outside and the baggage people load your baggage and take it to the desk (one tip) . Thats it. They are not allowed to take it to your room. The very busy desk clerks do that, and therein lies one problem. It can take up to a half hour for your luggage to show up at your room if they are busy. When it does...another tip. Same happens when you check out.The room is very nice. Very comfortable.The towels were frayed and there was only two. For what you pay the towels should not be frayed.The tub needed a better cleaning and the floors could have used some more vacuum work.Some may consider these things minor but for what you pay they should not happen. I have seen this hotel rated in various magazines and I think, based on my experience, it's overrated.Nice but not meeting it's standards.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Enjoy being at the center of Union Station in a wonderful hotel,"The newly renovated historic Union Station is filled with places to eat and shop plus the lovely Crawford Hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed out stay, the friendly service, the Tesla shuttle that took us where we wanted to go, and the convenient location.  We even took the train right into the station from the airport.  Doesn't get easier than that.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The hotel is out of this world!!!,"Everything about the Crawford is first-class.  Each member of the staff remembered our names and details about our visit.  We were so pampered in such a luxurious setting.  I will definitely return to this hotel.  I highly recommend it to anybody staying in the Denver area.  RTD lite rail has transportation from Denver airport right to the door at Union Station.  Beautiful, unique rooms (be sure to take the tour), complimentary transportation around the city, extremely knowledgeable and over-the-top staff.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Fun Stay in an Active Hotel and Area!,My first time in Denver.....I studied the reviews on the top hotels before choosing the Crawford.......once booked.....I had 3 friends asks where I was staying in Denver and all 3 said the Crawford was their #1 choice as well......the lobby was actually the train station....so commuters and long distance travelers moved thru day and nights....great people watching.....lots of dining options in the lobby area as well as nearby......my room faced the street and plaza in front of the station.....it was very quiet......no lobby or street noise......others in our party with rooms facing the tracks mentioned the noise was an issue at night...my room was large and very modern......friendly service at the front desk.....I would stay here again!Tulemar Dave,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Cool but Odd Hotel,"This hotel was very cool located in the actual train station.  Rooms were small but nice.  However, would try it once but never again.  The lobby is the train station and if it is after popular hours security guards make you show id if you sit there even though there are people sleeping around the benches in the station that a not guests, very annoying.  No staff to be found.  It is a hotel desk, a public train station and rooms.  You do NOT feel like you are in an upscale hotel and no hotel vibe. No coffee, water or anything available. There has to be better hotels at this expensive price that come with service.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful restoration, in the heart of town, lots of action","The renovation of this whole building is marvelous. In addition to being the hub for public transit, it's close to lots of nightlife, the baseball stadium, downtown offices and other activity. In addition to the hotel, the station building contains at least two very good restaurants, an ice cream parlor, and a couple of very good coffee places. The desk clerk even dispensed discount coupons for some of them when we checked in. The staff was extremely helpful, the room immaculate and well-furnished, and the convenience factor cannot be beat. Highly recommend and hope to return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Lovely Hotel, Great customer service, Great location!","The Crawford is a beautiful hotel with lots of amenities and excellent customer service. The location in LoDo is choice, and there are lots of great options for coffee, drinks, and food just steps away. Shout out to Jacob who was very helpful during our stay and made us feel right at home. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Denver. Highly recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Stay at The Crawford,We had a wonderful experience at The Crawford Hotel from the time we checked in till we checked out.  The hotel staff is so friendly and helpful.  I forgot my phone charger and there were so nice to deliver 1 to my room.    Loved to convince of the close restaurants and shopping. Urban Farmer is a must try for anyone visiting.  Also enjoyed the complimentary ice cream and coffee provided when staying.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved It,I stayed here for four weeks this summer during business training.  Staff was friendly and very responsive.  Rooms were spectacular.  Really loved the convenience of the restaurants and bars in the Terminal.  Was a great place to relax.  Also enjoyed that it was walking distance to most everywhere.  Would definitely stay again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Another amazing stay at The Crawford,"Coming back to stay at The Crawford is like visiting close friends.  When we checked in everyone was so helpful and happy to see us!  They have the most incredible staff!!  We had a corner room with beautiful views of the city.  The room was fabulous and peaceful!  The beds are so soft and wonderful it was difficult to get up and get moving in the morning!! It's so nice to have the robes and slippers available after the amazing and relaxing shower.  We enjoyed and looked forward to the beer, and ice cream everyday! Being connected to the station is so wonderful for meals as well as just sitting down and enjoying the surroundings.  We had a very nice evening at the Cooper Lounge while visiting with friends.  We loved the complimentary Tesla that picked us up and dropped off anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel.  We took the tour of the hotel and really enjoyed learning about the history and how it became the luxury hotel that it is today.  We'll be back soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"The heart of Union Station in downtown Denver...excellent location, great restaurants in the area",The Crawford's 112 rooms are very unique in that they are part of the historic Union Station renovation. Very good restaurants and bars are in Union Station but also within easy walking distance...as is the 16th Street Mall with free bus rides. The Crawford provides a Tesla with driver for trips within 2 miles of the hotel and Union Station is the central location for the RTD light rail system with its A-Line access to DIA plus many other metro Denver locations. The Crawford is an experience you'll definitely enjoy.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Perfect Anniversary Getaway Inside Union Station,"I'm a local and I love this place. My wife and I stayed here in mid-August 2017 and our experience was incredible. We were greeted in kind by the very attentive front desk staff — who congratulated us on our anniversary and looked into available upgrades for us. Their smiles are genuine. You definitely get the sense that you're being taken care of here.The room itself (a superior classic) overlooked the rail lines behind Union Station and featured Victorian era details like a pin-tucked headboard and mirrored glass with a few modern touches, such as local urban artwork. Ours even featured an original safe that had been preserved during the renovation of the historic property.The amenities are great: $5 cocktails at the Cooper Lounge (which features amazing views of 17th street), free coffee and ice cream at PigTrain, and more. You will not only love the hotel and the excellent service, but also your time exploring Union Station and the nearby LoHi neighborhood.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel!! Loved the proximity to the CA Zephyr.,"I stayed in this hotel on the last night of a three week trip through the central states.  It was so nice to relax in the very comfortable room knowing that I just had to wake up and roll out the back door to catch my train.  The staff was amazing and the $20 worth of perks were great!  I had my free beer, my free ice cream, my free coffee, and my $5 drink at the restaurant.  It all was so nice.  The bed was so comfortable and the room had central air which was great after a trip full of places with no air conditioning.  I'd love to stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,It's the People!,"The people at the Crawford made the experience that much more amazing!  We were traveling to celebrate a birthday and even though it was well past midnight when we finally settled into our room on the first night after checking in, the gentleman who helped us check in arrived with chocolates and a birthday well-wishes card!  We especially enjoyed the courtesy Tesla service and enjoyed chatting with Riley & Myles as we went from place to place.  The service is second to none, the amenities and extras are wonderful, the location is convenient, and the experience is one of a kind!  I highly recommend this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Brilliant hotel,"This is not your typical  hotel, the lobby is actually the lobby of what it was the train station and now is full of lovely restaurants and shops and kind of a common area where you can have a drink and admire this beautiful place. The rooms are a bit  small but really comfy, the bathroom is super clean and nice. The hotel is placed right in downtown so you just walk wherever you would like to go everything is really close by or you could just take the free mall bus wich is free for anyone and is always in transit through the main street wich is by the side of the hotel. Totally worth it and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,First visit to Crawford Hotel!,"We chose the Crawford Hotel online, because of it's proximity to Coors Field for a Colorado Rockies game.  Absolutely LOVED the hotel!  We received an upgrade upon check-in, due to it being my husbands birthday and our 23rd Wedding Anniversary, and stayed in a Loft room.  Absolutely LOVED the room!  Clean, quaint, quiet rooms and the service upon check-in and during our stay was top notch!  We've already booked another stay at the Crawford Hotel for a stay in Denver in September!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel. Great Location.,"We had an amazing stay at the Crawford. Having the train station that close was very convenient. The bars, shops, and food were all top notch. They have iPads in each room that you can order housekeeping, room service, or just get information about the area. Would highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Close to Everything ,"Fantastic hotel in Denver which is close to breweries, transit, and coors field. You pay a little more to stay here but you get fantastic location, and great amenities/perks. I was a little worried about parking but right across the street is a public parking garage which made the stay even easier. We enjoyed the Terminal bar for happy hour, ice cream from the milk box and the short stroll to Coors Field. The rooms were great with a private elevator tucked away in Union Station. Very relaxing Trip can't wait to stay at again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great spot and service,"My wife and I loved it. We had a loft room and loved the character added by the wooden beams.Also got a free coffee and giant scoop of ice cream for each of us, along with other available freebies and discounts.And being right over Union Station was great because we could just head straight to the airport the next day.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Hip and cool, but not relaxing or kid friendly.","Hello fellow travelers.  I just returned home from a trip to the much-anticipated Crawford Hotel.  I traveled with my husband and 4 children (ages 6 yrs - 4 mo).  This isn't our first rodeo with the kids so you know this review isn't from an overly-dramatic/helicopter mom. This hotel got great reviews and the pictures were outstanding.  For empty-nesters, 20 somethings, or travel without kids or even travel with older kids, it's beautiful.  For our trip, it was good, but couldn't give it a 4/5 star for a couple of reasons.  First, it's a busy, busy, building that also happens to be a hotel.  It is not relaxing or serene.  If you are looking for that, this is NOT the hotel for you. There are people shopping in the market inside of the hotel, people with tons of luggage waiting for the train, people just taking a look around, a guy with a parrot on his shoulder passing through, a lively bar, and overall  just a lot of people in and out.  It was always crowded and loud, and I longed for quiet and less foot-traffic.  Given this, I watched my kiddos closely, and was not at ease while in the ""lobby"", which is really just a desk plopped in the midst of this major thoroughfare.  I thought the hotel was an afterthought, with the real action being the bar, the markets, the shops and the actual functioning train station. I got the impression this was a destination unto itself.  It's great; just not the calm, hip, chill type of great. The rooms were fine with grand high ceilings.  The art was, interesting.  Our room had a very strange red-haired girl print.  It was chilling; she appeared ready to extract a beating heart.  I tried not to look at it.  The housekeeping was meh.  Our floor was not the cleanest.  The bathtub could have been cleaned better.  The towels were in pretty rough shape, with some fraying ends. As for being kid friendly, it's not.  The pac-n-play that they brought to our room looked to be about 20 years old and had the dirt to prove it.  I just went with it because it was likely the only one they had and I covered it with sheets.  There weren't any kid activities here and I just couldn't let my kids be more than 2 feet from me lest they get lost in the crowd. Also, beware of hidden costs at this hotel.  The parking is very expensive, and our bill for two adjoining rooms was not clear.  Management got weird about honoring a AAA discount and they didn't do so despite many vacancies, so my advice would be to get this in writing in advance. Overall, beautiful building, beautiful architecture, and unique concept; but just too crowded, noisy and busy to be a 4/5 star for this price point.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An Overall Great Experience,"Stayed here for two nights while in town for business.  Took the train from airport right into Union Station and walked over.  Great location, close to everything, no car needed.  Nate at check-in was excellent, providing a little history of the hotel.  Love the key and tassel! Large room, clean and comfortable.  Obviously if you are looking for a luxurious resort, this isn't it.  But it is a great hotel in a great location.  I would return again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,parking garage staff,"Parked for a lunch meeting, upon exit my credit card got stuck in the machine and we could not exit.  After a long(hour) wait to get the gate manually opened, Zach - who has nothing to do with parking payment - waited for my credit card to get removed from the machine and delivered it to my office.  Zach truly went above and beyond his duty or responsibility for which I am forever grateful!  Excellent customer service - thank you ZACH!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Soundproofing is a State of Mind,"We were in town to attend a book release party. As an introduction to Denver, this hotel does a great job of capturing the more hip aspects of the local vibe: lots of retro details, handlebar mustaches and locavore dining available in the area. The lobby is bustling at all hours and on Saturday there is a cool farmers' market on the plaza outside. The rail connection to the airport is great, and there is a B-cycle bike stand right out front (bike to City Park, the Botanic Garden or up and down Cherry Creek). Food and drink from the establishments in and around Union Station was spectacular.Hotel staff were very friendly and responsive.We enjoyed the destination amenities, which is a $20 fee tacked on to your bill (I think per person per day, but I don't really want to know) that grants you a coffee, ice cream, beer once a day, some shopping discounts, and a few other perks. This was like the adult version of the Paw Passes our kids made us buy at the Great Wolf Lodge last month. This package helped us get to know the hotel better and gave us something fun to do, but when the room rate is already over $400, learning about this fee at check-in was a bit of a hit. OK, the destination amenities package also covers the car service (awesome Tesla rides within a 2 mile radius) and wifi, but charging for these is a technicality.My complaints would be about guest room comfort. The hallways upstairs were harshly lit (probably older LED bulbs) and to me smelled a bit of tobacco. Our room seemed pretty small for the luxury price point. The bed was up against the wall so one person had to clamber in from the foot of the bed—I guess this is what rail car roomettes are like. One ad I saw for the hotel mentioned the rooms are all ""soundproofed"", which to me should be a given, and I wondered what made them want to underline this point. Sure enough, the people in the room next door could be very clearly heard through the communicating door (with both doors closed). We could hear them watching Animal Planet at 12:30 a.m. (which is 1:30 a.m. Central Time. Did you know that the beaver builds dams with sticks that it gathers from its environment?), snoring and just breathing. Night manager Sean was kind enough to ask them to turn down the TV but they didn't really do it. This is America, watching TV all night is legal but the neighbors shouldn't have to hear it or turn on a white noise machine just to get some rest. We asked to be moved but the hotel was said to be full.Our Voss mineral water was present on check-in but not replenished (there is more in the fitness center), the iPad was a bit fluky (white noise app actually crashed constantly but we had our own) and we had to call about a clogged toilet. The model of Nespresso machine they've installed makes great coffee with a professional head of crema on it, but is super loud; vide supra.Bottom line, the Crawford Hotel has a great location, plugs you into the hipster vibe and is a gateway to fun amenities. Room comfort was about the same as a cheaply built chain hotel at triple the price. We would stay there again if we could have some assurances about our neighbors (e.g., if traveling with another couple) or if thicker doors were to be installed.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford is truly a unique experience with hidden charges,"The Crawford is very conveniently located downtown.  The staff bend over backwards to be pleasant.  We had a loft room which was unique and pleasant.  You are only 4 blocks from Coors Field.  The Farmers Market is located on the front apron on Saturdays.  They say you can check in after 4:00 pm.  They are serious that you cannot check in until after 4:00 pm.  They want you out by 11:00 am.  They are serious about you being out by 11:00 am.There is no parking except Valet.  $45 per day to Valet park.  No choice.  You can try to find a public parking garage somewhere close. Not a good choice.They charge you $20 per day for amenities.  That gets you one free craft beer each from the hotel bar, but only between 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm.  They said that they used to give you $5 off a well drink but it got too expensive for them.  You get one free scoop of ice cream each.  But the ice cream store does not open until 11:00 am.  So if you want ice cream you may need to eat it with your beer.  You get one cup of coffee each.An excellent hotel!  But, watch those hidden charges.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Interesting Concept,"The concept of the hotel within a functioning train station is a cool one!  And the location really is great, central to everything. And though I didn't travel with kids, I think it would be great for families.  My personal opinion on the design, though, is that they took the period piece a little too far and should have punched up the colors to make it less drab - I don't think it feels luxe to be in a room that feels like a converted government office, complete with depressing yellow lighting.  The shower was great, though bathroom overall was cramped. Overall, for proximity to restaurants, etc - great, service - great, luxury/design - ok.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,So beautiful and unique ,"A bustling gorgeous hotel above Union Station.  Tons of things to do, tons of things to eat and drink. Easy walk to Coors Field. Stayed on the 4th floor in a very pretty room, bed was comfortable.  Shower amazing! Service staff cleaned when we were out. I highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Classic Location; Excellent, Focused Customer Service","We stayed at the Crawford, went to a Rockies game, which was a couple of blocks away, and enjoyed the activity in the center of Denver.  I was concerned that it might be noisy since the hotel is based in the historic and continuing train station.  Absolutely no noise problem and truly excellent customer service from the front desk.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique and historic!,"What a cool hotel inside a restored train station!  The lobby is the old train station, which is adjacent to the actual working train station. Cute shops all around (the ice cream shop is amazing and the coffee shop is wonderful). Our room had high ceilings and some old fashioned features, but feels new and fresh and modern.  The Nespresso machine in the room was a hit, and the beds were comfy. Took the light rail to and from the airport (and elsewhere) without incident. I would certainly stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique setting in a great location,"We stayed at the Crawford in December and thoroughly enjoyed the Christmas atmosphere.  Loved the downtown location and didn't even have to leave the station when the weather got bitter cold outside. Several restaurants, bars, and quaint shops to peruse.  Great location for shopping too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Niche Hotel,"This is a very interesting hotel in the Denver Union Station, actually a working rail station. In additional to the hotel, it has retail and some food options.  The lobby is bustling. The room are very well appointed and comfortable.  However, this was not what I expected in terms of service.Prior to my stay, I attempted to contact the concierge for dinner reservations. There is not number on the website, so I sent and email to the only listing, reservations, with my request.  It was never answered. During my stay, I called the Guest Services number on the in room phone. My call was not picked up. Room service has a very limited menu and the food is quite average. All orders are placed on an in room iPad. So, any particulars or modification were not made (an egg on the side, a substitution).  Delivery is more like Post Mates than in room dining. Paper containers and plastic cutlery. No water is included. There is not a newspaper delivered to the room.I would recommend the hotel and may stay there again. However, it is not like some hotels I stay in. The Crawford does not have the level of personal service of most fine hotels and it is difficult to make contact with a human for requests like restaurant recommendations or reservation and calling the valet to have the car ready.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing hotel! ,"My husband and I won a night's stay at The Crawford Hotel through a silent auction, and decided to celebrate our first anniversary there. We live in Denver and have been to Union Station many times, but wow, this hotel is really something special. Historic and ""old timey"", yet modern and posh. Our room was gorgeous and beyond comfortable (as was the claw foot tub!), and the amenities were plentiful (free coffee, ice cream, beer, guaranteed seating at Cooper Lounge, Snooze room service, etc... the list goes on!). Cannot say enough good things about this hotel, we will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Super Hotel,"I've stayed here a couple of times and love it.  Their small room, I think it's called the Pullman is cozy but very nice.  The station lobby downstairs is animated with good food and drink options.     This was the first time I took the train from DEN Airport.  It was cool rolling off the train and right into a room; no taxi, no rental car.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exceptional!,"What a wonderful experience!  So glad to have chosen the Crawford! Everything about it was great - location, customer service, and especially the uniqueness of being in Union Terminal!  Loved it - wish we could have stayed longer!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An amazing stay - you could spend the whole weekend right here!,"The Crawford was amazing - such a great place to stay.  The rooms were lovely and the amenities were unbeatable! You could literally eat and drink your way through the whole weekend at Union Station - such cool restaurants and bars and they give you vouchers for free coffee and ice cream!  We ate at Mercantile, Toast and the Cooper Lounge and all were delicious.  It's also a great location - a perfect starting point to explore the whole city.  We can't wait to go back and highly recommend it to others.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to stay,"A great place to stay, especially if you are traveling west on Amtrak. Friendly staff, and quiet rooms with character. You can watch trains, people or enjoy all that the adjacent mall has to offer. The free MallRide will take you up and down the 16th Street Mall.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Quick work trip, highly accommodating hotel in the middle of the downtown scene.",Rooms are great. Staff is friendly. Very unique hotel with daily coffee and ice cream for free at the parlor shops in union station. Good workout facility. Walking distance to everything downtown or in the highlands.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,So much to do!,"This is a perfect place to stay for a Rockies game!  It's within walking distance of the stadium.  There was everything I needed within the station, really no need to go elsewhere for anything.  Lots of extras were included in the price of the room:  free drinks, free ice cream, 20% of many of the restaurants.  The room was beautiful and very comfortable.  I would definitely book this hotel again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,loved this hotel!,"So many great things about this hotel - ease of getting there from the hotel (A line), the bustling train station lobby with lots of food options, power stations, locale and beauty.  But the rooms are wonderful - high ceilings, nicely decorated, large bathrooms, robes, etc.  And great service.  I'd love to go back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Good if travelling on AMTRAK, otherwise go elsewhere","Helpful desk staff especially Tara and Paulette.Hotel is built into train station and thus convenient if travelling on AMTRAK's California Zephyr.  But over-priced and under-serviced otherwise.  Not 5* as claimed.  More liked 3+*.Specifically:  They try to charge you $20 per day extra as an Amenity Fee for what most hotels now have as basic amenities, e.g: wifi, 800 service, local phone calls, in-town shuttle, etc, etc.  But for this extra $20 per day you get 1 ""free"" beer and 1 ""free"" ice cream --- even if you are a non-drinker and are observing a weigh loss diet!  Other disappointments:  No bellhops to help with baggage;  No curbside taxi access (not good in rain or snow); Out 8 stalls in Ladies toilets in basement 2 had no locks on doors and 2 were otherwise Out-Of-Service; Inexperienced clerk on duty at 11 p.m. on a Saturday; you have to pay 40 cents per day as a Union Station Historic Preservation Fee.  Not Nice!On a positive note: Comfortable bed; Good housekeeping; interesting architecture; good fish feedery adjacent; Food Court type eatery in lobby; You can get out of the $20 Amenity Fee if you protest enough.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Couples Getaway,"My husband and stayed at the Crawford for a long-weekend and had a great time.  It's in a great location, within steps from a train which goes directly to the airport, as well as restaurants and bars.The hotel itself is in the train station -- but I didn't notice any outside noise despite that.Two points off for the lack of blackout shades and the lack of room service.I could have done without the ""resort"" fee too -- I'd happily have given up the scoop of not-very-good ice cream for it.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,So Worth the Splurge,"Wow.  Sensory overload and so much attention to detail at the same time are tough to finesse but this place has accomplished it perfectly.  Union Station has so much to offer, yet its easy to pass the hours away just people watching.  Prices are reasonable throughout the shops at Union Station, and the selections are top quality.  The Crawford Hotel may be a little pricey, but so worth the splurge for a night or 2.  The staff was amazing - customer service excellence!  With such a heavy crowd inside the main level at Union Station, I really liked that you had to use your room key to access other floors (to the hotel).   The room was very, very clean and comfortable with no amenity spared.  If you do decide to book your stay here, make a point of stopping by Cooper Lounge - a 3rd floor bar exclusive to hotel guests that gets an A= for service and selection. Still, there are so many great bars and restaurants within an easy walk of the hotel, and they also have a courtesy driver (in a Tesla!) ready to drop you anywhere within a 3 or 4 mile radius.  It was a little noisy at night in our room, but not enough to keep me awake.  The tram to the airport was $10 (very reasonable) and was so easy to jump on from the hotel.  The staff at reception not only held our bags for us after check out, but brought them to us right by the tram stop so we didn't have to haul it all ourselves.  Loved everything about this place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Mr.,The Crawford stands out among the independent boutique style hotels. It's staff and level of service is in the five star category. The rooms are all new construction and nicely appointed with hardwood floors and marble bathrooms while the common areas retained the original architecture but completely restored. My room came with an iPad to communicate with staff and make reservations. An interesting contrast to the pre-technology era in which the Union Station was built. Not an inexpensive hotel but well worth it if you want modern day luxuries coupled with old world charm.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Business Meeting,I have lived in CO since 1983 and am so impressed with the rebirth of Union Station.  The Crawford is a must see and use hotel facility inside Union Station surrounded by great restaurants and activities.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Extremely nice hotel,"We were very impressed with our room!  We always book nice hotels & this is one of the best.  First, they upgraded us without asking.  We had robes & an expresso machine waiting in the morning.  No need to go buy shampoo.  There are big bottles in the huge shower.  The train station is beyond beautiful.  There are people everywhere & it is wonderful to see this hub brought back to life.  It is extremely clean & private.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic place to stay!,"When I was searching for that special place to take my wife for our 50th anniversary in Denver, The Crawford kept coming to the top of my list.  The fact that it lives in the historic Denver Union Station, just a few blocks from Coors Field, were all major points for me, since we were taking the California Zephyr from Sacramento to Denver. The staff at the Crawford are AMAZING! Super attentive, friendly and very professional. I did splurge on one of the better rooms...which was spacious, full of great amenities with a great corner view of all the action outside. They found us some great restaurants and moved us around town to our destinations in the complementary Crawford Tesla! To top everything else off, when it came time to head to the airport for the flight home...the RTD airport light rail leaves for the airport, right outside the rear door of the hotel! Thanks to everyone at the Crawford! You folks are awesome!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Iconic hotel and location,"The Crawford hotel was recently restored and is beautiful. The location in lower Denver (LODO) at Union Station makes for convenient walking to everything. The station itself has many amenities and restaurants, while nearby to local shopping and museums and parks. The hotel even offers complimentary car service within a 2 mile radius. Above all was the treatment by each and every one of the staff. You are addressed by name and always asked how your stay is going, with recommendations for us tourists. We would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic place to stay for Amtrak travelers - or anyone else wanting a great experience in LoDo,"Wow. How do we even start.  My wife and I were on a cross-country Amtrak journey, with overnight stays in NYC, CHI, DEN, and SFO (at the end of the trip). The Crawford was the most expensive of all the hotels (including NYC and CHI - where we had great rooms) and still definitely worth it. It is so convenient to the train station and everything else downtown Denver has to offer, including the 16th Street shuttle bus.  Rooms are modern, and cool, and the staff is unbelievably friendly and helpful. Denver has done a great job turning Union Station into a jewel, and the Crawford is the center diamond. They even have a Tesla for free shuttle service within 2 miles, though we didn't even need that because of the great (free) public transportation options in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Do it!  You deserve it:),"Why The Crawford?  Well...besides treating yourself and friend to a friendly, beautiful establishment that is perfectly located for travel and fun in Denver, the fact remains that occaisional self indulgence is good medicine!The room was grand and the tub rocks!  An amazing shower is also there.  An espresso machine that starts your morning perfectly is a good thing.Go ahead ..treat yourself!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Miserable 65th B-Day,"stayed here 2 nights in room 433 the LODO Suite for my husbands 65th B-Day which was mentioned when I made the reservation. Checked-in pleasant and efficient. Bellman took us to us to our room and dropped off bags and left. No showing us around. No special treat. Notified desk on way out to dinner. Came back, no treat, no turndown, no robes, towels or slippers. Next day went to gym (located in basement) and shopping Again spoke to desk. Returned several hours later, no treat, no cleaning of room,no towels only bed made. Went to front desk and requested a manager. Explained to Paulette what was going on. She apologized, said things would be taken care of and offered money off for the previous day. We went on a food tour for 3 hrs. Came back. The trash had been taken out . This time brought Paulette to the room and showed her how filthy and no restocking. She again apologized, said things would get straight and wanted to know what we would like to do this evening, that she wanted to make things right. We said that we would just like to have a nice farm to table dinner. Paulette said that would be perfect, she would take care of everything to come to the hotel lobby at 6:20. We were taken to a wonderful restaurant and then presented with a bill. We called the hotel and whomever answered the phone said to pay the bill and the hotel will reimburse us. That of course is not happening. Be careful, these rooms are not being cleaned properly! No pampering here!",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Enjoyable Stay,"We just spent the weekend at this hotel to attend a wedding and celebrate our anniversary.  The hotel had inquired ahead of the stay about any special celebrations, and at check-in we were awarded a room upgrade and given two small bottles of bubbly.  Very nice welcome.  Arriving at this place from the airport on the light rail is the easiest hotel transfer ever and fabulously convenient.  You walk into a bustling station with restaurants and shops, which turns out to the hotel ""lobby"" itself.  The check in desk is tucked away in an alcove at one end.  It felt like this hotel was at the center of everything, and yet the room itself was quiet and comfortable.  Ours had a small sitting area and very high ceilings.  A bad faucet design kept the sink from draining properly, but that was the only room complaint.  Housekeeping came promptly, though for other guests we knew staying there it was non existent.  On Saturday we strolled through the farmer's market and watched the kiddies running through the splash pad.  You can walk  or ride share all over from here. I would definitely stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best date night ever!,"We live in the suburbs of Denver, and wanted a special date night out on the town.  Our stay at the Crawford was wonderful... massages at the Oxford spa, semi-private cocktails at the Cooper lounge, large, architecturally interesting room with a great bubble bath in our huge bathroom, and a lively vibe inside and outside the hotel.  Watched kids play in the fountains while we had an amazing bfast at Snooze.  This was just what the doctor ordered for 2 tired parents from the burbs!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Location,Cirque tickets and anniversary celebration ! Our son gave us a gift voucher for the Crawford.  It's a very cool location -  you can walk to any type of restaurant.  The staff is the best!  Check out ice cream at the MilkBox and coffee @ PigTrain - both were excellent. On Saturdays in the summer there's a Farmer's Market in the plaza out front to explore.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,True Revitalization!,"My husband and I stayed for a night to celebrate our anniversary. It was amazing! We remember Union Station ""before"" and our weekend experience was a true revitalization. We had great weather and really enjoyed all the things to do and experience while staying at the Crawford. Our loft room was gorgeous, spacious, and tastefully decorated. The service was wonderful. We loved the ""Denver's living room"" feel of the lobby of the hotel with all the different restaurants and shopping along with lounge space. It was absolutely stunning. We can't wait to go back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"History, Location and Quality at the Crawford","My 'other half' and I stayed at the Crawford this past weekend for three nights in one of the loft rooms on the 4th floor, which was different as it had wood beams and peculiar shaped ceilings.  Very comfortable room.  Can't fault anything about the hotel.  Hotel service and location to downtown Denver were both excellent.  Make sure to spend some time people watching while sitting in luxurious armchairs in the Union Station concourse and sipping on a cocktail or a cup of coffee.  The concourse is very interesting. Bars and restaurants in the Crawford all appear excellent although we only visited ""Snooze"" for breakfast, which gets very busy very early so make a reservation the night before.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"2nd time here, will be back! ","This is the 2nd time our family has stayed at the Crawford and we will definitely be back. At check-in, the friendly staff gave each of my daughters a Beanie Baby as a little welcome gift. So nice! The rooms are spectacular. I mean so well-designed, beautiful furniture, huge windows overlooking the front of Union Station, super high ceilings, gorgeous bathrooms. Since we have 2 young girls, we do spend quite a bit of time in our 2 adjoining rooms (to rest/nap) - so I appreciate a beautiful space in which to relax. We loved going down to the lobby area for ice cream, coffee, snacks, happy hour and just to people watch. The place is bustling. Then our girls had a blast playing outside in the huge water fountain. We spent an hour and a half playing in it one of the days!Huge bonus- since the hotel is located inside Union Station, we took the train direct to and from the airport. Kids are free so each way was $9 per person. It was so convenient and cheap. All in all we had a great stay would recommend the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Can't wait to go back!!,"My husband and I stayed for the first time about a week ago.  (Suite 314) Absolutely perfect execution from every direction! The front desk staff were welcoming, acted glad to have us, let us check in very early, surprised us with an upgrade, the room was impeccably clean, Merchantile restaurant is fantastic, location is perfect, and I could go on and on.Well done. We look forward to returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Was expecting better,"After spending the 5 nights prior in lodges in and around national parks, I was very much looking forward to our one-night stay at The Crawford. Of course the location cannot be beat - especially if you are arriving by train. The lovely front desk girl was professional and welcoming, upgrading us to a king room on the 4th floor. While on the surface the room seemed to be nice, there were several small things that made the experience less than lovely. The curtains do not adequately come together to block bright morning light from filtering through. The ipad would not work. There was a pretty thick layer of dust on the desk and tv stand. Several pieces of furniture had scrapes and nicks. There was not an outlet or USB ports on my side of the bed (which in 2017 seems like a must - doesn't everyone charge their phone overnight?). The giant chandelier in the room was clearly placed for aesthetics from the outside rather than inside functionality (minor gripe, but it honestly threw off the vibe of the room and looked dumb). Also, there was not proper spacing in between the night stand and the curtains - just poor design. Finally, I requested two additional foam pillows and was brought feather instead. Each of these things alone is not a big deal, but combined, they just left me feeling ""meh"" about our stay.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A great spot for anyone who loves trains.,"We reached Denver at the end of a vacation that included an overnight stay on an Amtrak Train.  We'd seen the hotel above the Amtrak Station a year ago when we traveled out of Denver by train.  This year we decided to stay.If you do not like the sound of trains, this may not be the place for you; but the sound of the trains during the night gave us the atmosphere of sleeping another night on the train only this time in absolute comfort.The lobby is right in Union Station, adding to the unique atmosphere.  Overlooking the train platform, the ""Pullman"" room was not large, but beautifully decorated and efficient.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Luxury Stay at Union Station,"I was travelling across the US by train, so what better place to stay in Denver than at the Crawford Hotel which is part of the Union Station complex. The room was very comfortable, I had a peaceful night's sleep and the shower was great. So much is happening around the station and at nearby Latimer Square that you really feel part of the Denver landscape. My room actually overlooked the main concourse, which was interesting, but I needed to remember to close the curtains when dressing.  The whole station was abuzz with activity so I really enjoyed my stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent hotel...would highly recommend to people and we will definitely be returning.,"My husband and I had a great time at the Crawford.  Its uniqueness is what initially attracted us to the place.  We loved that the lobby was also an actual Amtrak train station.  The quiet hustle and bustle was so fun.  The amenities and stores that inhabit the lobby were also quite stellar.  From the cordial, efficient bartenders at the Terminal, to the Pig and Whistle daily coffee...we loved it all.  The $20 additional ""destination fee"" was unexpected, but it turns out we loved the fact that we got a free coffee each, free scoop of ice cream each and two beers each, for each night that we stayed.  We ate at the Next Door, one of the eateries attached to the hotel...and was superb. Super friendly staff and the food was amazing.  The rooms were clean, and nicely decorated.  The hotel itself has a great location.  Easy access to everything.   Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique hotel experience in a great section of Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Nice, well located hotel.","This hotel offers valet parking and there are no realistic options. Valet parking is a substantial addition to the daily cost. When I commented to management about this surprising cost it was removed from my bill-fantastic! With this problem aside the hotel staff and management are extremely accommodating. The reception & lobby adjoin the train station waiting area with restaurants in this huge room-very unusual, but interesting. The guest rooms are large, quiet and have all the expected amenities. We will stay here again when we want to frequent lower ""LODO"".",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Grand Hotel in the Union Station,"My wife and I stayed overnight in the Crawford Hotel inside the newly, and excellently, renovated Union Station in downtown Denver. It was a fabulous experience all the way around. Our package included discounted valet parking and an excellent tour of the station's history and renovations, guided by Courtney who did a great job. Our room on the 3rd floor was spacious and had incredibly high ceilings, good closet space, and a very comfortable bathroom. All of the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly. Complementary downtown transportation was provided in the hotel's Tesla. Lastly, we particularly enjoyed drinks and wine at Cooper's Lounge, located on a balcony overlooking the station waiting room. In all, it was a wonderful experience for our anniversary and a visit we will repeat in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel in the heart of Denver,"LOVE this hotel and all of its unique amenities and services. Rooms are lovely, staff was friendly. Location is great - lots of restaurants and breweries near by. Close walk to art museums and the baseball field. But the restaurants, bars and shops off the common area of the hotel make it a really great stay. Love the free perks (cup of coffee, ice cream scoop, happy hour at The Terminal) that are built into your stay 1x per day. Almost gives you no reason to leave the building ;)There's action going on no matter what time you get in. Big communal area with good wi-fi if you need to hang out between check-out and departure too, especially nice for business travelers. Great mix of old meets new. Quirky and cool, a must-stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotel, great spot ","We just stayed at the Crawford Hotel for a work/couples getaway and it was a gem.  It is an old train station that has been converted into a hotel. You feel like you are in the center of everything. There are great perks that come with staying there. The bed was not our favorite, however, the room was really unique and special.We would not hesitate to stay here again in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellant Renovation,"Union Station was very nicely restored. We appreciate old buildings like this being redone. The Crawford Hotel rooms surround the main atrium - don't miss the stairwell with all the original blueprints!  There is a lovely lounge that we suggest for drinks and snacks - the ambiance is very classical but modern. The rooms are very well decorated and spacious. Union Station also has a few small shops and places to eat. Snooze had a great breakfast.  The only thing was evening dining was really limited. I would have liked a more traditional restaurant right there.  You can take the train from the airport straight to the hotel since it's in Union Station.  This area of downtown is right by the 16th street mall and lots of shopping and dining,",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Didn't Get Value for the Dollar,"Room 338, overlooking the train tracks.  My wife and I were expecting a truly quality experience, but we were disappointed.  The hotel location is excellent  However, small things do count when it comes to the actual hotel experience, especially in a supposedly top quality hotel.  The room finish was disappointing.  It looked nice on the surface, but the desk, cabinets, closet doors, etc. were made of cheap material covered in a formica-like overlay.  There was no toilet paper in the room.  The coffee maker was on top of the drawers in the closet, but there is no outlet in the closet.  The lower shelf under the restroom counter was covered in what must have been weeks of dust (and that's where your bathroom towels, etc. are kept.)  Overall, the room looked nice at first glance, but was inferior in many respects.  If you are looking for a quality hotel with quality in the room, this is not the place.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Another Terrific Stay!,"Over the past 6 months I have stayed at The Crawford Hotel 6 times. Wonderful rooms that are very clean with great amenities. The staff and management at the hotel are absolutely wonderful and highly customer-centric. The restaurants as well, including both Snooze for breakfast and the Mercantile for dinner are phenomenal. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance of other restaurants, galleries, and shopping. The value for the money is great. I would highly recommend staying at The Crawford!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Impressive,"I cannot write enough words to thank all of the staff at the Crawford Hotel. Held our East and West coast branch manager meeting at this hotel and not only did Kara Akers, the sales manager make sure i was within my budget but had definitely made an impression on how professional this hotel is.  From Chris Luersen keeping track of all our rooms and check-ins to Colleen Barrett doing a spectacular job at assisting me with anything i needed and without hesitation. I would like to also mention that our server Cesar was such a big help in assisting with IT issues to waiting on our every need.  To top it off their rooms are AMAZING! Im so very impressed with this hotel and the location I would love to plan future visits to Denver as long as i am staying at the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,​​​​Pleasant Venture (4/18 to 4/21),"The path and timing that myself and husband followed into Denver included remarkable accommodation and hospitality by Crawford Hotel staff members. We were impressed by the wide variety of amenities within our room and immediate hotel surroundings. The Crawford Hotel offered value-added assistance (thanks to Myles S. and colleagues) throughout our pleasant visit, given its top-quality services that transform initial travel experience from commuter rail convenience to customer-centric concierge priority.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Trendy and fun!,"We unfortunately missed our connection to Hawaii and had to overnight in Denver. We chose the Crawford based on Trip Advisor reviews and it did not dissapoint!  It's in a recently revamped area downtown, in a train station. There are several very cool restaurants, bars and shops in the station and the vibe is as trendy as it gets.  I want to plan to return!  It was fantastic and helped us turn lemons into lemonade!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautifully Restored Train Station Into A Unique Hotel. A Wonderful Place For A Special Birthday Celebration,"We made reservations for this hotel 6 months in advance in preparation for a very special birthday celebration road trip. After arrival at the Denver airport and renting a car, we arrived within 30 minutes to this unique hotel. After valet parking we entered the atrium of the hotel and were amazed at the beauty. The restoration of this train station is amazing. Check in was very pleasant, with friendly staff that quickly checked us in and offered cold water and an amenities card that offered 2 free Craft Beers at the Terminal Bar, 2 Ice-cream scoops from the Creamery and 2 coffees from the Pigtrain Coffee Shop. The arrival experience was perfect.Our stay was in a Premium Loft room that was charming and very unique, with beautiful exposed wooden beams and brick.  The bathroom was very large with both a claw tub and a 2 head shower. The sitting area was comfortable with sofa  and TV, and the king bed with 4 pillows was extremely comfortable. The butler area included a small armoire with robe and slippers, a small fridge and safe, and espresso coffee maker.The location of the hotel is ideal for walking the downtown/Coors field LoDo area. Many restaurants and bars to chose from, as well as shopping. We took advantage of the free 16th street mall tram that drives the length of the mall with stops at each block, and runs every few minutes. Several brewpubs are close, including the Wynkoop brewery up one block, which has great beer and wings.We took advantage of late checkout, which was quick and pleasant,  to continue our road trip travels. This hotel was a perfect choice where to begin.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fabulous Experience!,"This is a beautiful hotel with many entertainment options including coffee shops, specialty stores, restaurants and bars. Perfectly located at Union Station! Exceptional service especially from Front Office Manager Marie! Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Ideal place- filled with thoughtful touches,Not cheap and totally worth it.  The staff was amazing...the room  came with a free ice cream cone and a chauffeured car.  The suite  was cozy and idiosyncratic.  I loved the lobby.  The location was perfect- off the train and into the lobby.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Christmas Week at The Crawford,"We spent the week before Christmas at The Crawford Hotel and it was just like being at home!  We have stayed here many times before and each time we are reminded of why we continue to come back!  The staff makes everything so wonderful.  They are always so welcoming and accommodating.  The Christmas decorations were amazing and so tastefully done. The amenities are always superior!  Our favorite part about staying here is that we can walk out of our room and take advantage of all the restaurants and shops without leaving the building. The rooms are always fresh, quiet and so comfortable! Everyone and everything at The Crawford is just simply the best!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Peaceful Oasis from Downtown Area ,"If you're a history buff you'll love this place- The Crawford has reimagined all the hustle and bustle of train traveling from 100 years ago with the modern amenities of today. Nestled right in the heart of downtown at Union Station, this hotel inside the lobby is full of frenetic energy including the Amtrak station (which has cars going out daily). The rooms and hallways are completely soundproof however and bathrooms are beautiful with large shower and soaking tub.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Place to Stay!,"My husband and I wanted to take in a couple of San Francisco Giants games and found that the Crawford Hotel is within close walking distance to Coors Field.  We loved the whole atmosphere in which the Crawford is located--The Union Station terminal with its great shops, restaurants, and boutiques.  Our room was clean and overlooked the light rail station, but did not hear any noises from the trains coming and going. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  We also had enough time to walk in the March for Science in downtown Denver, which was both fun and, we felt, sent an important message to the current administration. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Weekend Stay!,"Union Station is fabulous! Staying here was so much fun. Lots of action and people-watching all day. We took advantage of the lobby/station set-up: had coffee in the mornings, ice cream there as a snack, happy hour beers, late night drink at the upstairs bar (Cooper's), morning reservations at the diner! The hotel adds on a surcharge for a bunch of ""freebees"" that we took advantage of, but I think they should add this into the room rate and then call it ""free.""",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfection! ,"Stayed for one night in this amazing hotel! It was vibrant, historic, and fun! We were given a bottle of water at check in. We arrived well before the 4:00pm check in time. They called us when our room was ready. The room was gorgeous and very quiet. We enjoyed the free drink at happy hour, ice cream, and coffee. People watching at Union Station is always fun! It's a great location next to restaurants and shopping. The staff treated us like valued guests. We will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,luxury boutique,"Room - wonderful, but really badly needs a table and a chair for people who travel for business like me. It was uncomfortable propping myself on 2 cushions atop an ottoman just to reach typing height for a small 'table' that was really meant solely for decorative purposes next to the door. The door of the business centre's rooms lock behind you when you leave - so you can't really use the restroom because if you do, you have to go back to reception (which is on another floor) and ask them to let you back in with a key. Cleanliness - hairs and soap stains in the 'clawfoot' bathtub, the main reason why I paid the exorbitant fees to stay in this hotel. The drain plug of the bathtub is difficult to manoeuvre and has a sharp metallic rim. I cut my thumb trying to unplug the bathtub after having a bath - beware! All of the sheets and towels smell like honey. I can't describe how special and wonderful this made me feel. I am going to try and buy some honey-flavoured laundry detergent when I get home to emulate this. The rainfall showerhead directly overhead was amazing. I really appreciated the generous water pressure. It was so relaxing I took the guilty pleasure of returning to my room at lunchtime just to have a shower - sorry Denver, I hope I didn't deplete your water supplies! My room was located behind a sealed door along a quiet corridor away from the main pedestrian area of Union Station. My room was very quiet and even for a fussy, light sleeper like me, the sleep quality was exceptional. The manager (I think her name is Kristin) was firm but very gracious when I turned up 1 day late. I mixed up the date of my arrival in Denver. My room was sold to another person, and I was charged a fair 1 night's fee for not turning up. She then personally walked me to the Crawford's sister hotel the Maven about 2 blocks away to see that I got checked into somewhere for the night. Much appreciated! Location - very, very convenient. This hotel is located amidst the trendiest parts of town. Lower Downtown (LoDo) is to the south along 16th / 17th street, and Lower Highland (LoHi) is a short 15-minute walk to the north across the highway and river passes (very, very trendy). Bars and restaurants were abundant, pricey but often tres chic. The nicest part of town (Cherry brook or Cherry something) was only a 15-minute Uber ride away - wonderful shopping there. Jazz club (Nocturne) - amazing, and the Crawford's free 2-mile radius car service took me there within 10 minutes' drive. Same goes for the Denver Center for Performing Arts (wonderful, highly professional and impressive local and international talent), and the LoDo comedy venue (I forget the name). The Crawford made my memory of Denver a very memorable and treasured holiday. Thank you! Free ice cream everyday - YAY!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top Notch!,"Beautiful hotel! The location is perfect just steps from Light Rail to Airport, Coors Field, an array of eateries, and Union Station (actually IN Union Station).  The staff is hospitable and accommodating. Convenient to riverfront running. Great selections of beverages at hotel bar. Highly recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,one night more please,"Really great stay, put in for (and received) an upgrade to the Superior Loft. Amazingly quiet and serene given the constant activity in the great main hall there. Room was wonderfully appointed, food in Union Station is amazing, and lots of great stuff around there. Have stayed all over Denver, and there are no shortage of nice places, but this one easily is my favorite. Front desk staff wonderful and helpful throughout.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome hotel but......,"First off, this is a fantastic, trendy hotel in vibrant location. If you want quiet serenity, this is not the place. Plenty of people and nightlife right downstairs. Front desk was awesome, super friendly. Room was modern with nice furnishing, high ceilings bathroom was great with good amenities. I would recommend higher floor since it is an open air concept in that you walk out of your room and can see down into the station/atrium. In the evenings, it can get quite noisy.  Love the daily free ice cream. It was delicious. Shoe shiny right off the elevator bay and Snooze Restaurant for breakfast was fantastic. So you ask, with all the positive comments why the 4 out of 5 stars?  Housekeeping is failing this hotel. I'm not sure if the person who stayed before me had a hair loss problem but I found hair in the shower drain and in the sink. There was toilet paper in the toilet that was not flushed. Lastly, the kicker, I placed the ""Rest"" sign on the door, it's the do not disturb sign, and still housekeeping entered my room and went about their business. The do not disturb sign is up for a reason!  Had the bathroom been clean and housekeeping honor the sign hanging on the door, this hotel would def be a 5 star.  Would I stay here again, absolutely. I hope next time they get the housekeeping situation all figured out.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful and perfect,"I was in Denver on business and stayed in a Pullman room.  The train station was outside my window but I never heard any noise.  It was quiet and peaceful.  The room was impeccably clean and comfortable.  The lobby area was beautiful and Snooze is the perfect breakfast spot.  The food was perfect and the staff was very friendly.  My only complaint is, I didn't get to stay longer!  I will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Moving to the right side of the Tracks,"My husband and I flew into Denver to surprise our daughter who lives there. The hotel where we originally planned our 4 day stay, was not very satisfactory and just across the tracks from them was the Crawford. We called to see about availability and spoke with the delightful, Cassidy who invited us to stop by and check out the rooms. What can I say? EXCEPTIONAL! Everything was outstanding. They are in the coolest location. The room we checked into was beautiful with floor to ceiling windows, super airy with great views and fun for people watching. The bathroom was very spacious and while my husband appreciated the rain shower I was in heaven with the claw-foot tub.  We used their car service several times and the gentlemen who drove us were very professional and charming unfortunately I can only remember Riley's name.Every day I checked in with the front desk for one reason or another and everyone was very kind, courteous and helpful. Their concierge gave us excellent restaurant recommendations.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The best of the best of the best,"Fantastic old hotel, updated but definitley not losing its charm.  Came in for Business - flew top Denver and took the new train from airport to hotel.  Winning!! The hotel is centrally located in downtown Denver, close to shops, restaurants, and of course the ballpark.  The train statyion has many eating establishments and bars.  The rooms are incredibly nice, I will surely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great place to stay,"This hotel is right next to the train station and bus station which is convenient when your traveling. The rooms are very nice and quiet even though downstairs is full of life. There are many  restaurants that  are so close.  You do pay a destination fee of $20 but you get free ice cream, beer and coffee and more discounts.  It is a great place to stay.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel, Very cute!,My boyfriend and I had a great time while staying here. Being in Union Station and enjoying the surrounding restaurants was great for our short stay in Denver! The bar at the Crawford had amazing drinks and a cool Gatsby feel to it.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautifully Restored Classic,"Stayed here for a New Year's eve trip with friends.  The rooms were beautifully restored and had every amenity we could ask for, the staff has very attentive in fulfilling our requests and answered all of our questions and recommendations for restaurants in the neighborhood. The setting in the train station is beautiful and every detail has been taken into account in creating a unique and lively space.  We finished our night out with great cocktails at the classic bar and had a delicious breakfast at Snooze, the next day.  Can't wait to go back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A romantic stay at an amazing venue,This hotel is vey new but is filled with a great deal of history and character.  One of the best parts of the hotel is the easy access to the swanky Cooper Lounge and the fab restaurants Mercantile and Stoic & Genuine.  Rooms are spacious and filled with rich decor.  Customer service is too not bc.  Get room service from Snooze!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Old World Elegance,"Really enjoyed my short, one-night stay at the Crawford. The hotel setting in the old Union Station has a unique feel. Makes you want to spend a night and then jump on the ""Flyer"" to California....The room had unique proportions but was well-appointed and elegant. The free coffee, ice cream and a happy hour brew were all nice touches. It was also very nice to have a driver available for quick transport back and forth to a meeting downtown. I'll plan to stay again on my next visit to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Hotel and Customer Service,"After a negative experience at the Crawford several years ago, Frederick responded to my three star Trip Advisor review and I reached out to him as per his request.  Ultimately, the hotel wanted to make it right and invited my husband and I back for two nights of our choice.  We opted to return in July 2016 (sorry for failing to write this sooner) for our anniversary and had a wonderful time.  The rooms are beautiful and the hotel is in the perfect location for enjoying all downtown Denver has to offer.  Knowing how much the hotel values its patrons just solidifies The Crawford Hotel as our ""go to"" hotel when staying downtown.  Excellent all around.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Outstanding Service,"Perfect location for those downtown for business or to party.Great restaurants and bars nearby, bus shuttle very close, light rail very close.Rooms are unique and very nice.Staff beyond good.The restaurants downstairs are fantastic.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Urban Staycation Done Right!,"We opted to stay in town and enjoy some amazing restaurants--couldn't have picked a better hotel to base ourselves.  Awesome room in an historic building. Wonderful service and amenities for days! See attached photo for the list of benefits.  And I encourage you to use them... the car (Tesla) service is delightful (thank you, Myles) & the ice cream is yummy.The rooms are equipped with a rain shower head and the water pressure to make it awesome. Comfy robes, Nesprssso coffee maker and beautiful design make the room a delight to come back to.Th restaurants are all great but ""Mercantile Provisions"" and ""Stoic & Genuine"" are the must visits. Also the ""Cooper Lounge"" was fabulous!Finally, take an hour and take the history tour of the building. Delightful Michael was a superb guide. Gorgeous hotel with a fantastic staff!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Helpful, well pri.ced, well situated","Having not been to Denver before, and wanting to get a little acclimatized before Aspen and skiing, this seemed like a good spot to spend a couple of days somewhere new.At the time, this hotel was new and boutique style which suited what we were looking for.We were not disappointed either. Well appointed split level suite, dark for the most part at night, although a skylight in the bathroom with a opaque door may be problematic during the summer.All the team on hand were very helpful from the curbside to the room.  Comfy bed, decent TV offerings, able to play my own media too, a great stay, and recommended hotel for this town",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Perfect location, Amenities Unnecessary.","Pros: Location, location. Incredibly easy access via train from the airport; in LoDo at the beginning of the 16th Street Pedestrian Mall and easy walks to Larimar Square, the Capital area, the Denver Art Museum, the Rino district, Coors Field and several wonderful restaurants. Union Station serves as the lobby and is lively all day and much of the evening. Take care not to trip over charging cords stretched from tables and sitting areas across walkways to outlets. The security staff is friendly and helpful. Our room was good sized, very clean and extremely quiet. Hotel front desk staff and drivers were very nice and helpful, especially Dominic and Cameron.Cons: The daily $20 amenity fee is excessive and unnecessary. The fee far exceeds the costs of the so called amenities offered.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great time!,"Location was fantastic, took the train into Denver The Crawford is in the renovated Union Station.  Rooms are clean and quiet.  Great amenities at the Station, great food, great bar and perfect for setting off on Denver adventures.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location,We had an overnight stay with grandsons.  The hotel is beautiful and the ambience of Union Station is lovely.  Room was very clean and quiet.  Nice shower with waterfall shower head and lots of pressure.  Extra measures taken to provide security for upper floors.  Breakfast at Snooze was great and as a hotel guest you can make an advance reservation for a very busy breakfast place.  Hotel provides car service rides within two miles - in a Tessa no less.  Look forward to a future stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Location is the only reason to stay,"This hotel is just above an amazing destination in Denver, Union Station. There are great restaurants, vibrant bars, and constant activation. The hotel itself is just ok. Amenity products are poor, sliding bathroom door looks cool but is not great functionally, and there is little attention to detail. There are better hotels in Denver, but it is worth it for the location alone. The resort fee is annoying but forces you to go try a few places like the ice cream shop - so maybe it's not so bad.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unlike Any Hotel I've Stayed At Before,It was a different experience mostly because it was a combo hotel and train station but that added to the charm and uniqueness. Everyone was friendly and they gave me a free room upgrade. It was a marvelous stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great stay,"We arrived very late for our stay and was greeted promptly and let eight in. The staff was very helpful with checking in and the offered a car service the next day. The room was incredible-2 bathrooms, huge bathtub, comfortable bed-reminded me of a mountain chalet!highly recommend staying",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A different kind of hotel--in a good way!,"A hotel inside a bustling train station?  I had no idea what to expect, but based on good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I was not disappointed. My deluxe loft room overlooked the train tracks not the station interior, and it was very spacious and comfortable. I did not hear any station noise, just a train whistle or bells once in a while. Very quiet. The only thing I did not like about the room was that it was dark.  There was only a small, very high window, which kept the sound out, but didn't let much light in.  The room lighting helped, but I prefer natural light. I suspect the non-loft rooms are better in this regard. Hotel staff was amazing, and although you do pay a daily ""fee,"" there are some bonuses to staying here, including free ice cream. Great location for everything--take the train from the airport, and it drops you off here. 16th street mall shuttle is free and stops at the corner.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Only Place to Stay In Denver,"Loved! Loved! Loved staying at the Crawford. The revamp to Union Station is just incredible ... think airy modern art deco. While still an active train station you don't really get lost in that hubbub, instead the lobby feels more like a giant atrium with restaurants, bars and coffee shops at your disposal. Location is hard to beat as you're in the trendy LoDo neighborhood, with lots of things in walking distance. Hotel staff was super accommodating from arranging free Tesla rides to dinner to letting us have a late checkout so we didn't have to change our plans. Highly recommended and definitely will stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Hands Down THE Best!!!,"This is my first time staying at The Crawford Hotel, which is conveniently located at the newly redone Union Station. From when I first set foot in the hotel to when I departed, the service and facilities were incredible! I arrived quit early and had the pleasure of being checked in with Tara. Tara could have not been more accommodating. She informed me that there were two different room types available with 2 beds. Once corner room was ready, but there was a loft style room that was going to be a little bit of a wait. I decided to wait, and boy was the wait worth it! She immediately asked if I would like to store any luggage, which I did. After having lunch, I then came back to check on the status of the room. They were just finishing up the room and it was going to be a a few more moments. This is when I decided to take the hotel courtesy car to the store. The Telsa was immediately available to pick me up. The driver (my apologies I have misplaced his name) could not have been nicer! We went to one store where he then waited for me! After that there was one other thing I needed, and without a hesitation, took me to one more store and waited AGAIN! I was thoroughly impressed. Once arriving back at the hotel, I stopped by the Front Desk to check on my room. It was ready, they had already taken my bags up to the room, and put my beverages in the refrigerator!! The room could not have been nicer. The dark hardwood floors, the exposed wooden beams and brick walls really made the room have a homey feeling. Then within 10 minutes of being in the room, i received a phone call from the front desk asking how the room was and if there was anything they could do to make it better. Again, I was just floored on the level of service. They way the staff had been anticipating my needs really made my stay!Throughout the rest of my stay, it was just one pleasure after another. Lauren and Paulette at the Front Desk could not have been more accommodating and nice. Their never ending attention to detail really made my stay memorable. Working for a top tier hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, I can be VERY picky and cannot help but critique. I have to say this was the FIRST time that I did not have anything negative/reconstructive to say at all. The service, the facility, and overall vibe of this hotel is absolutely impeccable! You would be doing yourself a disservice if you chose anywhere else to stay!This will be the only place I stay when traveling to the Mile High City!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel Stay during our Spring Break Vacation,"This hotel is AMAZING.  Based on all of the favorable comments from other visitors my girlfriend, college daughter, and my 16 year old son decided to book a night's stay during our 5 nights in Colorado.  We booked 2 hotel rooms (double beds in their room a king size in ours).  We honestly wished we had spent more days in Denver and specifically at this hotel.  The renovation work and the historical touch and feel of this hotel is off the charts.  We took so many great pictures from the first and second floor.  The rooms were spacious, well decorated and the wood interior beams added so much character.  The beds were super comfortable and I had my best sleep in it throughout my vacation.  The architect (Dana Crawford) who fought to preserve this building is a legend for her work in downtown Denver and with other buildings and we were so impressed with her work that we had to google her and we ended up purchasing one of the books about the history of the hotel.The front receptionists were kind and friendly and immediately made us feel welcome.  They explained a number of extra perks and amenities we received as guests including free beers, free ice cream, and the use of a TESLA CAR at NO CHARGE with a driver to take us anywhere around downtown.  That alone was worth the cost of the hotel.  We were chaufferred around town including the downtown mall, the Art Museum, several restaurants and the Pepsi Center for the Nuggets game.  The staff was knowledgeable and eager to recommend places to visit.  If you use the TESLA, make sure you tip the drivers.  Its the least you can do for the experience of driving around in a Tesla, at no charge. I would HIGHLY recommend this luxury hotel.  One small exception-- do not use the complimentary razors given at the front desk.  It is worse than shaving with sandpaper.  For the prestige that it carries, I would much rather that they sell a good razor rather than provide a complimentary one that is of no use.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing!! Beyond comparison!,"In town just to visit and the room and amenities are unbeatable. Very clean and a bathroom to die for! The luxury rooms are amazing while still holding on to the historic value of the building. The building really has everything you need, plus right in the center of everything!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wow - best room anywhere!,"We were fortunate to be able to use the Crawford Suite, a most beautiful and luxurious space - in fact, I can't imagine any room, anywhere, being finer than this.  We had stayed in a Pullman room when we were in Denver before; it was nice but quite small. This had an elegant living/dining area with powder room and a very large bedroom.  Its bathroom had the finest of fixtures including a claw-foot tub. Large windows overlooked the train tracks, but the room was soundproof.  All the staff we encountered were amazing.  When we had trouble using the Nexpresso machine in the Butler's Pantry, Housekeeping brought instructions as well as a Keurig machine. Our check in and out were speedy, friendly, and seamless.  As you would expect, everything in the room was spotless and comfortable.  We were taking an early-morning Amtrak from the station, so the location was perfect.  A light rail runs from the airport to Union Station, which made getting to the hotel quick, easy, and inexpensive.  Union Station's surrounding area is a vibrant place and you can find any type of cuisine within walking distance. If you are looking for a very special stay, The Crawford is the place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Nailed it,"This is the spot. The location, the amenities, the vibe, the staff. I live in Denver and got put up at this hotel for the weekend. It made for a luxurious vacation in my own city. Being in and around Union Station is such a treat and the rooms at the Crawford are soooo nice. Super high ceilings, cool art, mattresses that are way better than my own...had a blast. Can't wait to go back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"An Experience, not just a bed.","I had a conference in Denver but wanted to stay someplace special to show off Denver to an out of town colleague.  The Crawford was the PERFECT choice.  The staff is amazing - efficient and courteous.  We stayed in one of the loft rooms and it was charming, unique and extremely well appointed.  As part of our ""Art and History"" package, we were given a personal tour (set according to our schedule) by Mike, who was fantastic.  We enjoyed several perks from the Union Station businesses - including a free coffee, a free scoop of ice cream and priority seating at Snooze for breakfast.  The Copper Lounge was top notch.  The drinks were prepared with precision and presented in the most elegant manner - we were wowed!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hotel.  Can't wait to go back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Weekend away with Girlfriends,"The location of this hotel is perfect.  Right in the middle of the LoDO area with all of the shopping and great restaurants.  Very clean and well appointed.  I loved the vibe of the Union Station Terminal.  The shops and eateries in the station are fantastic.  Also, taking the A Line train in from the airport could NOT be easier.  $9 each way directly to the station/ hotel.  Very convenient!Would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, quirky room","This hotel is definitely centrally located!  Right in Union Station actually.  It's a little weird to walk into a train station to check into your hotel, but it was just fine.  I was staying in a ""loft room"" when I was there, so it was the top floor, a very large room, very comfortable.  The only thing that I thought was a little odd was that there was just one window, and it was at the end of the hallway entrance next to a table.  There was a step down into the actual room where the bed/closet/etc are, and there was no window there...so it was a bit of a cave.  But it was clearly very recently redone, so it was beautiful and comfortable.  I like a light bright room, so I probably would try a different room next time.  Lots of great restaurants right in Union Station, and again great walking options.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Perfect ,convenient location","Stayed one night at the Crawford, overall ambiance was excellent. Great concierge, very accommodating Lots of places close by and inside Union Terminal to eat, have a drink and just people watch. Valet parking was a great service, which came in handy.My complaint of the hotel... the room wasn't as clean as I expected. Being in the hospitality business myself these are things I noticed:bathroom had hair on the floor, the shower had streak marks on glass, shower walls had stuff on them (wasn't sure if it was shampoo-conditioner-soap residue.) just had a dull look to it, and some things were dusty. The room had areas that needed dusting. I could be knit picking but since I'm in the business these are things I found the Crawford lacking. Bed was comfortable and lots of great amenities so it's worth staying at. Hopefully these things could be tweaked and I would gladly stay at The Crawford again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique, beautiful, outstanding","In a world full of cookie-cutter hotels, the Crawford is a refreshing change of pace. Constructed in the historic Denver train station, with shops and drinking establishments all around the inner lobby area, the Crawford is an interesting, beautiful, and comfortable hotel.  Our high-ceilinged room was lovely, and the staff was as outstanding as the station itself. We were greeted by very friendly front-desk people, led by the lovely and welcoming manager, Marie. And later, we were given a tour of the station itself by a young man named Mike, who regaled us with a history of the trains and the structure itself. His tour was first-rate, and I highly recommend it.  Centrally located, the Crawford has character and a unique charm. We enjoyed our stay immensely.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,This. Place!,"This place was EVERYTHING I was hoping for! The historic architecture, incredible design and comprehensive art programming knocked my socks off! From breakfast in bed, to drinks at Cooper Lounge, this place was amazing. So much romance, so much charm, and the SERVICE! When are we going back?!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Location,"I've stayed at quite a few hotels in Denver, but this is my favorite. The hotel is right in the heart of Lodo (Lower Downtown) district, and it's attached to the train station - the hotel lobby is the station. You can take a train directly from the airport to the hotel for only $9/person. The hotel is fun and beautiful. We stayed in the Loft rooms, and they are comfortable and unique. It's located in a great area. The 16th Street is within blocks of the hotel, so you can use the shuttle to get around. It's a great place to stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Everything you'd hope for in a luxury hotel plus unique setting,"We loved our stay at the Crawford. Everything we would hope for in a luxury hotel, and we loved the setting of Union Station with the stores, restaurants, bars and people watching - truly the 'living room of Denver' as Ms Dana Crawford imagined. The whole place is imaginative design and so well done.Loved the tour and Mr Mike the tour guide to tell us about the history and the renewal of Union Station.Great room, loved the bathtub and shower, hospitality and friendliness of staff, all of them.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Luxury Found!,"We stayed at the Beautiful Crawford Hotel for two nights celebrating 50 years of friendship! Both of us are Denver natives but my friend now lives in New Jersey so It was a perfect weekend to remember the good ol' days and be pampered by the most amazing staff. Our room had champagne to toast our occasion and a personal note welcoming us. We had the most amazing massage and facial at the Oxford spa which I will be returning to monthly... I was so impressed! The Oxford Hotel is a sister hotel to the Crawford and is right across the street where we had full access to the workout facilities and steam room. The beds were without a doubt the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the rooms were large and quiet. We loved watching the trains out our window! The bathroom was huge, had a clawfoot tub and two sinks and the shower had wonderful pressure. Union Station has so much history and we enjoyed being right in the middle of everything. There are many restaurants to choose from....Breakfast at Snooze is a great way to start the day and seafood at Stoic and Genuine for dinner was first class.Our late snack was at the ice creme shop.....SO delicious! We were given a coupon at check-in, so.... two cups with two scoops was free and so was coffee and bottled water!We went to a show at Temple Buell one night and Bellco Theatre the other.....both are within walking distance although we opted for the bicycle that pulls the carriage which we loved. The nightlife is non-stop and full of choices.........I wish we could have stayed longer! It was a perfect weekend!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Great Place to Stay,"With my attending a three-day conference being held in a meeting room at the Crawford Hotel, I experienced a wonderful room with all the amenities and a very personable and responsive staff at a terrific location in downtown Denver.  Taking the rail from Denver Airport directly to Union Station and just a short walk into a decorative and historic building, I enjoyed having lots of food and store options, along with close proximity to major restaurants in the area.  The hotel provided a driver to locations within a two-mile radius, which was most helpful.  It was a truly great place to stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent stay,Customer service was excellent.  Complimentary champagne for our anniversary.  Comfortable and beautiful room.  Convenient for taking the train from the airport.  A coffee and beer free each day at the terminal.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing venue!,Sometimes it's just reassuring to be someplace where people care about every detail and want it to be perfect. We were delighted with this beautiful hotel and every aspect of Union Station. The restaurants and bars are varied and great-you don't have to leave the building to have  a terrific weekend. Then they hung the whole center of this cavernous art deco space with lighted gossamer curtains for a wedding that must have been amazing. Tried to pass myself off as the bride to no avail. Staff in all venues over the top.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Funky and brilliant,"Best location possible.Marvellous, characterful rooms are interesting, luxurious, clean and homely.The staff are so helpful it's amazing.Courtesy car, whenever and wherever.The real ale at the Terminal Bar.I really, really loved this hotel",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great hotel, loud rooms","I booked this hotel due to its proximity to my meeting location and the rail line from the airport.  The hotel was very nice and the choices for food/etc in Union Station were great.  Tried two restaurants and they were both very good.  Front desk will even deliver takeout to your room.  Everyone was very friendly. Unfortunately, the doors that connect rooms are super thin and I could hear everything going on with the couple next to me.  my room also faced the rail station where there is a short street, and anyone walking along the sidewalk I could hear very clearly.  great hotel just needs lots of sound-proofing.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Near perfect,"I travel for a living and like many people who do, many of the properties I stay in seem to run together. It takes something special, or bad, to stand out when you work in the air and on the road. The Crawford is such a place. Full disclosure.....I'm a Denver native and spent a lot of time in lower downtown Denver before it became Lodo. At that time there were a select few establishments down here. The Oxford Hotel and the Cruise Room were part of the rotation and Union Station always stood guard over the landscape that had an edge to it in those ""early days"".Today most of the creative, independent places are gone and have been replaced by Chipotle's and Starbucks. The refurbishment of Union Station has created an island of unique and quality establishments in LODO with the Crawford playing a large role in that play. The idea of putting a hotel in the middle of a working train station is brilliant and it works very well. The furnishings and design are fantastic. 2 wonderful restaurants are located here. Perfect home base for visiting the city. Treat yourself, you will remember this fondly.I stayed here for a birthday. Staff could not have been better. Thank you.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lovely Experience not just a hotel! A Destination!,"Take train From Airport lobby is on your left.Enjoyed our room inside towards Station  No noise as others have stated Free Coffee, ice cream, beer, discounts on food.  All are part of your experience. Met Guy the Amtrak worker. Just funny and always cheerful.Close to many restaurants as well as many attached to Union Station Room a bit European in size yet tall ceilings helped Nespresso coffee in room a refrigerator and a safe Okay all was not perfect We had constant wifi problems. We were told that a new carrier was just started. It was annoying at times  Staff sent chocolates 🍫 as a sorry for the annoyance.One other issue our I pad did not work from check in until early AM on Friday on a Tuesday-Friday stay Techs tried for two days to make it workOverall a great experience Try it 😊",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great way to start a ski trip!,"Staying at the Crawford was a huge treat for me and my family...and it was worth every penny!  The staff generously accommodated our need for extra space and we loved the comfort of the Pullman room. Being part of Union Station was an energizing plus!  The excitement of being near the ski train was practically intoxicating for a life-long skier like me!  If you can swing it, go to the Crawford. You will be so glad you did.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,One night to catch train to airport,"Great hotel. We had a small room which we knew in advance, and it was really designed for maximum space. Nespresso machine and great bath amenities, clean and comfortable. Enjoyed the lobby and train station, many choices and the free ice cream and coffee with room was welcome. Will be back",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Service!,I proposed to my girlfriend while staying at The Crawford and in Union Station.  The staff was very supportive and made this a memorable experience.  All of our needs were met.  Thank you for taking care of all of my questions as I planned out the big ask!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Art & History Tour Package of Union Station and the Crawford Hotel,"Many cities have cool hotels, but I doubt few places in the US could compete with the kind of fun history and ambiance that The Crawford Hotel at Denver's Union Station offers. For a discriminating traveler who is looking for a unique experience, The Crawford Hotel truly has that in spades! It combines the best of modern features (the hotel was finished in 2014) in a historically preserved setting (Denver's original train station from the 1880's) that boasts not only a thriving hub of hip local restaurants and retailers, but the hotel is literally at the center of the transportation network for EVERY mode of travel in Denver - Amtrak, light rail, a commuter train straight to the airport, regional and local buses, Pedicab's, taxis and Uber. But those aren't the only things that make the Crawford Hotel so amazing! At one point or another in the last century, every person who traveled this country by rail came through Union Station if Denver was on their itinerary. I chose to to stay there and to do the art and history tour package at The Crawford to honor the memory of my late parents who absolutely went through Denver's Union Stationi by train in the 1940s and 1950s. Learning about both the history of the station and the amazing journey of creating a luxury hotel in such a beautiful building was a wonderful treat. If you value historic preservation, the idea of revitalizing the urban core of America's great cities, and creating spaces that literally invite the public in, then The Crawford Hotel at Denver's Union Station and this history and art tour are right up your alley! At The Crawford, they've done something extraordinary in creating a space where luxury lodging meets art and history and an incredible amount of fun! Upstairs on the mezzanine level where The Crawford Hotel has its hidden Cooper Lounge,  I saw three couples all dressed in 1920s garb – the women as flappers and the men as sophisticates from that era .  I can't think of any other setting in Denver that lends itself to this kind of playfulness and enjoyment!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Place !,"WOW! The Crawford was the most amazing place I have stayed at here in Colorado. We stayed here for a couple of nights after our small wedding ceremony and the staff made it an amazing unforgettable stay. Amina, Aaron, Cameron and Lauren were the absolute best during our stay. They all went above and beyond to ensure that we did not have to lift a finger in order to enjoy our stay. They have a Tesla car as the courtesy car that was really easy to book ! You can order Snooze for room service or go down and get priority sitting , we did both and it was great both ways . The bath tub and shower are to die for,  I am sure this was my favorite part. I enjoyed every moment of it and I will be back for many more staycations and specials stays !",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience,"We flew into Denver and wanted to spend a night to get use to the elevation before heading to the ski slopes.  We saw on Trip Advisor that The Crawford was a top choice.  We had a great time.  The historic building is exquisite and the Main Hall felt like 'Denver's living room' with comfortable seating, restaurants and shops.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful.  Our lovely room was small but very comfortable and decorated like an pullman car.  On our next trip to Denver we have decided to stay for longer then one night at The Crawford.   I truly exciting hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique, luxurious, beautiful at an amazing location","If you are going to Denver - do yourself a favor and go to The Crawford. The hotel is located inside Union Station - beautifully appointed swanky transportation center loaded with coffee spots, bars, restaurants, and shops. The rooms are unique with exposed wood beams, brick in the rooms. Super comfortable beds, yummy towels and high end soaps and lotions. Your hotel guide is an ipad like device that allows you to place room service requests, wake up calls, or if you need extra towels. We had notified them we were coming in for Valentine's Day and they had a small bottle of champagne waiting for us on ice with a tray of chocolates with a nice personalized note. The list of details is endless - as is the choices for food and things to do in Downtown Denver during your stay. High end hotel at reasonable prices.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Valentine's Staycation,"We had a lovely trip and truly felt special staying in such a beautiful hotel and location.  Surrounded by both history and nightlife, we couldn't miss the opportunity to stay at the Crawford, even as locals.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Stay in the Heart of Denver!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this unique stay at The Crawford Hotel. I'm a sucker for an old, majestic space given new life and this place does just that. What it may lack in a central lobby or common space, is more than made up for with the draw of the Union Station Courtyard - the bustle of activity at restaurants and coffee shops just outside your door. When I checked in, the room I was assigned wasn't quite what I expected. I had booked a Loft Room. The description and photos I remembered online did not reflect the room I was in. I had thought there was a free standing tub in the room that I booked and a separate seating area. The one I was assigned had neither.   I wasn't entirely sure though if I was remembering correctly. And I really didn't want to sound obnoxious. But I also didn't want to be paying for a room that I wasn't enjoying. After debating with myself for a while, I finally called reception to tell them about my confusion. Without hesitation, or making me feel bad at all for asking, the receptionist promptly said he would be happy to transfer me to the room I had described. I'm still not sure if the mistake was mine or the hotels, but the way it was handled was so generous and made me feel completely welcomed. This larger loft turned out to be the one I was expecting. While the room interiors aren't entirely my style (I generally prefer very clean, modern furnishings) the design of this particular Premium Loft definitely worked. And the bathroom IS beautiful.  Later that day, I passed by the check-in desk on my way out. A staff member (that I hadn't yet met) greeted me by name with a smile. I can see how that might be considered creepy, but I thought it showed just how much this staff was invested in their guests.  Aside from the excellent service and the draw of the location, I love that you get the added benefit of a punch card to use at the Union Station restaurants and shops. I definitely put this to use sampling complimentary ice-cream from Milkbox Ice Creamery, and used the discount for local souvenir at Bloom. I also took advantage of the priority breakfast seating for hotel guests at Snooze an a.m. Eatery. While the perk of being seated without a wait is great, I have to say the food was just ok. Later, I grabbed a few snacks from Mercantile Dining and Provisions. I'll be eating there next time for sure. It was delicious! In short, The Crawford Hotel proved to be a fantastic stay and I hope to make it back sometime soon. If you have the chance to stay here, I highly recommend it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Interesting, not for the budget minded","No continental breakfast if your into that sort of thing, free coffee at the union station coffee shop, nespresso machines in the rooms, the upstairs lounge, bar was fun, the terminal bar takes over the open lobby, very lively, had a queen bed room on the 2nd floor wich is a glass enclosed lobby where you are on display to downstairs, we would have loved one with the door overlooking the terminal or better view, we looked back onto the train station.  Rooms were quiet, bed very comfortable and nice bathrooms although our faucet was loose.  There are lots of garages in the area or the train gives you lots of options.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anniversary stay,"We stayed for our 10th wedding anniversary and everything was great.  They have valet parking which we did since there really isn't parking available and it was $42/night which seemed pricey.  All of the staff were friendly and helpful.  The fact that it's part of Union Station was why we stayed.  The terminal/lobby is lively and has plenty of seating for people to meet for a cocktail or coffee.  There is an ice cream shop, coffee shop, deli and bar in the terminal.  Plenty of restaurants, we ate at Snooze and was excellent.  The room is very cool and has great TV, IPORT device to order room service, play music and find out what's going on at the hotel. Great location I think walking distance to great restaurants, 16th St mall, Cooks field and plenty of bars.  We will stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Art/Tour Package at the Crawford was Excellent,"My high school aged son and I traveled to Denver for my work.  We stayed at the Crawford Hotel for 2 nights.  It was an amazing experience.  The ""lobby"" is really a meeting place of the downtown area.  There are coffee shops, book stores, a flower vendor, and huge benches for the people waiting for their trains.  We booked an ""Art/Tour Package"".  Michael Schmidt did the tour for us when we arrived.  This 1 hour tour was awesome!  He pointed out unique features of the renovated building, the artwork, and was super energetic about this marvelous property and its history.  Highly recommend doing this tour if you are able - it's educational and fun!  Also, with our Tour Package, we were given a linen-covered, color-picture book.  The hotel rooms at the Crawford are clean and beautiful.  There are several places for breakfast and cocktails in the evening. The staff were ALL super friendly.  We used the ""free"" Tesla service (with the Crawford driver) to get to and from dinner.  All in all, I would highly recommend everyone to stay here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very cool atmosphere,"Union Station is awesome! There's a hotel, bar and at least 2 full service restaurants. There's also a coffee shop, ice cream store and several boutiques. We rode the California Zephyr into the station, stayed in the hotel for 2 days, and rode the train the the airport. We ventured out to go to RMNP one day, and to dinner one night. Otherwise, everything we needed was in the building. Very cool place!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Christmas night,My experience at Crawford was amazing! The rooms are historic with an amazing view and that staff was beyond helpful and available. The manager Paulette stood out to me the most and was extremely professional and helpful to whatever we needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Unique Place to Stay,"It was a trip to celebrate our 52nd anniversary. I wanted to do something unique for my wife. I selected The Crawford as we had not been to Union Station, even though we live 30 minutes away. I wanted to learn about the Station and also to explore it. It far exceeded my expectations.I signed up for the Art and History tour package. They upgraded our room to a deluxe loft and there was bubbly waiting in the room when we arrived. The room was spotless and the hotel security excellent three electronic key locks (elevator, hallway and room) to shield the rooms from the mass of train travelers. There was also a lot of security people in and around the Station and train platforms.The pillow and bed were the best I have ever had at a hotel. We first had a glass of wine in the Cooper Lounge, which overlooked the central lobby area - good wine selection. Then it was dinner at a seafood restaurant in the hotel - Stoic & Genuine - fabulous (subject of another review). Breakfast followed the next day at Snooze, where we got preferred seating as a result of staying at The Crawford. There were other free food - drink extras included as a hotel guest in the Station concessions.The Art and History tour was excellent. Michael Schmidt was our guide - well versed and informative. We loved it and learned a lot.My only complaint was the parking situation. The valet parking was $42.00 per day (plus tip). We parked free on the street as it was Sunday but had to plug the meter on Monday every two hours.I highly recommend the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,OUTSTANDING HOTEL!,"My family and friends stayed at The Crawford Hotel recently for a wedding.The staff went out of their way to make everyone welcome.  They delivered our gift bags, arranged and delivered personalized amenities for each of our guests.  We all loved the different style rooms and beautiful decor!  Our family and friends really enjoyed the extra perk of a coffee, ice cream, beer and other items that were definitely worth the nightly fee.  We would meet everyone in the ""The Great Hall"" of the awesome Union Station. I highly recommend this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel; Fantastic Staff and Service; Tremendous access to first class dining. Highly recommend,"First stay the The Crawford and will definitely return. Beautiful, exceptionally clean and totally newly updated room with great amenities. The staff, from the moment that I checked in through my departure, were exceptional, friendly, and went out of their way to assist and please me. Ate at three on-site restaurants, all outstanding. Breakfast at Snooze is not to be missed from pancakes to omelettes, all great. Both the Mercantile and Stoic and Genuine had excellent dinner options. Would highly recommend a stay at The Crawford and I will be returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beware extra charges,"Don't get me wrong, lovely hotel in a fantastic historic railway station. We were completely happy until we checked out. On our arrival we were handed a little card telling us all these great 'free' things we could get and discounts in shops and restaurants in the complex. We didn't use many of them, but we used one discount for breakfast. Then when we checked out we were told we needed to pay $20 per day for the privilege of using this discount card. This was definitely not made clear to us on arrival, and as they already had our bank card details stored for incidentals we could not refuse to pay. Very poor customer service and it soured what had been a nice stay up till then. You need to be more transparent about this - had I known I would have declined the discount card. But it was presented as just an automatic complimentary benefit.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,LOVED it!,"I just loved staying at The Crawford! We decided to book a night just to get away and picked The Crawford especially because of its location in the heart of downtown. Its location is primo, with almost too much to do in about a half mile radius! But no worries, the concierge, Mike, directed us to some lovely restaurants and did all of the work of choosing the best options for us... Thank you!! To top off our experience that evening, The Crawford supplies a Telsa as a courtesy vehicle to get you wherever you need to go in the downtown area. Our driver that night, Cameron, was very charming and always arrived to bring us to our next destination right when we needed him. Now onto the hotel, it is beautiful!! I loved the classic architecture and how modern amenities are incorporated to provide a refined but cozy environment. We received nothing but smiles and courtesy from the ladies at the front desk and they were able to provide a wealth of information. I loved our room, the decor was very tasteful and had every amenity you would ever need. After a wonderful night out and an uninterrupted sleep, we ordered breakfast in bed from Snooze, that arrived promptly at our door. When it was time to check out, my husband and I both agreed that we wished we booked a longer stay. We will definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Terrible Experience,"In the spirit of giving an honest review, I will start by saying this is a beautiful hotel. Convenient with a lot of perks with it being in Union Station & nice rooms. My low rating is for the experience & staff. I came here to stay the first night of my honeymoon before we took off for Breckenridge and Beaver Creek. We were told we were getting a complimentary updgrade but when we got to our room it was the room we paid for, but no big deal. When we checked out we noticed we were charged twice on our bill. We took it down for them to ""fix"", they said they did but then it was still wrong. They assured us it was all taken care of a second time and we left for Breckenridge. On our 3rd night of our honeymoon our card that we got specifically for this trip began getting declined. We checked with our bank & The Crawford Hotel had posted nearly $2000 to our credit card. I called & was assured they were reversed. So, imagine our surprise when our card was again declined a few days later. I called & spoke to the manager Tara, who essentially told me she didn't know what I was talking about & there was nothing she could do. She was very rude & I explained to her that the charges were clogging up our card & making things very inconvenient & all she would say is ""I don't know what to tell you.""  We spent 2 days of our honeymoon on the phone with banks and the hotel, trying to figure this out and transferring money. Its been over a week now & the charges are still on our card & we cant get anyone from The Crawford to help so we have to do a charge back through our bank. It was a terrible start to our Honeymoon and Tara was a nightmare to deal with.",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loft Premium ,"Beautiful hotel and room. The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of downtown with plenty of restaurants to go to. When you stay here you get a free beer, ice cream and coffee each day you stay. The bed in the room was super comfortable and the bathtub was huge! My 6'4 husband still had room in the soaking tub. Very quiet  (never heard the trains). We will definitely stay here again next time we are in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Updated and lovely location,"This was our first stay at this interesting hotel.  Key card secure and security always visible but not obtrusive .  The atrium is open to public and train weary travelers between connections.  It's also a gathering place for business appts. and mtgs.  I saw and spoke to many people who found the soaring ceilings and amazing restaurants to be irresistible .  The hotel and staff are quite lovely .  Your bags can be stored securely and retrieved by your claim tkt from a staff member.  We never had a problem and the location was the best.  Close to shopping venues, Coors Stadium and many restaurants walking was extremely pleasant .  The reading chair and ottoman was so comfortable!!! In-room Nespresso and fridge was convenient.  Tablet in room for info on hotel, restaurants, etc.  Will love returning to this unique property!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Diminishing Returns…,"It isn’t about what the Crawford Hotel has done. It’s about what they didn’t do.The hotel is elegant, centrally located and has a solid staff. Additionally, it is clean, quiet and comfortable but none of these things are enough to compel my wife and I to stay there again. At this price point, all of the aforementioned things should be a given – especially in a hotel at this price-point. Our stay-cation included a trip on the Ski Train. Michael, our concierge helped with getting us tickets on the Snow Cat and arranged for flowers, charcuterie, a bottle of wine and a welcoming, hand-written note. However, the promised breakfast to go for the train ride wasn’t waiting at the front desk as promised.  The staff did their best to get us the food items from the Pig Train coffee shop but the results turned out incomplete and slapdash at best. The free drink coupons at the Terminal Bar went unused. A crucial aspect of our stay that was terribly out of step for a hotel of this caliber was the room service or the lack thereof. Restricted hours, limited choices and coffee that was only available in to-go cups. Really? The staff kept reiterating that the coffee was in “recyclable containers”. That was beside the point. We didn’t want to participate in the eco-disaster of to-go packaging or Keurig cups.  We were told of the in-room coffee maker, a Keurig knock-off. Again, really? At best, you’d find maybe 2 examples of coffee you wanted and in the demitasse-sized amount it’s not going to satisfy anyone’s’ caffeine fix. Getting a simple cup of coffee in the morning at a fine hotel shouldn’t be this odious. But wait, we could eat at Snooze. It’s just off the lobby. The staff uselessly told us if we would have told them the night before, they could have made us reservations.  How were we supposed to know that? That should have been an option on the home screen of the in-room iPad. This is a colossal misstep of marketing and lost opportunity for customer service. The miscues like these degraded the experience and seem hardly befitting a hotel with aspirations to be the premier destination of travelers. We upgraded our room to one of the attic, 4th story, deluxe rooms.  It was spacious, well appointed and featured the exposed, original structural beams and brickwork accented with walnut trim. An elegant space but be advised: there are 3 steps separating the entry and bathroom area from the bed and desk. I would wager few hotels have this feature and you could slip and fall in the dark as I did.  (Twisted the hell out of my ankle.) I didn’t turn on a light because I didn’t want to see the ugly wall art. A mirror image of two bleached out, buck deer, joined at the neck and shoulder with big, doey eyes that follow you. The nightstands are the nested type but the inner section weighs more than the slight pull can withstand and it isn’t simple or easy to pull out. Like other hotels, the bathrooms at the Crawford feature a conspicuous lack of towel racks or hangers. The generous size of the shower with dual showerheads is a nice touch and is a preferred use of bathroom space in my opinion. It is kind of tragic that a place that started out with such promise devolved into a place we couldn't wait to leave. I have had 5-star hotel experiences in Denver but this stay wasn't one of them.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Stay!!!,"We stayed at the Crawford and loved the hotel! Great location, new rooms and super clean! We stayed in a loft style room and had plenty of room! The bathroom was a great size too. Had a dual shower head which was really nice. Loved having a Nespresso machine in the room!! Staying at the Crawford you get a free beer at the Terminal bar, a coffee each morning at Pig Train Coffee Co., and a scoop of ice cream at Milkbox creamery. Loved sitting in union station and watching the world go by! Also, you must try Mercantile and The Kitchen for dinner! Both were amazing! I highly recommend this hotel if your staying in downtown Denver!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Charming,"Very nice and charming hotel located in Union Station Great if you're arriving from the airport and want to just jump on the train.  Brings you right to the hotel.Rooms are nice and clean.  I was in a room that reminded you of a train car.Amenities are great.  Everything you would expect in an upscale hotel.Free internet,  lots of food choices in the same building or right outside the door.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved the Crawford!,"What a wonderful property!  From the well appointed room to the available Tesla to take you around town, there was so much to love about this hotel.  Right at the station, you only need walk across the platform from the new airport light rail or one of the many other buses or trains and you are at your home away from home.  From there is is only a short walk to the 16th street mall and the free bus that takes you up and down it to all the shops and restaurants.  But we chose to take the hotel's Tesla the day we went downtown sightseeing.  The car was prompt and took us down to the state capitol building so we could stand one mile high.  Later after visiting the Art Museum and a few other attractions and getting dinner, the car was available then as well to come pick us up and get us safely back to the hotel.  Service by the rest of the staff was wonderful and the 2nd floor lounge was a gem.The room has very nice furnishings, an iPad, a Nespresso machine, nice flat screen tv and a gorgeous bathroom with a rain shower.  Plus all the shops, cafes and bars of Union station right downstairs.  You do need a room key to use the elevator or doors to get up to the hotel levels, so there is some security.But because you are at Union Station there will be some noise.  The hotel backs to where the trains pull in, fronts to Wynkoop street with all its traffic and bars and the interior rooms look right down over Union Station where travelers come and go all day and night.  It didn't bother us, but if you are looking for a much more quiet location, you may wish to rethink this choice.  Otherwise I highly recommend this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Good choice for our family; details in review,"First, we enjoyed the train from the airport to Union Station.  Second, we found Union Station outstanding: several restaurants/bars, tons of seating, a small bookstore, 2 shuffleboard tables, a deli, a coffee shop, and an ice cream place that we visited 3 times.  Third, the Crawford Hotel exceeded expectations: great service, reasonably large and nicely appointed room, large bathroom, no street noise (despite outward-facing room), clean, comfortable beds, small fridge, good-sized safe.  Fourth, we liked downtown Denver and found plenty within walking distance, like the Avalanche game and spending quarters at the 1Up classic arcade/bar.  One thing worth knowing is that Union Station is a working Amtrak station -- you will find backpackers spending time there.  Not a bad thing, but do not expect the ""lobby"" of the Crawford (which is not really a lobby) to be as serene [read: boring] as the Four Seasons.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Came in on Amtrak from Emeryville California,"The Crawford was a great destination after 30+ hours on a train!  The renovated Union Station is very nice and downtown Denver has quite a bit to offer.   The hotel was fine...old building but modern renovations.   Our 'attic' room was more of a suite than a room, with lots of interesting angles, more bathrooms and television sets than we needed, but fun nonetheless.  If in Denver we will check out the Crawford again.   We ate at Mercantile and enjoyed it!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Anniversary getaway,"We took the train to Union Station a couple of weeks ago.  Wandered over to the front desk of this Hotel, and had a great conversation with the wonderful young lady who told us all about the hotel.  As our anniversary was coming up, we decided to book a room.  When we arrived to our room, we were greeted with a chilled bottle of champagne and a personalized card for our Anniversary.  The room was amazing, very historic, and the location was perfect.  I couldn't have been happier with my stay.  Highly recommend this Hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing stay,"My husband and I stayed at The Crawford Hotel for the first leg of our cross-country honeymoon. I used the concierge services even before I arrived to arrange some surprise activities for us to do when we arrived. The concierge and front desk personnel were incredibly kind, helpful, and seemed genuinely pleased to be able to assist me. The hotel itself is unbelievable...Dominic and Bree (front desk and sales) went above and beyond to make sure that we had an amazing experience. I cannot thank them enough or more highly recommend this hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Must See,"My wife and I stayed at The Crawford last month for her birthday. We enjoyed our stay, and we both felt that the amenity/resort fee was absolutely worth it. We've stayed at 3 different hotels that charged an amenity/resort fee. The amenities provided at The Crawford were exceptional.My wife and I both work in the hotel industry, so it was very nice to experience why The Crawford is rated #1 on TripAdvisor. With our experience and knowledge, we appreciated all of the tiny details that they look for. All of the small details and amenities are what make The Crawford so successful.I also had the pleasure of briefly meeting the Hotel Manager, Tiffany O. She is very kind and intelligent. With her leadership, it is no wonder why they have a great staff as well.Thanks for everything! It was wonderful!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,5 Star Treatment!,All I can say is WOW! This hotel was absolutely outstanding. My boyfriend and I were so torn on where to stay in Denver based on location. It was between the Crawford and The Four Seasons and I am so so so happy we chose The Crawford. First of all the staff is OUTSTANDING. Chris made a great impression when I called and booked up to our driver tall blonde gentleman. I wish I could remember his name!!!! So courteous! Take advantage of the courtesy car and tip your driver! Our room was fabulous. We stayed in the Pullman room and the decor and bed were superb. You have to go to Snooze downstairs for breakfast. BEST BREAKFAST IN THE WORLD! The hotel even puts guests on a priority list for the morning. Also make sure and play shuffleboard while you have some cocktails from The Terminal Bar. My boyfriend and I loved the hustle and bustle of the Hotel and loved the fact that we could not hear a sound from downstairs. We arrived about 2 hours before check in and our room was ready. We were so pleased. We had a fantastic time in Denver and will ONLY stay at the Crawford because of this outstanding experience. Thank you to all staff for making this the stay of a life time!!!!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing staycation!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at The Crawford Jan. 2017 and it was amazing! I love that you can go straight from the airport to the hotel at Union Station. When I checked in, Alison was so wonderful and friendly. Everytime i saw her, she was smiling. I was a little concerned about ths noise when i saw where our king room was, but as soon as we closed the door, it was silent! The room was great, the bed was very comfortable and I love the location of the hotel. Will definitely recommend this hotel to others",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Holiday Downtown Stay,"My husband and daughter and I stayed at the Crawford for a night downtown to take in the Christmas lights and be together for the holiday.  The staff was warm and friendly, the room was comfortable and stylish, and the location is magical.  Union Station was lit up with a picture perfect Christmas tree and the hustle and bustle of families meeting up at the train station made for a really memorable night.  We will definitely make this a tradition.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,"I stay in quite a few excellent hotels around the world & the Crawford is head & shoulders among the best!  The staff does an excellent job of anticipating ones needs & desires, making one quite comfortable!The rooms are gorgeous, clean, & well appointed.  I was amazed at how completed quiet the room was despite the fantastic downtown, Union Station location.  A perfect retreat in the best part of Lower Downtown Denver.More about the location: Union Station is quite good.  Excellent coffee, food, & beverage set in a beautiful open, yet comfortable seating area.  Great for work or social.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,This is a must stay again and again hotel!,"We were first timers in town for the bull riding @ the Denver Coliseum.  The valet was friendly and helpful.  The front desk person, Erin, was to be very honest,  so great and helpful!!!   He assisted us with our belongings to our room.  He drove us to the Coliseum;with the promise of having a driver pick us up.  We have stayed at other hotels that shuttled us and they either forgot us or they were confused on where to pick us up or they had to pick up several people from the 16th St. Mall and would get around to us.  Miles called us within 10 minutes of our pickup call and found us right away!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Erin made sure everything was explained to us and answered all of our questions!  We do believe that he is an outstanding host that deserves praise and a raise would be nice!  Both Erin and Miles were pleasant and made our stay extra enjoyable!!!!Our room faced where we had boarded trains to go to Glennwood in the past.   the room was clean and very aswesome considering it was a knockoff of staying in the pullman car on the train.  All of the old pictures and articles were interesting. The property is everything you could ask for, clean, friendly with everything you need .  The Snooze is the place for breakfast.  There are so many employees to serve you, and they were all taking care of business well!  They brought everything out the way it was ordered and even gave us an extra pickle(house made of course, and so yummy)and waters to go were offered without our having to ask!  The hotel gave us discounts on the establishments in the depot.  Free beer@the Tavern with a great and knowledgeable bartender, free coffee and a hand dipped scoop of ice cream @ the Creamery.  We had the best Reuben sandwiches @ Acme and was waited on by the friendliest person also!  I can't say how great the Crawford and their staff and establishments within the property were to us.  It was truly and experience that we won't ever forget!  THANK ALL OF YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Everything under one roof - fun time in Denver!,"Weekend getaway to Denver the weekend before Christmas with my husband. We took the train from airport to the hotel, train dropped us off right at the hotel which is located inside of union station. Lobby was beautifully decorated with an enormous Christmas tree and large ""santa bench"" which was perfect for picture taking. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. A few freebies (ice-cream, beer, coffee) were given to us. Rooms were small but clean. Quality bath products and good water pressure in shower. Overall pricey rooms but great place to splurge for a special occasion. We tried to use the hotels free ride service but he was booked up so we ended up using the local bus system and it worked perfectly. Plenty of shops, restaurants, and live music within walking distance. We loved breakfast at Snooze inside union station but be ready to wait about an hour if you don't arrive early....food and mimosas definitely worth the wait. Great place for a weekend get away if you want to be amidst people, food, and shopping venues.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at the Crawford to celebrate my birthday. I was pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail of the hotel. The hotel is inside of Union Station (which has been revitalized) and the ""lobby"" is small and along side the many eating establishments. The staff was impeccable. We booked a King room and got an upgrade to a larger King room. The hotel, although new, kept a lot of the vintage charm of the old times. The elevator had the old style dial indicator that showed which floor the elevator was on. Inside the elevator was a subtle etching of people on the back elevator wall. The room was large with very tall ceilings, a sliding barn type door to the bathroom, hexagon tile in the bathroom, dual shower heads, and Bigelow Apothecary toiletries. The hotel even allowed the guests the ability the use of a car  (Tesla) and the driver would take you if going within 2 miles of the hotel. Great perk!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Hotel - Amazing Service,"As a hotel to stay at, this was a perfect property.  It has everything you could possibly want.  The train from the airport in Denver stops directly at the hotel.  (Avoid rooms facing the train station if the sound is going to bother you)  The hotel itself offers great amenities like free beer, ice cream, and discounts on food on the property.  Be sure to take advantage of it.  In addition you are centrally located to all the great food, the stadium, and lots of museums.  Many things are walkable but uber is also readily available.The rooms are beautiful, clean, and pleasant.  For a relatively ""rustic"" feel, the rooms had all the modern conveniences I would expect and want.  Truly well done.  Tip - It's hard to find check-in desk when you walk in and the station has so many distractions.  They are off to one side next to the elevator bank.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved it!,"Stayed at The Crawford with my three year old son and husband after Christmas and we loved it. Union Station is definitely a hot spot. The hotel is cool and eclectic. Rooms are spacious with nice bath products, an iPad and a Nespresso machine. When we checked in they wheeled out a wagon of toys and let my son pick whatever he wanted. If you want to be in the center of bustling LoDo then this is the place to stay. It's not a traditional hotel with a lobby, the train station is the lobby, quiet luxury it is not, but fun and cool it is. The restaurants in  Union Station are good, Mercantile and Snooze for sure and the Cooper Lounge is a great place for a drink. Only thing to note is the valet parking is pricey at $42 a day, but it's comparable to the parking garages in the area and more convenient. Highly recommended, next time we are in Denver we will be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Worth every dollar,"This was one of my favorite places to stay.  This hotel is located inside Union Station.A few years ago they renovated Union Station and included this hotel along with several restaurants, shops and a bar.   It is such a great idea to have all of these services under one roof. The great room as its called is the main area inside Union Station that allows for guests,tourists or passengers to sit and you can eat, drink or just read.   This area was always hopping no matter what time of day but not to a chaotic point just people in and out coming to enjoy one of the services.  I cannot thank all the staff enough for their friendliness and attention to customer service.   They also offer a complimentary car service with a Tesla that will drive you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel.  That was so helpful.  The rooms were good size -a little pricey but  again with all that is has to offer well worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Ah-mazing!,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It is probably one of the best hotel's I have ever stayed at. From the great location in the center of downtown to the great amenities located at our doorstep downstairs inside the train station to the décor and little touches inside the room itself.. we were only sad we had to leave so early the next morning to go to the airport instead of sleeping in and enjoying our stay even longer. I thought the price was good especially for what you get it was well worth it. Of course there was a $40 a night charge for the car, but they had it ready for us out front at 2:30am so can't complain about that. They provided 2 free Voss waters in the mini fridge which I thought was nice considering most places charge you for water. There were robes and slippers and a nespresso machine which I thought was nice. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. There was an ipad on the nightstand as well where you could check the weather and nearby attractions as well as request your car and other things. That was pretty cool. The style and décor of the hotel, room and bathroom was amazing. Very swanky! And don't get me started on how beautiful Union Station is! We had coffee at the cute coffee shop downstairs followed by drinks and dinner at the Terminal Bar. They also had a couple other restaurants and an ice cream shop. And part of the amenities you get when you stay here is 25% off at most of the places plus a free drip coffee, free ice cream scoop and a free beer. We will definitely stay here again when we visit Denver the next time.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful hotel in a historic building ,"The Crawford hotel is top notch and I can't wait to stay there again. Situated in Union Station, it is in the perfect location to walk to pretty much everything in downtown Denver. You can also stay put in the hotel itself because there are several restaurants and cafes onsite. The Acme deli has great sandwiches and Snooze is worth the wait for breakfast/brunch, but I would give Terminal bar a pass except for a late night drink.    My room was spotless and well appointed with top of the line amenities. There is a great shower, an espresso machine, and the bed was very comfortable. The view was of the train tracks but there were no issues with noise. The only thing I did have a problem with were that the doors are so heavy and slam every time some goes in and out of their rooms, but I have seen this in many hotels so it was not a deal breaker for me. I wish housekeeping would be aware of that though, as they start early and that made it hard to sleep. But otherwise, my stay was a perfect one and I would definitely  recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great experience,"Amenities were great, loved the Nespresso maker in the room. Wonderful location for all that LoDo has to offer. Loved the shops and we had a fun afternoon playing shuffleboard. Snooze was great for breakfast and as a hotel guest we were offered priority seating.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Industrial Chic in LoDo,"In a word, disappointing even though I've given the hotel a 4 rating. The renovated Union Station is really amazing and the hotel is located right in the station. We were catching Amtrak's California Zephyr to San Francisco the next morning and from the room to the train was a five minute leisurely walk.The room rate was $279, good for a luxury hotel in downtown Denver, but the Union Station Historic Preservation Fee, State Tax, Lodger's Tax, and Amenities and Services Fee added $70 to that and caused it to be not particularly good value. Just what amenities and services did I pay $20 for that other hotels provide without additional charge? While I like the industrial chic ambience and feel, the room didn't have windows and didn't feel particularly cozy. Maybe ""industrial"" isn't supposed to. So all in all location, location, location is great but I think I'll stay somewhere else next time.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel and location,"This was our second stay at the Crawford.  It is a great location with easy access to everything in Denver.  Also, just a great atmosphere with it being in Union Station.  The rooms are very nice and the iPad mini in the room is a nice touch.  Great showers that are large.  Staff was super helpful going over all of the amenities and setting up some dining and transportation for us.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Industrial Chic, Contemporary Historical setting","We booked the Date Night package and were upgraded to the Crawford Suite!  The amenities and décor were tasteful and well done.  As part of the package, we had cocktails at the Cooper Lounge (spot on as always!).  It was the night after Thanksgiving and they lit up Union Station and had a performance and Santa on sight.  Delightful.  Would highly recommend a stay at the Crawford if you are into the hustle and bustle of downtown, but enjoy more posh finishes and a bit of distance from the crowds!  We fell in love with the painting in the dining area of the room, and after our stay were contacted by the staff who found out the (local) artists' name so we could contact her.  Service was impeccable, our experience divine.  Several nearby dining choices, as well as fabulous dining in Union Station (Mercantile is wonderful!) Would definitely recommend and hope to do this again something for another staycation in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Staycation,"Best of old world and new world. Beautiful hotel with all the amenities, old charm, you never have to leave with all the bar and restaurant options. Best hotel in Denver!! Make sure to make a reservation a day in advance at Snooze for breakfast.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic Hotel and Venue!,"We love The Crawford and it's location at Union Station.  Rooms are beautiful, the amenities are great and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The whole venue is perfect for just hanging out or grabbing a cocktail and dinner, or coffee and breakfast.  One of our absolute favorites!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lovely and So Convenient,"The historic Crawford Hotel in Union Station is so special!  The staff provided exemplary service from early check-in to delayed check-out.  We were surprised to receive a complimentary ride in a Tesla to the Denver Art Museum.   The best parts are the location in Union Station and all of the amenities so close at hand.  We were concerned our lovely room would be noisy since we overlooked the train depot, but no so.  It was so quiet and relaxing.  We will definitely return!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Enjoy the history with your stay!,"This hotel takes you back in time.  As smaller but modern boutique hotel, this hotel is hustling and bustling with travelers, tourists and history.  Staying in the central location of the city, it's the train station ""Union station"".  The rooms are spacious and modern, with historic doors and history on the walls.  Can be a little noisy, but that should not stop you from this beautiful hotel with stores, bars and restaurants for your entrainment.  They offer a car service to take you around town to local establishments when the weather is cold.  But everything is a walk away.  Downtown Denver has so much to enjoy.  We highly recommend the Crawford Hotel.   Not recommended for small children.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love this hotel,"The Crawford is located in Union Station. We loved the atmosphere and all of the options located in one spot.  Great restaurants, coffee shop and ice cream! Something for the whole family.  The most comfortable bed I have slept on in a hotel in a very long time.  Quiet, clean and thoughtful staff!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome romantic hotel in a great location,"One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.  It was a nice romantic getaway for my wife and I.  I's so nice to know that there are still hotels out there that provide impeccable, personalized service, including a private ride in the hotel Tesla within a 2 mile radius.  We truly felt we stepped back in time, with the art deco motif and the tasteful, luxurious room.  Ordering Snooze to be delivered using the provided iPad in the room was a plus.  We'll definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best spot in Denver!,"Everything about The Crawford is next level! From the wonderful staff to the excellent amenities, this hotel is MUST if you are staying in Denver. Plus it is conveniently located near some of the top restaurants in the city. I will definitely stay at The Crawford again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wanted to stay longer,Fantastic find. Stayed as it was in union station and taking the train the next morning. The hotel staff were amazing. The decor very hip and beds super comfy. Used the services of the hotel driver and Tesla. Very nice benefit. Will be back for a longer stay.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,great location,"very cool location in Union station. Very close to great restaurants, bars, and shops. Flying into Denver airport we just took the train straight to union station ($9 per person). I found this to be very convenient. Check in was quick and easy. The girl at the front desk asked if we needed the complimentary driver which was cool. He drives a red Tesla. The regular rooms are small but cozy. I think it must have been a double bed. Very small but comfortable. Our room was very quaint and comfortable. After putting our bags down and getting settled we headed to cooper lounge for a drink. I am not sure if they are trying to make this bar some super exclusive vibe but the whole checking in thing is stupid. The girl at the check asked if we had a reservation. I told her no. she then got on her radio and asked the bar if they had any space. Then she told us to go ahead. When We turned the corner we expected to see a full bar but instead saw a completely empty bar? Seriously? We sat and had a couple drinks over the course of an hour at which only a handful of people actually came up to the bar. The female bartender was super cool but the check in lady was ridiculous. Overall a nice hipster hotel. :12-16-16 Room Charge 207.2012-16-16 Union Station Historic Preservation Fee 4.1412-16-16 State Tax 8.4512-16-16 Lodger's Tax 22.7212-16-16 Destination Amenity Fee 20.0012-16-16 Union Station Historic Preservation Fee 0.4012-16-16 Lodger's Tax 2.1912-16-16 State Tax 0.82265.92",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Place,"Located within Union Station, the Crawford Hotel was a wonderful place to spend a few days. The staff was friendly and efficient, the room was quiet and relaxing, and the location was perfect. We decided to upgrade to a much larger room.Check in was very efficient. The front desk is a little hidden in the airing room of the station, on the right wall. We arrived late morning and our room was not ready, and they asked for my mobile number to inform us when it was available. They checked our luggage. Since we were hungry from our cross-country flight, we decided to enjoy a beautiful day and lunch outdoors at one of the many restaurants in Union Station. The call arrived around 130 and when we went to the front desk they told us the luggage was already in the room.The room overlooked the train tracks (not to worry, very few trains and the noise level was miniscule, it did not disturb us at all). The was a king bed, settee, sitting chair, desk, chest of drawers with a TV atop, a large armoire with closet space, safe, coffee maker, and refrigerator. Bath was very large, tub, walk-in shower sinks and WC. The WC was not self-enclosed, which was interesting for a bath this large. The room was very clean. Amenities were high end. There were plenty of electric outlets throughout the room, there was an abundance of light plus the windows were enormous to allow for addition natural light. Additional amenities are numerous but not with a fee. There is the city equivalent of a resort fee, $20 per day. This includes the WiFi, 2 bottles of water, the use of the free car-service within 2 miles of the hotel, two dishes of 2 scoops of ice cream per day at the shop, 2 coffees in the morning at a coffee shop, 2 craft beers, fitness center, discounts at other shops, and a few other items. This is not disclosed on the website and is not an option. Just a head’s up.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Night out downtown with stay at the Crawford,Myself and some friends stayed downtown for the avalanche game and decided to stay the night at the Crawford. Room was amazing and the Cooper lounge was magnificent. Front desk agent was extremely helpful and courteous!!! Can't wait to stay at the Crawford again!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,My favorite hotel yet!!,"The Crawford is right off the light rail station and perfect for guests who want to enjoy beautiful downtown Denver.  Fantastic restaurants, shops and places to hang out and enjoy a coffee or pint of beer.  The Crawford offers short distance valet in a Tesla with some of the nicest drivers around.  We celebrated a birthday with the Infinite Monkey Theorem Urban Winery tour package and had an excellent tour and wine tasting with Jazmine.  Michael, the concierge was very helpful.  Our room was quiet, tastefully decorated and very comfortable.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Date Night Getaway,This is the second time we spent the night at The Crawford Hotel. It's such a fun place to relax and enjoy downtown Denver. The rooms are spacious and very quiet. The staff is friendly. It's a very cool vibe being in the train station. We were there at Christmas time and it had beautiful decorations. We also ate at Mercantile in Union Station which was fabulous! The only down side was waiting for valet at check out. It took longer than we anticipated.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,So LOUD,How can you rent a hotel room at a premium rate and then have a VERY LOUD event in the atrium that the rooms face out on? I have never been in a hotel that was so loud.  We also had asked for adjoining rooms as we were traveling with family -- this didn't happen.  Stay away from this venue unless you just plan to party all night.,1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect for Downtown Date,"We stayed at the Crawford on a Saturday night as part of a 24-hour downtown holiday date. Check-in for our room took all of 2 minutes. We'd reserved a ""Superior Classic"" room, which was small but elegant, clean, and nicely decorated. I had requested an extra blanket during reservation, and they provided two, We discovered neither of us had packed toothpaste. The Crawford provides an ipad in the rooms and I used their app to request a dental kit, which was delivered within a half hour. I liked that the bathroom had a spacious, walk-in shower with two shower heads because who really ever uses the small tubs usually found in hotel bathrooms?After our activities around downtown we went to the Cooper Lounge for some cocktails (had made reservations). The bartenders were super nice, and the drinks were great. The Union Station lobby was hopping with activity, including a private holiday party right in the center. It was also beautifully decorated for the holidays, and the whole atmosphere was very festive. We were concerned about the noise once we finally decided to retire, since our room was literally 3 doors down the hall from Cooper Lounge but the walls and door were pretty noise tight. We heard a little noise but nothing that kept us awake, in spite of the crowd that was still in the station lobby.We enjoyed our stay very much, and would definitely return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Perfect Hotel, Location, Luxury, and Excellence","I stayed at the Crawford Hotel with a group of friends.  We all had a great time at this beautiful hotel.  It was so convenient to be able to take the train from the airport straight to the hotel where we were greeted by the pleasant, kind, and accommodating staff of the Crawford.  The lobby was beautifully decorated for the Holidays and had great restaurants, cafes, kiosks, and coffee shops!  The hotel room was stunning with floor to ceiling windows, super comfortable beds, and a shower I could have spent all day in.  Not to mention, just outside the hotel are all the conveniences of downtown with tons of options for shops, restaurants, and bars all close by within walking distance!  I have nothing but nice things to say about the hotel and its staff.  I would recommend this to anybody wanting to stay at the perfect hotel in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Weekend Getaway,"""Wow""I was impressed with the first step into the Union Station in the heart of Denver. There was a private office party with a band and it looked right at home in the center of the station floor. The energy was fantastic. We found the front desk tucked into the side and was in our room on the 4th floor within minutes. The room was near sound proof but you can always walk out to the atrium and enjoy the architecture and the buzz below.The rooms themselves were well appointed and very generous with the high ceilings (at least our suite was) which was I believe an upgrade with the date night package (worth it!).To say that the rooms and hotel were nice is missing the point. I gave this place 5 stars for the service. From the valet to the desk staff and even the cleaning staff everyone was friendly and helpful. Special shout out to the concierge staff (Michael was outstanding) for their attention to detail and ability to problem shoot and make our trip especially special and unique.A must stay/see for those wanting a jaunt into town and want to have quick access to a variety of quaint shops within walking and fantastic food. To go further afield they provide included car service with a Tesla! Our driver was fantastic (Erin, I believe) and really made haunting around for dinner easy and exciting.Great location, staff and service!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Very ""Happening"" Hotel",Didn't realize from hotels.com info that The Crawford is actually part of the renovated Union Station....now a multi-faceted gathering place with a big pulse rate.  Room itself was of the European style....quite compact but otherwise fine.  Staff was helpful when needed.  Excellent location.  Courtesy shuttle Tesla when available for up to 2 miles.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Business Trip,"Great room....took pictures for my wife. I needed to use the hotel automobile (red Tesla....nice ride) to get across town for a cocktail party at the Art Hotel. The driver, Miles, was a great guy. We had excellent conversations going both ways. The rest of the staff was also very friendly. Nice stay, great ambience.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful Room in a Unique Setting,"Room was beautiful! Very comfortable bed.  Extremely clean & quiet.  Although it was only the third floor and it was the corner of the building there was no street noise.  Had a great night's rest, which to me is the most important thing. Very centrally located. Amenities were very nice.  Staff couldn't be more courteous and helpful. Just two comments for those traveling with children: 1. I couldn't find a night light in the bathroom and 2. I couldn't find where there were any movies offered for purchase. Having been to Denver many times I am comfortable saying that this is the best place to stay if you have to be in downtown Denver on business.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Delightful Environment and Convenience.,"We flew to Denver and stayed at Black Hawk, about an hour west of Denver for three days.  We returned to Denver to catch the California Zephyr.  We dropped our luggage with the hotel valet and returned the rental car to the airport.  We had a difficult time finding the valet.  We were given the coordinates of the street running parallel to Union Station and an intersecting street that dead ends into Union Station.  The valet station is on the sidewalk across from that corner.  The sign is small and not at all prominent.After dropping the luggage, we returned the rental to the airport.  We walked the short distance to the light rail the travels from the airport to Union Station.  The light rail drops you a short walk from Union Station.  The registration desk is just off the waiting room of the station.  It is inconspicuous, so be on the lookout.   The check-in was brilliantly handled by a pleasant young lady.  Our luggage was waiting in the room.We were assigned a room on the second floor.  The room had been recently renovated, and was tastefully furnished.  The room was small but with all the expected amenities.  We checked our luggage for the next-day train trip that evening.  The next morning, the train was just a short walk.Union Station has a deli, coffee station, and a couple of popular restaurants.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Excellent service, wonderful rooms","This is the nicest place to stay in Denver! Our room was amazing, the staff was incredible, front-desk manager Tara really rolled out the red carpet for us and in such a unique setting. I would highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great room and location,"Loved the Crawford. The room was awesome. They upgraded us to a loft suite. The special perks they give for union station places were great, and the helpfulness getting reservations at Mercantile was appreciated. Union Station is a wonderful and vibrant location. Highly recommend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel,"We had an amazing time at the Crawford! One of the coolest rooms Ive stayed in, the beds are super comfy. The restaurants in the area have great atmosphere also. I highly recommend a stay at the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stately Rooms and Amazing Service,"I had a wonderful stay at the Crawford with my wife several weeks ago. We're from Denver and decided to have ourselves a little ""staycation"" downtown to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the loft-style rooms with cool exposed beams/brick and and hip interior design. It was a stately blend of old and new. On to the service: Upon checking in we were escorted up to our room (via private elevator, no less!) by Mike, one of the concierges. Mike would go on to make sure that our every comfort was taken care of over the next 24 hours. He helped us to make reservations for dinner, reservations for massages the next day, recommended a great bar for after dinner drinks, and even made sure that we had a bottle of champagne in our room to celebrate our anniversary. He was truly one of a kind and seemed to work around the clock too! How surprised we were when we went to check out the next morning and Mike was back again to send us off with a smile :)The Crawford is an amazing hotel in an incredibly vibrant part of town. There are amazing dining options right onsite from casual to fine-dining. We opted for the seafood restaurant that is operated by one of Denver's local celebrity chefs. We also stopped into the Terminal Bar for a casual drink and some shuffleboard. Can't wait to come back again soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great staycation at the Crawford,We had a wonderful staycation at the Crawford. Our room was beautiful and it was great to stay right in the middle of everything downtown. We had only positive interactions with Crawford staff - Mike at the front desk even helped us to track down gluten free pizza close by! Absolutely will come back to decompress from a long week.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great stay at the Crawford,"We had a wonderful stay at the Crawford. The hotel is beautifully decorated for the holidays. We were greeted by Lauren who welcomed us, reviewed all the amenities, sent us to the bar for a ""welcome beer"" while she took our bags up to our room and later made reservations for the hotel Tesla to take us to a nearby holiday party. She has great attention to detail, as does the rest of the staff. The room is beautifully decorated and the entire hotel has a balance between modern rooms and a classic traditional feel through out the rest of the hotel and station. We will make this stay an annual tradition. Thank you.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect weekend retreat,Don't overlook a stay at the Crawford. We booked a small suite in a quiet section of the hotel. Room service for breakfast from the Snooze is the way to go. If you're interested in an evening night cap that's available as well. Great restaurants all around.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great place, great location","Recently stayed here and went to a football game. Very convenient to take the rail from the airport to the hotel at union station. Ate at the kitchen next door and mercantile and both where very good and reasonably priced. The lounges were great to have close by. Overall a very pleasant and unique set up with the hotel, bars, restaurants etc. The rooms are up to date and very comfortable. This will be my first choice in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A wonderful experience ,"We had a great stay at the Crawford. What a wonderful place to spend a quick stay, a fancy night out, a business trip, or any other trip at all. The service is out of this world with Mike's beautiful face greeting us with a smile, to Dominic being patient with our requests. At every turn they had someone ready to answer questions and help with whatever we wanted. I remember Myles and Cassidy answering questions about what food we might want for dinner around the area. Their knowledge and commitment to service made our stay that much more relaxing. I cannot recommend a better, more accommodating stay than the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Embedded Culture in Union Station,"This is a first class hotel catering to the traveler or to those just wanting a romantic getaway.  It occupies floors 2-6 in Union station and is the hub of a very busy downtown district in Denver called LoDo.The hotel itself has roomed elegantly appointed and even at least one with a railroad theme called the Pullman.  Beautifully done and the hotel offers complimentary beers, coffee's, ice creams at close by vendors with the station in addition the use of a Tesla & driver to take you various places.Staff are well informed, dressed to the nines and would fit in any of the worlds' hotels.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Renovated Beauty,"I spent 5 nights at the Crawford during the kick of to the holiday season and it was magical. Being that the hotel is situated in the upper levels of the redone union station, it is nicely decorated and always has an energy going through it, I was lucky enough to stay in one of the Attic rooms. There were exposed beams and plenty of room to move around and not feel cramped. The amenities that the Crawford offered were just what I needed throughout my stay. Sometimes a good cup of coffee was all I needed from Pig train, or a nice scoop of ice cream to end my day as I made my way to my room (both were free because I was staying at the Crawford). The rooms were quiet and you wouldn't know you were staying at a train station until you walked out of the hallways. The front desk staff and friendly and always there to chat like old friends or lend a good suggestion on things to do in and around Denver. I will deffinatly be returning to the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Simply the best!!!!!!,"I recently returned from a 3 week journey by car. I have again stayed in numerous establishments. The Crawford in all her beauty has by far surpassed any and all expectations. The current holiday decorations provide quite the Christmas spirit. There are multiple places to eat from quick service to full service 5 star restaurants all located within the confines of the magnificent Union Station. I highly recommend any of them. They will not disappoint. But, back to the subject at hand. She is a true beauty. I have previously stayed here and am thoroughly impressed with the rooms. They are spacious and a true delight to enjoy. You must understand, this is not simply a hotel stay, its an experience. The staff is by far the best. They all appear to be hand picked personnel. There are three staff members that stand out, Dominick, Tara and Aaron (I apologize if I have misspelled your names).  These three represent what ALL hospitality professionals should be.  Knowledgeable, kind, genuine and very personable.  You will immediately feel at home.  I am not in anyway intending on taking away from the rest of the staff.  These three are simply exceptional if not the best in their field.  Regardless of the staff member, all guests are treated with the utmost respect, courtesy and compassion.  I truly appreciate not being just another person at the hotel.  I feel more like a house guest, truly treated special.  I can go on and on about all the extra special experiences in store for those who elect to stay here but I will leave that for the next time I have the privilege of staying under her roof.If you have the opportunity to stay here and have the time, there is an available tour that I would highly recommend.    At the risk of sounding like a commercial, I wish to make mention that a courtesy car (a Tesla I might add) is available to take you anywhere within a couple miles and a train directly to and from the airport.  Also, the 16th Street Mall is but a block away, with outstanding shopping and food.   I will be returning to The Crawford Hotel the next opportunity that arises, simply to stay with the best.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Overall great hotel from ambiance to location,"Stayed the hotel for a business mtg and was very impressed on all aspects of my stay from check-in, to room, to service.  Such a visually pleasing place.  Loved the proximity to lots of activity and the selection of different vendor locations in the lobby.  Not to mention the convenience of using the train for the Denver Airport that delivers you right to the door of the hotel!!  Not your typical hotel room, the design is awesome.  I will definitely return!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Experience Ever!,"I don't write reviews unless I am absolutely happy with a service or product.  This hotel and their level of customer service will surpass your expectations.  We had the opportunity to stay 4 nights over the Thanksgiving Weekend and it was a memorable experience.  At check in, we were greeted like valued customers and our bags were immediately loaded onto a cart and taken away to our room.  The room we stayed in is bigger than my condo.  Seriously!  It was not only huge but had a great vibe and cool amenities like an amazing coffee maker, an IPAD, refrigerator and a type of bathroom you would see in a million dollar home.  Our stay came with daily free coffee, beer at the hip Terminal Bar, free scoop of local ice cream, 24 hour access to the gym (which by the way is the nicest gym I've ever been to) and pretty much a personal Tesla Driver.  Yes, your personal Tesla Driver.  What hotel does that?  The location of the hotel is central to everything and you can take the train directly to Denver airport.  Who needs Uber if you have a personal driver and the train? During checkout, the attendant checked to see how busy the airport was.  I didn't even ask.  Go there and experience Denver.  It's well worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"If you're visiting Denver, this is the spot","As a former Denver resident, the transformation of Union Station is truly remarkable and the Crawford Hotel as part of that was really well done.  The hotel was top notch from start to finish and you don't have to go very far for anything.  To start, you can take a 30 min light rail ride from DIA right to the hotel for $9.   Union station now has a great scene with several bars & restaurants including Mercantile Dining & Provisions as well as Snooze.  Both are top notch.  The Crawford Hotel itself has a really cool vibe to it and great service.  I was staying in the Classic Guest Room and it was top notch.   If you make it out of the hotel you're walking distance or a short Uber ride from everything in downtown Denver.   Great spot and looking forward to stopping back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Impressive!,"I really can not think of a negative to staying at The Crawford.  Our girls night out was spent in splendor here and we felt spoiled by the amazing accommodations. The hotel and every one of the employees we encountered were the best! The double queen room that we had was clean and nicely furnished. The location is perfect to get a feel for the LoDo scene. If you want to explore the area in style the hotel provides a driver and a Tesla within roughly 2 miles and we took full advantage of it(Thank you Cameron and Miles!!!) The concierge offers great suggestions for dining and entertainment and we got 5 star treatment at locations where they made reservations for us(especially at Vesta).  A part from The Crawford, Union Station offers plenty of options for gift shopping, eating, and drinking.  The Kitchen Next Door was a good restaurant with healthy options, terminal bar made decent drinks, we never ate at Snooze because it had a 2 hour wait for breakfast.  We are already thinking we'll stay here again for our next girls night out!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,At the hub of activity!,"The Crawford is a comfortable and elegant stay. It is located right at the hub of transportation- I was able to take a bus to Boulder for the day and a train/complimentary bus to Golden for the day. So much to do in the area! The rooms are chic and the beds are dreamy. Included in the daily hotel amenities fee, are free Milkbox Ice Cream, craft beer, Pig Train coffee and a discount at certain restaurants. Had a perfectly wonderful time, staying at the Crawford Hotel and experiencing Colorado!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stunning hotel with amazing service,"We have stayed at The Crawford twice now and one experience has been better than the next.  The rooms are beautiful, chic, clean and full of lovely amenities and the location cannot be beat.  During this visit we actually just spent the entire day in our hotel room and Union Station because there was so much to do and we were enjoying ourselves so much!Dominic at the front desk was absolutely amazing.  He got us into a spectacular corner room, walked us to the room and then called to make sure we were settled in and comfortable. Upon leaving he came to our room, helped us with our luggage and was genuinely pleased we had a good stay and told us to ask for him again by name the next time we stay there and we will!  We will certainly be back and we will ask for Dominic - you should do the same!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,In the lap of luxury,"Recently got to stay at the Crawford in Union Station. We had a loft room that was not only huge but unique. The room was decorated in a sleek modern way, but the beds were sooooo comfortable. Loved being in Union Station. The hotel gives it's guests all kinds of goodies like free ice cream, craft beer, coffee and 25% off at dining establishments. We also got priority seating at Snooze. The hotel staff is top notch. Friendly, welcoming and accommodating. We used the free courtesy car (it's a freaking Tesla!) and the drivers were so charming. With all the bustle in the main hall of the station, our room was super quiet. Everything is just steps away and there is easy access to all kinds of transportation. Stay here for a totally different kind of hotel stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The very best that Denver has to offer!,"In recent years we have visited Denver often and love staying at the Crawford!  The rooms are beautiful and spacious.  The beds are so comfortable that it makes it difficult to get up and begin your day!  The bathrooms are attractively designed and always clean. The large windows provide amazing views and a great spot for people watching up and down the streets. There are many options for dining right in the hotel.  Because the location is so great, you can walk almost anywhere you need to go.  If you need a ride within a 2 mile radius, they have an elegant Tesla courtesy car that will take you and pick you up as need be.  The staff here always exceeds our expectations!  They continually go above and beyond to make sure our stay is the best that it can be.  The lobby is always a bustling place filled with people that seem to be truly enjoying themselves especially while sitting among the elegant Christmas decorations.  We will be back again to stay at the Crawford and highly recommend to everyone!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Make a point to stay here!,"Got off the train at Union Station from the airport,as we waited for our ride we notice The Crawford Hotel in the terminal and was smitten by the beauty of the the whole station. Reserved the Date Night Package, it's a bargain. Dined at The Mercantile and wasn't disappointed,breakfasted at Snooze,great way to start the day. Walked all over the downtown area. So much to do and not have to drive or hunt for parking.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A must for train lovers,"The room was small but comfortable.  I looked at a room advertised as a ""pullman car"" design but it wasn't anything special (maybe there are other ""pullman"" rooms which are more distinctive).  The point of staying at this hotel is not the room itself, but the location, which is the actual original Union Station, with the trains still active.  The atmosphere is worth every penny.  There is a nice list of amenities and free treats from the many really cool restaurants, bar, shops in the station.  The courtesy car will take you around town and to/from events - it's a Tesla!.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Fun, hip, clean, great service","I stayed here for a friends wedding and it was fantastic. It's so convenient to take the lightrail directly from the airport. Great location in Denver: the Crawford is in Union Station, with all the hipster delicacies you could ever want! I'm from San Francisco and i felt right at home. Amazing rooms, free wifi, great service. Five stars for sure!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful hotel retrofitted into a restored historic building,"I had read many positive things about the Crawford and Union Station, so it was my first choice for my visit to Denver for a convention.  Alas, I needed to be a bit closer to the Convention Center, so I had a ""meh"" 5-night stay at the Ritz Carlton Denver, then spent my last night at the Crawford because I wanted to try it out and because I'd be taking the new (opened this year) RTD Light Rail line A to the airport.  My last night by far was the best of my stay.   I am often attracted to hotels that arise in historic or architecturally significant buildings (the Hotel Burnham in Burnham and Root's Reliance Building in Chicago, the Langham Chicago in Mies van der Rohe's IBM Building),  and the Denver Union Station renovation complete with the retrofit of the Crawford Hotel within its historic exoskeleton certainly fits the bill. Union Station has a fantastic location in the vibrant LoDo area of Denver.  Many attractions and eateries are within walking distance.  First opened in 1881, the Station remains a transit hub for Amtrak, RTD buses and Light Rail.  I personally arrived in Denver on Amtrak's California Zephyr from Emeryville, CA.  The Crawford opened about 2 years ago.  The Union Station structure consists of a main building with 2 wings on either side.  The main building has 3 stories, the wings have 2, yet the Crawford has 4 floors.  This is accomplished because the hotel's 2nd floor is actually a mezzanine level over the rear of the 2 wings; the low-ceilinged spaces below are the kitchen areas of retaurants and the Amtrak ticket office and baggage claim.  So the ""second"" floor of the main building and wings are actually the 3rd floor of the hotel, while the hotel's 4th floor is the main building's ""third"" floor and the wing's attic spaces.  This sounds and is confusing--I only figured it out due to my casual interest in architecture and because I did extensive snooping around the hotel's public areas and exterior.  I basically opened whatever door was unlocked or accessible with my room key.   I gained much more admiration for the hotel's design--it truly was a retrofit and a very ingenious one at that.  A prior TA review mentions a hotel tour and tour concierge.  I heard and knew NOTHING about this--I would have been EXTREMELY interested had I known such a thing existed.Union Station is now a clever mix of restaurants, lounges, shops and the Amtrak facilities.  The main building's original waiting area now holds a variety of seating areas and options, plus the Terminal Bar.  Around its periphery are the Crawford Hotel's front desk, 2 shops (check out Bloom), a deli (Acme), a coffee place (Pigtrain), an ice cream shop (Milkbox Ice Creamery), a floral stand, snack stand, tourist desk, and a tapas eatery under construction.  On a balcony over the Terminal Bar is the elegant Cooper Lounge, a fancier retro space where reservations are helpful.The two wings house the complex's table-service restaurants.  On one side there is  the Kitchen Next Door (casual pub/eatery) and Stoic & Genuine (seafood and oyster bar).  On the other side are Snooze-An AM Eatery (wildly popular breakfast and lunch spot) and Mercantile Dining and Provision, which itself it divided into a food shop/casual eatery and a full dinner-only restaurant.  Also on this side is a branch of the Tattered Cover Book Store.  All the table service restaurants plus Pigtrain and Milkbox have outdoor patios.  Note that none of the restaurants have restrooms.  There are HEAVILY used restrooms for all in both wings; in one wing the restrooms are in the basement.The Crawford has 3 basic room types, plus a couple specialty suites.  1)  Pullman rooms are the smallest, all located on the 2nd floor, all facing the train tracks.2) Classic rooms are the most plentiful, located on the 3rd floor main building and wings, and the 4th floor main building.  These Victorian-style rooms all have very high ceilings and face either the front plazas or the train tracks.  They come in Superior, Deluxe and Premium categories based on the size of both the living space and bathroom--I think only the Premiums have a tub.  Note that the  Classic rooms that are in the main building seem less secure that those in the wings because they are accessible by a public staircase used to access the Cooper Lounge, while the wings have additional key-access doors.  These central rooms may be noisier as well, especially those on the 3rd floor, because folks heading to the Cooper Lounge walk right past these rooms.3) Loft rooms occupy the former attic spaces of the wings (4th floor).  As such, these rooms have vaulted ceilings and high windows that are well above eye-level (ie, more for natural light than views).  These rooms also have Superior, Deluxe and Premium categories.  As stated before, the hotel's front desk is really an alcove within the main building; there is no dedicated lobby space.  It seems the folks staffing the desk are concierges and luggage handlers as well--all I encountered were quite friendly in a casual, informal way.  My room was not ready when I checked-in.  I was contacted by phone a short while later while I was finishing a delicious lunch at Stoic & Genuine, which has Happy Hour all day on Sundays.My room was a Pullman room. As stated before these rooms are on the 2nd floor of the wings, really a mezzanine level.  They are accessed by glass-walled hallways that overlook the dining rooms of the 4 table-service restaurants.  While these are the hotel's smallest and least expensive rooms, they are by no means tiny, and the thought put into their design (meant to evoke an old-fashioned luxury train sleeping car) is admirable.  The narrow room is divided into 3 sections:  1) the entry foyer with a table and lamp and well-lit bathroom with sliding door alongside.  The bathroom had a large shower with pump-dispensers for shower gel, shampoo and conditioner by C.O. Bigelow.  A wrapped box set of toiletries for you to take (for a fee) is on the bathroom counter.  2) the sleeping area with a queen bed pushed against the wall (this may be a problem for a couple if the person against the wall needs to use the bathroom), and a large mirrored vanity opposite.  The vanity holds a tablet with hotel information, alarm clock, area information, guest folio info, newspapers, and room service menus and ordering procedures for Snooze and the Kitchen Next Door.   The closet is a wooden armoire with Art Deco doors that houses a too-narrow hanging rod as well as a safe, Nespresso machine, slippers, robe and minifridge with 2 bottles of Voss water.  There is no turndown service.3) a sitting area with a decent-sized desk and chair with floor lamp, plus the window.  A flat-screen TV separates the bedroom from the sitting area, and it swivels so is visible from both areas.There is a nightly $20 ""services and amenities"" fee, which includes:  courtesy transportation within a 2-mile radius in a Tesla, WiFI, the aforementioned daily water and Nespresso machiine, one select craft beer per guest at the Terminal Bar during Happy Hour, one scoop of ice cream per guest per day at Milkbox, one small drip coffee per guest at Pigtrain, priority seating at Snooze (must request one day prior via the front desk), 25% off food and non-alcoholic beverages at Pigtrain, Milkbox, Acme and Terminal Bar, 20% off at Bloom, 10% off at the Flower Kiosk, access to the Oxford Club Fitness Center and classes (this may be in the nearby Oxford Hotel) with discounts on services and merchandise, unlimited local and 800 calls.I personally used enough of these services to justify the $20 fee.   I dined/snacked/shopped at Mercantile, Stoic & Genuine, Acme, Milkbox and Bloom.  I priority-booked for breakfast atSnooze on my day of departure but overslept and didn't make it.  One has so many options without having to ever leave the building.  Overall a fabulous albeit short stay.  Should I return to Denver, the Crawford will be my first choice for lodging.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent service,"Stayed for one night with business. Great spacious rooms, free wifi and perfect service. The location was conveniently close to the station making my trip to the airport so much easier. Have already booked to stay there on the next work trip.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Spectacular hotel in the perfect location!,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it was our first stop on a wonderful tour of Utah and Arizona.  We chose the Crawford due to its positive online reviews and its central location in downtown Denver.  We were not disappointed.  The hotel is located in a historic train station building that contains a plethora of fantastic restaurants and shops.  You can find some awesome food here no doubt!  Also, the rooms were modern, spacious and well appointed.  Not to mention the service of the hotel staff was amazing.  If you're headed to Denver, you should consider this hotel---we highly recommend it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Just Great,A trip to Denver always states off with a night at The Crawford. Great staff and a warm welcome greets everyone there every time. The location is ideal within Union Station. Close to the Cherry Creek path for a run. And convenient to the art museums.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Addendum - prior review,"After posting my previous review of this hotel, the management responded quickly and superbly by discounting our stay and apologizing. Unfortunately at the time, the service was still struggling - we arranged a pick up by the hotel car (a Tesla) from dinner on our last night and then watched the driver pick up a different couple, drive off, and not pick up the phone when we called repeatedly. Even after getting a cab back the hotel car had not yet returned. However, management made sincere efforts to ease the sting of our experience and I hope that if I return to Denver the hotel is everything I believed it can be.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Escape Awaits at the Crawford,"I was fortunate to find this gem of a hotel for my business travel to Denver. The Crawford is conveniently located at the end of a short and pleasant train ride from the airport. You'll then have numerous commute options including a quick walk or courtesy car hop to nearby businesses. The hotel is perfect for work given the excellent sound-proofing in every room and corridor. With the upscale amenities and room service menu, they make it hard to leave the comfort of your room.  You will want to take part in the camaraderie that awaits in the lobby where the selection of food and amenities -all local - is vast and delightful. During my most recent stay, I was able to tour the hotel with Tour Concierge Michael Schmidt - see picture. His knowledge and presentation made the hotel come alive. Ask about an impromptu tour if you miss the scheduled tour days or times. Do treat yourself to this one-of-a-kind hotel experience next time you're in Denver; you'll be glad you did!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Anniversary ,"We live in Denver suburbs and love coming downtown for a special night.  The ambience, rooms, restaurants, staff and location make this our favorite downtown destination.  Whether it dinner at The Mercantile or Stoic &a Genuine, drinks at in the lobby bar, breakfast at Snooze or late night coffee and ice cream, this place has it all.  The loft rooms on the 4th floor are unique and beautifully appointed.  There is no noise from the train station when in your room.  If you want to dine outside the hotel there are great restaurants and bars all around Union Station.  This is a must stay property.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved it - So cool to be in Union Station!,"Amazing location, rooms were huge and we loved the decor. The lobby is the terminal of Union Station and it is swanky and fabulous. The Snooze breakfast was delicious and we were so lucky that the concierge got us into a fully packed Mercantile. We loved our stay - everyone was so friendly.  We ordered flowers for a birthday celebration from the in house florist and they were gorgeous and so thoughful.  Thank you, Crawford Hotel.  We will definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, nice rooms","I loved staying at the Crawford hotel. It was centrally located near the office I was visiting and a very pleasant stay. The train to/from the airport ends right at the entrance to the Crawford lobby, so I didn't need to rent a car. The lobby also serves as the train station, and there are a few bars as well as coffee shops, restaurants, and gift shops within the station.The rooms were a little small, but perfect for traveling alone. The Pullman room included 1 queen/double size bed, which was almost pushed up against the wall on one side, so with another person in the room could have been difficult. There was an entertainment cabinet with a TV that could swivel around to the small seating area on the other side. The room also included a desk and vanity type area next to the wardrobe closet. The bathroom was comfortably sized and the shower (no tub) was great. The shower included built in pumps for shampoo, conditioner, and body wash and was one of the nicest showers I've seen at a hotel. Though there is a lot going on in the lower levels of the hotel (the lobby i mentioned as well as restaurants and the train station), the walls and windows were very well sound-proofed and i could not hear any outside noise from my room. you could also order room service from a select menu on the in-room e-tablet.I enjoyed my stay at the Crawford and look forward to the opportunity to stay again!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel in Denver,"I love this hotel!  We checked in for one night on a Thursday and the sales associate upgraded our room which was unexpected but fantastic.  We had a 4th floor room with the most amazing exposed beams that made the room so beautiful.  The bathroom was spectacular with a tub that would fit two people and the most amazing shower with a choice of a rain shower head or a regular shower head.  The Terminal Bar, just down stairs was a great place to go and relax after a full day of travel.  For breakfast don't miss snooze also down stairs as it is SO worth the wait!  Over all this was a fantastic night at an amazing hotel!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Will definitely come back!,"The Crawford Hotel is such a fantastic experience. The location, inside Union Station, can't be beat. The ambiance is electric, I could sit and people watch all day. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. They arranged a car to take us to our show, explained the amenities that were included in our stay, offered to make reservations at the many restaurants and more. The room was small but creatively designed to maximize the space and the finishings were top notch. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer. Next time we will be sure to stay for at least two nights, maybe three.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Place to Host an Elite Group of Clients,"The Crawford Hotel and Union Station of Denver are amazing, the architecture and interiors are beautiful and well done to replicate the original design. Love the hotel rooms as each one is unique but all are of high style and very comfortable.  I highly recommend the Crawford Hotel for any stay business or pleasure-its a Denver Gem!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very nice stay!!,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights.  It was very convenient getting off the train from the airport literally at the door of the hotel.  The room was beautiful and very clean.  I loved the bathroom and large soaking tub.  We got free ice cream, beer, and coffee from all the shops downstairs every day we stayed.  The only bad thing was no vending machines, so make sure to stop at the 7-11 down the street.  I also wish there were more channels to watch or movie rentals available. Over all I will definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A curated experience!,"This is something completely fresh. The Crawford sits above and around Denver's Union Station. Your experience consists not just of the hotel, but the entire environment of the station - which is probably the nicest public transportation hall I've ever visited. The vast space is home to many coffee joints, bars & restaurants, and is overlooked by the impressive Cooper Lounge (where sadly on my visit, the cocktails didn't match the atmosphere).The loft rooms are spacious, with exposed brick, high ceilings, and live up to the style of a modern boutique hotel. They are also incredibly sound proofed (remember - you're in a train station!) and at a great price.The area around the station only adds to the joy of The Crawford - full of restaurants and brew pubs. Plus the train leaves direct from your door to the airport at a bargain price of $9 with no traffic. Recommended!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fabulous place,"Gorgeous renovation of a historic property.  Rooms are beautiful and comfy, and the facility is loads of fun.  The train station was very lively on Fri and Sat nights, but rooms were quiet nonetheless.  The independent breakfast place, Snooze, has great food although both times we went, servers had an attitude and food came out cold.  But that's not the hotel's fault.  The $20/night resort fee was worthwhile for us as we used the local shuttle numerous times, including once going far beyond the maximum 2 mile radius, plus enjoyed coffee,  ice cream and a beer from the local shops.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Wonderful, unique","Possible to take train from Denver airport right to the hotel.  Best if you don't have a lot of luggage. Trains run from the hotel back to the airport every 15 minutes.  Several great restaurants in the hotel, also pretty bars, deli, coffee bar and on and on.  Waiting room of the station is actually the hotel lobby.  Access to rooms, (spacious & attractive) quite secure.  We've stayrd there twice, would happily do so again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A beautiful hotel carved out of the historic Union Station,One of the best hotel experiences ever.The buzz in the atrium which was Union Station is remote from the hotel part of this brilliant Adaptive Reuse development.  The building is on the National Register.  The experience of being in this historic space with all of the amenities is worth a trip to Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amtrak Trip to Denver and our stay at The Crawford Hotel,"My wife and I  made our first trip to Denver  by way of Amtrak. Not being familiar with the city, we decided to stay at The Crawford Hotel in Union Station. It was close to the trainwhich we would be using to return home.      Staying at the Crawford was a pleasant experience. The reception we received from Mike, Cassidy,Courtney and the courtesy car driver, we will always remember. The drivertransported us within a 2 mile radius. We went to the Aquarium, Black American WestMuseum and rode the 16th Street Mall Shuttle. We had a GREAT TIME !!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,It would have been better....,"...... had we not been given a room right by the bar so that whenever we entered the room everyone in the bar could see straight into our room! Once we were in the room this didn't matter but entering & leaving was a little odd.Otherwise the hotel was great; a lovely big room with easy access to Union Square station and all it's attractions. Vouchers for free coffee, beer and ice cream were available and the hotel is a train ride from the station. It's worth watching the room rates - they are very variable and rebooking saved us 70 dollars (but might have been why we had the room by the bar).",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Central location with a little slice of heritage....,"Stayed here for an overnight business trip. Overall liked the hotel. The rooms are a little small, but very charming! Location is the prime advantage being right above Union station - you can take the train in from the airport. Lots of places to grab dinner or a quick breakfast right downstairs. Check-in/checkout experience was very smooth. A tad expensive when I stayed, but rates were high all around that week in Denver. Would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stopped in on our way to Meeker for a hunting trip.,This hotel has great service and a great location.  The historical aspect of the hotel was an added bonus.  The downstairs bar had some great beer on tap and the ice cream shop was pretty good also.  I would definitely stay here again if we are ever in Denver again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Charming and vibrant,"First time in Denver and extended a business trip with a long weekend.  This was the perfect location to see and experience the city.  The hotel lobby is active with places to have a cocktail, coffee or ice cream, or just do a little light shopping; everything else you need is within walking distance.  The rooms are very clean and decorated far beyond the feel of an old train station.  I will stay here each time I travel to Denver for business - or pleasure.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very Unique Hotel,"Very unique hotel. Overall they did a great job re-purposing Denver's Union Station. Still an active train station, but with an upscale feel.  Gorgeous lobby bar. Several options for coffee, breakfast, pub food, lunch, etc.  Rooms are a bit small, but with such a prime location and such amenities just outside your door, I didn't feel the urge to stay in the room that often.I'd definitely stay here again for business or on a trip with friends. Not sure I would bring young children.  Since the hotel's ""lobby"" is the main hall of Union Station, I wouldn't want my children wandering around.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Historical Pleasure,"My husband and I love to visit Denver to see family and we love The Crawford Hotel, it's perfect location, you can walk almost everywhere and perfect for the LightRail to DIA.  The Crawford has charm, warmth, fountains and friendly people everywhere.  We enjoyed a drink in the Terminal Bar, full of such interesting facts and great beers on tap!  Union Station is clean and bustling.  The Milk Box for ice cream is amazing, and so convenient.  The room was perfectly appointed with a spacious bathroom, and the most comfortable beds in town, we also enjoyed a fabulous view to the fountains and activity on Wynkoop, with floor to ceiling gorgeous windows!  I hope to be fortunate enough to stay here again!  Love, love The Crawford Hotel",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Location and Charm,"Amazing location with on site access to the light rail and a short, clean and safe ride to and from the airport. But location in the historical Lodo district is just the tip of the iceberg.  We were greeted by Tara at the front desk and felt immediately welcomed. The rooms high ceilings and massive windows is perfect for people watching in front of Union Station. A daily free pint of local brew at the historical Terminal Bar along with daily servings of ice cream at the Milkshake Creamery make the family happy too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Prime location, Not so prime room...","You can't get a better location in the heart of downtown Denver; however I am sure you could find a better hotel room. The rooms are small and not very secluded from the rest of the main terminal. The front door of my room looked out onto the Snooze, the ever so loud and always packed breakfast joint below and was situated just off the elevator to the left of the main terminal.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Charming and modern hotel in the heart of downtown Denver,"The staff was great here. I like the rooms that surround/look out onto the inside of Union Station.  They have more light and most have high ceilings.  I have stayed at this hotel two times.  It is clean and modern.  They have a little gym w/ no windows and it has most of what you need or you can head outside for a workout! There are plenty of places to eat nearby and the bar scene inside of Union Station was fun. This is a lively hotel and it was pretty loud at night because the bar inside of Union Station stays lively until later hours-bring your earplugs if you are a light sleeper or get a room down the hallways (even though they are a bit darker). There is a little coffee maker inside the hotel room to wake you up.  There is also a delicious coffee place right downstairs called PigTrain.  Terrific hotel for family, friends stay or single travel.  One of the most unique locations for a hotel in any city. Parking-There are lots of parking lots nearby to save you money vs. valet parking if you are driving.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent upscale choice close to downtown attractions,"My husband and I have stayed here twice so far -- once in a Deluxe Classic and once in the Lodi Suite.  Both stays were highly enjoyable and we look forward to returning again.  The location is excellent, as Union Station is surrounded by many options for dining and is within comfortable walking distance to the Pepsi Center, the Denver Center for Performing Arts, the ball field, and many other attractions in downtown Denver.  The small fountain plaza outside the hotel is a gathering place for families in the summertime and the confluence of Cherry Creek and the Platte River are just a stroll away.Apart from checking in, we haven't interacted much with the staff, but check-in was quick and courteous.   We've always appreciated the room decor and found the beds to be comfortable.  Union Station itself is a fun place to hang out in the evening and enjoy drinks or a bite to eat.  I highly recommend the Crawford for an upscale hotel stay in a vibrant,  setting.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Experience,"This was our first time at the Union Station since the remodel and I have to say it's absolutely beautiful!!Also, our first time at the Crawford and I have to say it was a perfect weekend. Even though I thought their prices were a little high for October it was well worth it.  Room was clean & bright; loved the big windows. The staff was exceptional; they went above and beyond to make sure our stay was a pleasant one.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Stay,"We spent the weekend at the Crawford and really enjoyed it. It's a unique hotel with so much to do right at the station & within short walking distance. I could see how the nightlife noise from the station below might be annoying to some, but we were so tired it didn't seem to bother us. The staff was consistently pleasant and the courtesy car was a really nice amenity (It will take you anywhere within 2 miles for free). It's not a cheap room, but if you're willing to splurge a little its definitely a nice place to stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic stay,"From the plane to the train to the hotel, all so convenient to The Crawford at Union Station. Great location in downtown Denver with a lobby full of dining, drinking and shopping options. Loved My stay at the Crawford!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fabulous Experience,We stayed here last weekend and had a wonderful experience!  We have 3 children and it was a pleasant experience for all of us!  they supplied a crib for our little one and the room had tons of room for us to spread out all of our belongings!  The shower was lovely with the rain spout option and the beds were VERY comfortable!  The room itself was very plush and modern and the views out front were fun for the littles to check out.  The staff was exceptional as we had a carseat that was lost at the airport and needed the staff at the front to exchange out the seats when the man from Southwest arrived.  They had our rental car out front when needed and the free ice creams daily were a hit!  The Union Station is such a fun environment to be a part of!  Everything is there and the restaurant choices were perfect for our family.  Thank you to the staff for a great experience!!!  We would for sure come back and visit!!!!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Overnight in an historic place,"Great location, very comfortable room, easy new connection to Denver airport (at a very affordable price), disappointing extra charges on the hotel bill ($20 Amenities charge?  Union Preservation charge?  These should have been included in the basic price).  Union Station has been refurbished nicely and all the amenities are popular.  A real benefit to the city.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Location,"Beautiful rooms, near the Pepsi Center and restaurants. The room itself was very roomy and filled with all the amenities one would need. We did not try room service, but took advantage of the complementary items available within Union Station. The hotel is centrally located so walking was a breeze. We did use valet parking which the hotel discounts for using..great bonus as we did not need to worry about parking once we checked in. Staff extremely friendly.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Centrally located in LoDo,"My husband and I just stayed at The Crawford from Wednesday to Sunday morning and we loved it. The hotel is located within the train station, which makes it very unique! During the day it is filled with people coming and going from the trains. The hotel ""lobby"" also offers a few shops and a great bar, Terminal. It is also located and surrounded by a variety of bars and restaurants that are in short walking distance. The rooms are spacious and the decoration is a mix of eclectic modern. I would definitely stay here again on our next visit! Side note: it was my husband's and I 6 month wedding anniversary and the hotel had a bottle of champagne and a flower arrangement waiting for us as we entered our room!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic place to stay,"Every aspect is staying at the Crawford Hotel was amazingly great. The rooms were unique style and top notch. The service across the board from the reception staff, to valets, to housekeeping went out of their em way to ensure our stay was pleasurable.  Mike Schmidt personally provide wonderful support prior and during our stay in recommending and coordinating fun and interesting things for us to do. The location is primo. Downtown in the night life district and the newly renovated train station made for fun things to do and easy access.5 stars all the way around. Highly recommend anyone visiting Denver stay at the Crawford",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Romantic Luxury Close to Home,"My wife and I were looking for a luxury hotel experience to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. It needed to be near enough to home so that we could easily travel there, but far enough that we would feel we were getting away. We had recently visited the newly re-furbished Union Station, and so we chose the Crawford. We booked the Date Night package, and were able to get a free upgrade when we checked in. The room was beautiful, comfortable, and romantic. The staff was very helpful - I engaged one of the concierge to spring a little surprise on my wife. We had complimentary cocktails at the Cooper Lounge (part of the Date Night package,) which is an elegant spot on the mezzanine, and then dined at Rare & Stoic, enjoying fresh sea food. The Crawford lived up to all our expectations. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Special Occasion destination in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful and eclectic,"I stayed in The Crawford last weekend.  It has the best and most convenient location in the city. It was so easy to take the train to Union Station right from the airport. $9.00 pp each way, 35 minutes and no traffic later you are steps away from the beautiful lobby of the hotel. The lobby offers bars , restaurants, an ice cream and coffee shop all of which you get full sized servings included with your stay.  I stayed in #337. It  had the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in and lovely soft qualify linens. A fantastic bathroom with great toiletries and a 2 headed shower. In every aspect it was a great stay and I would highly recommend it to everyone staying in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun atmosphere,"Arrival from airport was a breeze.  Hotel staff was extremely pleasant and accommodating.  The location was convenient for walking/jogging/biking (park near by), eating (so many options), exploring the city and meeting up with people.  I will definitely stay at The Crawford Hotel the next time I am in Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect location in the city,"Loved staying in this hotel with my family. Perfect location, tons of amenities at your finger tips. Stay includes free ice cream daily for the kids and a coffee. Happy hour at the Terminal Bar includes a free beer. Great place to hang out during the day in the huge, spacious lounge. Shuffleboard. 2 great restaurants in the building for breakfast. Lots of options for dinner close by as well. 2 cool bars for after dinner drinks in the building as  well. The rooms are spacious. Luxurious shower with the rain head :) Comfi beds with nice views. Farmers Market out front on Sat morning. Steps to the train station. We used it to/from the airport. Drops you off steps from the Crawford Hotel. Highly rec for your next stay in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best hotel lobby ever!,"Beautiful hotel in the best location in Denver.  I could go on at length to describe the clean, spacious and attractive rooms and the great service but the highlight for us was the lobby. We were able to kick back in the evenings with a craft beer from the Terminal Bar, play a few rounds of shuffleboard and meet new people while taking in the ambience of the restored station. Definitely a highlight of our trip.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun for Train Lovers,"Fun for Train Lovers We love trains. This place was perfect for us. Our room overlooked the tracks where train and people watching were abundant. Our room type was the Pullman, room 216. Extremely quiet and comfortable. Loved the bathroom barn style door. The lobby is not your mother's typical lobby.  It is a vibrant cross section of travelers. We were slightly surprised by the required amenities package but, turned out to be a big plus as it lured us to the lobby which we enjoyed immensely. Included in the package were ice cream , local craft beer, and coffee for each of us in the lobby. The package also had use of car and driver within a two mile radius and wifi. Location was great. We used the car to go to the Molly Brown house then leisurely ambled back to hotel.  We explored as we toured to our hearts content.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful Boutique Hotel in Downtown Train Station!,"Had occasion to visit Denver recently and, through a wild set of circumstances, the reservations I thought I had, I didn't.  So, frankly we were scrambling for a room at 1:30 AM in Denver.  We were beat, having flown FRONTIER Airlines non-stop from Tampa, leaving 2 hours late.  BTW, Frontier sucks... but that will be another review.In any case, I called the Crawford, and they had a couple of rooms.  When we showed up we were a bit surprised to find that it was literally located in a train station.  I'm talking subway station, not locomotives, but, still, it was different.The person at the desk was the same one I spoke with on the phone, and he remembered me, and greeted us warmly and professionally.  This place is upscale, there is no doubt about that.  Very classy.  This was a Sunday night, and he said that in the morning the train station would be bustling, and that if we wanted to come down there were restaurants, coffee shops etc.  I asked about the noise, and he assured me not to worry, and said they spent a fortune on soundproofing materials when they built the hotel.  He checked us in very efficiently, and up to the rooms we went.The rooms were beautiful, with vaulted ceilings, and a skylight cut into it; there was a nice work desk, large flat panel TV, and, most importantly (at least at that time of night), a big, comfortable, king size bed.  The bathroom was luxe, and replete with high end bath products, as one would expect.  The shower was very large, and very luxurious, with two shower heads, one a rain head.I wanted to mention that even though the next morning was Monday, and the train station was full when we checked out, they were absolutely correct about the sound insulation.  We never heard a thing.  One more thing.  The have a Mercedes SUV that offers complimentary transportation to guests if you're going anywhere within a 2-3 mile radius of the hotel.  Very thoughtful, and very convenient.  Highly recommended!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Impeccable and stylish hotel in the heart of it all, but pricey!","First time in Denver for a short girls weekend - concert at red rocks and exploring downtown. We chose the Crawford based on convenience when traveling from the airport via rail system and planned to take a shuttle leaving from union station to red rocks. The rail was not operating when we arrived, however we were still very glad we chose the Crawford! Union Station is such a lively place and we enjoyed the restaurants and perks for hotel guests (Snooze call-ahead seating, complimentary coffee and ice cream in lobby), and walkability to nearby areas (Larimer square). The room was well appointed and large enough for the two of us since we didn't intend to spend much time in the room but would not be large enough if traveling with our young children. Enjoyed the complimentary iPad in the room. Concierge arranged dinner reservations at a fabulous restaurant (Rioja) in Larimer square. enjoyed drinks at the second floor hotel bar for guests only. I would stay at this posh hotel again if traveling with a friend or spouse and wanted to splurge, but you could also visit Union Station without staying at the hotel. I did not find other hotels in the area that looked very nice for much less so i would say if you are close to this price range definitely splurge and stay here!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Cool, fun place","Great hotel in a fantastic location.  Room was different than your standard hotel room, but super nice and really cool.  Location was great and the amenities were more than expected, even at a higher end property.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Over delivered in every way,"The room was great and the location was outstanding. But what really set this place apart was the customer service.

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, amazing staff","I reserved this hotel, as I was coming in from Ohio to surprise my boyfriend for his birthday.  Not only did the staff upgrade my room to a suite because I told them why I was there, but also sent us a bottle of champagne to the room, along with a birthday card, to add to the celebration. The amenities of free coffee and ice cream, as well as free drinks for happy hour were premium! I will definitely be back in the future. Getting there from the Denver airport is a breeze.",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great concept, location!!","The Crawford is a pretty awesome addition to Denver's downtown scene. The Union Station redevelopment is quickly becoming a new city in and of itself, and that is no understatement. To say this is revitalizing downtown is putting it mildly. Lodo and the surrounding neighborhoods were already well on their way, but now this puts it over the top. IMHO, The Crawford is the center point. This is THE ideal place to stay when visiting Denver. There cannot be a better location. Restaurants, shops, sports, transportation are steps away. The whole vibe in and around Union Station is awesome. Tons of vitality, its clean, seemingly safe and generally cool! The Crawford comes at a pretty hefty price point, but I think its worth it. They have a sweet Tesla courtesy car (reserve early!), they buy you a drink at the Terminal Bar at happy hour and can get your priority seating at Snooze for breakfast. However, you need to call a day ahead of time. (Re; Snooze, I think its played out and not as good as everyone thinks. Skip it, go to Mercantile just down the hall, its really good and no wait!)The hotel itself is not your average hotel by any means. It's new, so the rooms are all still very nice. We opted to pay up for one of their loft rooms. They are really cool. The layout and decor are all very unique. More like an apartment than a hotel room. The furnishing and artwork are done in a great style. Exposed beams, wood floors, all really neat. The windows are more like sky lights, so in this particular room, if you were hoping for a view, it wasn't quite there. But it didn't bother us one bit. The beds are very comfortable, extra blankets and pillows. Nice ropes, slippers, etc. Overall, excellent.I rarely give out 5 stars, and this is no exception. 5 stars means perfection and the Crawford wasn't quite perfect, although it certainly could be. I was disappointed to not find any sort of radio/music in the room that we could plug our iphones into. They do have ipads with a dedicated website, as many nicer hotels do these days. It has a radio function, but if you are familiar with Apple Radio, you'll know that only about 20% of the stations actually work and when they do it just plays thorough the ipad. I was also bummed to find no PPV on the tv. Enough said about that. The biggest hit against the Crawford was that there was a razor left in the shower from the past guest. This is inexcusable and leaves one with a not so comforting feeling. The soap dispenser in the shower (right next to where the razor was left) was also broken. Because we generally have a great stay, we let this go unsaid. In hind sight, should have mentioned to the staff.Overall, stay here. It is a really cool place. Unbelievable setting and such a unique experience. As you will find out, it's not cheap but I'd rather pay the money to stay here than the Brown Palace, Ritz or Four Seasons.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing location,The Hotel is located in the renovated train station and it looks amazing! It also has a couple of great restaurants inside the station including a Snooze which is delicious. I highly recommend this trendy hotel which is very cozy.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent on all counts! ,"Stayed at The Crawford for a family friend's wedding, and had an amazing time! The staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was a positive one. My party accidentally booked one room for just one night instead of two, but our intention was to book two nights-Marie solved the issue in a flash and could not have been nicer!!! Will definitely be staying here again should we return to Denver. Thanks to all at The Crawford for your consideration and making our experience so wonderful!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Such a unique place to turn 70!,"Rode Amtrak from California to Denver.  Two steps later, inside the Union Station! Rats! Now we're spoiled forever.  Ah, such special treatment.  Champagne. Flowers.  Beautiful room facing the trains (by choice!) Dominic at front desk is excellent, and made our stay all the more memorable. A unique place to turn 70, remembering that old age is a privilege, granted to few...",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,TootToot Crawford,"the Crawford Hotel is inside Denver's Union Station The property is very attractive and a feeling of fun throughout with numerous restaurants at varied levels  The busiest restaurant is Snooze which is open for breakfast and lunch only and a must while staying at the Crawford  A very well trained, polite, and accommodating staff acts to to upscale yet comfortable feeling  Situated in the Lodo section of Denver is another big plus  The top floor rooms a called lofts which to me are junior suites with a small dividing wall between bedroom and living room  These rooms are very large with an incredibly complete bathroom",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"cool, spacious, modern hotel in the old train station","Really enjoyed my stay at the Crawford Hotel. Great room, bathroom, shower, bed. Great temperature control. The A.C. unit worked at a low hum, not a deafening roar as at so many other hotels. I could hear some trains out the window at night, but they weren't too loud. The folks at the front desk were consistently helpful. There was great coffee in the a.m. at The Pig Train cafe. There is a restaurant downstairs called The Mercantile, which is truly fantastic. There's a balcony bar in the train station which was terrific -- high-ceilinged, beautiful, comfortable and cool bartenders. (Yummy bar nuts.) And there was a noisy, tasty breakfast spot called Snooze with inventive egg dishes. (I sat outside on the patio, which was delightful and not noisy at all.) All of the wait staff I dealt with at the Union Station location were friendly and smart. And, to top it all off, there's a train from the hotel that goes straight to the airport. Really convenient. What can I say, this place was great. (I did find a gym elsewhere as the gym associated with the property, at a nearby hotel, was old and in desperate need of updating.)",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,No service. Not almost a 5 star hotel as alleged,"I appreciate the restoration of Union Station, but the Crawford is a very basic hotel when it comes to service. No offer of help with bags when check in. No late night room service. You pay a resort fee for the""perk"" of beer , ice cream, bottled water and coffee. Have to request turn down service. Water not replenished, had to ask...No offer of help--it is self service. More like a boarding house on top of the train station rather than a hotel experience.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Must Stay,"The crawford is a great place to stay in denver. We stayed here on a vacation and found ourselves not wanting to leave the hotel and common areas. The restaurants are great, the rooms are well done, the staff is friendly and accomodating and the common areas are large. The hotel has a great energy.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Playing tourist while in for a wedding,"What a beautiful hotel!  All the amenities of Union Station in the lobby ... plus as a hotel guest (for the $20 fee), you receive so many perks!  A Tesla courtesy car, complimentary ice cream, coffee, craft beer; 20-25% off boutiques and restaurants in the station/lobby.  Our room was awesome with a huge rainhead shower.  We explored LoDo, local breweries, 16th Street mall, the Denver Zoo.  We took the train from DIA straight to the hotel.  Next day took the train to the suburbs for a wedding.  Would absolutely stay here again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Shinning Example of the Fun and Modern Denver,"First time to Denver is 27 years and what a difference! Loved it and what the city has become. The Crawford is a shining example of the fun and modern Denver. The location can’t be beat for a fun time right in the Denver Union Station a center of activity. We really enjoyed walking downstairs and having a variety of food and drink choices. While we were there we ate lunch, breakfast, Milkbox ice cream, drinks, coffee, etc… I was really impressed how a functioning train station could be so well kept, clean and a fun social scene.  It is also right in walking distance to lots of great restaurants for dinner. The rooms are modern, clean, well-organized. The bathroom was luxurious with rain showers. I had a ball using the in-room iPad to order room service and get our car from the valet. If you really want to be in the center of things and have lots of options this is a terrific location.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Good location, pricy (for me), soothing","+ Union Station is bustling with lots of activity on this Saturday afternoon.+ Fast & friendly check-in.+ Very quiet room (404).+ iPad in the room. The software crashed often.+ Some food/drink perks as a guest.- Expensive at $300 per night. And that is the cheap rate.- Needs some refurbishing. Our room furniture was banged up. The bathroom cold water faucet turned on in the wrong direction. Our broken reading lamp was taken away, but never replaced. The ""reading"" chair is impossible to sit in. The chair ""designer"" should be punished. - While the internet radio via the iPad is cool, it is annoying to use as 80% of the stations are not working.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great historic hotel in a prime location,This revitalized hotel is in Union Station right in the heart of Denver.  Within walking distance to many attractions and the 16th street mall. Added advantage if you're arriving at the Denver airport - the new light rail brings you right to the hotel door. Upgraded rooms have rain showers and tubs.  All have historic decor. The lobby area is teaming with food and drink options.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Luxury hotel: Comfortable Bed, Location+, Accomodating, but Fit & polish missing","Best: The comfortable bed and the location of the hotel.Worst: The lack of fit and polish for a $450/night room.Service: The service was good. The staff was very responsive. We had stayed at the Crawford previously and had a great experience. The room had been extremely quiet and we were impressed. This time, however, we were unhappy with or struggled with three things upon arriving. 1. We complained about a loud knocking noise in the ceiling. Was not expecting that at a luxury hotel. The hotel sent an engineer up right away. Never figured it out, though, and we put up with it. We managed to sleep as well as we ever do in hotels.2. We had trouble figuring out the phone messaging system, and they sent the same guy to help us with that. That was solved.3. When we first arrived, we immediately tried to take a nap. The noise from the train tracks just below our window kept me awak: the robotic female voice announced the arrival of trains every 30 seconds to a minute. It was less than I would expect from a luxury hotel, so I complained. The staff said the trains ran until 1am and then started again at 3am, and offered to let us change rooms. I really doubted the announcements would go on all night every minute, so I just asked for a discount off the bill, and the staff took $100 off the total and I was happy. (Turns out I was right: the announcements stopped even if the trains were still running. It was only the voice that bugged me.)The Room: a Deluxe Classic on the west side, which had a lovely King bed. Very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and neat and light-filled. The fixtures looked very retro and classy. Some fit and polish was missing for a room that costs $450 a night:1. The rolling chair in the room didn't roll. The arms below the base that connect to the rollers were cheap, thin aluminum. It seemed that someone dropped a heavy weight on the chair at some point so that some of the arms got wrenched about 10 degrees off center, which prevented the rollers from rolling 360 degrees.2. No explanation of how the phones worked. You have to press the white button to turn the phone on before you can get your messages. This is not how our landline works at home, and definitely nothing like our cell phones work.3. Weird knocking in the ceiling of the bathroom as I mentioned above.4. Noise carrying from the train station below our window as stated above.Otherwise the room was quiet, insulated from most noise from other rooms.Location: FANTASTIC. That's why we stayed here. We live along the Front Range and we like to take the bus to Denver, land at Union Station, and then walk 300 feet to our hotel room in the station. There are fantastic restaurants and bars are right there, including the Kitchen Next Door. Other historic restaurants and sights are just a block away such as Wynkoop Brewing and the Tattered Cover book store. The River Walk is just two blocks away to the west where you can walk along the Platte River on a nice bike path with parks. Just a block away is the 16th Street Mall and shops with access to the Mall Shuttle, which runs every few minutes and can take you downtown as well as anywhere along the way. Amentities: Pretty good. The in-room iPad for interfacing with the hotel could be better, such as including a check out button, but you can make dinner reservations, order room service and call maintenance (!) from the app (which you can also load to your phone). There is a full refrigerator, but we did not use it. There is an in-room spa service, which we also did not use.One downside is that the Crawford charges an Amenities and Services Fee of 20.00 to everyone, which allows you to get one beer, one scoop of ice cream, and a cup of coffee free each day you stay at the hotel. Also you get access to a pick up within 2 miles of the hotel at any time day or night. And you get free rental of two bicycles when available. We didn't do any of that. Didn't meet our specific needs. Kind of wish we could have opted out. Also, I didn't realize that we could have asked for 25% off food and non-alcoholic beverages at several of the smaller venues in the station until I got home to write this review. The text display on the app where you can get this information is not very readable. The web site on a big screen is more readable, but I didn't read that before I left home with only a phone and tablet to access that info. So, that part was my bad.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Never disappointing,"I have stayed at the Crawford several times, and their eagerness to please is refreshing. Rooms are always clean, security is great since the facility is located in Denvers Union Station. In short, its a comfy place away from home.  However, the do need makeup mirrors in their bathrooms, but in my mind they are still a *5",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Horrible,"Expensive with no service. No one helped me with my bag and no turn down service. Ridiculous at this price. They have no kitchen so they bring you a tiny take out breakfast in paper cups with plastic utensils. Charge you $20 amenities so you can get a ""free"" cup of coffee and an ice cream. Can't get a reservation at the downstairs restaurant. Their business model is charged as much as you can and provide an average room with no services.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Interesting location,This hotel is located in Union Station. I took the train in from the airport which was very easy and convenient. There is a moment when you arrive when you are looking around to find the actual hotel. I would comment that as a woman traveling alone it is a little disconcerting to come back in the evening with people milling around waiting for the train. You wonder how easy it is for people to be all through the hotel. The rooms are comfortable but very compact. If I was traveling with my husband it would have been very tight.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Oportunity missed,"Cheap furniture in the rooms, no thought given to modern technology, no cable. As a native of Denver I was so excited about the development of union station and all the great new building in LoDo. I wouldn't recommend this hotel. Sorry. Just don't understand what they were thinking.",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,From another era.....,This architecturally beautiful hotel is like a walk back in time but with all the modern conveniences and a professional and courteous staff. The suite was spacious and well furnished without feeling to commercial. Will definitely stay here next time I'm in town.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,50th Birthday Weekend,"Please believe me when I say the pictures do not do it justice. This is a grand train station brought back to life with the best hotel I have ever  had the pleasure of occupying. It was unreal, the detail. The Crawford staff placed a bottle of Champs with a very personal note in my room. The room  décor was  beautiful. The bathroom was everything I have ever wanted a hotel bath to be.  The safe in the bathroom and the old door from the P.O. that was reused in the bathroom was  in great shape.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Date night away,"The Crawford made me look good! The date night package is one heck of a deal. The front desk staff we friendly and helpful in providing tips for the area. The historic touches in the common areas keep the hotel rooted in Union Stations beginnings. The room was wonderful. Exposed brick, wood beams, comfortable bed, and very limited train noise made for a great slumber. We were thrilled with Snooze AM Eatery room service for breakfast. It was piping hot and even more delicious without the hour plus wait. We will definitely be back for another occasion.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location in Lodo District,Room was spacious and well stocked with amenities.  Impressed with availability of technology for use in room.  Staff was friendly and very helpful. Location was perfect for visiting events and activities in the Lodo District of Denver.  Disappointed a car and driver was not available for our trip to one of the area attractions.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,excellent,Just a great experience. Part of Union Station so extremely convenient to the airport train. Staff is excellent and beyond helpful. Location in LoDo provides a ton of options both within the building and also within a short walk. Lots of interesting perks like the priority seating at Snooze and a free beer at Terminal Bar. A first class operation and definitely would stay again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A great hotel!,"I stayed here with my 3 adult sons, and it was fantastic! It was so convenient to be dropped off right outside the door after taking the train in from the airport! I overlooked the lobby, and before we arrived I was worried about the noise level. I was SO impressed with the quietness of the rooms! The staff was very friendly, and I would recommend this hotel highly! This is the ONLY place I will stay in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, but amenities & furnishings come up short","The Crawford Hotel is in a great location in Denver's Union Station. I just returned from a 2 night trip and will most likely not stay there again. Here are the positives and negatives I experienced with my stay...Positives:- The Crawford is a short walk to many Denver attractions like LoDo shopping & restaurants, Coors Field & Pepsi Center.- The Crawford is literally steps off the train that runs from Denver Int'l Airport to Union Station. 37 minutes door to door for $9 per person.Negatives:- The Crawford is very expensive! We paid over $430 per night for what is called their ""Superior Classic"" room. The room was very small...like a Paris 3 star hotel. - Furnishings in room were substandard for a hotel at this price point. Missing knobs on drawers, scratches on many surfaces. See my pics. Also, the bed was just average. - There was no room service available after 10pm. You are completely out of luck if you arrive at the hotel late and hungry. Based upon my visit I can't believe this is the 3rd best rated Denver hotel on TripAdvisor. The Crawford is much too expensive for its small rooms and substandard furnishings.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Not relaxing for a female traveling solo.,"I have done a fair amount of traveling solo and, as a female, there are certain amenities that I count on as a matter of personal safety. While expensive, this hotel left a lot to be desired. The room service after 2:30pm is practically nonexistent  and there is no beverage service. Yes, there are restaurants/ bars in the busy Amtrak station but this may not be the most comfortable place for a woman traveling alone. There is no traditional hotel lobby or bar.The room itself was clean, modern and comfortable. There was no hard copy binder or folder with phone numbers and hotel information in my room- the iPad 'concierge' lost power so I had no access to information if there had been an emergency. The walls in the room were paper thin and the constant flushing of toilets could be heard at all hours. Housekeeping and management were aggressive the day of my checkout. Checkout was at noon. Housekeeping banged on the door and entered the room no less than 3 times that morning to see if I had checked out. At 12:03pm the housekeeper and what I assumed to be a manager- it felt like a bouncer- came to bang on the door again. I was all set to go anyway but having a loud male voice yell at me through the door asking if I still planned to check out that day was completely unnecessary. I was at the reception desk a few minutes later only to hear the 'bouncer' announce to the receptionist that my room was the only one had not checked out and that he was leaving for the day. This should have been done in private away from hotel guests. I finished checking out and was able to hop on the 12:15 train back to the airport.While modern, hip, and centrally located this hotel has a lot to learn about discretion, privacy and personal safety. I will be choosing a different hotel the next time I visit Denver.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Luxury in the Train Station,"We had one night left on our Colorado vacation and booked The Crawford Hotel, because of the reviews, the location, and other amenities in the area.  What a wonderful place.  The room was large, quite, and came with all the latest technology, including an iPad for fun and games.  Security was a plus with the key needed to use the elevator, access the hall door, and your room.  The ambience of Union Station really adds to the experience with restaurants, coffee shop, bar, and the hustle and bustle of an active station.  There are great restaurants in the area and you're not far from the baseball stadium.  Next time, I think I will try taking the train to the airport.  I definitely would stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Favorite Hotel in Denver,Every time I travel to Denver this is where I stay.  Great location in Denver with a lot of outstanding bars/restaurants in walking distance.  The train station in back will also bring you right to the airport(a lot easier than a cab).  The hotel bar is fantastic and great people watching.  Very friendly staff.  The rooms are very large and always clean.  Can't wait to go back.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"It's Not How You Start that Counts, It's How you Finish","Just had a great stay at this fashionable boutique hotel in the heart of the city.  Our daughter lives in a small one BR apart. in Denver, so when we visit we stay at a hotel.  We started our trip by taking the train from the airport directly to the Union Terminal, the site of this hotel.  When we arrived, I asked a lady on the train where the hotel was.  She pointed at some double doors and said ""right there"".  Couldn't get any easier than that!  Unfortunately, our room was not ready until the guaranteed time of 3:00pm.  This was very disappointing.  As a world traveler, I always give notice to hotels if I am arriving early, have any special requests, etc.  I have always found that it is rare that a hotel can not adjust cleaning schedules, etc. to accommodate early arrivals.  Not in this case.  So, we waited in the lobby for about 2 1/2 hours.  Despite my prior notice and checking several times while we waited, the room was not ready until the ordinary check-in of 3:00 pm.  The first room we were assigned was noisy.  It was a great room with high ceilings and lots of windows because it was a corner location.  However, there was a building being constructed directly across the street and the construction noise woke us up early.  This was our second disappointment as I had given the hotel prior notice that I would like a quiet room as my wife was recovering from some long term medical treatments and needed to rest during the day.  The good news is that a manager, Marie, was very understanding and showed me three other choices for rooms.  The most quiet was actually an upgrade and it turned out to be a great room.  So, are these rooms soundproof?  Well, the short answer is ""no"", but the hotel has done a great job in making them as quiet as possible given the location right at the train station.  In fact, the only noise that sticks with me was the rather pleasant and quaint sound of a train's bell as it approached the station.  I kind of liked it.  We were also introduced to the Cooper Lounge by the hotel staff.  That was a great find and a perfect place for a cocktail away from the hustle and bustle of the train station lobby.  There are some nice perks staying here.  We used the complimentary hotel car several times to deliver us to restaurants, etc. in the downtown area.  There is a daily amenities fee added to your hotel room charge.  Also, don't forget to tip the drivers of the hotel car.  All very pleasant and polite to deal with.  Given the central location and car service, we found it unnecessary to rent a car and pay the high valet parking each day on top of the rental.  We did not use some of the freebies and discounts offered if you stay at the hotel.  However, we did have the free coffee and enjoyed drinking it on the outside patio of the lobby coffee bar each morning.  We would definitely stay here again.  All in all, we consider this a great find and an adventurous place to stay. You are in the middle of the action with shops and restaurants right in the renovated train station.  The walk to Coors Field for a baseball game was just a short jaunt from the hotel.  I would recommend staying here and we will likely do so next time we travel to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A true gem of a hotel.,"As a weekly business traveler.. You become used to certain ""perks"" . I am a lifetime Starwood platinum member with over 600 nights at those hotels. - On my recent trip to Denver I decided to try this hotel. The train from the airport ends there and I thought that will be easy. - Arriving at 10 am.. Of course I try to check in... Not available. (Keep in mind if this was a Starwood hotel I would have gotten into a room) . .. Anyway. I wait until 3 pm to finally get into a room. Miles at the front desk could not have been more helpful. Bottom line. This hotel/ location, is perfect especially if you take the train. The rooms are wonderful, outstanding etc. The showers might be the best I have ever been in on the road. Union station which surrounds this hotel is amazing. Tons of things to do from restaurants to coffee shops to just hanging out on couches . Plus it is a half block to the 16th street free bus...and red bikes you can ride all over Denver for $5 bucks. Would I stay here again YES. and I will . - I would say it is worth not getting early assess to a room for all the reasons listed above. DO IT.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Head of North America,"First Class, I like 4 & 5 star hotels. The rooms are spacious, with a western (woods, leather) retro (colors, mirror bordered bed frame and superb painting of a 20's female bathing suit-- I thought it was real inside a shadow box) elegance (high ceilings, linen curtain, high back chair)The team at the front desk were professional, helpful and even nice and fun. They also have a partnership with the spa and gym next door.Plus super amenities and the train from the airport stops right outside! What's not to Love.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,What a unique hotel ,My husband and I stayed for a short time in August 2015. The hotel is absolutely adorable and the rooms are huge. We stayed in a large one bedroom with a beautiful bathroom. The rooms were exceptionally clean and nicely decorated. The hotel itself is located within an Amtrak station and had a great bar with excellent food and libations. I highly recommend staying here if you are in town. They also provided transportation to dinner one night in a brand new Tesla.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,It's an actual Amtrak station lobby.....,"Our room was small but very stylish. The building itself is beautiful and central to down town Denver. The problem was that the""lobby "" of the hotel is literally an Amtrak station with a ticket booth etc.  it's a working train station , so you may not like some of the characters you will come across paying $350/night for a room. Also, there is no public bathroom for hotel guests alone--the public bathroom is shared by restaurant goers and train passengers. The parking was $48 a night which was outrageous. There are plenty of nearby lots that will charge you $20 a day.    I probably won't come back. Oh. The room was very clean.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Excellent stay, loved it, can't wait until next visit!","Staying at The Crawford made a great trip even better. The room and bathroom were beautiful, and the bed was very comfortable. Nespresso in the room was nice.  One day we didn't want the room cleaned, and it only took a call to the front desk to get our water, coffee and cream restocked. Like everyone else, I have to mention the freebies every day (coffee, ice cream, beer) were lovely.  You get a discount at the deli, and the food was great.  The bookstore and shops are also fun to check out.  We really enjoyed the beer and people watching at the Terminal Bar.  Also, the car service was an unexpected and fantastic perk to the stay.  Great location for the hotel, as well.  One small problem with our breakfast room service order was solved promptly and satisfactorily with a quick call to the front desk.  The young woman who checked us in accompanied us to our room, helped with luggage, suggested a good restaurant and booked our ride there.  All hotel staff with whom we interacted were wonderful:  helpful and polite.Our stay was a complete delight.  The only thing that could have made it better is if a fairy godmother had appeared and said it was magically free!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Nestled in a Rail Station,"This wonderful new (2014) hotel has been constructed within the renovated Union Rail Station Terminal in Lower Downtown Denver.  Named after Dana Crawford, the lady behind the restoration of the Union Station and area, this is a unique and delightful place to stay in Denver.  The lobby is actually the giant former waiting room for the railroad trains that used this facility.  It is now filled with bars, boutique shops, fast food outlets and the hotel front desk!  The rooms are tastefully decorated with exposed wooden timbers, vaulted ceilings and leather furniture. We stayed in the LoDo Suite (which they say is the attic area) and the living room is separated from the bedroom with a small stepped down staircase. It included both a powder room and a full bath with soaking tub and rainshower stall. We also had an IPod for a clock (and entertainment toy).  Highly recommend this wonderful hotel in an up and continually growing hot spot area away from the old commercial center by the convention center (but just a short few blocks away and easily reached using the free 16th street Mallride shuttle).The hotel charges a nominal daily ""Amenity Fee"" that includes free WiFi, a small coffee at the Pigtree Coffee shop, an ice cream cone from the Milkbox Ice Creamery, and free chauffeured transportion via Mercedes Van to local areas.  They were kind enough to offer this to us to visit the Denver Botanical Gardens (just barely out of their free transport range) and our wonderful delightfully cheerful and helpful driver, Cameron took great care of us to and from. This is the place to stay in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location but way too expensive,"We were visiting Denver for the weekend and wanted to give the Crawford a try as it looked really unique. The location is central and there are lots of things to do within walking distance. The main Union State ""terminal area"" has lots going on with bars, restaurants and small shops. This is all fantastic but the hotel and room part is where the greatness ends.  After taxes, activity fee and valet parking we paid almost $700 per night for a very basic room that we thought would be a worthwhile splurge. We were definitely wrong and the shower was the only really nice part. Don't try to have a night in if you are tired as the in-room dining is basically non-existent it has so little to offer, and there are no movies available to purchase. Housekeeping is also a joke. Our bed was barely made, the water which we pay for in the activity fee was never replaced, the bathroom items including toilet paper were not replaced and the trash in the room wasn't emptied.  When we mentioned this at checkout they took off the $20 activity fee which I guess was better than nothing. Overall the level of service just doesn't equal the price and we wouldn't return.",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great location, gorgeous building, excellent service","Location and the setting of Union Station is a great backdrop for the hotel. Super convenient access on the A line from and to the airport makes this a no-brainer for trips to downtown Denver. The front desk is basically just a nook off the main hall of the rebooted Union Station, definitely unique and fun space compared to a typical hotel lobby. The staff was excellentI took advantage of their local (2-mile radius) car service to get to my dinner meeting, a definite bonus. My room was a ""Classic"" room with huge windows and tall ceilings, very nicely decorated. Excellent rain shower in the bathroom. The room types seem quite different from each other, so check out the styles before booking.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Pre-Visit,"I have not stayed at this hotel yet but I just spoke with a very rude  man who advised me that I called two hours late to make a change to my reservation to leave a night early (changing a 3 night stay to a two night stay). When I asked him whether I would not be charged for the last night if they rebooked I was told that I would still be charged over $500 for that night even though they will not be out of pocket.  I may need to check the consumer protection laws in Colorado on that point. In short, the rudeness and unhelpful ness of the reservation clerk has put me off the place before even arriving!",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford is FANTASTIC,"first of all the new light rail (""A"" Line) from the airport is fantastic, so much better than the enduro cab rides of previous visits.It's wonderful to jump off the train and right into Union Station. The station is beautiful and the Crawford being nestled within the station makes it even better.We were a bit early so we checked our bags to head over to Coor's Field and a Rockie's game. On our return our luggage was already in the room and we were handed our keys.The room itself was very pleasant, fourth floor, split level, truly felt as if we were staying in the old station but all the amenities were new.Wonderful shower and the bed was probably too comfortable.Only issue would be the window on the North wall. A bit high, they need a step or two along the wall to enjoy the view out of it. OH, Watch the door stop on the floor outside the bathroom, not a great location, stubbed my toes on it.We enjoyed several of the eateries and bars around the station, well as many as we could, all were great. It would be nice to be able to grab a late night snack though, and it seemed the nearest place on a Monday night was a few blocks away.I'm sure they will fix this soon.Coopers was excellent as was the Terminal bar, both inside and out.All in all The Crawford was a great stay.........Can't wait to return.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful hotel in Union Station,The Crawford Hotel is a beautiful hotel located in Union Station.  Getting there on the train from the airport was very easy.  Hotel is in a beautiful location and has excellent service.  We got there very early to drop off our bags but were told since they weren't booked up the night before we could have our room early.  We booked a Pullman car room and it was beautiful.  I would suggest a visit here the next time you are in Denver.  The car service which will take you anywhere in Denver approximately 2 miles from the hotel is a wonderful service!  We will definitely stay here again when in Denver.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Denver Business Trip,"Beautiful guest room, private & quiet. Card access for elevator use so makes security easy. Gorgeous location in the Union Station. Within walking distance to some many great attractions, restaurants, etc.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Derailed,"If you've ever wanted to sleep in a train station and wanted to pay $300 a night for the privilege of doing so, the Crawford is the place. The loby is a frenzy of acivity that will make your head swim at times with all the people coming and going. From rail commuters to people sleeping on benches, drunk baseballs fans, partiers, a DJ in the lobby, you name it... this place is crazy, too crazy for my taste. My room  -319 was a little cramped. Not much space to work on your laptop at the desk. Close quarters - like a sleeper cabin on a train:) Hotel staff were at time helpful and other times clueless and cold. I wasn't impressed with their client relations skills either. So my suggestion unless you want lots of noise and action is to skip this hotel and get a good nights rest!",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great stay!  Love the train station bar, ice cream, and coffee shop!","What a great place!  Rooms are very nice with outstanding decor.  The included ice cream, coffee, and beer every day is a great touch.  Definitely planning on bringing my wife here in the future as she is now envious of my stay!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great hotel!,The Crawford was built inside the Denver Union Station.  The architecture of the old station is gorgeous.  The location is central to all of Denver's fabulous restaurants and activities in town.  I know you will enjoy your stay in The Hotel Crawford.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best location in Denver!,"This hotel is in such a great location (right downtown physically inside Union Station) and has fantastic amenities (access to a great fitness center across the street, great restaurants right on the main lobby level, easy access to the train to the airport, etc, etc).  The staff are outstanding and always extremely accommodating with late check-outs or early check-ins, etc.The rooms are all brand new and have great layouts that make it easy to relax or get some work done.  High ceilings in the standard rooms make them seem way bigger than they actually are (they are a good size to begin with)I stay here every time I come to Denver without hesitation.  I don't even check for other hotels (unless the Crawford is sold out of course)",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Experience,"My husband and I stayed at the Crawford for our anniversary and it was great.  The loft room was huge with a separate sitting area.  Plus the complementary items and discounts  in Union Station were great.  Lastly, the luxury transportation service was an easy and pleasant surprise. I can't wait to stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Exceeded All Expectations,"After checking out different hotel options, we decided on The Crawford for our weekend getaway.  I can't only say that the nostalgic vibe this hotel provides is completely unmatched!  The terminal, which is now a combination of shops, a coffee shop, a bar, and a relaxing hangout is so well thought out that it blew us away.The room was phenomenal.  Quiet, upscale, fantastic decor, and was perfect.The staff at every spot within The Crawford was top notch and friendly.If you're looking for a great weekend spot, look no further!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome space in an awesome location!,"The Crawford is in the perfect location for walking around LODO Denver! The hotel is amazing, the Union Station amenities are super cool! We LOVED our time for our mother-daughter trip! So many great places to enjoy nearby! It is an historic venue w/ many modern touches!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Customer Service,"Beautiful hotel that perfectly matches the renovated Union Station.  How neat to take the light rail train from the airport and end up downtown right at your hotel.  A little pricey, but customer service that goes beyond what is expected.  I left my jacket on the train from the airport and the hotel had their driver pick it up at Lost and Found and they shipped it to me.  It's not like I left my jacket at the hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Everything was top notch,"The Crawford is not your cookie cutter luxury hotel, as you've probably already figured out by it's unique location inside Union Station. You are literally walking through the newly remodeled train station to the front desk. There are some good dining options right inside the station, and you're a 2 minute walk from 16th Street shopping.  We stayed in a standard room, but there was nothing standard about it. Floor to ceiling windows for days, huge king size bed, huge TV, huge clawfoot tub, plenty of plush comfortable seating. It felt like a palace. They put a lot of thought and money into the interior design. I loved this room so much, I didn't want to leave it.  Staff is really friendly and you get 2 bottles of water a day. Free Nespresso in the room. Just don't come here with a car, parking is ultra-expensive, and there is no street parking around the station.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome historic hotel,We had a great stay in Friday night. We were in a beautiful room with great views of the city. Loved the way the hotel hallways overlook the terminal! Tons of awesome food and drink options. Also so convenient to get anywhere in Denver from Union Station! Don't miss this amazing historic Denver spot.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,old time creature comfort,"To say in a strange place and like it better than home ! The staff is excellent, the amenities perfect and the bar impeccable! This stay was one for business travel, I will be back, hopefully with a companion!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Isn't She Lovely ,"Oh my!  This hotel was all that and more!  The husband and I decided to celebrate our anniversary in Denver and really be city people. So we took the light rail from Golden to Union Station and then sauntered in to Union Station to the Crawford. Well the station was bustling and suddenly we knew we were in a happening place!  Check in was easy and then to our room. Oh!  So wonderful!  Not too large but so tasteful and really, just lovely. Loved the super high ceilings and over the top large light fixtures. Everything is classy and well thought out throughout the hotel. Loved the bathroom with the sliding door, and although the shower was just a little small it had good water pressure and a nice shower head.  We loved being in the center of all the action. We walked to a matinee at DCPA and dinner. Denver is at your doorstep!  The next day we headed to the airport via the A Train to the Plane. Could not be any easier. This is truly the place to stay in Denver and we will return!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Classic Throwback,"The service was wonderful.  The rooms were impeccable.  I truly enjoyed the experience.  There is something romantic about the lobby, though finding check-in can be a bit confusing.  My only gripe is the distance from the valet.  I would love staying here again.  There is also a delightful bar in the lobby, thus making this hotel @A_Wine_O approved.  Highly recommend this place for a quick romantic get away.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Visiting family,"I spent two nights at the Crawford. I arrived by train from the airport. That was super easy and convenient. Entering the Crawford hotel gave me a burst of energy. Over the next 3 days, I got to see (and chat with) a variety of people. Not just  travelers: some charge their phones so they can pursue Pokemon chasing, some go to just get out of the house, families, couples and many pursuing good drink and food. It really does feel like Denver's living room / lounge.Hotel guests have added perks such as 1 free coffee, 1 beer and 25% discount at the coffee shop and a discount at nearby spa. The room was well-appointed and comfortable. All in all, a special city experience suitable for all types of travelers.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Date Night,"The Crawford is everything I hoped it would be. The property is beautiful, the staff is excellent, the rooms are classic. You can tell that so much thoughtful planning went into the details when this building was remodeled. I will definitely be coming back.I also highly recommend the date night package. Totally worth it.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Sisters Getaway,"This place rocked. I met 3 of my sisters there for a few days and we couldn't have picked a better place. The 4 of us shared a room and we had plenty of space, we never felt on top of each other. The decor of the entire place was awesome, so beautiful from head to toe. The Cooper Lounge located on the 3rd floor was the best! The selection of restaurants was top notch as well, I highly recommend eating at Stoic & Genuine it was the best meal I had in Denver. The location of the hotel can't be beat, it's easy to get to from the hotel by the train and so close to the 16th Street Mall. I would love to stay here again! It might be a little pricey on my own with my husband so it would have to be a special occasion but it will stay at the top of my list.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Modern, Gorgeous, Delightful Hotel","Where to start? Room service from the best brunch place in Denver? The Nespresso machine tucked into the beautiful armoire, the free rides in the Tesla, or the bustling train station and hip, local shops and restaurants? I can't pick a favorite part, but I'm going back as soon as I can. I loved the Mercantile nearby and the taco place across the street, too.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Downtown historical location with modern elegance,"The Crawford is a great addition to the new downtown Denver scene. Located in the newly renovated union station, you can be a part of the history while enjoying new restaurants, bars and hotel. We stayed in a loft room.  It was a comfortable size and did not have a great views. (Looked at another high rise). The Crawford has very comfortable beds, great ammenities (robes,water, turn down servixe, nice shampoos, thick towels) and fantastic service. The individual ipads in the rooms are an impressive touch. On the ipads, one can request wake up calls and see all of the hotel offerings and even request the valet. I could not figure out how to check-out though. It comes at a higher price, but the value is there, especially when comparing to other downtown hotels. Remember you are in a train station, so the rooms are a little noisy. Grab drinks at the upstairs bar, enjoy dinner at the Kitchen and eat breakfast at snooze (get there early). Parking is pricey, but average for downtown.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Experience!,Beautiful hotel in a historic train station. I loved the well-designed modern industrial room decor and access to Union Station amenities (as well as discounts).The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. A must stay for business or leisure travel.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Check for events,"Completely disappointed and will never stay in this hotel again.  Do yourself a favor and check to make sure they're not having an event during your stay. Events can go all night.  Even after we asked at check-in about the level of noise, we were assured by Jason that we will have no noise issues during our stay.  We have 3 young children here with us and they could not make any accommodations to move us to another room or make any concessions other than offer a free breakfast.  I wish I could post audio from our room so one can understand the level of noise.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location and wonderful service.,My wife and I booked the valet and stay package and were very impressed.  The location was perfect.  The front desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  They were full of great tips and ideas of things to do in the area.  The valet service was super fast.  The hotel itself is beautiful and has a fun vibe.  The king size bed was very comfortable and the bath room was big.  The only negative comment I have is the AC was weak and the coffee station had not been restocked when we checked in. Other than those small things our stay was perfect.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Can’t Go Wrong!,"My wife and I spent last Thanksgiving weekend at the Crawford.  We can only say “wow”.  The customer service continues to be over the top, a room with tall ceilings and comfy bed was just spectacular.  We even had a bottle of sparkly greeting us when we arrived, just over the top!We arrived via Amtrak, which is just outside of the Crawford, so the location was perfect.  Union Station is a happening place and this is where you would want to stay.  We did venture out to a local whisky distillery and the hotel provided a free service to get there and back (via a Tesla – way cool car!).  Miles was our driver this day and was ever so courteous and helpful.My wife and I have to thank everyone at the Crawford for a wonderful, wonderful stay!One last note, we had appetizers at the Cooper Lounge (reservation via the Crawford) and got a great place to sit.  The appetizers are excellent and the service was splendid.  Give it a shot .",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel We've Ever Experienced in the USA,"We absolutely loved this hotel, and here's why:Location:  Extremely convenient right in the Denver Union Station.  We arrived by train (California Zephyr) and it was just steps away from the platform.Ambience: The lobby/great hall was hopping.  Full of restaurants, bars, coffee shop, ice-cream shop, flower stand, book shop, frippery shops, and people enjoying themselves and coming-and-going on trains.  We loved the updated historic building and the energy of the place.Our Room:  We stayed in a Pullman room and it was awesome!  The bed was soft and comfortable with wonderful squishy pillows and amazingly soft sheets.  The bathroom was very cool with a sliding wood door reminiscent of of boxcars, with a huge shower and all the amenities, and the towels were the thickest/softest I've ever encountered.  Too bad I couldn't find the brand name on them - I'd love to have some of these at home!  There were electrical outlets everywhere in the room so that we could charge all of our gadgets - on the desk, on the vanity mirror/desk, and even on top of the headboard of the bed - perfect for those of us who use our smartphone/ipad as an alarm clock.  There were robes and slippers, and complimentary bottled water in the mini-fridge.  The room had an iPad on the vanity/desk top with access to all sorts of hotel and room service amenities, and free internet access.  The room was quiet - we didn't hear a peep from other rooms or from the lobby downstairs. We spent a great night here. Extras:  We were wowed by the extras this hotel offers.  These are the ones we utilized:  Free scoop of ice cream for each person from the shop in the lobby/great hall - Yummy!  Baggage hold: We also departed on the California Zephyr train that didn't leave until 7:00 PM.  The hotel graciously held our luggage after check-out so that we could explore Denver.  Thank you!  Complimentary car/driver within a 2-mile radius of the hotel.  That was amazing and wonderful.  Our driver, Miles, was great - friendly and professional.  We went to the Forney Museum of Transportation, which is actually beyond the 2-mile radius from the hotel, but the hotel offered to drive us there, anyway.  What amazing service!  We were surprised and thrilled - we were at the end of a 24-day train traveling vacation and were getting short of funds, so that complimentary drive instead of cab fare allowed us to afford a meal.  (Yes, we were able to tip our wonderful driver.) Thank you, Crawford Hotel!This was our best-ever hotel experience in the USA.  When we return to Denver, this is most definitely where we will stay.  We wouldn't consider anywhere else.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,An awesome visit!,"This property is located at Union Station in Denver. What a great location! The guest rooms are ""sound proofed"" so don't worry about being at a train/bus station. The room had a great view of the city and the furnishings were beautiful! We're looking forward to our next visit!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location,"Fabulous location next to the station - 2 mins walk. Friendly staff at check in. Room service selection not great. Omelettes for breakfast were in recycled packages - more hip than tasty! They forgot to clean my room on day 2 of my stay. Overall location good, bar looked cool and gym was good. I only had room service meal one evening and it was ok. Other restaurants looked busy.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome Property!,"What an amazing property!  A great mix of historic charm, with every modern amenity you could need!  Awesome layout with the train station below and many cool bars and shops below.  The staff was first class and did everything to make our stay memorable!  Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Denver!  Best atmosphere of any hotel in the city!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Spectatular Location,"I really loved this hotel for a 2 day stay in early July.  The rooms were amazing.  I stayed in a Pullman Room, and I loved the art deco but modern feel to the room.  Bed and bathroom were top notch.  The location in Union Station is absolutely the best location you can be in LoDo.  Tons and tons of amazing restaurants and bars nearby, especially right at the station.  The hotel gives you some great little perks too... a free draft at one of the bars inside the station for each guest, a free scoop of ice scream per guest at the ice cream parlor in the station, and a free cup of coffee per guest.  They also have a valet car on demand for free for any travel within the local downtown area, I think the radius was 2-3 miles. Flying into Denver, the new train runs downtown from the airport and stops right in front of the hotel, insanely convenient.  They have a train package where you get some sort of a discount for the train fare. You get what you pay for, and I thought this place was well worth the money.  A+++",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"5-Star, Very Unique Hotel","The Crawford is not like a typical hotel! We wanted somewhere special to stay after our sons wedding in Denver earlier in the day. This was our first stay recommended by friends. It really is one of a kind. The old Union Station has been remodeled into several shops, restaurants and an open common area to relax or work. The hotel sits above the station. Our room was quite unique with a mix of lovely exposed brick and modern furnishings. The huge shower and clean comfortable bed was heaven after a long day. The service and amenities were 5 star all the way. Those valets were really on the ball too. Don't let the traffic in front concern you, just roll up and they will be right there to take care of your vehicle. We will definitely return to the Crawford. Thanks for a great stay on our special day!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford to the Rescue!,"We had a bad experience at a AirBnB we booked. After one night we were desperate for a change. The Crawford had a great rate and we were in our (VERY clean) room by 11:00am. Everything from the moment we arrived was just perfect. Plenty of great perks - local discounts and freebies, priority seating at the very busy breakfast spot downstairs. I can't say enough good things about our experience at the Crawford. It will definitely be our first choice when we come back to Denver.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful boutique hotel in the middle of it all,"My family and I loved the Crawford. From the time we checked in and Dominic made us feel welcome, till the time we left, it was a great stay.  My teenage girls loved the service and amenities. The rooms were gorgeous and very clean. We look forward to our next trip to Denver and the Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Phenomenal Hotel Experience,"We spent two wonderful nights at this fabulous hotel. First the ease of riding the train from Denver International Airport to the entrance of The Crawford is perfect and only a nominal fee of $9.00. The reception desk staff was efficient, courteous and gave us valuable information regarding the In house top rated restaurant as well as the Terminal bar and other wonderful shops and dining options within Union Station. Our room was simply beautiful, wonderful exposed beams, lovely comfortable bed and great living space. The location is considered to be Lower downtown. It was convenient, within walking distance to wonderful restaurants, live music or a short Uber ride to other spots such as Denver's Aquarium. This was one of our most favorite stays while on vacation and hope to return this fall.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great date night away!!,"My husband surprised me with an in-town getaway for my birthday. Even though we live in Denver (about 20 minutes away!) it was truly like being away on vacation. The resort like feel is lively, and Union Station has remodeled but managed to keep the vintage, classy feel. The hotel room itself was not large, but plenty big for a couple and really well appointed. We had a spectacular view overlooking the west side of the building. ""Coopers"", the upstairs bar requires reservations, even for drinks, but the view and ambiance is spectacular! The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Union Station and LoDo offers so much to do, you won't want to head ""uptown"" anymore. It's great to see this area revitalized and The Crawford truly is a great place to be!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel Ever,"I have traveled all over the US and have had the privilege of staying at the best 5 star hotels available. However I must say that my experience at the Crawford Hotel has to be listed as the best overall experience. All the staff members were wonderful from the reception area to the service personnel. The accommodations were unique, comfortable, affordable, and right in the heart of the Union Station area.A special thanks to Lance who made it all possible by finding accommodations when all of Denver was full.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Must Try!!,"My wife and I have been dying to stay at Union Station the first time we went post renovation. Now we can't wait to go again!!We stand in a Pullman room with admittedly is small...but the touches and layout make it fun! Fully loaded concierge type iPad, killer tv, a room overlooking the train platform, and a great bathroom (which is always a plus). Upon checkin they also provide a great happy hour option of beer and ice cream, coffee in the morning and other hip options like a tesla ride as an uber like experience. All of this in an absolute one of a kind train station. Oh Denver, you did this place right! A++++++!!!!!!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Perfect Engagement Night,"My new fiance and I stayed here on the night I asked him to marry me in Union Station. The hotel staff were incredible and offered champagne and chocolates in the room, along with a free upgrade. They drove us to our dinner reservation in the hotel's Tesla and helped me find a quiet corner of the Cooper Lounge (the hotel's upscale bar overlooking the terminal) in order to pop the question.It was a perfect stay after a perfect evening and I highly recommend it for any special occasion stays in your future!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Quirky, charming and fun","My wife and I took refuge here when a conference hotel proved unsatisfactory and had a great time.  Front desk staff was friendly and cordial, and our room was large, comfortable and well-appointed.  The period charm of the Crawford does not disappoint, and the excitement, fun and convenience of the train station setting was delightful.  One small cavil: on our second day, we left the privacy sign on the door until mid-morning because my wife was sleeping in.   We assume that housekeeping saw the sign and passed us by, but no one ever checked to see if we wanted service later.  At this price point, I'd normally expect an evening service as well, but at least a return visit, a note or a call to check back later in the morning would have been welcome (and expected). Other than that minor annoyance, a charming hotel that is definitely not standard-issue, and one to which we'd love to return.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Stay and Location,"Enjoyed a Deluxe Loft Room on 6th floor. Great location and ease with the RTD outside the rear of the Hotel to/from DIA. Plenty to enjoy and do in Hotel lobby. Fiance used the Oxford Club for Massage and Mani/Pedi. Telsa courtesy car is a great touch as we used it for a dinner date. Overall great experience and accommodations.   Its true, you get what you pay for. Crawford Hotel is worth every Penny.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Crawford Hotel is exquisitely amazing!,"Wow ... the Crawford Hotel is exquisitely amazing.  It Is more expensive but worth every penny and makes your visit to Denver an experience that will never fade, an experience with a sense of detail and one that will stand out in your memory as memorable. The only place to stay is the Crawford, any place else is just disappointment. Thanks for the great stay and especially to Lauren and Dominic. see you next time Crawford!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very good location and decor,The hotel is in a great location in the old train station. There are plenty of restaurants in walking distance and there is easy access to the highway. The room was well decorated. We had one of the larger rooms with a seating area. I wish the seating area was more separate with a wall or door blocking it from the sleeping area since I get up much earlier than my wife (this is why we booked this style room). The bathroom was large and the shower very nice. The only negative here was there no towel rack anywhere near the shower. The only other negative was our in-room coffee/cups/creamer was not replenished after the first day.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible stay at Union Station!,"Staying at The Crawford Hotel was such a treat! My husband and I were home for the holidays and I thought I'd surprise him and get us a room for the weekend at The Crawford. The best part is that it's inside Union Station, so it makes your stay even more exciting knowing that restaurants, shops, and bars/lounges are just a couple floors down! Eric at the front desk was the BEST and took such great care of us. The hotel also offers to drive you in a TESLA anywhere within a 2 mile radius of Union Station! Just make sure you tip the drivers!Our room was so big, with bright, trendy furniture, high ceilings, huge windows, an iPad with features and services for the hotel, a Nespresso machine, and they put 2 VOSS waters in your room every day (complimentary). They also had a vintage bathtub in the bathroom, as well as a waterfall shower head in the standing shower! And a HUGE lampshade in the room which I have never seen before but it added such a fun touch! We did not want to leave our hotel that weekend. The ambiance, customer service, and fun vibe of being inside Union Station was worth 10 stars! I highly recommend this hotel. It's definitely the best I've stayed at in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Service!,"I stayed for 4 nights on my business trip from May 30 - June 3. The driver service was very amazing.  Before I arrive, I was thinking about a shuttle van type of picking up and dropping off service.  It is actually, the driver in a suite with a nice car took me to a restaurant, picked me up when I finished eating, took me to walgreen....  The drivers were very polite,  they made me feel like a VIP!!Staff were very friendly and accommodating, the room was nice, clean and quiet. I will definitely stay there again!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,$40 parking?,"Beautiful hotel, but when a hotel forces you to pay $40 to park in an area where there is limited parking, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth when you check out. Ruins the whole experience. As an experienced traveler, I always want to have free wifi and parking under $15",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Train station hotel experience,"The Crawford Hotel is inside the historic and recently refurbished Union Station in lower downtown Denver.  The reception desk is literally in the lobby waiting room of the train station.  Only one Amtrak train remains stopping in Denver between Chicago and San Francisco.  I have reviewed this train, the California Zephyr, previously and it is worth checking out.  Now Union Station is the hub for local area commuter rail and buses including a new train to Denver International Airport.  This RTD ""A"" line is the most convenient and inexpensive way to get between DIA, downtown and several stops in between.  The Crawford Hotel aspires to five stars but still has some work to get there.  The standard rooms are small so upgrading is a good idea.  The high ceilings compensate somewhat.  The staff is very friendly and informative.  This is important since the room service fee includes benefits that you will want to take advantage of.  These include coffee, ice cream and beer at shops off the first floor train station lobby.  There is no hotel restaurant but there are multiple interesting eateries within the station complex.  These include Snooze for breakfast, Mercantile and the Kitchen Next Door.  The location is within a short walk of Coors Field and the many attractions of Denver's LoDo area.  The free 16th Street tram is just a block away.  Our room was very quiet with no transportation noise intruding.  We expected better housekeeping for a luxury priced hotel.  Our room was not vacuumed the three nights we stayed and toiletries not replenished.  It is worth noting that the train station has a visible security presence since it is a public area.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Incredible Service,"The Crawford is certainly a beautiful & unique hotel, but to be honest there is only one reason I’m writing this review: Brennan, the concierge. Please, someone, give this man a raise. After a bit of a disappointing evening spent in LoDo, he completely turned our night around. My husband (who is a car enthusiast) was very excited to be driven around in the Tesla that the Crawford provides and after deciding to give up on barhopping, Brennan was more than happy to take us for a short tour of the downtown area in the Tesla. We told him the reason for our stay (a concert) and when he picked us up he recalled what band we saw, where we went, basically every detail we had shared with him earlier in the night. He was very knowledgeable, enthusiastic, warm, genuine and an all-around fun person to be around. I had been feeling a little ill that night and when we ordered a pizza to our room, Brennan was there to bring it up, remembered my name and told my husband he hoped I was feeling better. That level of personable service put the Crawford in the top of our very, very long hotel-stay list. I could go on about the uniqueness of the rooms, the upscale amenities, the fun location, but if you’re looking for a level of service that soars above the rest, ask for BRENNAN. And to the Crawford: please, tell him Alex & Cynthia say hi!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Didn't Feel Like Business-& That Tesla!,"The Crawford's right in the middle of a train station & at first it seems a bit frantic for such a nice hotel. Then the staff is so warm in that laid back Denver way, but when our room wasn't exactly what we expected, they upgraded us to the most perfect suite with the utmost kindness & efficiency. The Tesla was a great convenience & every driver was helpful and fun. The trip was too short & we hated to leave. When considering your Denver accommodations, I'd definitely recommend the Crawford for its energy originality, great bars, convenience, laid back but perfectly efficient staff, and amazing location. Loved it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great stay at The Crawford Hotel,"I loved the hotel.  The rooms are clean, very comfortable, and quiet.  The hotel lobby is also a train station and has a nice vibe.  There is constant activity.  Definitely a great place for people watchers.Just before I arrived at The Crawford Hotel I learned that I had to reschedule my dinner reservations.  Unfortunately, I could not find a restaurant with availability.  I asked Lauren at the front desk for a suggestion and she said she would look at options and call me back,  Less than an hour later Lauren had not only found me a restaurant with availability but also made a reservation!  I could not have hoped for a better outcome.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Thank you!,Thank you for the wonderful stay to Brennan and rest of concierge! We had a few bumps in our trip regarding scheduling and issues with booked plans but the staff is wonderful and helped to solve all our problems!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Cool Experience,"This hotel is great for people watching in the lobby area as it is still an active train station.  The rooms are well kept, clean and welcoming,  The atmosphere is great, especially at the bar/lounge upstairs.  The food is all from outside companies, but you can still order room service and that is convenient.  The bathrooms are very roomy.  The beds are comfortable. There is also an iPad in each room to order room service and communicate your needs to the front desk which is a nice touch.  Overall, I would recommend to friends and I would stay here again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Brilliant location,We stayed for 4 nights - had a lovely little cocktail bar right outside our room!  Really easy to get to with a train directly from the airport to right outside hotel! Walking distance to most things in Denver - lovely restaurants nearby. The car was a bonus to drop you off and pick you up anywhere within 2 Mile radius and the priority reservation at Snooze for breakfast was great too.  All the staff we met were friendly and helpful.  Would definitely stay here again if we visit Denver again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Stay,"Stayed one night at the Crawford on our way to Moab.  We can't say enough about the Crawford.  The hotel was elegant and it was a vibrant scene with the bustle of the restaurants, union station, and pubs.  Our room was perfect and surprisingly quiet and the amenities were outstanding.  The hotel staff was incredibly helpful with restaurant recommendations, directions and drivers when needed.  The only negative with The Crawford was a bartender who was fairly pretentious when we asked him about a pour.  We each ordered the same beer and not only did they taste different, they looked different.  We politely asked about it and based on his response, he clearly wanted to assert that he was more of a beer connoisseur than perhaps his customer.   We didn't let that spoil our evening and quite frankly, we had a good laugh when we got the bill and he actually charged us for a different beer than what we ordered.  Other than this, I would go back and highly recommend a stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great turn around Hotel for our round trip Amtrak trip from Salt Lake through the Rockies!,"This Hotel was Great for our purpose, it is integrated into the Denver train station. We traveled with our four year old granddaughter and the accommodations were superior.The hotel fee is reasonable considering the perks that are provided with it. Located within walking distance to downtown shopping or you can take the hotel curtesy car if is available. Otherwise Denver has a very convenient public transportation. The Colorado Rockies baseball field is a pleasant 3 or 4 block walk from the hotel. The checkin staff were some of the nicest individuals i have encountered in my travels, very upbeat and they clearly enjoy their jobs, thumbs up to them and the individuals that interviews the staff.I highly reccomend this hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top notch experience,"We stayed at The Crawford to celebrate our 5th anniversary. A wonderful experience! So fun staying right in Union Station. We enjoyed a complimentary beer at The Terminal Bar, other perks are included as well (there is a small service fee charged per night that covers all the perks so take advantage of them). Had reservations well in advance at Stoic & Genuine for our anniversary dinner. Absolutely fantastic food and service. We wanted to have breakfast at Snooze the next morning. We learned that it would have been best to let them know the night before and we could have had a specific time reserved. Next time we'll do that. But they still were able to get us on the list and while other diners were waiting 1-2 hours to be seated, we were seated in about 20 minutes. Very impressed with the concierge and how accommodating they are. We stayed in a ""Standard Room"" and it was beautiful. High ceilings, high quality accommodations, large windows, comfortable bed, great shower, robes, slippers and comfy towels. We'll definitely be back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Customer Event,"To say that our group's experience at the Crawford Hotel was exceptional, would be an understatement. Every one of our 70 guests went out of their way to express how fantastic the Crawford was, and how much they enjoyed being in the middle of the action in LoDo. To a person, the staff was absolutely first class. They attended to our every need with speed and grace.  Whether you are coming to Denver on business or pleasure, with a large group or solo; stay at the Crawford.  From the energy and variety of Union Station, to the simple, modern elegance of the guest rooms, to the wealth of attractions outside the doors, a stay with the Crawford will be one of the most enjoyable getaways you could plan in an urban setting. Simply put, just go.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Horrible Mistreatment by Staff,"Fortunately, I did not have to stay in this hotel to experience first hand the terrible service that they provide. I arrived on Wednesday May 18 at valet. I checked my bags with the valet attendant and was told I could pick them up at the front desk. After spending the day downtown Denver, I went to pick up my bags and was treated terribly by the front desk staff/manager. I do not know her name, she was taller with brown hair. She brought me my bags and said that my bags arrived from valet and there wasn't a reservation under my name. I said that is correct, I checked my bags at the hotel for the day as I have done hundreds of times before at other hotels. She then scolded me and pointed her finger in my face and, I kid you not, said to me, ""don't be so deceitful."" I have never been talked to or treated in such a manner in my life. I myself am a manager in the hotel industry and I would never NEVER talk to a person like that. I'd also like to point out that no where does it say checking bags is for guests only. I come to Denver for about a week every month or two and due to the train from the airport recently being connected to Union Station, I would have gladly like to have given this hotel a chance. I'm person that's pretty loyal when it comes to hotels because I like the personalized service and them knowing who I am and supporting a good business. After the mistreatment I received from this particular female employee, I will not give this hotel my business ever. And it's their loss.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fascinating Setting!,"We stayed at The Crawford Hotel on two separate occasions, driving back and forth to Wyoming.  The first night we stayed at The Crawford the thermostat was set at 53 degrees in our room...FRIGID.  We turned up the thermostat and left to eat dinner and walk around.  When we returned several hours later, the room was a balmy 62!  Brrr.  The next morning, when I made coffee, the in room Nespresso machine would not make a full cup, only a shot.  I have a Nespresso machine at home so am familiar with how the equipment works so it wasn't operator error.  Then, the toilet stopped flushing.  We went to the lobby, informed the desk staff of the problem, and went to breakfast.  When we returned to the room, the toilet was fixed.  At check-out I explained the issues to the front desk and they offered to upgrade my room for my return trip.  We returned to The Crawford five days later. The manager on duty saw that we had been upgraded but as we were early, told us that guaranteed check-in was in a few hours.  We understood, of course, and went to have lunch and explore.  We returned at 3:00 and were told that the room was still not ready due to an issue with the onsite laundry machines, which had broken.  We waited close to an hour for our room.  However, the manager was lovely and gave us a $20 coupon to offset the inconvenience, plus had a split of Prosecco and chocolate truffles delivered to our room.  She removed the valet parking charge as well. Our experience was mixed by the inconveniences we faced but definitely ameliorated by the professionalism of the staff.  The Crawford is fun with the shops, stores, restaurants, travelers, views, etc. The rooms are well sound proofed so although you can look out onto the train tracks, you cannot hear anything.  I love how the rooms are decorated as well and appreciate the attempts to save the old building relics, like the safe in the room and the mail slots in the door.  I just think it was odd to have so many problems within five days.Lastly, The Crawford subcontracts with a Valet service...not a fan of those guys!! Too busy on their cell phones to help with luggage.  Our car took much longer to get than what we were told plus no confirmation from our text to request the car.  Like I said, not a huge fan of them!",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The Perfect Hotel,"My wife and I would like to recognize a few of the employees who took care of us during our stay. Brennan was the first to greet us at check-in. His appearance, demeanor and knowledge set the tone for our entire stay at The Crawford. We felt at home after he gave us a rundown of the hotel, the services, and the nearby attractions. Secondly, Lance was helpful when answering all our questions and set us at ease when he helped us secure transportation at the end of our stay to the airport. Myles took us around town whenever we needed a lift and is a very knowledgeable, pleasant young man. Marie was a great help in purchasing tickets on-line for the Padres-Rockies game. The one thing that impressed us both was that all the employees who helped us during our stay were so knowledgeable, friendly, and courteous. There are times when you ask a person a question and get a ""Yes"" answer, but you can see doubt in their eyes. Not so with the people I have mentioned. They knew what the answer was and were straightforward and positive with their answers. There was no sense of doubt in their replies. A great staff, a great hotel, and the highlight of our 50th Wedding Anniversary. Thank you all for the perfect vacation. Ray and Kay Johnson",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved this hotel!,We loved that we could take the train from the airport right to the front door of this hotel! The hotel was super nice and offered lots of freebies to the stores within Union Station. Union Station was GORGEOUS!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best hotel experience ever!,We stayed for a conference and choose The Crawford based on a friend's recommendation. This hotel is amazing it was really easy to get to right off the train from the airport. Everything inside was beautiful. We really enjoyed eating downstairs and happy hour at the Terminal Bar. The shops were great and we bought most of our gifts and souvenirs at the hotel. Our room was perfect for us and we were treated liked royalty. Especially the car service to anywhere around the hotel! The drivers were all really awesome and gave great recommendations.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Will not recommend,"No advanced warning that their spa facilities were under renovation, so if this is important part of relaxation for you, be forewarned that you'll be required to share an elevator in your spa bathrobes with construction crew up to the spa facilities. Room is nice enough, but for the rates, no comped water in the fridge. The fridge was not turned on, and no discernible switches or plugs could be found during a search. The light above a cabinet nook was not working. Hotel staff members who were alerted to these were responsive to requests for repair, and a facilities engineer was sent to address the fridge. After he left, the fridge appeared to be on but was still not cold enough and frozen items melted. The repairman who promptly got sent to address the light fixture, initially fixed it, but this only worked temporarily and stopped working a few hours later. Most eye-catching are charges added on for amenities, and such, but these have varied from 17-something dollars to a hundred, and on days when I purchase nothing from the hotel such that they are suspicious. When brought to the attention of staff, no adequate response was provided. I got double charged for spa services. Hotel staff member, to whom this last concern was brought, has been polite and reassuring, but is still working on resolving this. Got placed on the 2nd floor, where construction/maintenance crew, window cleaners, passers-by are right outside the window. A slamming door somewhere is regularly heard through the walls. The housekeeping staff is pleasant when their services were requested, but they forgot to leave replacement toiletries. The room is pleasant, and the location is central, but the overall quality of stay is markedly compromised by these factors. Seriously consider other hotels.",2
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Celebrating 30 years of teaching and 31 years of marriage,"We're from Colorado Springs and we love staying in downtown Denver ar least once per year and the last few years our stay has been courtesy of my husband's parents. They chose The Crawford because they recently stayed there and loved it. What an excellent idea to put a charming luxury hotel in the newly renovated Union Station. We chose the Date Night package that included signature cocktails and a delicious appetizer in the Cooper Lounge on the third floor. We stayed in a Classic Guest Room on the 4th floor that opened up to the terminal and overlooked the courtyard and fountains in front of Union Station.  Although the terminal was bustling with passengers, hotel guests, Rockie's fans, and the summer crowd, the rooms with their high ceilings were quiet. You could not hear anything once the door was shut and we slept soundly in the comfortable beds. The service in the hotel, lounge, coffee shop and restaurants was excellent as well as the amenities and the fitness center. Thank you for a wonderful stay, can't wait to come back next year!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best service / best hotel ,"Wow ... the Crawford Hotel is exquisitely  amazing. It's not just centrally located around the best restaurants downtown, but within the Union Station there are so many other options which call you to stay and play within walking distance. The Crawford exudes the epitome of luxury elegance with a modern twist. Want a custom dessert after the kitchen has closed? Usually a problem for most chain-food hotels, the Crawford responds with elegance and dedication to its guests, fetching berries and homemade whip cream after hours. The hotels high ceilings, attention to detail and in-room Nespresso maker make the Crawford, THE ONLY  hotel worth spending a penny on. It IS more expensive but worth every penny and makes your visit to Denver an experience that will never fade, an experience with a sense of detail and one that will stand out in your memory as memorable. The only place to stay is the Crawford, any place else is just disappointment. Thanks for the great stay and see you next time Crawford!!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Perfect location, beautiful property, calming, gorgeous rooms, and FABULOUS staff--you could not ask for more!","Stayed in a double for a long weekend with four adults and an infant.  Great high-ceilinged, beautifully done room, with wonderful space.  Comfy beds.  Fabulous, very attentive staff (I love that they always spoke to me by name).  From the front desk to the restaurants, everyone was welcoming and ready to go that extra mile.  We had a room ""snafu"" (needed a double, assigned a king with a rollaway), that the staff addressed, kept in good communication about, and solved by the next morning.  I cannot say enough good things about the staff, from the valet to the front desk, through to housekeeping.  All are well-trained, responsive, and welcoming.Our group used the Tesla service--a nice perk, that was easy to access/schedule...how cool is that?!?Loved the convenience and selection of restaurants on property.  Mercantile is a new fave, and Snooze is a go-to for breakfast (plus the ""VIP"" access through the Crawford front desk helps alleviate that long wait time).You can't beat the location, and now that the A train brings you straight from the airport, no need for a car--you can use the Tesla service within 2 miles, the free 16th street mall bus runs at the end of the block,and light-rail,Uber or cab it beyond that.Overall, the best hotel experience we've had in years!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun Anniversary Weekend,"I chose The Crawford Hotel for our stay-cation, Anniversary weekend because of it's great location and good reviews, and we were not disappointed. All facets of our experience were fabulous including the people we interacted with, the amenities in our room and the general atmosphere of the hotel. I can be a bit disconcerting to arrive at the terminal at 5:30pm, when Friday Happy Hour is in full swing. The lobby desk is slightly to the rear of the space, but once we found it we had no issues checking in and heading to our room. I was impressed by the sound-proofing of our room as well as the hallway. The decor includes piece of memorabilia and art that include some really fun pieces of Colorado/Denver history. The room was spacious, well-appointed, and included a view of the train platforms behind the station building. The location is great for walking to anything is LoDo, and the hotel will give you a ride to anything within 2 miles (with a reservation) if hoofing it isn't possible. We rode the train to DIA, which is just outside the back door, which we may never do to fly, but it was a fun jaunt. Your stay included goodies like a beer at the bar during happy hour and ice cream from the Milk Bar for each day of your stay. Much as I'd like to stay here often, it's a bit on the pricey side, but well worth doing as a splurge for a fun occasion. I'm sure we'll be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,INCREDIBLE!,"We chose the Date Night package at the Crawford to celebrate a wedding anniversary.  The entire staff – everyone – was friendly and made us feel welcomed and special.  The hotel surprised us with a split of Proseco and chocolate truffles in honor of our anniversary.  Our room was beautifully appointed and furnished.  Union Station is a great location from which to visit downtown Denver.  This place is expensive, but then all downtown hotels in large cities are.  The Crawford is worth every penny! We definitely hope to do this again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great welcome,"The check-in clerk was lovely, friendly, and helpful.  After telling her this was our 47th anniversary, she brought us up a bottle of wine and 2 glasses.  Very thoughtful!  We only stayed one night so the price seemed VERY high.  Rooms are nicely and newly renovated; however, I had chosen the Superior Loft, not knowing that meant we only had one window about 10 foot up, so the room seemed dark.  Everything was clean and the bathroom was wonderful - BIG shower with 2 heads and shampoo/conditioner/body wash in convenient containers on the wall.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique Location and Super Gracious Staff,I had the pleasure of staying one night at the Crawford Hotel last week and wished I could have stayed longer.  The location is in a renovated train station and everything you could possibly wish for is either in the lobby or within easy walking distance.  I took the A Line from the Denver airport and it very conveniently stopped directly across from the Crawford in Union Station.  The room was lovely and comfortable and the hotel staff was just wonderful.  Stay at the Crawford and you will not be disappointed!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Interesting & Fun Place,"Stayed one night in the renovated Union Station hotel.  Energetic and fun place to be with several restaurants, bars and eateries in the building to choose from.The rooms were ""chic"", clean and reasonably priced for the amenities included.Prepare for $$valet parking.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fabulous Stay,"Very unique hotel! I just stayed at the Crawford for two nights and it was amazing! It's right at the train station so it's super convenient.  The check was super easy. Don't worry about noise as some reviews have said-I asked for a quiet room and I had one at the end of the hall of the third floor overlooking the city. The Windows are completely soundproof. I did not hear a thing all night or in the morning. I stayed in a room to with queens and the beds are top notch! Bathroom was clean and had a nice rain shower. The employee who checked us in saw I had a broken foot and immediately brought me two bags of ice to my room. There is not hotel room service but they will bring you food from some restaurants at the train station. I had a wonderful breakfast at Snooze and great coffee at the coffee shop. The only reason I would say not to stay here is if you are the type of person who needs a quiet luxury lobby-the lobby is the train  station but I loved the energy of it! If you want luxury, modern and eclectic stay here!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome experience and amenities ,"This hotel is fantastic! The Hotel staff is friendly & very helpful; rooms are secure, quiet, large & unique. Because it is located in Union Station there are bars, restaurants, clothing stores, lounges and access to the train all in the same building. Guests are given free amenities from certain establishments for each day you stay, such as a free coffee, a free scoop of ice cream, and a free craft beer among others. It is within walking distance to Coors Field and also has a Tesla that will drop you off anywhere in a 2 mile radius of Union Station. I will DEFINITELY be staying here again! Look for great deals on Expedia.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,10 year anniversary,"This place is awesome!!  I found it via Trip Advisor and found it to be every bit as great as the reviews.  The location was in walking distance of everything we wanted to do and the courtesy car was available to take us father. The room was beautiful.  Great amenities and comfortable bed.  The service was fantastic.  We were made to feel that we were the most important guests.  Great restaurants inside the Union Station, including ice cream and a wonderful breakfast place.  We will stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Diamond in the Heart of the City,"This is such a unique lodging! Rooms built around perimeter balconies of Union Station. Stunning architecture. Beautiful view over main station floor. We had a Classic Guest Room which was spacious enough for two. Nice linens, beautiful bath, Nespresso machine in room. Best part of this hotel is not the rooms, but everything inside Union Station! We hardly left the station. Highly recommend The Terminal bar, Stoic & Genuine (amazing seafood), The Kitchen Next Door (especially Happy Hour), and Pigtrain coffee. Snooze serves amazing brekkie and even through there's almost always a wait, be advised you can call the front desk and they'll pop over and put your name on the list. Snooze will then text when your table is ready. It's all so easy! Prepare for prime pampering, dining and drinking whilst at The Crawford.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Luxurious and Fun,"The Crawford Hotel is a MUST STAY hotel. Not only is it historical, having been a train station in it's previous life, but the energy and character of the hotel is incredible. The lobby is open to the public, which is always entertaining, and has such a fun vibe with big tables, chairs, games, and one of the best bars in town. Some of the top restaurants are actually IN the hotel, making it a one stop shop when it comes to finding food easily. You also get a free coffee and a free ice cream from Milkbox Ice Creamery (delicious). The staff is so friendly and the rooms are all different and so cool. Only downside- no pool and not the best workout facility, but when you're in Denver, there are way better things to do than that anyways! Love this place, will definitely come back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Brilliant,"We moved to this hotel after staying at a horrible hotel earlier.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Staff were brilliant and they even took us to our previous hotel to collect our luggage.  The man who drove us was also very accommodating.The room was very  comfortable and quiet, given that the accommodation overlooks the concourse at the station.We can't recommend this hotel enough.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top notch service,Stayed at the Crawford for business travel.  The hotel is built is part of the Union Station which offers a grand lobby with plenty of amenities.  Rooms are spacious and well appointed.  The staff was quick to respond to cover every detail.  Not a single disappointment!,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wow,"We ended up here because we got to Denver a day early and the house we were renting wasn't ready...so it was under misfortune and when we checked in Jason knew that. He went ABOVE & BEYOND to ensure we were comfortable. We were traveling with dogs and hated that we had to have them in a hotel - but honestly couldn't have found a better hotel. The location is ideal for anyone that wants to feel the city energy Denver has to offer.  Close to everything especially a beautiful park. Restaurants in Hotel are DELICIOUS! You must get breakfast/brunch downstairs. The bookstore is convenient. The gym...is across the street, but once you're sitting in the eucalyptus steam room, you won't mind having to had walk across the street. The rooms were large and comfortable. If we visit Denver again, without the need, we're only staying here.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique Property, Superb Location and Rooms","The rooms remind me of a hipster loft - so cool and not your typical boring hotel standard room.  And that could be for the better or for the worse - but this was definitely for the better.  Downstairs and surrounding blocks have so many choices for great bars/restaurants.  The free rides in a Tesla in a 2 mile radius is a nice bonus too! Very convenient location - especially since you can now take a train from there to airport.Check-in was a little slow, but otherwise perfect!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Quick trip to Denver - Great place to stay,Had a short trip to Denver last month… Stayed at the Crawford with my husband as did my sister and brother-in-law… We all agreed it was one of the coolest hotels we've been to in awhile.  Great location (We walked down to the Rockies game) and the bar in the lobby and the Cooper lounge were great.  It was also very quiet - even though our room was over the main terminal lobby.  Would absolutely recommend it.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,May 2016 Business Offsite,"Room was clean and everything looked new.  Very comfortable room.  Location of the Crawford is awesome!  It is within walking distance of Coors Field, shopping, pubs, parks, and restaurants.  The common area of the train station is a cool place to hang out along with the shops and restaurants.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique Property in a Superb Location, Outstanding Service","While this property is very unique, it is a fun location with a good vibe.  I was impressed by the service and the Train Station location adds to the experience.  I was there in Denver for business and stayed here, after I was in another hotel for some vacation and the whole time I regretted not extending at the Crawford!  Service was above par, worth a stay for business or personal!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Lovely stay,"The Crawford is in the heart of downtown with a fantastic set up in the old union station.  The lobby is the old station waiting area with restaurants, bars, and stores    Rooms are lovely with big comfortable beds.  You get lots of perks at all the hotel bar and restaurants. Totally unique hotel.  Highly recommend.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wow!,"What a great hotel! I was there recently on a quick business trip and really enjoyed the hotel, location and amenities.  Nothing negative to say at all!The room quality, amenities and decor is outstanding!  I absolutely heard nothing outside, no transient noise, train noise etc.  It was very quiet and serene.The lobby and public areas were very well appointed and had activity, but nothing crazy and honestly, it was nice to have activity in the lobby as it was engaging and the space was active.  Location was excellent and train to airport right off the lobby, $9.00 to airport vs. $55.00 cab ride and quicker and more comfortable. Great hotel and offerings, my guess is nothing better in town.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very cool hotel but still a train station,"This is a really cool, fun hotel. We checked in early (11:00 am?) and they had my upgraded room ready and bottles of water for us at the front desk. Everyone was really friendly. The lobby/Union Station was a madhouse, but that's partly because it's part of an Amtrak train station.Our room was nice with huge ceilings, sort of art deco meets 1940s post office meets 2016 trendy hotel room. Surprisingly, it was a little shabby (dinged up furniture, stained carpet) but the bathroom made up for it. It was easily 2/3 of the size of the room with a beautiful tub, gorgeous tiling, big walk in shower and a great vanity area. The bed was really comfortable and there were huge windows overlooking....the trains. What I discovered the next morning is that you can definitely hear those trains, but I'm used to noise. If you're easily disrupted when you sleep this might not be the best hotel for you as the front of the hotel is facing a busy area.There is a hotel Tesla that is available to take you within a 2 mile radius of the hotel. We took it on Friday night and Brennan was our driver. He was outstanding and continued to remember us and information about us throughout the two days we were there.The things I didn't really like was that the lobby was perpetually a loud, complicated, congested space at every time of day. I was down there very early in the morning and really late at night and it was always Crazy Town. It's a very hip place but if you are ever looking for a moment of serenity, this is not the place to find it. I was happy that you couldn't hear anything in your room, however.I also wasn't pleased when we came back from a concert around 10:30-11:00 at night, starving and thinking we could order room service. Nope. There are about 5 restaurants in Union Station but not one of them serves food past 10. We had to walk about 3 blocks to find anything. The breakfast restaurant, Snooze, is highly recommended but it didn't matter what time we went there, there was always a 1 - 1.5 hour wait, so plan to walk for breakfast too. Valet is $39/day but you can come and go as often as you want each day. It does take some time but we didn't have to wait more than 10 mins for our car and the valets were fun to talk to.Wifi is complementary and SUPER FAST. How awesome is that?! There is also an iPad in your room that you can use to communicate with the concierge, valets, etc. They will stock your mini fridge with complementary water too. Overall, I think I'd stay here again because it's so unique and in a great location and the staff is awesome. I might seek out a hotel with a little more relaxed feel though, as I felt like I was constantly in a train station (funny, I *was,* I just didn't expect it to be a working one!).",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fantastic Everything,"This was a GREAT choice for a downtown Denver hotel.  - The location is really good, including the neighborhood, where you can walk to a lot of restaurants and shops, and Union Station itself is a really cool spot.  The hotel is integrated into Union Station, which is non-traditional and might take some getting used to, but really makes the hotel what it is.  Union Station feels like a place you could just hang out (and lots of people obviously do), and the hotel is put together in such a way that allows you to do so.  You have the easiest possible access to all the great amenities in the station, which the hotel facilitates (through an amenity fee, but it's worth it).  The hotel's reservation system at Snooze is worth the amenity fee alone, because the food is fantastic and you barely need to wait in line to get it (on Mother's Day, we waited five minutes for a table while the regular wait time was over two hours!).  We took advantage of the complimentary coffee and ice cream nearly every day we were staying at the hotel.  And the fee covers a free beer every night at the Terminal Bar and discounts on food at about every other restaurant in Union Station.  Also, the hotel bar is well worth a visit.- Besides the food and drink discounts, the hotel also provides access to a lot of other perks.  The Crawford's fitness center in the basement is actually pretty decent, but you also have access to the Oxford's spa and fitness center a block away, which we did not visit but sounded pretty extensive.  We also took advantage a few times of the Crawford's Tesla courtesy car.  They cap rides at a 2 mile radius from the hotel, but it's very available.  When we booked a trip in the Tesla, it didn't look like anyone else had it reserved all day, and they came and picked us up to take us back to the hotel as well.- Our loft room was very nice, with all the things you'd expect from a modern luxury hotel and some interesting decor as well.- The staff we interacted with were all extremely friendly and helpful.I really don't have anything negative to say about the Crawford.  It blows a chain hotel out of the water, with so many nice perks and enough character to make it memorable.  If/when we're back in Denver, I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel In Denver!,"Simply exceptional.  No weaknesses.  Not sure if we would bring the kids, but it is an awesome place for couples.  Great room, great service.  We have lived in Denver for 30 years and Walter Isenberg and Sage Hospitality did this one right.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Good times,"We came here to celebrate a mom's weekend off and had such a wonderful, relaxing, fun time! The rooms were perfect with all the amenities we needed. The funky scene was ideal for a fun break for 6 working mom and the spa was wonderful.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Location with Cool Theme,"The Union Station location is hard to beat for how central it is and its atmosphere. I stayed in a Pullman room, which was small but had everything I needed, plus a Nespresso machine. Fun extras, like a free beer and scoop of ice cream were bonuses to the great service. The highlight of my stay was using the complimentary Tesla. They will take you anywhere within a 2 mile radius of the hotel for free and the hotel's drivers are very friendly and prompt.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Weekend in Denver,"I cannot wait to return to Denver again. And rest assured I will stay at the Crawford again. Perfectly located for seeing Denver since the hotel is located in the Union Station. Our room was two queen beds in a wonderfully decorated space. The shower was a problem. It was so nice I didn't want to leave it. Overhead ""rain"" and a wall showerhead as well. Great service from the check-in to my departure. Will definitely be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great & Unique Experience,"We chose the Crawford Hotel, as a great date night getaway, and we were pleasantly surprised. We flew into DIA and took the train on the opening celebration day, there was so much hustle and bustle it created an exciting atmosphere, yet the rooms were exquisite and quiet. We stayed on the 3rd floor at the end with beautiful soaring ceiling and windows. Not one detail is left undone. All staff were very professional and attentive. The Terminal bar was fabulous. The coffee shop great. Have traveled to Denver before, and this hotel is THE place to stay. Its close to everything, went to a baseball game, couple restaurants off the property all within a quarter mile. Is to beautifully restored, very happy. Hope to return soon. Because this is the train station , you will not experience anything as unique as this lovely hotel, not a turn key type of place. I noticed it draws a wide demographic as well, which means there is somethin for every one to enjoy!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Stunning bathroom, rest of room a little dark","We stayed in one of the loft/deluxe rooms and while the bathroom was an absolute dream the rest of the room had only one small window and the decor was a little lacking. Best part was having the Tesla chauffeur service and getting Snooze breakfast room service.  Can't beat! They were also very accommodating in bringing us things like extra cups, towels, coffee etc",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,My New Favorite Hotel in Denver!,"The Crawford is the epicenter of cool in Denver and has great bar, food and drink offerings.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and all slightly unique.  My room happened to open into the second floor speak easy which was fantastic.  You can now take the train from DIA directly to the Crawford.  I highly recommend and will for sure return!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,LOVE THIS HOTEL,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Crawford.The front desk staff was fantastic, Brennan was especially helpful.The shops in Union Station were convenient , enjoyed everything about this place.We hope to one day return to this wonderful place.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Very pleasant stay with some minor issues,"We recently stayed at the Crawford as a family of 4 with two pre-teens.   Overall, we enjoyed our stay.   The highlight was being located in the wonderfully remodeled Union Station.  My son and I had arrived by train, so this was the perfect spot for us.  My wife and daughter arrived by plane and we met at the hotel.   There are several excellent dining options both inside and nearby the station. We were quickly checked-in by a friendly and accommodating staff-member at the front desk.   We were pleasantly surprised to receive a card providing several benefits from several of the merchants - such as complimentary beer at happy hour, and a scoop of ice cream a day - a favorite of the kids.   We had booked a Lo-Do suite with the intention of having the kids sleep on the sofa bed.   The room itself was very spacious and unique - being located in the attic.  It was very quiet.   We never heard any noise throughout our stay.  However, the downside of being located in the attic is that there are few exterior windows.   In an apparent effort to offset the lack of windows, they added skylights in the bathroom, which helps provide light.   However, because the bathroom doors are opaque glass, you have no way to control the light in the early morning.    The sofa bed in our room was very small - not much larger than a twin bed in my estimation.  This was also a surprise.  There is no way my kids, ages 9 and 11, could have slept there together and the hotel does not have roll aways.    My daughter slept in a make-shift bed on the floor - thanks to housekeeping for providing her with a feather bed and blankets!   It would be a nice if roll aways were an option as the LoDo suite was otherwise perfect for families.    We used the hotel car once - which was quite helpful.    The kids loved the Tesla.  The WiFi was speedy and very easy to use. All requests to the front desk were handled courteously and quickly.   We also used the Crawford App on our iPhones a few times - which was a cool and easy way to communicate with the hotel to, for example, have our car brought out by valet. Our only issue during our stay was with housekeeping who seemed to be off their game or perhaps in too much of a rush as they never provided with enough towels and we had to request items to be replenished.   When we asked, it was always handled quickly, but it shouldn't have happened repeatedly. Last tip - hotel can provide ""reservations"" at Snooze - a great spot for breakfast.  We ate there all four mornings of our trip and miss it already.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,THE Place to Stay in Denver!,"Beautiful hotel located in the vibrant and fun Denver Union Station.  Despite being located in a train station, I found The Crawford Hotel easy to access, quiet, and secure… a retreat in the heart of the city.  It was snowing when I stayed and I didn’t even have to leave the building since some of the best bars and restaurants in Denver are right on property!  The staff was exceptional and went above and beyond to ensure I was enjoying my stay.  I can’t wait to return!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent hotel.,"This is the hotel to stay at, if you're willing to pay for it.Great location, lots of perks (Tesla that will drive you within 5 mile radius!).Gives you access to two fitness centres, both of which have a decent selection of equipment.Staff is very pleasant.Excellent wifi.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Atmosphere for the moment you arrive!,"My first impression was the attention we received at check in. The staff is attentive and caring. They asked if there was anything we needed to make our stay great. BTW, they give you a bottle of water and a coupon for an Ice Cream Cone from a vendor in the lobby( My Mexican Chocolate Cone was SOOO GOOD). The rooms are nice, the foods was great and the location is alive.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great location and amenities,"Spent the night before flying out in the morning.  Nice and clean, great staff and the train station had interesting restaurants and retail.  Our room was showing signs or wear, but by 9 yr old loved the light in the mirror in the bathroom and the views out of the corner location.Staff struggled with recommending a dinner restaurant for a family and gave even worse directions.  But, very pleasant!  Not sure you would want to spend more than a night or two, but it was a great choice for the family exploring SoDo and I would return.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique Experience,"We love The Crawford Hotel- accommodating staff, clean rooms, funky decor, free Tesla shuttle service and more!  Upon check-in we received a voucher good for free drinks, coffee and ice-cream - all available in the historic train station that doubles as the lobby.  We spent an hour just walking around the station checking out the many shops, bars and eateries.  The decor is breathtaking and much of it restored from the original.  And the best part is that it's located in the heart of Denver.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a really unique and fun stay.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,INTERESTING PLACE TO STAY,"Visiting Denver and wanted to stay at a hotel that was not just the standard hotel room, We found it at The Crawford Hotel. The hotel is located in ""Union Station"" which is a working train station. The terminal is beautiful and historic. Housed in this space are bars, eateries and  shops. You never really have to leave the station to have a great experience.  Our hotel room was spacious with a large modern bathroom. We had a view of the train tracks and it was surprisingly quiet. Great location and definitely different. Make sure to use the discount amenity voucher. A free shuttle is included.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A quick getaway to Denver,"We had an incredible time in Denver - the valet service was fast and friendly, Tara at the front desk treated us like we were family and our room was beautiful!  The location was perfect.  Once we turned the car in we never needed it again during our stay. We will be back - hopefully soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Chic Hotel in Prime Location!,"I love The Crawford Hotel! The beautiful Union Station is a showcase and The Crawford hotel is the perfect compliment that completes the property.  The front desk staff greeted us with smiles, were so kind and offered us every amenity to make our stay comfortable.  The rooms are very well appointed.  The bed was luxurious. The bathrooms have a wonderful spa feel.  On our last visit, we enjoyed a beautiful corner suite with separate sitting area and a sliding door to the bed area.  My husband was able to watch TV, enjoy the complimentary coffee bar, all while I slept in.  We also love the ease of getting to this hotel.  On our next visit, we plan to take the train from D.I.A. directly to Union Station. The restaurants and bars in Union Station are the best, but The Crawford Hotel offers a Tesla Car and driver to take you to other fun places in the city.  The front desk staff arranged a great tour of a local brewery and really made our trip so easy and relaxing.  I highly recommend The Crawford Hotel!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Good and not so good,It is pricey ..but I suppose this is more about the location . very close to the baseball field and lots of downtown restaurants. Stayed in a loft room and I thought it was somewhat on the smallish side. Unfortunately also was on the side that the trains pulled into. I would ask to be away from that side . the main lobby was lively with a bar and a few spots for eating and drinking.,3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Wonderful stay at a cool place!,"Excellent service from the moment we walked in.  The staff walks you to your room since you have to traverse the departures lounge of Union Station to get to the hotel elevators from the front desk.  It's a necessary, but classy touch.  Room was extremely clean and well decorated.  The free pint of beer at the Terminal Bar and scoop of ice cream each night was a welcome touch. So was the reservation process for Snooze the breakfast restaurant downstairs.  It was cool to have the hotel staff make our reservation each morning and then upon receiving a text from the restaurant, sauntering past the long line of customers awaiting a table.  Guests of the Crawford receive priority on the waiting list, a touch that matches all other efforts by the property to make guests feel important.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Crawl Around the Corner to the Crawford,"In spite of its excellent downtown location, GETTING INto the Crawford by car is a struggle. Located in Denver's downtown renovated Union Train Station, the almost non-existent signage and not very helpful ""valet"" parking, requires the visitor to disembark and schlepp across a large plaza and somehow find the check-in within a large central space. Its miniscule sign is almost lost among the other ""tastefully scaled"" signs to the bar and restaurants. Elevators are inconveniently located on the opposite side of the lobby from the main desk. Our room was quite adequate but tiny and really not worth its almost $300 dollar price tag. If one arrives on the TRAIN, the hotel is perfect, but by car, the service and confusion is a bit ridiculous, and frankly, could easily be improved by better management. I wish the Crawford luck in the future, but next time I'm going back to the BROWN PALACE!",3
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love this place!,"I have stayed at The Crawford Hotel many times in the last year or so.  I actually tried this hotel from a Trip Advisor review. I go to Denver a few times a year to visit my son.  The location of this hotel is fantastic, very central. So many restaurants and shops easy to reach on foot. The rooms are a bit on the smaller side, but the space is very well used. Really nice bathrooms with nice rain showers. Very comfy beds. One of the best parts of this hotel is the train station lobby. Great large space to hang out in. Have a coffee, cocktail or a bite to eat. Sit and use your computer at a table or sit on one of the many comfy couches or chairs and read a book, or just people watch. So many delicious restaurants to eat at without ever going outside. Mercantile, a favorite. Snooze for breakfast, delicious!  Terminal bar in the lobby, grab a drink inside the bar or get one at the ""take-out window"" and sit anywhere in the lobby area! Love this hotel. Almost did not want to write this review, want to keep this place to myself ;-).",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,All Aboard!,"This hotel was part the renovation of the Union Station in lower downtown Denver.  Still a functioning train station, from the open atrium lobby, the hotel seems like an after thought, but a lot of thought did go into it.My room was spacious, well appointed and comfortable.Ask for a room facing the street and if you want a bathtub, you'll have to ask.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Roybabs in denver,Great experience.. Get  a 4 th floor room very unique.   ...cooper bar was great for drinks and appitzers before dinner at the Merchanile...get VIPs reservations at snooze for a wonderful breakfast....enjoyed the daily coffee and ice cream,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A great stay,"We enjoyed our time at The Crawford Hotel. The hotel and Union Station are beautiful, well-maintained and a nice place to spend time. Tara at the front desk went the extra mile to help make our stay the best.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel in Denver,"Just stayed there last night. I've stayed in every hotel in Denver, and the Crawford is by far the best of all of them. Beautiful room , great amenities, complimentary car service,  unbeatable location, and best of all top notch service  from everyone.Every staff member I met was pleasant,efficient, and eager to help.I'll be back soon",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Simply Spectacular,"From the second you walk in to Union Station downtown, you know you're in for something special and unique.  Located inside the great hall of the station, The Crawford's front desk is a classy little cubby and Allison and Tara, who checked me in, could not have been nicer or more helpful. I was there for a little romantic ""staycation"" with my better half and they were so sweet about wishing us well, even leaving a kind note and a little bottle of bubbly in our room!The room.  What a neat and different space...it was located in what was formerly the attic of the building, so the original features like sloping ceilings and exposed beams are left intact.  The decor was plush and modern and comfortable, and the bathroom was, in a word, incredible. I'm a big guy and I can't remember the last time I had a bath, but the huge tub let me stretch out and get submerged, something I don't think has happened since I was a kiddo! The bath salts and awesome toiletries left me so relaxed and clean and ahhhh. Drinks at the Cooper Lounge left us feeling like VIP's and while a whiskey on the rocks is my normal sipper, the waitress suggested something fun, a blueberry concoction (I wish I remembered its and her names!) that made me grin with the first sip. The Crawford is located right in the middle of it all in lower downtown Denver, so everything you need is a short walk away (although they DO offer a suh-weeet Tesla Sedan as a courtesy vehicle if you need it) and the station is a working train depot and we found lots of interesting sites for some fun photography with the architecture and people of all stripes passing through the bustling place. Bustling or not, it was quiet as a tomb inside the room and it was incredibly tough to force myself out of the ultra-comfy bed the next morning. It was a spectacular stay in a really special place.  The people are there to make you happy and I left relaxed and 100%  pleased with every single aspect of our visit.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Unique Hotel, Perfect Location","This upscale hotel located in Union Station downtown Denver has a unique setting. The lobby Great Room is shared with the train station, & includes the Terminal Bar (upscale pub), coffee shop, & ice cream parlor. Rooms are clean, comfortable, surprisingly quiet, & fairly spacious. Coors Field & the Pepsi Center are within two blocks walk for baseball & hockey games, respectively, as is the 16th st ""mall."" There are likely better values, but I would recommend the Crawford for those guests seeking an entertaining atmosphere during their stay downtown.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Interesting accommodations in historic setting,"I had the pleasure of staying at The Crawford on a recent business trip to Denver. The hotel occupies part of the renovated Union Station train terminal which provides a historic environment. The lobby contains The Terminal bar, a couple of restaurants, a gift shop as well as the current Amtrak terminal. The rooms featured very high ceilings and were adequately appointed for this price point. The bed was comfortable and had the standard four pillows. They were all of the soft variety. The shower had two heads, one was directly overhead and quite high-up. So tall guests will surely appreciate that feature. In room Nespresso machine was a nice touch. The hotel staff was friendly and professional. One of the few negatives is that the free Internet access was too slow for good video. Otherwise it's acceptable. My female co-workers each had rooms that had bathtubs as well as showers. Each of their rooms was slightly different. One included an old vault, and one had a unique old door with a a mail slot for the bathroom. Those rooms were very interesting with a great character. The room I had was was very nice but much more standard. The elevators and halls required the key to be able to access them, so security was better since the lobby was open to the public. During the stay one craft beer from the bar, one scoop of ice cream and one cup of coffee from the shop in the lobby are provided per day at no extra charge. Upstairs the bar has interesting seating that overlooks the lobby area. The surrounding area has been revitalized, too. So there are plenty of good restaurants and bars that are within easy walking distance. Coors field is also close by. We held meetings in one of the basement rooms. The lighting was good, and we did not hear any other meetings through the thick stone walls. The refreshments provided were fine and fresh. The tables and chairs were comfortable. There was an iron I beam in the room that was distracting, but that was the only negative. We did have a buffet setup in one of the basement rooms. It was relatively standard hotel conference food -- quite acceptable. Overall I was very pleased with my stay at The Crawford. It is definitely on my list of places to stay when I visit Denver again on my own time.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Above and Beyond- thank you!,"My daughter and I booked 2 nights at the Crawford as part of a Spring break college tour trip. En route from Colorado Springs to Denver a major storm hit and all freeways shut down. After being detoured we called to indicate we may not make our first night. Not only did the nice gal at reception reassure us there was no problem waiting to see if our route opened or cancelling the one night, she conducted several google searches to try and get us storm/freeway information. When we arrived the next morning, the hotel accommodated an early check in and went out of their way to make sure our stay exceeded our expectations. All staff are extremely friendly and courteous. The hotel itself is ideally located in Union Station with easy access to cool restaurants and shops. The valets are great- even helped us with refilling windshield wiper fluid. We loved the room decor with high ceilings and stylish decor. Great bathroom/shower. Lots of attention to detail. Have stayed at many, many great hotels, but this one was beyond our expectations and is really top notch. Will be our go-to in Denver from here on out!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"A ""WOW"" property!","As a business traveler who frequents multiple hotels per week, I rank the Crawford as the best of the best. Every detail has been attended to, making for an experience that exceeds expectations and allows for a comfortable and restful stay. The hotel is completely unique - everywhere you look is pretty. From the lobby furnished with restoration hardware-style furniture surrounded with Colorado-local food and beverage, to the gorgeous cooper lounge, to the amazingly serene and expansive room. My room had beautiful clawfoot bathtub and high quality bath products so I was able to have a spa-like experience after a long work day. I also appreciate the high-tech nature of the hotel. iPads in the room to order room service (among other things) and RFID room keys that don't demagnetize if next to your phone. I could move into one of these rooms immediately. I sleep incredibly well and never want to check out. To me, I consider that a real success. Well done, Crawford.  I can't wait to come back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Hotel and Staff Top of the Line,"For a staycation or a longer visit, The Crawford Hotel is the best place to stay in Denver. It's a gem hidden inside Denver's Union Station. The staff; including Lance, Dominic, and Laura, were friendly and informative. The room was spacious and the décor matched the Union Station; steampunk Restoration Hardware-style furnishings. Our stay included little perks including drinks, coffee, ice cream, and transportation in the hotel's Tessla. The location is close to all the downtown activities. My husband and I will stay again this summer when we can walk to Coors Field to catch a game.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beautiful!!!,"Very nice hotel, comfortable room, great service! Very nice restaurants, my favorite was oysters bar, Stoic and genuine!!!! BEEEEEESSSSTTTT oyster menu ever, great service, impeccable!  The location of the hotel is very good.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A Unique Experience,"The unique concept behind an old train station being converted into a hotel was like none I'd ever stayed in before. The room quality was excellent, and I opted for the loft-style room for the same price as a standard guest room. There were several interesting bars and restaurants in the same plaza, connected by a hallway, so you didn't even have to go outside. The lobby of the train station was a large, inviting space in which guests of the various bars could hang out and play shuffleboard on the table in the middle of the lobby. The place was alive with energy, and really exciting. Would definitely recommend it to anybody!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Almost . . .,We stayed at The Crawford because of the historic location and to support the rejuvenation of lower downtown Denver.  It's advertised as being a luxury hotel so we had high expectations.  The hotel is barely 3 years old but is already showing signs of wear and tear.  The flooring in the entry way of our room was loose and had gaps.  The carpet was coming up at the edge of the entry to the room.  The furniture is looking beaten up.  And the room decor was strange - very mismatched.The most disappointing thing was that we had booked well in advance and let them know there would be 3 of us but the room was only set up for 2 people.   And the bathroom wasn't clean.  So we couldn't give it a five although it was handy for boarding the train the next morning.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazing Staycation!,"My husband and I decided to play tourist in our town this weekend with an overnight at the Crawford Hotel- we can't believe we waited this long to check it out, and we can't wait to go back! Our 4th floor suite was large and well appointed-very comfortable. We appreciated the in-room Nespresso machine and free bottles of water, along with the other amenities offered for hotel guests at other merchants on the 1st floor (free beer, ice cream & coffee?!).  The soaking tub, rain shower, and top-notch toiletries made us feel like we were in a resort, not a downtown hotel.  We were a little worried at first that we would be able to hear the din of all that was going on downstairs, but we barely could barely hear anyone walking down the hall. The front desk staff were so accommodating and lovely, answering our questions and making reservations for us (thanks again, Alison & Tara!). The front desk manager, Marie, made sure we were all taken care of from check in to brunch at Snooze the next afternoon. In all, I would recommend The Crawford to anyone, whether you live 1 or 10,000 miles away- it's the best of both worlds, being in the heart of it all while still feeling very private and intimate.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Spring Break in Denver,"We stayed at The Crawford in Denver on March 17th and 18th. Everything was EXCELLENT. When we arrived at the desk we were meet with three smiling faces, they were helpful, friendly and informative. The room was awesome. We have a premium classic room. First thing, it was quiet. We didn't hear any other guests or street noise. The 14 foot ceiling made the room seem massive. I loved the shower, super tall shower heads with excellent water pressure. My wife took two evening tub baths and was so relaxed that she nodded off each time. Very comfortable bed. Being apart of the Union Train Station made it that much more fun. There many bars and restaurants in the train station as well as several shops. Fun place to people watch or  to grab a bite or cocktail. We have been to several five star hotels, this topped them all. I highly recommend and will stay there again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Top-notch rooms and service,"This hotel provides a unique experience with beautiful rooms, great facilities, and fantastic service. The hotel is in a fantastic location, offering an easy walk to downtown Denver's main attractions, restaurants, bars, etc. With that said, being located in Union Station, you don't even need to leave the building for a great bar, ice cream, food, or entertainment. You even get a free pint of beer, scoop of ice cream, and coffee for each night you stay. The Union Station restoration is stunning (props to Elizabeth for some really cool decorations as well)!My room was fantastic. I stayed in 405, which was a loft-style room. It was twice as large as most hotels rooms I am used to. It had authentic vintage decorations but had all of the comfort of a  modern, high-end motel. From nifty vintage features like hangers from old hotels and exposed brick and support beams, to modern features like an iPad with tons of movies, this room was a fun juxtaposition of old and new. Finally, the staff was great. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful, the valets were quick, and everyone I interacted with was great. Brennan gave me a ride in the hotel’s Tesla and took the time to show me all of its bells and whistles. He was a great guy who seemed to love making guests happy.I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and hope to come back in the future.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Marketing Meeting- perfection!,"Several marketers stayed at the hotel.  The accommodations are second to none, great vibe, wonderful conveniences and fabulous service.  We loved hitting the city with Brennan as our driver of the Tesla!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Customer Care Lacking here...,"I called with some questions about the rooms at this hotel. We wanted to make sure we had a nice tub and king size bed, and just some basic amenities I was wondering about before making a reservation. After reading some of the reviews here I was not sure what we'd need to pack for a 3 day stay. We live in the region but wanted to stay downtown for a conference and have a bit of a getaway AND not have to drive home late at night. You have to be kidding me. After being on hold for more than was appropriate, the person I spoke with was rude, and snide. I was not asking for a discount and had only asked a couple questions, but she cut me off and told me I might want to consider booking at a Holiday Inn or ""something like that."" I guess she was having a bad day. We took our business elsewhere.",1
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Mom & Daughter sleepover,"Exceptional property and location, reminded us of New York city but much friendlier! Booked a Loft room #437 which is located in an interior hallway closed off from the terminal.  Very quiet, unique space, didn't feel cramped.  Smaller closet space for hanging garments or coats.  Nice sized bathroom, shower only which is fine.  Nice bedding and towels.First time at the Crawford Hotel and really enjoyed the setting of Union Station, seating varied from sofas, club chairs, library tables, and picnic tables. Also two shuffle board tables, weights can be checked out from the Terminal Bar. The hotel imposed $15 fee entitles guests to several freebies and discounts within the property, didn't have a chance to use the complimentary car service in a Tesla!  Dinner at Stoic & Genuine did not disappoint along with breakfast at Snooze.Exceptional staff, wish we had a longer stay and will definitely return!",5

We got on wait list for cooper lounge and that spot is amazing!! The large scale Windows lighting fixtures and library feel keep your interest and offer a beautiful understated setting Although the station was busy and full of activity you feel a sense of privacy and calm We had a blast bouncing around to Stoic and genuine , mercantile (our favorite) and hotel offers little perks for free coffee ice scream and other extras We have stayed at every 4-5 star hotel in Denver and the Crawford hits the spot with location, variety and comfortWe can't wait to go back  and do it all over again!",5

"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The BEST Denver downtown experience-coming from a Coloradan,"I grew up in the metro area and have experienced many wonderful places that Colorado has to offer. Because I am a native of Colorado, Downtown Denver is very close to my heart. I have lived downtown, played downtown. and enjoy the arts and culture that Denver attracts. I chose to raise my family in Northern Colorado, yet we often gravitate back toward Denver.There are many great hotels to choose from when we travel. However, The Crawford hotel is by far our favorite place when we want to get away. Why?1) The Crawford Hotel is located on a historical site that is a fully functional train station, as Union station has always been..(Only WAY more innovative and beautiful)The coolest concept is that travelers with baggage, intermingle with locals, tourists, and all they care about is making their way to their next adventure, You can't help but be drawn into the mystery of where the train will taking them, and what they will see.2) The Hotel is AMAZING!! The staff, the restaurants, the amenities, are 5*** STAR***The décor is simplistic, modern, and beautiful. The beds feel like you are sleeping on a cloud. (I am very picky when it comes to beds)3) The Hotel offers a Tesla!! (YES A TESLA). Free of charge to take you, or pick you up anywhere downtown. Ask for Dominic, he knows downtown and is SO much fun!4) The restaurants are phenomenal!! I am a foodie...From Snooze in the AM, to The Kitchen Next door for dinner, you will not be disappointed. Not to mention that late night fare is provided by ACME Burgers, Milk Box Creamery, and the Merchantile.If you are looking for great adult atmosphere and a cocktail or two, stop by Stoic and Genuine. If you think the libations are incredible, try the New England Lobster roll. The Cooper Lounge, or the Terminal bar are cool spots to chill and order unique drinks, lite fare, or pub grub. Both have unique cocktails that will impress! 5) There are a few shops in Union Station, (Bloom, 5 Green Boxes, and Tattered Cover). Even though shopping is sparse, the shops available, are thoughtful, eclectic, and beautiful. You will be sure to find something for yourself, or a loved one.6)The Crawford Hotel is central to Denver. The Denver Convention Center and the Denver Coliseum are a 10 minute drive. North and South Denver are a 20-30 minute drive.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Luxury in Unexpected Places,"I cannot wait to return!  Out of the 100 nights a year that I used to travel on average for work, The Crawford Hotel at Denver’s Union Station is by far, my favorite hotel.  Coming in to visit friends for a weekend, I wanted to select a hotel that was unique to the city, surrounded with great architecture, restaurants with energy, and lobby with a cool atmosphere, while still having a luxury experience without a chain name.  The hotel is only 25 minutes away from Denver International Airport and easy to access via chartered car, taxi, Uber, Lyft, and soon to be connected to the RTD light rail.  The hotel is in the heart of Downtown, and within walking distance to most of Denver’s major attractions.  As soon as I pulled up to valet, the valet greeted us and welcomed us to The Crawford.  Within a few steps, you walk into the Great Hall Lobby that has been restored back to its historic charm.  You could quickly tell it was the destination to-be for locals and visitors alike with a great energy of people enjoying a beverage at The Terminal Bar, the coffee shop or dining in one of the many restaurants located right in Union Station. When I walked up to the front desk, I was quickly greeted by Tara and Alison, who walked me through a standard check-in process, quickly pointed out all the great things to do in Union Station and the surrounding areas, and sent me on my way to my Superior Loft Room. My Superior Loft Room was on the fourth (top) floor of the hotel, and upon entering the room, I was greeted by a huge ceiling with beautifully exposed brick and wood beams that gave the room a unique feel unlike any other.  A raised living room offered a spacious workspace with plenty of outlets, a pull-out leather couch, plenty of good lighting and room to spread out and relax.  Separated by a huge flat panel TV, and half wall, the bedroom featured the most comfortable king bed, amazing pillows and the most comfortable soft linen that isn’t even found in most Mandarin Oriental or Four Seasons.  The mini iPad on the nightstand was a great touch, equipped with a hotel app, ability to access the internet, make dining reservations, place wake-up calls, housekeeping requests, and more. The main surprise was the spacious bathroom with beautiful white marble flooring, his/her sinks with tons of counter space, a beautiful shower with both a rain shower and traditional shower head, C.O. Bigelow Amenities, a huge bathtub.  The lighting in the bathroom was exceptional, and the loft was decorated with unique art, and balanced the historic charm with everything you would find at a luxury modern hotel. Housekeeping at the hotel was flawless.  I could not find anything under the bed, behind the curtains, behind the armoire, underneath chairs, in the bathroom, etc.  You could tell the hotel is new, and very well maintained, not even visible ware and tear on the furniture. Natasha at the Front Desk recommended Mercantile for Dinner and Snooze for Brunch which are both located in the hotel.  Mercantile had plenty of amazing comfort food dishes, in a really cool and casual atmosphere.  Highly recommend the House-Made Spaghetti, and Pork Shank.  Snooze the next day was worth the wait, especially if you can sit on the Porch on a nice day.  Highly recommend the Breakfast Pot Pie, which was to die for.  Service at Snooze was really friendly and energetic. If you plan to stay around the area, The Crawford’s complimentary house car is a Tesla, and their driver Dominic was great.  It was fun to take the car to/from Larimer Square (Corridor 44) and 16th Street Mall (The Market).  The hotel staff throughout our stay consistently exceeded my expectations whether it was the housekeeper greeting you walking by, the security guard giving us directions, or the bellman that walked my bags back to the car upon check-out; it was an experience I never imagined and one I will never forget.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Experiance the Way It's Supposed To Be.  None Better!,"A beautiful historic hotel with class, charm and service second to none. My wife and I recently spent several days here on vacation.  Briefly about ourselves, we have been to almost all of our lower 48 states by car.  We have stayed in no star ""no tell motels"" to five star ""reach for the sky resorts"". The Crawford Hotel is by far ""THE PLACE TO STAY"".  The hotel is located within the ""Denver Union Station"" in LoDo (Lower Downtown).  The lobby is the beautifully renovated station with restaurants, bars and shops to occupy any free time you might have.  From our arrival to the departure, we experienced a polite and professional staff which there is no compare.  Dominic and Brennan are true gentlemen to the definition of the word.  It appears the staff has been selected for their practices in the true ""Art"" of customer service.  Our room was located on the fourth floor.  We were treated to beautiful accommodations with a spacious bathroom (impeccably clean I might add).  The décor is luxurious yet keeps with the one hundred plus year old structure it adorns.  All the modern amenities you want in the historic atmosphere.  In reference to comfort, our next mattress just might have to be the same used here.  If you enjoy the architecture or are a history buff, ask about the available station tour (we highly recommend it).  As for things to do, within the confines during your stay; The restaurants are fabulous. Don't miss ""Snooze"" for breakfast (room service or dine in), if you're looking for a Colorado Micro-Brew Taste Tour, just visit the ""Terminal Bar"" and save the extra travel time.  We found a perfect evening snack at the Ice Cream Parlor featuring ""Little Man Ice Cream"".  Visit ""Cooper Lounge"". We particularly liked the tall tables overlooking 17th Street.  Speaking of 17th street, once you wander out of the hotel, there is so much to do within walking distance it's just fantastic.  There is also a Tesla courtesy car to take you where you want to go within a couple miles.  Well enough said before we start sounding like a commercial.  In our future travels, when we visit Denver, we will be staying at ""The Crawford Hotel"".  True Luxury at it's Finest.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Trendy, yet historic ","This hotel is a real gem.  Located in LoDo (Lower Downtown), it has proximity to everything a business traveler needs. Union Station is RIGHT THERE. 16th Street tram, busses locally and to and from the airport, and soon even a direct railway to DIA! Convenient curbside lanes for valet, pickup and taxis. Restaurants and bars all around within walking distance, and easy access to the highway. Rooms are elegant and cozy, quiet, and I did enjoy the soaps provided in the bathrooms :) If I'm in Denver again, I'd definitely stay here first choice.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,A very cool and unique hotel experience,"Flew in for business and meeting was across the street.  Union Station is a feat of architecture and renovation.  Bar was packed with young vibrant folks after work having fun.  Checked in and arrived at my room - very unconventional but extremely rustic and cool.  Every person associated with the hotel was incredibly friendly and this as much as anything makes me want to  return.  Bed was fabulous, bathroom was top shelf.  I'll be back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Highly recommend The Crawford!,"Gorgeous hotel with plenty of character.  They preserved all of the best aspects from the history / age of the building and added modern, unique, upscale touches to make this a gem in Denver.  We also love the location and many excellent dining options in or near the hotel.  I definitely recommend this hotel to everyone traveling to Denver and I look forward to staying here for all of our future visits.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Nice, but not as special as we'd hoped","We had seen reviews of this hotel in the newly renovated Union Station and wanted to try it on our visit, where the main purpose was to catch the Amtrak CA Zephyr toward CA.  It was more expensive than places we usually stay, but picked it for the experience.  There were some very nice things about the hotel, but, overall, we were underwhelmed.On the plus side, this is a one-of-a-kind place.  The desk is right in Union Station.  When I called ahead, I was given very helpful directions of how to take the public bus from the airport to the hotel for just $4.50 per Senior.  Check-in staff was very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are furnished nicely with beautiful wood and glass accents.  Detracting from the experience, however, were several factors.  We booked a Pullman room because we had read you could see the trains and it replicated the experience of old-time rail travel.  The trains must back into the station because, while we could see the back end of the Amtrak when in the station, the train left in the opposite direction.  I guess we had imagined trains would be going by our window, which was not the case at all.  While nicely furnished, the Pullman room was quite small and the bed was against the wall - not ideal for Seniors.  In the evening, the fire alarm sounded.  There was no intercom to give directions and guests started leaving.  After a bit, the alarm stopped.  We were able to finally get a call through to the desk and were told it was a false alarm.  Better communication would have been appreciated. Although the room was equipped with a lot of plugs, many of them would not work, including the ones in the bathroom.  The light at the head of the bed had a short in it and kept going off.  Since it was quite late before we discovered these issues, we didn't ask to move.  The room was very quiet for most of the time, but there was loud banging very early in the morning that woke both of us.  The room must have been next to a supply closet.   When we checked out, we reported the issues to the clerk and were given a $15 reduction in the Amenities charge.  Later, the manager emailed that if we return, he would provide a complimentary room upgrade, but I don't expect to be in the area any time soon again.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Place is horrible! ,I only say that to keep the place to myself! Loved this place again! Great atmosphere and vibe... Surrounded by amazing food and drink.  Rooms are clean and stylish.  Comfortable feel but refined. Would definitely be back again.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique Hotel with Amazing History,"Stayed at this hotel with my husband for approximately 1 week. One of the best features is the fact that had we not made prior engagements throughout Denver, we could have stayed in the same building the entire time! So many amenities, shops, and restaurants to choose from. With all of the attractions you could possibly need within walking distance and a Courtesy Tesla to take you anywhere within two miles,  a vehicle is not a necessity.To top off what was a wonderful experience in terms of the building itself and the location, the staff was second to none. They seemed to enjoy working in the building as much as we enjoyed staying in it. Every individual that we came in contact with genuinely cared about our experience as guests and wanted to help in any way they could. Dominic was especially personable. He remembered us by name each time we saw him and made sure to follow-up with us about our plans from days or evenings before. Overall, our stay at The Crawford was exceptional. From the luxurious loft-style room to the five-star service they exceeded our expectations. We will recommend this hotel to everyone traveling to Denver and we will most definitely be staying here for all of our future visits.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Full of Life, History, and Luxury","I usually stay at the Four Seasons, but wanted to try the Crawford for my first time. It was stunning! The Cooper Lounge was amazing, great views of the station as well as 17th St. Sophisticated and charming! Highly recommend for those looking for curated, luxurious accommodations with style!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"One of the best hotels, but the valet are shady","I am an experienced traveler but don't typically stay at hotels in Denver since I live here. I knew about this hotel and really wanted to do a staycation since it was so unique and new (and they do Snooze room service for breakfast). Union Station itself was nicely done, there are cute shops, a bar, and many places to sit. I really enjoyed how the hotel provided a free cup of coffee, glass of co draft beer and scoop of ice cream with your stay. A nice touch. Although check in was noisy and took about 20 minutes, the staff was quite pleasant and helpful. My husband and I stayed in one of the LoDo Suites which was fantastic. We were originally booked for a different room, but were upgraded for free, which we appreciated very much. It's very spacious and well decorated. I really liked the character of the room which included the exposed beams and brick. The only downside was that there is only one window, that's a bit high up in the sitting room. There are sky lights in each of the bathrooms as well. If you aren't from Denver, the hotel is in a great location and is within walking distance of many restaurants, bars and activities. My favorite part was the Snooze breakfast, it is my favorite place to eat. We ordered in, and were delivered food to our rooms from a limited selection menu. If you haven't had Snooze before, I would highly suggest actually going to the restaurant to experience the full menu. Now, I should have known better but there wasn't clarification around parking. We were aware that there was a $40 overnight valet fee for parking, but we were not aware that this was already charged to our room on our departure (we got an emailed receipt). As we were leaving, one of the valets ripped me off and charged me for parking too, making me think he was giving me a deal. Karma will come back for you sir! I have been to different countries and always have my guard up, but I was not expecting this in my own city. Shame on you valet. Lesson learned.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,The weekend that didn't happen WILL happen,"This isn't a review of a weekend that we were supposed to spend at the Crawford Hotel. Instead of enjoying the amenities of this hotel this past Friday and Saturday nights, I spent most of the weekend in and out of emergency rooms and doctor's offices getting tests. What I'm basing my review on is the stellar customer service we received even when we were NOT able to use our reservation at the Crawford Hotel.First, before the trip even started we received email updates and an invitation to download the hotel's iPhone app. I write reviews of apps and accessories for a website I run, so I was somewhat skeptical of what it could offer. I was pleased to see that the app provided a wealth of information about not only the  amenities at the Crawford, but about restaurants and services found in the area. When I ended up in the ER early on Friday morning with chest pains, my wife and I were still hopeful that we'd be able to have our weekend downtown. But as the day wore on and I didn't feel any better, we realized that we'd have to cancel out. My wife called the hotel and told them what was going on. They graciously canceled the Friday night reservation with no penalty and offered to keep Saturday night open in case I was feeling better by then. Nice!Sadly, Saturday was full of more more tests and I wasn't sure how I'd do staying at a hotel while still feeling sick, so we had to cancel the Saturday night reservation as well. Once again, the Crawford expressed genuine concern about my situation, canceled the reservation with no penalty, and wished us well.Although we weren't able to stay at the Crawford Hotel, we're now planning on giving them our business sometime this summer when we're heading downtown for a Rockies game or two. Hotels earn respect and five-star ratings by treating customers like royalty, and the Crawford certainly earned my respect, my thanks, and my loyalty the way they treated me and my wife this past weekend. We look forward to staying at the Crawford soon!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Major Wow Factor,"In the totally refurbished Union Station, 1880 architecture meets modern thoughtful design from furnishings, art work, and bedding to the well appointed bathrooms.  No detail left to chance or unattended to. My spouse, who is a design snob and art curator says she wouldn't change a thing. Last night was our third stay at this Denver gem, each time in a different unique style room (stand alone claw foot tub in last night's mini suite was a delight).  Outside you are walking distance to the Contemporary Art Museum, Coors Field and the 16th Street Mall.  Dinner at Stoic and breakfast at Snooze, all under the doom of Union Station, what could be better?  Maybe the New Years Eve Bash, which was our last stay.  Can't wait for the RTD train from DIA to Union station to start operations in April of this year.  Crawford is a perfect stop to acclimate before heading to ski country or returning.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Unique,"A unique historic building hosts this hotel in an active Train station. The rooms are very nice, but our room on the south gallery was a little noisy. There are bars, shops, and great places to eat downstairs. We used the courtesy Tesla to whiz us to our restaurant in town for dinner which was a nice touch. If we stay in Denver again, it will be here.Check out the Mercantile Deli and cafe.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Solid hotel at Union station,"Stayed here two nights this week on a biz trip.  Room was fine. Small, but well finished and furnished with a great bathroom.   Laundry service was acceptable.  Nice to be in the ""buzz"" of Union Station and all the activity and restaurants.  Be warned that all of the various restaurants are not affiliated with the hotel in including the Cooper Lounge which appears to be.  Front desk check in was polite enough and housekeeping was on (a nitpick:  coffee service was restocked but no cups were restocked).  Bed was comfortable.  Overall a pleasant surprise.",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Well Done Renovation of Historic Rail Station,An interesting hotel in the historic Denver Union rail station.   Nice location if you like being the middle of things.   When we were there there was a party in the main room of the station which made for a lot of noise.   I think there would always be a lot going on though with the location of the hotel and the fact it is an operation Amtrak station.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Spectacular location and hotel,"This hotel is located within Union Station and is a wonderfully appointed hotel.  The Staff is super helpful, rooms are immaculate and artistic, and it's wonderfully quiet.  I thought being in a train station would add a lot of noise and sound... but the rooms are so quiet!  This hotel has the perfect location to Coors Field, the Pepsi Center and any sort of downtown Denver activity.   This hotel offers amenities not found in other downtown hotels that make it a spectacular choice.  The in-room IPAD is fantastic!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Awesome,"Best hotel in downtown Denver.  Have stayed a few times and always look forward to going back.  Very unique experience and one that I haven't experienced elsewhere.   Only downside is no pool.  Great place for business and couples trip. Also, great place to meet friends for dinner and drinks.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Love This Hotel,Love the Crawford and its sister hotel the Oxford but The Crawford is new and needs a little time to make it a perfect stay. Wonderful service - but misses in the small details that would make it a superb experience. Give it time and it's attention to detail and it will meet expectations.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"The most gracious, helpful and hospitable staff and beautifully appointed hotel. It's all here at The Crawford Hotel!","I would like to commend your most gracious and helpful staff.  Domenic, Brendan, Miles and Lance were super; both on the road in your courtesy Tesla, and in the hotel.  Lise at the front desk is among the most hospitable and helpful front desk hotel associates.  All staff were always available and worked to assure my stay was perfect.  The rooms are very well appointed, spacious and quiet. Thank you for a great stay in Denver!!!  I will be back as soon as possible.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Outta the park comfort and location!,"As an avowed fan of cozy boutique hotels - I was delighted to find that the Crawford fit the model and yet still fulfills it's role as a central figure in a ""big city"" neighborhood.  I was a little anxious that the entrance through ""Denver's living room"" might portend equally busy energy at the upper levels, but it did not.We stayed in a classic high-ceiling room looking up 17th Street.  Though the public space out front was busy and filled with bar-crawlers until very late, there was no sound of it at the 3rd floor. The furniture and fixtures were all clean, operable and comfortable.The hotel is located in the former office space above the Denver Union Station, which is now the central transit hub for the city.  It was built as anchor tenant to a mixed use historic preservation project, so it is just delightful to get to have a bedroom right in the bustling building - which is the host of amazing restaurants, bars, ice cream . . . and fun local shops.  A special treat:  enjoy a drink at The Cooper Lounge located on a balcony above the main terminal.  (Enter at stairs across from Amtrak office.) A bit pricey - but the view of the restored interior architecture and the historic (replicated?) globe lamps is amazing to see up close.And . . . you can walk, shuttle or catch a courtesy car to all points LoDo.  It is a great place to build a romantic adventure in the city!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Loved our stay at the Crawford,"We stayed for one night only in Denver on our way to a ski trip in Beaver Creek. So happy that we chose the Crawford and wish we'd had more time there. Charlie, the Grand Hall Ambassador, was especially welcoming and helpful upon check-in. The room was beautiful and comfy and I was particularly excited by the bathroom which was spacious and luxurious with a clawfoot tub. I immediately relaxed after a long flight from NYC by taking a bath with the bath salts that they provide. In the morning we enjoyed coffee from Pigtrain - a delicious cafe that's one of the establishments within the train station. They offer guests of the Crawford a complimentary coffee too! We ordered breakfast from Snooze because the menu looked too delicious to resist. It was delivered to our rooms in take-out containers. The one thing I would have appreciated to round out the experience was plates/real silverware. Eating out of the take-out containers took away some of the fun and indulgence of room service. But the food was excellent. I highly recommend the sweet potato pancakes! All in all - great stay and I hope I have the opportunity to come back.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Really Convenient Hotel for Amtrak Trips!,"Our room looked out on the tracks, but noise was never a problem. Rooms are elegant and clean. Internet was fast. Wake-up call was at time requested. Staff was friendly. We will definitely stay again.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Birthday Overnight Stay,"I surprised my husband with a stay at The Crawford Hotel for his birthday. After researching a ton of hotels in Denver (we live here so we're familiar with quite a few), The Crawford was easily the best choice. Between the convenient location, Tesla driving service, amazing amenities just below in Union Station and the beautiful rooms, it was a no-brainer. And if all those things aren't reason enough to stay, you should know that the customer service was impeccable. Friendly, helpful, and very accommodating. Charlie checked us in and I couldn't have asked for a better, first-time experience at The Crawford. We will definitely be back and we can't wait!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Place for a Staycation,"We wanted to celebrate Valentine's Day in down town Denver. We chose an incredible Date Night deal at the Crawford Hotel at Union Station!  What a great package and a wonderful hotel. From the time we arrived and were greeted by Charlie at the front desk, we felt as if we had been transported to another place, if not another time!  Union Station as a setting has an ambiance that evokes an age when travel was exciting and elegant. Cocktails at the Cooper Lounge only reinforced that with their specialty cocktails and excellent appetizers (all included as part of our Date Night package)!  The overlook of the station is stunning and adds to the sensation you are some place other than your home town. For dinner we made reservations at Stoic and Genuine. The oysters, crab and lobster did not disappoint!Our room at the Crawford was an upgrade from a Superior Suite (thanks to Charlie) and was perfectly comfortable and quiet. We travel a lot and know quality when we experience it. This Staycation was top quality from start to finish!  And, we didn't have leave Denver or Union Station to experience all of it!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Hotel On Earth,"I have been traveling both for business and pleasure for almost 50 years. I will say without any doubt that our stay at the Crawford Hotel was the best service, the friendliest staff, and the absolute greatest Hotel experience of our lives!!! I will return often and will go to the Crawford in lieu of any resort or cruise vacation that I've ever been on. I is absolutely the best of the best!!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"First time in Denver, Perfect Stay","My husband and I were in Denver for the first time and this was a perfect location, close to restaurants, shopping, entertainment. It is a functioning train station, which gives it a kinda cool atmosphere. There's a flower shop, and a couple of boutiques plus several delicious eating choices. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room we stayed in was a Lodo suite. It was a nice size. The only complaint I have about the room was there was only one window that I had to stand on a chair to look out of. But there were two skylights, one in each bathroom; there was one full and a half bath in the suite. There is room service. Lunch and dinner comes from The Kitchen Next Door, one of the restaurants in the hotel. The food was great but the menu limited. Breakfast comes from Snooze, another of the hotel's restaurants. The food there is DELICIOUS, however, a word of warning: this is a by popular breakfast place. It was crowded every day we were in town, and we were there during the week so I can only imagine a weekend morning. So the two times we ordered breakfast from room service we had issues. The first morning the food took almost an hour and a half to arrive, but, that was the morning of the Super Bowl champions' parade, so they were slammed. They sent us a tray of goodies on the house for the inconvenience. They next morning we didn't get our full order, but they were quick to correct it. The rooms have iPads for ordering food, house keeping, etc. That was cool, however, when we needed to tell someone our order was wrong or that we needed housekeeping to pick up room service trash, we weren't sure who to contact or how. Also, it would be nice to have the ability to watch a movie in your room, whether that's pay per view or even a DVD player, that would be a nice amenity. All in all, it was a great stay and we'd definitely stay here again!",4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Fun at the Crawford,"Selected the Date Night package at the Crawford Hotel in Union Station for his birthday. From the start the staff made us feel welcome and went out of their way to help. We arrived early...as in very early...because of the unplanned Bronco parade in support of their Super Bowl win. Charlie Chavez at the front desk searched and found us a room for right now check-in, plus it was an upgrade! Arrived back from husband's special lunch to discover a surprise treat in our room. All in all a terrific stay and we look forward to going back!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Pricey, but well worth it!","My husband and I have stayed here twice now.  The service is amazing and the rooms are the perfect balance of rustic and modern.  Both times we've stayed here, we had and event to go to and the hotel offers free car service in their really cool and sleek Tesla.  They also offered us a free scoop of ice cream each at Milkbox, a free cup of coffee and a free pint of craft beer.  Although this hotel is in a great location to go anywhere downtown, it is so packed with places to eat and drink, you never need to leave!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"A funky, comfortable and unusual place to stay in Denver!","This is one of the most fun places to stay! It is located in the old train station centrally located in Denver. Amtrak still runs out of here but this is not your usual train station. High ceilings and turn of the century frills mixed with a contemporary feel, the inside is a sight to behold. This large ""lobby"", with comfortable tables to work at, or chairs to enjoy coffee and visit with friends, is a place to hang out. Very open and cool, there is a coffee shop, bakery, and tavern along the perimeter. Signing into The Crawford happens in one of the alcoves. The rooms are on the second floor, beautifully rendered beside the old archways of the building. You can look down into the lobby as you get off the elevator. We stayed in a suite which was reasonable priced and larger than a bedroom. The living room was a nice size and the bedroom on a different level, three steps down. No windows here but still somehow airy enough. The bathrooms were very large with a big clawed foot bathtub and a large walk-in shower. And, they are very welcoming to dogs!This is definitely going to be our ""go-to""place when we are in Denver!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Best Flight Cancellation place to stay!,"5 stars for the Hotel Staff, Room And Food ! Do your self a favor and book a room if you want a good nights rest and being pampered! We left Estes Park due to getting snowed in and our flight being canceled, so we booked a room at the Crawford Hotel to be closer to the Denver airport. A little bit on the pricey side; but worth every penny:) Dale & Kim . P.S. - I celebrated my 50 th Birthday at the Mercantile Restaurant with a 5 course wine and food pairing. "" over the top """,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Excellent Stay,The staff at the Crawford provided a very warm and friendly welcome.  We took advantage of the complimentary Tesla service which was awesome.  The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable.  The lobby is a bit noisy however the rooms are very quiet.  We enjoyed cocktails and appetizers in the Cooper Lounge which had a very nice ambiance.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Date night out,"Located in the recently refurbished Union Station, this hotel has pretty much everything. This is a place for a one or two night splurge. Great restaurants, but make a reservation a few days in advance if you want to get in. Staff was helpful and pleasant. Location is great for other restaurants, shows, shopping etc.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Beyond the call of duty...,Weekend in Denver at Crawford.  Easy walking distance to downtown attractions.On departure we needed a shuttle to our car and their shuttle had not come on line at our time.  The front desk clerk gave the keys to her car to the valet to ran us over.Outstanding guest care.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Great Hotel with Great Offerings!,"The Crawford is a fun experience because it is so much more than a hotel. The building houses hotel, Amtrak station, multiple restaurants, shops and bars. The lobby is always bustling and lively - which I loved! There are large shuffleboard tables and TONS of seating in the lobby area, which really encourages interaction...even among strangers. Definitely a fun Denver experience!",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Amazingly Accommodating,"Stranded in Denver for Winter Storm Jonas and stumbled upon The Crawford Hotel.  Set in a beautifully restored train station. The staff hooked me up with a beautiful suite with a luxurious bed, gorgeous marble bathroom and a great clawfoot tub that is a treat to look at even if you never set foot in it (like me).  The Crawford is affiliated with The Oxford Hotel across the street.  I got a massage from veteran, Michael, who worked my twisted up muscles with the knowledge of a surgeon.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Classic Perfection in Union Station,"Let me just start with that; as a travel reviewer, I have visited many wonderful Denver hotels. Denver is unique in that it offers so many hotels: mega-chains, luxury resort style hotels and boutique places to stay abound.  While I have love for many a hotel in the Denver area, I have never loved a hotel the way I loved the Crawford.  First off, the location: the Crawford is literally located inside the redone Union Station, which in itself is stunningly gorgeous, a great place for a night out.  I was welcomed at the front desk, which gave me my first glance at their quirky art-deco feel.  My check in was flawless, with a front-desk concierge named Tasha going above and beyond to help me feel welcome. My room was on the second floor, overlooking Snooze and their farm to table restaurant.  Cozy beds, simple yet chic decor and C.O Bigelow bath products greeted me.  I waited for my party to arrive and took in my view of the lightrail outside my window.  Dinner was  down the street at Cholon, which I highly recommend, being only two blocks down.  On our way back, we stopped at Tattered Cover across the street (through there is one inside the Crawford as well) and ended up at the Cooper, the Crawford's exclusive bar for guests of the hotel.  It's amazing!  It overlooks the entire Union Station, and is decorated in retro luxury decor - the walls are climbing with carved awnings and grand light fixtures.  The drinks were delicious, and the atmosphere at 11pm on a Saturday was hopping. It was nice to be above the crowd looking down, yet still a part of that energy.  Your stay comes with a free scoop of ice cream at Milkbox and we for sure took advantage of that.  We turned in around midnight and slept great in the downy beds. In the morning, the best perk of the hotel waited for us: the famous Snooze eatery downtown - which usually comes with a three hour wait - can be delivered to your room.  Let me say that again - SNOOZE. IN YOUR BED.  This is perhaps the greatest hotel offer in Denver. Between it's killer location, luxury accommodations, sleek design and feel and eating a Spuds Deluxe in your pajamas, I have to say, with great consideration, that the Crawford is my favorite Denver hotel.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,"Great place! Very nice, pricey. ",So I booked this place for our anniversary and they didn't have the wine ready like I had asked. They got my packages in the room and flowers setup as requested though. Top notch but wouldn't spend more than a night here because of the price tag.,4
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Destination Hotel in LoDo- Must Visit,"The Crawford is a special spot for my wife and I, as it is in the heart of our favorite town and our go-to staycation spot.  Situated in the beautiful Union Station, the hotel mixes right into the terminal and restaurants.  This is a unique setup, and adds charm to the hotel.  The rooms are pretty and swanky, the bathrooms are very well-appointed and feel somewhat European.  Room service (at least for breakfast) is very good, because it is provided by the local well-known breakfast joint, Snooze, which is in Union Station.  Great lower bar (Terminal) and the speak-easy upstairs is nice.  Great seafood spot (for Denver), Stoic and Genuine, also in the hotel.  You are literally at the base of LoDo, and are near all of the best things Denver has to offer.  Coors Field, Tattered Cover, cross the walking bridge to go to Highland, and the many great restaurants and bars in LoDo, like Cruise Room (a visitor highlight).  Very fun getaway spot.  Highly recommended.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Broncos weekend,This was my second time staying at the hotel and it was better than the first time! While the room was amazing the overall experience of Denver Union Station made the stay exceptional. The staff was very friendly and responsive.,5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Renovated Train station that is also a hotel!!,"Hussling and Bustling entry experience and then I remembered, Im in a actual train depot.Lots of energy, with a multitude of restaurants and bars to choose from and a vibrant lobby.The check in desk is a little hard to find due to so much going on. The Terminal bar is a happening place all hours of the day.We ate at Stoic and Genuine, great for seafood and oysters.Snooze it the spot for breakfast although a few feet down the hall you'll find Metropolitan. Another great breakfast place without the wait.The Cooper lounge takes you up one floor above the train lobby with its noise to a more relaxed spot to grab a drink.Cool building w a super location for everything Denver has to offer.Oh, btw, the rooms are average size, high ceilings and contemporary interiors and lighting AND very comfortable. Nice check in staff. Go and you'll be pleased you did.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,Stunning and Quaint,"I loved the atmosphere of the Crawford nestled in the bustling terminal of Union Station.  Check-in was a breeze and the representatives were very friendly and professional.  I checked in at the same time as two others in the firm and we all got assigned 3 different types of rooms, so just note that the rooms are not uniform.  My loft room was spacious with vaulted ceilings and a huge bathroom--my colleagues were placed in lofts that had stairs in their rooms and tinier bathrooms.  Still, the room felt sumptuous and opulent and the only detractor was that sometimes, you just didn't want to have to weave through crowds of people milling around in the station.  That said, it was a very, very minor issue, and was probably exacerbated by it being the holiday season.  Oh, and the security checks insured that no one could get into the hotel part without a room key, which was really attractive. The views overlooking the station from the interior balconies were also spectacular.",5
"Denver, CO",The Crawford Hotel,LOVE LOVE LOVE The Crawford Hotel!,"Starting with booking this hotel, everything was amazing.  The agent we spoke to noted that we would be celebrating our 13th wedding anniversary a bit early while we were there.  The valet was very convenient right in front of the hotel.   We walked right in to the amazing Union Station and were able to check in right away.  Charlie at the front desk was so nice and helpful.  The Crawford has amazing offers with some of the restaurants right in Union Station.  For example, each guest in the room is offered complementary craft beer each night at The Terminal Bar, free coffee and a scoop of ice cream at PigTrain and awesome discounts at a few of the cute boutique shops right there in Union Station as well.  Our room was one of the ""Classics"" and we were on the 3rd floor.  Or view was the Amtrac station across the street.  We never had a problem with noise.  In fact, our floor was so quiet, we never even saw another person on our floor the whole time we were there.  Housekeeping was great and our room was impeccably cleaned each day.   They even offer two complimentary bottles of Voss water in the fridge daily.  In the room was a Nespresso coffee maker.  This was our first time using one and it was awesome!!!! The Crawford tablet next to the bed was great.  Each day it personally welcomed us by name and provided the weather.  We ordered breakfast up to the room from Snooze (a restaurant downstairs) from the tablet and it was soooooo yummy.  They even delivered it in a pretty cool reusable ""Snooze"" bag.  We used the valet service a few times a day as we went back and forth from the hotel and they were great. At one point, I needed a coat I had in the car to be brought back to the room.  Instead of me going all the way back up, the valet had it brought up for me and it was waiting in the room when we arrived back!  Every staff member we encountered at The Crawford Hotel really went above and beyond their call of duty to make our stay especially wonderful.  And lastly, you really can't beat this location.  Walking distance to pretty much anywhere you would want to go in ""LoDo"" and a short drive to Denver Int'l.",5
